                <p>The eyeball is well-protected by the bony orbit, the nose, the lids, eyebrows, eyelashes and a good cushion of fat behind the eyeball. The incidence of injury to the eye is high specially in the industrial towns. The common causes of injury in the children include playing with bow and arrow, throwing stones, ball, sharp pointed objects like pen, pencil, stick, etc. Chemical injuries are common in the laboratory and industry. Protective goggles are available for industrial workers.</p>

                <p>An eye injury is an emergency and requires immediate medical or surgical treatment.</p>

                <h2>EXTRAOCULAR FOREIGN BODY</h2>
                
                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It is usually a small particle of coal, dust, emery (hard stone), steel and glass. At times wings of insect and husk of seeds may also involve the limbus.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is sudden discomfort in the eye.</li>
                    <li>Reflex blinking due to foreign body sensation is very troublesome.</li>
                    <li>There is great irritation and gritty feeling if the foreign body is embedded in the cornea.</li>
                    <li>Lacrimation and photophobia are present in cases of corneal involvement.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is marked reflex blepharospasm.</li>
                    <li>Foreign body is visible on the bulbar conjunctiva, limbus, cornea, sulcus subtarsalis and fornix by the naked eye, oblique illumination with a loupe or slit-lamp examination.</li>
                    <li>It may be single or multiple, superficial or deep.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Conjunctivitis may occur due to secondary bacterial infection.</li>
                    <li>Corneal ulcer may be present as a result of corneal erosion due to foreign body.</li>
                    <li>Brown ring or stain is left on the cornea by an embedded steel particle or emery.</li>
                    <li>Foreign body like sharp steel may penetrate into the anterior chamber.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Do not rub the eyes</strong>—It is very important as the foreign body may penetrate in the deeper tissues.</li>
                    <li>Wash the eye with plenty of clean water.</li>
                    <li>If in the conjunctiva, it is picked up by a needle after application of local anaesthetic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign body spud</strong>—If in the cornea, it is gently scraped off with the foreign body spud with its blunt end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharp needle (sterilized)</strong>—If the foreign body has penetrated in the superficial layers of cornea, it is gently lifted by the sideways motion or by liver action of a sharp needle.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>CHEMICAL INJURIES AND BURNS</h2>
                
                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The burn injury can be caused by hot water, steam, hot ashes, explosive powder, molten metals, etc. The chemical injury may be due to lime, acid, and alkali.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Alkali burns</strong>—The common alkalies responsible for causing injury are lime, caustic potash or caustic soda and liquid ammonia. These can cause considerable damage to the eye because they tend to penetrate deeper. They cause necrosis of the surface epithelium in a few seconds with occlusion of the limbal vasculature. This leads to a diminished vascularity of the anterior segment, corneal opacification and melting, cataract and symblepharon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acid burns</strong>—The common acids responsible are sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. These are less serious than alkalis burns because they coagulate the surface proteins and do not penetrate the eye.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Poison gases</strong>—Lacrimatory gases, phosgene, mustard, gas, arsenicals and other agents are used in war.</li>
                    <li>In holi festival (festival of colours), there is great danger of chemical injury to the eyes due to the presence of 'mica' in various coloured powders.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is red eye with marked swelling of lids and conjunctiva.</li>
                    <li>Marked reflex blepharospasm is present usually.</li>
                    <li>Photophobia and lacrimation are present when there is corneal involvement.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is severe congestion and chemosis of conjunctiva.</li>
                    <li>Marks of burn over surrounding skin are noticed.</li>
                    <li>Cornea is dull and opaque or may get sloughed off.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluorescein staining</strong>—It is positive and it demarcates the denuded epithelium.</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <h3>Grading of Chemical Injuries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grade I</strong>—Clear cornea and no limbal ischaemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade II</strong>—Hazy cornea but with visible iris details and less than one-third (120°) of limbal ischaemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade III</strong>—Total loss of corneal epithelium, stromal haze obscuring iris details and between one-third and half (120° to 180°) of limbal ischaemia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grade IV</strong>—Opaque cornea and more than half (> 180°) of limbal ischaemia</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Complication</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Symblepharon</strong>, i.e. adhesion of the lid to the globe due to conjunctival ulceration is a common complication. A glass rod well-coated with a lubricant or ointment is swept around the upper and lower fornix several times a day to break and prevent the formation of adhesions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corneal ulcer</strong> is usually present which may easily perforate.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Immediately wash the eye thoroughly with plenty of clean water. Acid should be neutralized with dilute alkalies, e.g. soda bicarbonate solution. Alkalies can be neutralized with weak acids, e.g. boric acid or milk. Lime particles are picked up with a forceps and 1% EDTA (ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) is applied as a neutralizing agent.</li>
                    <li>If there is corneal erosion, treat it like a corneal ulcer.</li>
                    <li>If cornea is not involved, steroid drops and ointments should be used to prevent symblepharon formation and to reduce congestion and chemosis of the conjunctiva.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctivitis caused by lacrimatory gases is treated by irrigation with bland lotion, normal saline, 3% soda bicarbonate or clean water. Dark glasses are comforting.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>BLUNT INJURY [CONTUSIONS]</h2>
                
                <p>Trauma by a blunt object like fist, ball, etc. can cause an injury from simple abrasion to the rupture of the globe.</p>

                <p>The ocular trauma classification group has proposed a new classification system for mechanical injuries to the eye.</p>

                <h3>1. Cornea</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Simple or recurrent abrasions of the cornea.</li>
                    <li>Deep corneal opacity is due to the oedema of corneal stroma and folds in the Descemet's membrane.</li>
                    <li>Blood staining of the cornea is due to associated haemorrhage into the anterior chamber with raised tension.</li>
                    <li>Partial or complete tear of the cornea.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Sclera</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Rupture of the globe may occur with prolapse of uveal tissue.</li>
                    <li>This may lead to subconjunctival dislocation, expulsion or dislocation of lens in vitreous cavity.</li>
                    <li>Intraocular haemorrhage.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Iris and Ciliary Body</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Traumatic miosis</strong>—There is constriction of the pupil following trauma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traumatic mydriasis</strong>—There may be dilatation of pupil after trauma.</li>
                    <li>Radiating lacerations of iris may occur occasionally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iridodialysis</strong>—Iris is torn away from its ciliary attachment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antiflexion of iris</strong>—In extensive iridodialysis, the pigmented portion of iris faces forwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retroflexion of iris</strong>—The whole iris is doubled back into the ciliary region (total inversion). Iris is invisible in this condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aniridia or irideremia</strong>—The iris is completely torn away from the ciliary attachment. It contracts and forms a minute ball which sinks to the bottom of the anterior chamber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cyclodialysis</strong>—Ciliary body is ruptured near its anterior attachment and it may retract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyphaema</strong>, i.e. blood in the anterior chamber may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>4. Lens</h3>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Vossius's ring</strong>—Circular ring of stippled brown amorphous granules is seen on the anterior surface of the lens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traumatic cataract or concussion cataract</strong>—Typical rosette-shaped cataract may form early or late, i.e. after 1-2 years in the posterior cortex usually. An accumulation of fluid marks out the star-shaped cortical sutures and lens fibres.</li>
                    <li>There may be dislocation of the lens in the vitreous or anterior chamber.</li>
                    <li>Subluxation of the lens may occur due to the partial rupture of zonule.</li>
                    <li>There may be tear of the lens capsule with absorption of the lens matter.</li>
                    <li>Total lens opacification may occur.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>PENETRATING AND PERFORATING INJURY</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Penetrating injury</strong>—There is single full-thickness break or wound of the eyeball caused by a sharp object such as knife, needle, iron particle, small stone, glass, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Perforating injury</strong>—There is dual or double full-thickness break or wound (entrance and exit wounds) in the eyeball caused by sharp objects.</p>

                <p>A perforating injury is likely to cause severe and serious damage to the eye due to the immediate trauma and the infection. It is an ocular emergency.</p>
                <p><strong>Laceration</strong>—There is outside - in injury of eyeball.</p>
                <p><strong>Rupture</strong>—There is inside - out injury of eyeball.</p>

                <h3>Signs of Perforation of the Eyeball</h3>
                <p>Any one or combination of the following suggest global perforation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Decreased visual acuity</li>
                    <li>Marked hypotony or low IOP</li>
                    <li>Shallow anterior chamber or hyphaema</li>
                    <li>Alteration in pupil size, shape and location</li>
                    <li>Marked conjunctival oedema (chemosis)</li>
                    <li>Subconjunctival haemorrhage</li>
                    <li>Hole in the iris as confirmed by transillumination</li>
                    <li>Wound track in the corneal, lens or vitreous</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Aim of Treatment</h3>
                <p>The main aim of the treatment is:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>To save the vision</li>
                    <li>To prevent the occurrence of the sympathetic ophthalmitis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Principles of Treatment</h3>
                <p>It should be treated immediately by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Proper suturing and apposition of the ocular tissues is done promptly. It is very important to free the uveal tissue from the corneal or corneoscleral wound.</li>
                    <li>Control and prevention of infection by suitable broad-spectrum antibiotics.</li>
                    <li>Close follow-up with topical antibiotics, atropine and corticosteroids is essential.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>PERFORATING INJURY WITH RETAINED FOREIGN BODY</h2>
                
                <p>The foreign bodies which are likely to penetrate the eye and are retained include minute chips of iron and steel (90%), stone, glass, lead pellet, wood spicules, etc.</p>

                <p>The retained foreign body causes damage to the eye depending on its size and velocity. The particles greater than 2 mm in size usually destroy eye and sight.</p>

                <h3>Effects of Retained Foreign Body</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical effect</strong>—The foreign body pierces cornea or sclera and falls to the bottom of the anterior chamber or is situated in the angle of anterior chamber. It may get lodged on the iris or pass into or through the lens into the vitreous. It may finally settle down in the retina. Occasionally, it may pierce the coats of the eye and stay in the orbital tissue which is known as the "double perforation". This results in hypotony.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infection</strong>—It is introduced along with the foreign body. The small flying metallic particles are usually sterile due to the heat generated partly on their emission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific chemical action of the metals</strong>—It varies with the chemical nature of the metal.
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Inert metals—Glass, plastic, porcelain, gold, silver, platinum, tantalum, etc.</li>
                            <li>Little reaction with encapsulation—Lead present in shot gun pellets becomes coated with carbonate.</li>
                            <li>Local suppuration—Aluminium, nickel, mercury, zinc, etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Degenerative changes</strong>—Iron and copper undergo electrolytic dissociation and get deposited throughout the eye. They cause degenerative changes known as siderosis bulbi and chalcosis respectively.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. Siderosis Bulbi</h3>
                <p>It is due to the electrolytic dissociation of the iron metal by the 'current of rest' in the eye. Ferrous ion combines with cellular protein causing atrophy of the cells.</p>
                <p><strong>Ferrous ion + cellular protein → atrophy of the cells.</strong></p>

                <p>Iron gets deposited in,</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Lens</strong>—The anterior lens capsule wherein oval patches of rusty deposits are arranged radially in a ring. It corresponds with the edge of the dilated pupil. The lens becomes opaque eventually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iris</strong>—It is stained greenish and later reddish-brown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retina</strong>—Retinal degeneration occurs with the generalised deposition of pigment.</li>
                    <li>Secondary glaucoma of chronic type occurs in late stage.</li>
                    <li>Blindness occurs unless the foreign body is removed early.</li>
