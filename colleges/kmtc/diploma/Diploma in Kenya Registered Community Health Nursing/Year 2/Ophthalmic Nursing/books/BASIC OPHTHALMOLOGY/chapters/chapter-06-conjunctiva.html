                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>Conjunctiva is a thin, translucent, vascular mucous membrane which covers the under surface of the lids and is reflected over the anterior part of the eyeball upto the limbus. It is exposed to dust, wind, heat and radiation and therefore prone to get infected.</p>

                <h3>Parts</h3>
                <p>It consists of following parts namely,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Palpebral</strong>—It covers the under surface of both upper and lower lids. The palpebral conjunctiva is adherent to the tarsus and cannot be easily dissected. It is very thin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bulbar</strong>-It covers the anterior part of the eyeball. It is loosely attached to the underlying tissue but it is firmly adherent to the Tenon's capsule 3 mm around the limbus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fornices</strong>-These are folds of the conjunctiva formed by the reflection of the mucous membrane from the lids to the eyeball. It is a loose but thick membrane.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plica semilunaris</strong>-It is a crescentic fold of the conjunctiva situated at the inner canthus.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>It consists of two layers,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The epithelium</strong>-There are 2-5 layers of epithelial cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>The stroma</strong>-It consists of blood vessels, connective tissue, glands such as glands of Krause, glands of Wolfring and goblet cells.</li>
                </ol>

                    <figcaption>Structure of conjunctiva</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Blood Supply</h3>
                <p>The anterior and posterior conjunctival arteries and veins.</p>

                <h3>Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
                <p>The preauricular and submandibular lymph nodes.</p>

                <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
                <p>It is supplied by two different sets of nerves:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sensory nerves</strong>-These are branches of ophthalmic and maxillary division of the 5th cranial nerve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sympathetic nerves</strong>-These are derived from the sympathetic plexus.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Bacteriology</h3>
                <p>Most of the organisms normally present are non-pathogenic but some are morphologically identical with pathogenic types.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Non-pathogenic bacteria</strong>-Diplococcus, Corynebacterium xerosis, Staphylococcus albus, etc.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pathogenic bacteria</strong>—Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Ps. Pyocyanea, E. coli, B. proteus, etc. are pathogenic but rare.</p>

                <p>The bacterial growth is inhibited by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mechanical washing away action of tears.</li>
                    <li>The tear contains lysozyme, IgA, IgG which are bacteriostatic.</li>
                    <li>Low temperature due to evaporation of tear, exposure and moderate blood supply.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>I. INFLAMMATION (CONJUNCTIVITIS)</h2>
                
                <h3>I. EVALUATION</h3>
                <p>Evaluation of conjunctival inflammation is done by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The type of discharge.</li>
                    <li>The characteristics of conjunctival reactions.</li>
                    <li>The presence of lymphadenopathy.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>1. Discharge</h4>
                <p>It consists of serous exudate, epithelial debris, mucus and tears.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Watery</strong>-It is present in acute allergic and viral conjunctivitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mucin</strong>-It is seen in spring catarrh and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mucopurulent</strong>-It is present in mild bacterial infection and chlamydial infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purulent</strong>-It is seen in severe acute bacterial infection.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Conjunctival Reactions</h4>
                <p><strong>Hyperaemia</strong> - It is seen maximum in the fornices and minimum at the limbus. It is due to congestion of the conjunctival vessels.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Oedema and chemosis</strong>-It is due to swelling of the conjunctiva as a result of exudation from capillaries. It is seen maximum in the fornices and the bulbar conjunctiva as they are lax.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Follicle</strong>-There is lymphoid hyperplasia with a germinal centre. They are usually multiple, discrete, slightly elevated, round, measuring 0.5-5 mm in size.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Papilla</strong>-It is a vascular structure invaded by the inflammatory cells.</p>

                <h4>Membrane</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>True membrane</strong>-It is a coagulum involving the entire epithelium. Its removal causes tearing of epithelium and bleeding, e.g. diphtherial, β-haemolytic streptococcal conjunctivitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pseudomembrane</strong>-It is a coagulum on the surface of the epithelium. It can be easily peeled off leaving the epithelium intact, e.g. pneumococcal, streptococcal, gonococcal, adenovirus and autoimmune conjunctivitis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>II. DIAGNOSIS</h3>
                <p>The diagnosis of conjunctivitis is confirmed by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bacteriological examination for the presence of bacteria and inclusion bodies.</li>
                    <li>Histological examination of the secretion and scrapings of the epithelium taken by a platinum loop and stained with Giemsa stain and Gram stain.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctival culture-It is taken from lid margin and conjunctival sac with sterile cotton tipped applicators.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>III. TREATMENT OF CONJUNCTIVITIS</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotic drops</strong>—Antibiotic drops commonly used to treat conjunctivitis include the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Norfloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic with broad spectrum activity and low toxicity.</li>
                            <li>Ciprofloxacin-It has similar properties as norfloxacin.</li>
                            <li>Other antibiotics include chloramphenicol, gentamicin, framycin, tobramycin, neomycin, polymyxin, etc. They are instilled 4-6 times daily.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotic ointments</strong>-Ointments provide higher concentration of antibiotic for longer period than drops. As they cause blurred vision during the day, ointments are used at night or during sleep.
                        <p>Antibiotics available in ointment form are: Chloromycetin, gentamicin, tetracycline, framycetin, neomycin, polymyxin and ciprofloxacin.</p>

                <h3>1. Acute Mucopurulent Conjunctivitis</h3>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>It is caused by several organisms such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Haemophilus aegyptius, adenovirus, etc. It is often associated with measles and scarlet fever.</p>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It occurs in epidemics and is bilateral usually.</li>
                    <li>It is contagious and spreads by flies, fingers and fomites.</li>
                    <li>It is often self-limiting.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>There is redness and grittiness, i.e. feeling of foreign body sensation.</li>
                    <li>Mucopurulent discharge and crusting is present in the fornices and margins of lids.</li>
                    <li>There is sticking together of lids specially in the morning because of accumulation of mucous discharge during the night.</li>
                    <li>Coloured halos due to flakes of mucus passing across the cornea may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Conjunctival congestion is always present. The conjunctiva is fiery red (pink eye or red eye).</li>
                    <li>Chemosis and subconjunctival haemorrhage may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Complications</h4>
                <p>These are rare but superficial keratitis, marginal corneal ulcer, chronic conjunctivitis may occur.</p>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Cleanliness</strong>-Frequent washing of the eyes with warm saline or clean water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control of infection</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequent instillation of appropriate bacteriostatic antibiotic eye drops and application of eye ointment at bedtime after doing culture and sensitivity. Conjunctival swab is taken prior to starting treatment. Application of ointment prevents the lids from sticking together.</li>
                            <li>The eyes should not be bandaged as this prevents the free exit of secretion and encourage bacterial growth due to warmth and stasis.</li>
                            <li>In case of photophobia, dark glasses or an eye shade may be worn.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Prophylaxis</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Isolation of the patient should be done when possible.</li>
                    <li>Avoid using the patients towel or other fomites.</li>
                    <li>Avoid contact with the infected eye as it is highly contagious.</li>
                    <li>Patient must keep his hands clean by washing them often.</li>

                <h3>OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM</h3>
                
                <p>It is a preventable disease occurring in newborn babies.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>Virulent gonococcus infection used to be responsible for 50% blindness in children but due to effective methods of prophylaxis and treatment, it is rare nowadays. Chlamydia oculogenitalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae or other organism cause mild infection.</p>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is bilateral usually.</li>
                    <li>It commonly occurs in the newborns due to maternal infection.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Any discharge from a baby's eye during the 1st week of life is alarming as tears are secreted only 3-4 weeks after birth.</li>
                    <li>The conjunctiva is bright red and swollen with pouring out of thick yellow pus.</li>
                    <li>Thick pus accumulates at the lid borders, lashes and canthi.</li>
                    <li>Sticking together of the lids is a common feature.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lids are swollen and tense due to dense infiltration of the bulbar conjunctiva.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctiva is markedly congested and chemosed. Lids are separated by lid retractors to see the cornea. Pseudomembrane may be present.</li>
                    <li>Later the conjunctiva becomes puckered and velvety with free discharge of pus, serum and blood.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Complications</h4>
                <p>These are common in untreated cases.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Corneal ulcer and opacity.</li>
                    <li>Perforated corneal ulcer with prolapse of iris.</li>
                    <li>Adherent leucoma and panophthalmitis.</li>
                    <li>Metastatic stomatitis and arthritis involving knee, wrist and ankle joints occur rarely.</li>
                    <li>In case of corneal opacity, there may be nystagmus as macular fixation occurs during the first 3-4 weeks of life.</li>

                <p>The conjunctival surface is covered by a fibrinous membrane.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the most common pathogen. Other organisms such as gonococcus, pneumococcus, Streptococcus can also produce a membrane specially in sick, malnourished children.</p>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <p>It is commonly seen in children who are not immunized previously. It often occurs in weak children after measles, scarlet fever or in cases of impetigo.</p>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>In mild cases there is swelling of the lids along with serous or mucopurulent discharge.</p>

                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                <p>It is confirmed by bacteriological examination and culture of the conjunctival swab.</p>

                <h4>Differential Diagnosis</h4>
                <p><strong>Pseudomembrane</strong>-Pseudomembrane is caused by gonococcus, Staphylococcus, pneumococcus, Streptococcus, H. aegyptius, E. coli in weak children who are not immunized. It is often associated with measles, whooping cough and influenza. It peels off readily leaving the underlying epithelium intact. The fibrinous exudate is present on the surface of the conjunctival epithelium.</p>

                <h3>4. Trachoma (Egyptian Ophthalmia)</h3>
                
                <p>Trachoma in Greek means 'rough'. Though the disease is known for long, its etiology was not clear. Inclusion organisms were demonstrated in 1907 and the organism was isolated in 1957. The organisms isolated is known as Chlamydia trachomatis.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <p>Trachoma is caused by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chlamydia trachomatis, a Bedsonian organism (serotypes A, B, Ba and C).</li>
                    <li>It belongs to psittacosis lymphogranuloma group.</li>
                    <li>It lies between bacteria and virus.</li>
                    <li>They multiply by binary fission. They stay inside the cells, which makes them relative immune from effects of the drugs.</li>
                    <li>It is seen in the conjunctival scrapings of the epithelial cells as the Halberstaedter-Prowazek inclusion bodies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Incidence</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is estimated that 1/5 of world population is affected by trachoma.</li>
                    <li>It is prevalent in Europe, Asia (Iran, India, China, Japan, Middle East), Africa and South America, Australia.</li>
                    <li>In India it is common and endemic in north Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab.</li>
                    <li>It is commonly seen in unhygienic, crowded, dusty and dirty environment.</li>
                    <li>It is contagious in the acute stage. It spreads by finger, flies, towels and fomites.</li>
                    <li>Maintenance of facial cleanliness is found to be the best measure to reduce the spread of trachoma.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mild irritation and foreign body sensation is often present.</li>
                    <li>Frequent blinking may be present.</li>
                    <li>Mild itching is a common complaint.</li>
                    <li>In chronic stage, cornea is involved causing pain, lacrimation and photophobia.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <p>The primary infection is epithelial and involves the epithelium of both the conjunctiva and the cornea.</p>

                <h4>Classification</h4>

                <h5>I. Mac Callan Classification</h5>
                <p>There are four clinical stages according to Mac Callan classification.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Trachoma I (subclinical stage)</strong><br>
                It is the earliest stage before clinical diagnosis is possible.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Trachoma II (Stage of typical trachomatous lesions)</strong><br>
                It includes the period between the appearance of typical trachomatous lesions and development of scar tissue.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follicles or papillae</li>
                    <li>Epithelial keratitis</li>

                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Trachoma III (Stage of scarring)</strong><br>
                Typical star-shaped scarring is obvious.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Trachoma IV (Stage of sequelae and complications)</strong><br>
                The disease is quiet and cured but cicatrization gives rise to symptoms.</p>

                <h5>II. World Health Organization (WHO) Classification</h5>
                <p>WHO has suggested the following classifications in 1987.</p>

                <h4>Diagnosis</h4>

                <h5>1. Clinical</h5>
                <p>The presence of any two signs is essential to diagnose trachoma.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follicles or papillae</li>
                    <li>Epithelial keratitis</li>
                    <li>Pannus</li>
                    <li>Typical star-shaped scarring of the conjunctiva.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>2. Laboratory</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Histological demonstration of the inclusion bodies</li>
                    <li>Culture in irradiated McCoy cells</li>
                    <li>Microimmunofluorescence test (micro-IF)</li>
                    <li>IgA-IPA light microscopy test</li>
                    <li>Monoclonal antibody direct test.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Sequelae and Complications</h4>
                
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Trichiasis and corneal ulcer</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The only complication of trachoma is corneal ulcer. All the rest are sequelae of trachoma.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trichiasis</strong>-Misdirected eyelashes occur due to conjunctival scarring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entropion</strong>-In rolling of the lid margin results from scarring.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corneal ulcer</strong>-It is often due to dry eye and misdirected eyelashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corneal opacity</strong>-It results from corneal ulceration.</li>
                </ol>
