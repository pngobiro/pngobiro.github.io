                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>Pathophysiology of glaucoma revolves around the aqueous humor dynamics. The principal ocular structures concerned with it are the pars plicata part of the ciliary body, angle of anterior chamber and the aqueous outflow system.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-268.jpg" alt="Schiotz tonometer">
                    <figcaption>Schiotz tonometer</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>1. Ciliary Body</h3>
                <p>It is the main site of aqueous production. The shape of the ciliary body is like an isosceles triangle with its base forwards. Iris is attached to about the middle of the base of the ciliary body. The outer side of the triangle lies against the sclera with the suprachoroidal space in between.</p>

                <h4>Structure</h4>
                <p>The ciliary body consists of four layers namely,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ciliary muscles</strong>—These are flat bundles of non-striated muscle fibres which are helpful in accommodation of the lens for seeing near objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stroma</strong>—It consists of connective tissue of collagen and fibroblasts, nerves, pigments and blood vessels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ciliary processes</strong>—There are about 70 ciliary processes seen macroscopically. Suspensory ligament or zonule of Zinn is attached to them and the equator of the lens. Each finger-like process is lined by two layers of epithelial cells. The core of the ciliary process contains blood vessels and loose connective tissue. These processes are the main site of aqueous production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Epithelium</strong>—There are two layers of pigmented and non-pigmented epithelial cells.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Parts</h4>
                <p>Ciliary body has two parts namely,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Pars plicata</strong>—The anterior one-third of ciliary body (about 2 mm) is known as pars plicata. The ciliary processes are attached to this part. Pars plicata part of the ciliary body secretes aqueous humor</li>
                    <li><strong>Pars plana</strong>—The posterior two-third of ciliary body (about 4 mm) is known as pars plana. It is relatively avascular therefore posterior segment of the eye is entered through the pars plana incision 3-5 mm behind the limbus.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Angle of Anterior Chamber</h3>
                <p>It plays an important role in the process of aqueous drainage. It is formed by the root of iris, anterior most part of the ciliary body, scleral spur, trabecular meshwork and Schwalbe's line (prominent end of Descemet's membrane of cornea). The angle width varies in different individuals and plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of different types of glaucoma. Clinically the various angle structures can be visualised by gonioscopic examination.</p>

                <h3>3. Aqueous Outflow System</h3>
                <p>It includes the trabecular meshwork, canal of Schlemm, aqueous veins and the episcleral veins.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trabecular meshwork</strong>—It is a sieve-like structure through which aqueous humor gets filtered into the canal of Schlemm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Canal of Schlemm</strong>—This is an endothelial lined oval channel present circumferentially in the scleral sulcus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aqueous veins</strong>—These are about 25-35 in number. They leave the canal of Schlemm at oblique angles to terminate into episcleral veins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Episcleral veins</strong>—These are branches of anterior ciliary veins. There is pressure difference of about 5 mm Hg between the anterior chamber and the episcleral veins so that the aqueous drains continuously in them.</li>
                </ol>

            <section id="maintenance-pressure" class="content-card">
                <h2>MAINTENANCE OF NORMAL INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE</h2>
                
                <p>The factors which maintain the normal intraocular pressures are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The formation of the aqueous humor.</li>
                    <li>The outflow of the aqueous humor.</li>
                    <li>The pressure in the episcleral veins.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. The Formation of the Aqueous Humour</h3>
                <p>The aqueous humor is a clear watery fluid filling the anterior chamber (0.25 ml) and posterior chamber (0.06 ml) of the eyeball. In addition to its role in maintaining normal intraocular pressure, it also plays an important role in providing nutrients and removing metabolites from the avascular cornea and lens.</p>

                <p>For many years Leber's theory of simple filtration from the blood was generally accepted. However, the chemical analysis of the aqueous humor indicated that ultrafiltration and secretion are involved in the formation of the aqueous humor.</p>

                <p>Aqueous humor is derived from the plasma within the capillary network of ciliary processes. The production of aqueous humor takes place by the ciliary epithelium by following mechanisms:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Secretion</strong>—It is an active metabolic process</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultrafiltration</strong>—Its rate is influenced by the level of blood pressure in the ciliary capillaries, plasma osmotic pressure and the level of intraocular pressure.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Blood-aqueous barrier</strong>—The system of semipermeable membranes separating the blood from the ocular cavity is known as the Blood-aqueous barrier.</p>

                <h3>2. The Outflow of the Aqueous Humor</h3>
                <p>The normal outflow takes place by two routes,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Angle of anterior chamber (conventional route)</li>
                    <li>Uveoscleral outflow (unconventional route)</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>i. Angle of anterior chamber (approximately 80%)</h4>
                <p>The aqueous is formed by the ciliary epithelium. It flows from the ciliary region to the posterior chamber. It then flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber and escapes through the drainage channels at the angle to the episcleral veins.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-270.jpg" alt="Outflow of the Aqueous humor">
                    <figcaption>Outflow of the Aqueous humor</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>ii. Uveoscleral outflow (approximately 20%)</h4>
                <p>This is the second accessory exit through the ciliary body into the suprachoroidal space and choroid. It then passes into the episcleral tissue. This pathway is of importance particularly in buphthalmos.</p>

                <h3>3. The Pressure in the Episcleral Veins</h3>
                <p>There is a pressure difference of approximately 5 mm Hg between the anterior chamber and the episcleral veins so that there is a continuous flow of aqueous into the venous system. In cases of orbital varicose veins or tumour, the venous pressure rises causing obstruction to the flow of aqueous.</p>

                <h2>GLAUCOMA</h2>
                
                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>The most important factor which causes rise of intraocular pressure is obstruction to the drainage of the aqueous humor through the:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Angle of the anterior chamber</li>
                    <li>At the pupil.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>The glaucomatous damage is attributed to a combination of factors which affect perfusion of optic nerve head.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical changes</strong>—The coats of the eye can withstand raised intraocular pressure except at the lamina cribrosa which is pushed backwards. This squeezes the nerve fibres within its meshes to disturb the axoplasmic flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vascular factors</strong>—The perfusion of optic nerve head may be affected due to decreased blood flow in the capillaries and in annulus of Zinn which supply nutrition to the laminar and postlaminar optic nerve head.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Classification</h3>
                <p>Absolute glaucoma—It is the end stage of all the above types of glaucoma where there is no perception of light and the person is blind. The intraocular tension is markedly raised.</p>

                <h2>CONGENITAL OR INFANTILE GLAUCOMA (BUPHTHALMOS, HYDROPHTHALMOS)</h2>
                
                <p>It is defined as glaucoma appearing between birth and the age of 3-4 years. There is raised intraocular tension present since birth. When the glaucoma presents at puberty, it is known as Juvenile glaucoma.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It is usually of a simple obstructive type due to congenital abnormality at the angle of anterior chamber. It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The iris is not completely separated from the cornea.</li>
                    <li>Persistence of embryonic mesodermal tissue at the angle.</li>
                    <li>Absence of canal of Schlemm.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <p>It occurs in about 1 in 10000 births</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Age</strong>—It is congenital and present since birth. However, the symptoms may manifest within 1-3 years of life (Infantile glaucoma)</li>
                    <li><strong>Sex</strong>—Boys are affected more than the girls</li>
                    <li>It is usually bilateral.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Congenital glaucoma</strong>—It manifests at birth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infantile glaucoma</strong>—It presents between 1-3 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Juvenile glaucoma</strong>—It presents around puberty.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Syndromes Associated with Infantile Glaucoma</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>von Recklinghausen's disease, i.e. generalised neurofibromatosis.</li>
                    <li>Sturge-Weber syndrome—The capillary naevus of face is associated with angiomatous conditions of the choroid and the brain.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lacrimation is present due to corneal oedema and erosion.</li>
                    <li>Photophobia is associated with corneal involvement.</li>
                    <li>There is defective vision due to corneal oedema leading to hazy cornea.</li>
                    <li>There is enlargement of cornea and the eye as a whole, due to stretching of the sclera.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enlargement of the eyeball as a whole is present with globular cornea.</li>
                    <li>There is corneal oedema and opacities due to endothelium damage and rupture of Descemet's membrane (Haabs' striae). These occur because Descemet's membrane is less elastic than the corneal stroma. Tears are situated in the periphery and are concentric with the limbus.</li>
                    <li>Deep anterior chamber with iridodonesis may be seen due to backward displacement of the lens. Iris may have atrophic patches in the late stages.</li>
                    <li>Lens is flattened and displaced backwards due to stretching of the zonule of Zinn.</li>
                    <li>Sclera becomes thin and bluish as the uveal tissue shines through it.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Raised intraocular pressure</strong>—It is not raised markedly due to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extensibility or stretching of the sclera</li>
                            <li>Uveoscleral outflow.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Measurement of corneal diameter</strong>—Corneal enlargement occurs along with the enlargement of the globe-buphthalmos (Bull-like eyes), specially when the onset is before the age of 3 years. A normal infant's cornea measures about 10.5 mm in diameter. A diameter of more than 13 mm confirms enlargement. The prognosis is usually poor when the diameter is more than 15 mm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundus examination</strong>—The cupping of optic disc is seen due to stretching of the lamina cribrosa and raised tension. Optic atrophy usually sets in after the third year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gonioscopy</strong>—The angle of anterior chamber shows certain abnormalities.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Keratoglobus (megalocornea)</strong>—It is present since birth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Very high myopia</strong>—The eyeball is large as a whole.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) in infants</strong> may be associated with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retinoblastoma.</li>
                            <li>Retinopathy of prematurity.</li>
                            <li>Aniridia or absence of iris.</li>
                            <li>Persistent primary hyperplastic vitreous.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>The treatment of congenital or infantile glaucoma is always surgical.</p>

                <h4>1. Medical Treatment</h4>
                <p>Systemic acetazolamide and mannitol IV along with local beta blockers, e.g. timolol maleate control the intraocular pressure preoperatively. Miotics are useless as they do not help in aqueous outflow.</p>

                <h4>2. Operative Treatment</h4>
                <h5>i. Goniotomy</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A specially constructed knife is passed at the limbus.</li>
                    <li>A Barkan goniotomy knife is swept across the angle of the anterior chamber in the opposite segment under direct gonioscopic observation.</li>
                    <li>It opens up the blockage of the corneoiridic angle by the persistent embryonic tissue.</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>

                <h5>ii. Trabeculotomy</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>A small flap of conjunctiva and a partial thickness flap of sclera are made at the upper limbus</li>
                    <li>Canal of Schlemm is exposed by making a vertical incision and dissection through the sclera and is identified.</li>
                    <li>The trabecular meshwork is incised by passing a probe or lower prong of Harm's trabeculotome (the upper prong is used as a guide) into the canal and then rotating it into the anterior chamber to break the inner wall over one quarter of the canal.</li>
                    <li>This is repeated on the other side also.</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-274.jpg" alt="Harm's trabeculotome">
                    <figcaption>Harm's trabeculotome</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>It is often difficult to localise the Schlemm's canal. However it is useful in cases where goniotomy has failed or when the angle is not visible due to hazy cornea.</p>

                <h5>iii. Trabeculectomy</h5>
                <p>If all forms of trabeculotomy fail then a trabeculectomy, a type of filtering operation may be considered.</p>

                <h2>PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA (POAG)</h2>
                
                <p>It is a chronic, slowly progressive condition with an insidious onset. This presents an entirely different clinical picture from the acute closed angle glaucoma.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It has a genetic basis. There is sclerosis of the trabecular meshwork in any type of eye. The endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm may also be sclerosed.</p>

                <h3>Incidence</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Age</strong>—It affects 6-7th decade mainly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sex</strong>—Both sexes are involved equally.</li>
                    <li>It is a bilateral condition usually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Race</strong>—It is more common and severe in black people than in white.</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-275.jpg" alt="Mechanism of rise in intraocular pressure in open angle glaucoma">

                </figure>

                <h3>Mechanism of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>There is increased resistance to the outflow of the aqueous humor offered by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The sclerosed trabecular meshwork</strong>—Electron microscopic picture shows following changes in the trabecular meshwork:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proliferation of endothelial lining with thickening of the basement membrane.</li>
                            <li>Narrowing of intertrabecular spaces.</li>
                            <li>Deposition of amorphous material in the juxtacanalicular tissue.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The sclerosed endothelium lining of the canal of Schlemm</strong>—This leads to narrowing or collapse of canal of Schlemm.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Associated Ocular Pathology</h3>
                <p>Following ocular diseases may be present in association with primary open angle glaucoma.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High myopia</li>
                    <li>Fuchs endothelial dystrophy</li>
                    <li>Retinitis pigmentosa</li>
                    <li>Retinal vessel occlusion</li>
                    <li>Retinal detachment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is painless, progressive loss of vision. Due to its insidious onset, it is usually noticed when vision is completely lost in one eye and the other eye is seriously impaired.</li>
                    <li>Mild headache and eyeache may be present.</li>
                    <li>A defect in the visual field (noticed by an intelligent patient) is often present.</li>
                    <li>There is increasing difficulty in doing near work. Reading or close work is often difficult due to accommodative failure as a result of pressure upon the ciliary muscle and its nerve supply. There is frequent increase in the strength of presbyopic glasses.</li>
                    <li>Light sense is defective. Light minimum is raised and dark adaptation is slowed.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visual acuity decreases gradually. However, it remains good till the late stage as the central field of vision persists.</li>
                    <li>Cornea is usually clear.</li>
                    <li>Anterior chamber depth and angle are normal.</li>
                    <li>Pupillary reactions remain normal until the late stage when they become sluggish.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                <p>The diagnosis depends on the classical triad signs:</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-276.jpg" alt="Pathogenesis">
                    <figcaption>Pathogenesis</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>1. Raised tension</h4>
                <p>In primary open angle glaucoma careful study and repeated observations of tension are required.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Initially there is exaggeration of normal diurnal variation. A variation of intraocular pressure over 5 mm Hg (Schiotz) should always excite suspicion of glaucoma.</li>
                    <li>Later on there is permanent elevation of tension so that the normal basal level is not attained.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Cupping of the optic disc</h4>
                <p><strong>Pathogenesis of optic disc changes</strong>—Both mechanical and vascular factors play a role in the cupping of the disc.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mechanical effect of raised intraocular pressure</strong> forces the lamina cribrosa backwards and squeezes the nerve fibres within its meshes to disturb the axoplasmic flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vascular factors</strong>—Ischaemic atrophy of the nerve fibres occur without corresponding increase of supporting glial tissue. As a result, large caverns or lacunae are formed (cavernous optic atrophy).</li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>The cupping of the optic disc usually starts as a focal enlargement in the lower temporal quadrant. However, it may enlarge in concentric circles</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertically oval cup</strong>—It is due to the thinning of the lower margin of the optic cup at the 6 O'clock position.</li>
                    <li>When fully developed it should be differentiated from the physiological cup.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal cup/disc ratio = 0.3.</li>
                            <li>Glaucomatous cup/disc ratio may vary from 0.6 to even 0.9, specially if in the vertical axis</li>
                            <li>An asymmetry between the two optic nerve heads of more than 0.2.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
