                <h2>STERILIZATION OF INSTRUMENTS</h2>
                
                <p>It is essential to sterilize ophthalmic instruments before using them to prevent ocular infection.</p>
                <p>Sterilization is a process which destroys all micro-organisms including bacteria and spores.</p>
                <p>Disinfection is a process which kills pathogenic micro-organisms but has no effect on bacteria and spores.</p>

                <h3>METHODS</h3>
                <p>Sterilization can be achieved by,</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Physical agents: Heat, filtration, radiation, etc.</li>
                    <li>Chemical agents: Alcohols, aldehydes, phenol, halogens, surface acting agents, gases, etc.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1. Heat Sterilization</h3>

                <h4>Dry heat sterilization</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hot air oven:</strong> It is the most commonly used method of sterilization by dry heat. It kills the bacteria, spores and viruses. It is used to sterilize instruments like forceps, scissors, scalpels, etc. The articles should be double wrapped and kept at 150°C for 2 hours in an oven.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flame:</strong> It can be used to sterilize, tips of forceps, air way cannula, spatulas etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incineration:</strong> It is used to destroy soiled dressings and pathological materials.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Moist heat sterilization</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Autoclave (Steam under pressure):</strong> It is the most widely used method of sterilization. It is based on the principle that at the boiling point of water, the vapour pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Thus if the vapour pressure is increased, the penetrating power of the steam also increases.

                    Autoclaving at 121°C under 15 lb/in² for 20 minutes kills the bacteria, spores and viruses. This is useful in sterilizing various instruments, rubber articles, towels, gowns, dressing pads, swabs and eye drops.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Steaming:</strong> It kills most bacteria and viruses but not spores. The instruments are placed on a shelf above the level of boiling water. Sharp edged instruments like knives and scissors can be sterilized by steam for approximately 30 minutes.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> It kills bacteria and viruses. Heavy metallic instruments can be sterilized by boiling for about 30 minutes. This methods, however, blunts the cutting edges of the instruments.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Chemical Sterilization</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Spirit (95% alcohol):</strong> It kills the bacteria and spores but not viruses.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Methylated spirit (70% isopropyl alcohol):</strong> Schiotz tonometer can be sterilized by it.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Formaldehyde:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Formalin (10%): It has marked bactericidal, sporicidal and some viricidal action. It is useful for cryoextractor probes and heat sensitive instruments.</li>
                            <li>b. Formaldehyde gas: It is used to fumigate and to sterilize the operating room. Formaldehyde fumigation is recommended fortnightly as a routine for optimum disinfection. 500 ml of 40% formaldehyde is added to one litre of water and kept in an electric boiler or in a large bowl placed on a hot plate with safety cut-out till dry.</li>

                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Savlon:</strong> It is a combination of cetavlon or cetrimide and chlorhexidine. Cetavlon is a surface active agent and chlorhexidine is a phenol. It is effective against most gram-positive organisms. It is commonly used for cleaning the skin. Scissors, knives, etc. may also be sterilized with it.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Glutaraldehyde (2%):</strong> It is commercially available as 'Cidex' solution. It is specially used to sterilize sharp instruments as their sharpness is not affected. The instruments are free from pathogens and spores in about three hours. However, instruments should be washed thoroughly with sterile water prior to use.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Hydrogen peroxide (3%):</strong> It is used for sterilizing of applanation tonometer, prisms and ophthalmoscopy lenses. It is active particularly against AIDS and herpes virus.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Ethylene oxide gas:</strong> It is highly inflammable gas. It is mixed with an inert gas like carbon dioxide or nitrogen. It is effective against all bacterias, spores and viruses. Indirect ophthalmoscopy lenses, gonioscopy lenses and cryoprobes can be sterilized with it.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Acetone:</strong> It is a quick and cheap method of sterilizing instruments. Instruments are kept in acetone for 5 minutes and thereafter are thoroughly washed with sterile water before use.</li>

                <h3>3. Radiation Sterilization</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Ionizing radiations:</strong> These include gamma rays, cosmic rays, X-rays which are lethal to DNA and thus kill all types of micro-organisms. The rays can penetrate both solids and liquids without raising the temperature significantly (cold sterilization). They are used for sterilizing swabs, dressing pads, tubings, plastic syringes, etc.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Non-ionizing radiations:</strong> They act as a type of hot air sterilization because they are absorbed as heat. Infrared rays are useful for rapid mass sterilization of instruments.</li>
