                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <h3>The Eyelids</h3>
                <p>These are two movable folds of tissue situated above and below the front of each eye. There are short curved hair, the eyelashes situated on their free edges. The layers of tissue which form the eyelids are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A thin covering of skin.</li>
                    <li>A thin sheet of areolar tissue.</li>
                    <li>Three muscles-the orbicularis oculi, levator palpebrae superioris and Muller's muscle.</li>
                    <li>A thin sheet of dense connective tissue, the tarsal plate, larger in the upper than in the lower eyelid. It supports the other structures.</li>
                    <li>A lining of palpebral conjunctiva.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Lid Margin</h3>
                <p>It is divided into rounded anterior and sharp posterior borders by the grey line. The eyelashes originate anterior to the grey line and ducts of the meibomian glands are located posterior to the grey line. Grey line is important in operations where the lid is split as it indicates the position of loose fibrous tissue between the orbicularis muscle and the tarsus.</p>

                <h3>Meibomian Glands (Tarsal Glands)</h3>
                <p>These are modified sebaceous glands about 20-30 in number embedded in the tarsal plate. They are directed vertically and open on the lid margin. Therefore vertical incision is given while incising the chalazion.</p>

                <h3>Zeis's Glands</h3>
                <p>These are also modified sebaceous glands attached to the hair follicles.</p>

                <h3>Moll's Glands</h3>
                <p>These are modified sweat glands which open in the hair follicles or directly in the lid margin.</p>

                <h3>Palpebral Fissure</h3>
                <p>The space between the two lids when the eye is open is known as the palpebral fissure or palpebral aperture.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-413.jpg" alt="Anatomy of the eyelids showing structures and layers">
                    <figcaption>Anatomy of the eyelids</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>The Outer Canthus</h3>
                <p>The outer or lateral angle of the palpebral fissure is called the outer canthus.</p>

                <h3>The Inner Canthus</h3>
                <p>The inner or medial angle of the palpebral fissure is called the inner canthus. A semilunar fold, the plica semilunaris with an elevation called the caruncle is situated in the inner canthus.</p>

                <h3>Blood Supply</h3>
                <p>It is supplied by the ophthalmic and lacrimal arteries by their medial and lateral branches. The venous drainage is through the ophthalmic vein.</p>

                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Blood supply and innervation of the eyelids</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The 7th nerve supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle. The 3rd nerve supplies the levator palpebrae superioris. The sympathetic nerves supply the Muller's muscle.</li>
                    <li>The sensory supply is by the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
                <p>The preauricular and the submaxillary lymph nodes.</p>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The eyelids and eyelashes protect the eye from injury. Reflex closure of the lids occurs when the conjunctiva, cornea or eyelashes are touched, when an object comes close to the eye or when a bright light shines into the eye. This is called the conjunctival or corneal reflex.</li>
                    <li>Regular blinking spreads tears and meibomian gland's secretions over the cornea which prevents drying of the cornea and conjunctiva.</li>
                    <li>The eyes close when the orbicularis oculi muscle contracts. The eyelids open when the levator palpebrae muscle contracts.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>BLEPHARITIS</h3>
                <p>Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of the lid margins.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>It follows chronic conjunctivitis due to Staphyloccocus in debilitated children usually who are living in poor hygienic conditions.</li>
                    <li>Parasites such as Demodex folliculorum, Phthiriasis palpebrarum, crab louse, head louse also cause blepharitis.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>

                <h4>Types</h4>

                <h5>1. Squamous blepharitis</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is due to abnormal metabolism and seborrhoea. It is usually associated with the dandruff of the scalp.</li>
                    <li>Numerous white coloured small scales accumulate among the eyelashes.</li>
                    <li>The eyelashes fall out readily but are replaced without distortion.</li>
                    <li>On removal of the scales, the underlying surface is hyperaemic.</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>

                <h5>2. Ulcerative blepharitis</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is an infective condition. The yellow crusts glue the lashes together.</li>
                    <li>On removing the crusts, there are small ulcers seen around the bases of the lashes. These ulcers bleed easily.</li>
                    <li>The eyelashes fall out being replaced by misdirected lashes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Itching, redness, soreness, lacrimation and photophobia.</p>

                <h4>Sequelae</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Trichiasis</strong> - This condition is due to misdirected eyelashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tylosis</strong> - There is thickening or hypertrophy of the lid margin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Madarosis</strong> - Absence of or scanty eyelashes as a result of destruction of the hair roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ectropion</strong> - There is eversion of the lid margin due to the contraction of the scar tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Epiphora</strong> - Constant watering of the eyes occurs as a result of ectropion which may lead to eczema of the skin.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>CHALAZION (TARSAL OR MEIBOMIAN CYST)</h2>
                
                <p>Chalazion is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is probably due to chronic irritation caused by an organism of low virulence. The glandular tissue is replaced by granulation tissue containing giant cells predominantly.</li>
                    <li>It is often multiple in number occurring in crops.</li>
                    <li>It is more common in adults than in children.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is no pain unless chalazion is secondarily infected.</li>
                    <li>There is disfigurement due to the presence of swelling in the lid.</li>
                    <li>It may be single or multiple in number.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A small non-tender hard swelling in the lid, slightly away from the lid margin is seen.</li>
                    <li>There are no signs of acute inflammation.</li>
                    <li>On everting the lid, the conjunctiva over the swelling is red or purple. It is grey in colour in later stages. It may be yellow when secondarily infected by pyogenic organisms.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Course</h3>

                </figure>

                <ol>
                    <li>Complete spontaneous resolution may occur rarely.</li>
                    <li>The contents of the chalazion may be extruded through the conjunctiva occasionally which resembles a fungating mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marginal chalazion</strong> - The granuloma is formed in the duct of the gland which projects as a reddish-grey nodule on the intermarginal strip.</li>
                    <li>Recurrence may occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne rosacea and malignant change.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is incised and thoroughly scraped.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The conjunctiva and lid are anaesthetised with procaine.</li>
                            <li>The lid is everted and chalazion clamp is fixed at the site of maximum discolouration with the hollow side facing the conjunctiva.</li>
                            <li>A small vertical incision is given with a sharp blade over the conjunctival side.</li>
                            <li>The semifluid contents escape and walls of the cavity are thoroughly scraped with the chalazion scoop. The cavity is cauterized with carbolic acid to avoid recurrence.</li>
                            <li>Bleeding stops and usually no dressing is necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Injection of triamcinolone directly into the chalazion may cause complete resolution.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>It is an acute suppurative inflammation of the meibomian gland. It is uncommon.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It occurs due to the secondary infection of the chalazion.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>These are more violent than the stye because the gland is larger and it is embedded deeply in the dense fibrous tissue.</p>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A yellow spot (pus) is seen shining through the conjunctiva on everting the lid.</li>

                <p>Trichiasis is a condition where the eyelashes are misdirected backwards rubbing against the cornea. A few eyelashes or whole lid margin may be involved.</p>

                <h4>Etiology</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Entropion due to cicatrization in stage IV of trachoma is a common cause.</li>
                    <li>Spastic entropion in old persons or due to tight bandaging may cause trichiasis.</li>
                    <li>Blepharitis specially the ulcerative form may result in trichiasis.</li>
                    <li>It may occur after recurrent stye.</li>
                    <li>Scars of the lid following burn, injury or operation may cause trichiasis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is foreign body sensation and photophobia due to corneal involvement.</li>
                    <li>Irritation, pain and lacrimation are very troublesome.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctival congestion is present usually.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Signs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reflex blepharospasm and photophobia are seen in cases of corneal involvement.</li>
                    <li>Superficial corneal opacities are often present.</li>
                    <li>Ciliary congestion is often associated.</li>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Epilation or removal of misdirected eyelash is repeated every few weeks.</li>
                    <li>Electrolysis - It is preferable as it causes destruction of hair follicle by a current of 3-5 mA for 10 seconds. It may be repeated every few months.</li>

                <h5>2. Whole lid margin involvement</h5>
                <p>Operative procedures as for entropion are employed.</p>

                <h3>ENTROPION</h3>
                <p>It is a condition in which the lid margin rolls inwards.</p>

                <h4>Types</h4>

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>It is due to the spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle as may occur after tight bandaging after operation or following chronic irritative corneal condition.</li>
                    <li>It commonly occurs in old people involving the lower lid.</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>2. Cicatricial entropion</h5>
                <p>It results due to contraction of the palpebral conjunctiva in:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Trachoma stage IV</li>
                    <li>Ulcerative blepharitis</li>

                <h5>1. Spastic entropion</h5>
                <p>The basic cause of blepharospasm is treated:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>If it is due to prolonged and tight bonding, discontinue the application of bandage.</li>
                    <li>In senile patients the lower lid is pulled downwards by a strip of adhesive plaster.</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>2. Cicatricial entropion</h5>
                <p>It is treated by operative procedures.</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Resection of skin and muscle</strong> - Removal of an elliptical or spindle-shaped strip of skin and muscle 3 mm away from the lid margin corrects mild degree of entropion. It is the simplest procedure.</li>

                    <li><strong>Burow's operations</strong> - This procedure is done from the conjunctival side by everting the lid over a spatula. A horizontal incision is made through the conjunctiva, tarsal plate but not the skin along the whole lid margin 2-3 mm away from the posterior border of the lid. The temporal end of the strip may then be divided by a small vertical incision. The edge of the lid is kept everted during healing by a spindle-shaped pad of oiled skin, kept in position by sutures suitably applied.</li>

                <h5>1. Spastic ectropion</h5>
                <p>It occurs due to blepharospasm when lids are well-supported by the globe. It usually occurs in children and young persons.</p>

                <h5>2. Mechanical ectropion</h5>
                <p>It occurs as a result of thickening of the conjunctiva, e.g. as in trachoma stage IV.</p>

                <h5>3. Cicatricial ectropion</h5>
                <p>It may be due to several conditions such as chronic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, injury, burns, ulcers, etc.</p>

                <h5>4. Senile ectropion</h5>
                <p>It is present in the lower lid due to the laxity of orbicularis oculi muscle and other tissues of lid.</p>

                <h5>5. Paralytic ectropion</h5>
                <p>It occurs due to the paralysis of orbicularis oculi muscle.</p>

                <h4>Symptom</h4>
                <p>The most common symptom is epiphora, i.e. constant watering of the eyes.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Conjunctiva becomes dry in appearance and thickened in texture.</li>
                    <li>Chronic conjunctivitis may be present due to exposure of the conjunctiva and cornea.</li>
                    <li>Corneal ulcer may develop (exposure keratitis).</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Spastic ectropion</strong> - The underlying cause of blepharospasm is treated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cicatricial ectropion</strong> - The aim of surgery is to free the lid margin from scar tissue and restore the lid to its normal position and function.
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>V-Y operation is done in mild cases. A 'V'-shaped incision is made in the skin.</li>
