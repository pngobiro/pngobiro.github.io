                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>The two orbits are two pyramidal-shaped bony cavities situated on either side of the nose or midline of face. The apex is represented by the optic foramen and the base by the orbital margins of the frontal and maxillary bones. The average volume of orbit is approximately 30 cc.</p>

                <h3>1. Orbital Walls</h3>
                <p>The surfaces of each orbit (roof, floor, medial and lateral wall) are composed of seven bones: ethmoid, frontal, lacrimal, maxillary, palatine, sphenoid and zygomatic bones. The thinnest of these bones is the lamina papyracea over the ethmoid sinuses along the medial wall.</p>

                <h3>2. Orbital Apertures</h3>
                <h4>I. Superior orbital fissure:</h4>
                <p>It is located between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid. Structures passing through the fissure include:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves</li>
                    <li>5th cranial nerve-ophthalmic division</li>
                    <li>Sympathetic nerve fibres</li>
                    <li>Orbital veins</li>
                    <li>Recurrent branch of ophthalmic artery</li>
                </ol>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <h4>II. Optic foramen and canal:</h4>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Optic canal (5-10 mm long):</strong> It is located in the lesser wing of sphenoid. It transmits following structures:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Optic nerve</li>
                            <li>Ophthalmic artery</li>
                            <li>Sympathetic nerves</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Optic foramen:</strong> It is the orbital end of optic canal. It measures 6 mm in diameter.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>III. Inferior orbital fissure:</h4>
                <p>It is situated in the lower part of the orbital apex. It transmits following structures:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Fifth cranical nerve-maxillary division</li>
                    <li>Zygomatic nerve</li>
                    <li>Inferior ophthalmic vein</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Surgical Spaces in the Orbit</h3>
                <p>There are four surgical spaces in the orbit. These are of clinical importance as the inflammatory process remains localized in any one of them and each space may be opened separately.</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><strong>Subperiosteal space:</strong> It lies between the periosteum and the bone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peripheral orbital space:</strong> It lies between the periosteum and the extraocular muscles. It is a continuous circular space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Central space:</strong> It is a cone-shaped space enclosed by the extraocular muscles. It is known as the 'muscle cone'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tenon's space:</strong> It is situated around the globe underneath the Tenon's capsule.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ORBITAL CELLULITIS</h2>
                
                <p>It is the purulent inflammation of the cellular tissues of the orbit. It is a serious condition of the eye which may endanger the vision and life as well.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>Any age or any sex may be affected. It is unilateral usually.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is often due to extension of infection from the neighbouring parts such as nasal sinuses, teeth, face, lips, etc.</li>
                    <li>Penetrating injury of the eye with or without retention of a foreign body.</li>
                    <li>It may occur following septic operations and panophthalmitis.</li>
                    <li>Metastasis from septicemia may also cause orbital cellulitis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is severe excruciating pain particularly on movement of the eyeball.</li>
                    <li>There is inability to open the eyes due to chemosis and swelling of lids.</li>
                    <li>Diplopia may be present due to impaired movement of the eye.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Orbital cellulitis</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ol>
                    <li>There is swelling of the lids and conjunctiva along with marked congestion.</li>
                    <li>Mild proptosis and impaired mobility may cause diplopia.</li>
                    <li>Pain is increased by pressure or on movement of the eyeball.</li>
                    <li>Vision is not affected. However, it may be reduced in associated retrobulbar neuritis.</li>
                    <li>Fever and cerebral signs may be present due to central nervous system involvement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundus examination</strong> - It is difficult to examine the fundus. It may be normal or signs of optic neuritis are seen with engorgement of veins. Eventually optic atrophy sets in.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Abscess</strong> - It points in the skin of the lid near the orbital margin or may empty into the conjunctival fornix.</li>
                    <li>Panophthalmitis is a serious condition.</li>
                    <li>Purulent meningitis and cerebral abscess may occur occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Optic atrophy results in permanent loss of vision.</li>
                    <li>Thrombosis of cavernous sinus can even cause death.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hot compress relieves pain and prevents stasis.</li>
                    <li>Modern broad-spectrum antibiotics are given parenterally in high doses.</li>
                    <li>Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful in controlling pain and fever.</li>
                    <li>If an abscess is formed, incision and drainage is done promptly.</li>

                <h2>THROMBOSIS OF CAVERNOUS SINUS</h2>
                
                <p>It is due to the extension of thrombosis from various sources which communicate with the cavernous sinus.</p>

                <h3>Anatomy of Communication of Cavernous Sinus</h3>
                <p>It is of great clinical importance as infection may travel from face, lips orbit, mouth, pharynx, ear, nose, accessory sinuses or as a metastasis in infectious diseases or septicaemia.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-450.jpg" alt="Communications of cavernous sinus anatomy">

                    <li>The superior and inferior ophthalmic veins enter the sinus anteriorly.</li>
                    <li>The superior and inferior petrosal sinus leave the sinus posteriorly.</li>
                    <li>It communicates directly and indirectly with the pterygoid plexus, cerebrum and middle ear. Therefore the swelling behind the ear is diagnostic of cavernous sinus thrombosis.</li>
                    <li>The sinus of one side communicates with the other by two or three transverse sinuses which surround the pituitary body.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>They are same as for orbital cellulitis.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is severe supraorbital pain due to involvement of ophthalmic division of the 5th nerve which is situated on the lateral side of cavernous sinus.</li>
                    <li>High-grade fever, rigor and vomiting are present usually.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Oedema over the mastoid process of the temporal bone of the affected side, i.e. behind the ear is the most important early diagnostic sign.</strong></li>
                    <li>Transference of symptoms to opposite eye in 50% cases is seen. Paralysis of opposite lateral rectus muscle is suspicious of bilateral involvement.</li>
                    <li>Paralysis of extraocular muscles may be present.</li>
                    <li>Corneal anesthesia and dilated pupil are seen in later stages due to involvement of 5th nerve.</li>
                    <li>Proptosis occurs in almost all cases but is of late onset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundus examination</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retinal veins are dilated and engorged</li>
                            <li>There may be pronounced papillitis</li>

                <h2>PROPTOSIS OR EXOPHTHALMOS</h2>
                
                <p>It is a condition where there is forward displacement of the eyeball beyond the orbital margin with the patient looking straight ahead. The term proptosis is synonymous with exophthalmos for practical purpose but they connote different meaning.</p>

                <h3>Proptosis</h3>
                <p>It is defined as the passive or mechanical protrusion of the eyeball.</p>

                <h3>Exophthalmos</h3>
                <p>It is defined as the active protrusion of the eyeball forwards.</p>

                <h3>Classification</h3>
                <p>It may be classified as follows:</p>

                <h4>1. Unilateral Proptosis</h4>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Inflammatory lesions—Orbital cellulitis, abscess, etc.</li>
                    <li>Vascular disturbances-Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc.</li>
                    <li>Cysts and tumours-Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit.</li>
                    <li>Systemic diseases-Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages.</li>
                    <li>Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Bilateral Proptosis</h4>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Developmental anomalies of the skull-Oxycephaly (tower skull).</li>
                    <li>Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic.</li>
                    <li>Inflammatory lesions-Cavernous sinus thrombosis.</li>
                    <li>Tumours—lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, etc.</li>
                    <li>Lipodystrophies—Xanthomatosis, diabetic exophthalmic dysostosis (Hand-Schüller-Christian disease).</li>

                </figure>

                <h4>3. Intermittent Proptosis</h4>
                <p>It is usually caused by the orbital varicose veins particularly on looking down.</p>

                <h4>4. Pulsating Proptosis</h4>
                <p>It is caused by the arteriovenous aneurysm as a result of communication between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus.</p>

                <h3>Clinical Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Clinical evaluation of the patient is done by taking a careful history, clinical examination, radiological and laboratory investigations.</p>

                <h4>1. History</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mode of onset - Whether sudden, gradual or chronic?</li>
                    <li>Presence and duration of pain is important.</li>
                    <li>Past history of thyroid dysfunction, orbital trauma, sinus disease and malignancy.</li>

                            <li><strong>By clinical observation</strong> - The patient is made to sit in front of the surgeon. His head is tilted slightly backwards and the position of the apex of each cornea is compared on both sides.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exophthalmometer</strong> - It consists of a transparent plastic ruler with a groove which fits into the outer bony margin of the orbit. The scale is engraved on both sides. The level of the apex of the cornea is measured on both sides.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Normally the distance between the apex of the cornea and the lateral orbital margin is less than 20 mm. A reading of 21 mm or more is regarded as abnormal.</li>
                                    <li>A difference of more than 2 mm between the two eyes is abnormal.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>There is limitations of ocular movements due to oedema, infiltration and fibrosis.</li>
                    <li>Visual acuity may be reduced as a result of exposure keratitis and optic nerve involvement due to infiltration, pressure by swollen muscle and reduced blood supply.</li>
                    <li>Pupillary reactions are affected due to optic nerve involvement.</li>
                    <li>Fundus examination-The disc may be normal or show features of optic atrophy, papillitis or papilloedema.</li>
                    <li>Transillumination and auscultation are done for tumour and pulsating proptosis.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>3. Radiological investigation</h4>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Plain X-rays</strong>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>The Caldwell view (PA view)</strong> —This view is taken with the patient's nose and forehead touching the film. It is useful in the diagnosis of orbital lesions. The enlargement of the orbit bone density, calcification, enlargement of the superior orbital fissure and optic canal is noted.</li>
                            <li><strong>The lateral view</strong> - It is useful is studying the nasopharynx.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Computerized tomography scanning (CT scan)</strong> - Axial and coronal scanning are done. CT scan is the most useful single technique for orbital evaluation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> - Both A and B scans are complementary to CT scanning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> - The tissues are exposed to a short electromagnetic pulse, and the sensitive receivers pick up this electromagnetic echo. It has the advantage of not being hampered by bone and there is no effect of ionizing irradiation on the patient.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>4. Laboratory investigation</h4>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Routine blood picture, haemoglobin, WBC total and differential count, ESR, blood sugar and cholesterol, urine examination are useful investigations.</li>
                    <li>Special tests like T3, T4, TSH level of blood, orbital venography may be done.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Exploratory operation and biopsy are done.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surgical excision</strong> — It is done in case of benign tumours and dermoid cysts. There are 3 routes of approach with retention of the eye:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Anterior orbitotomy,</li>

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Exenteration</strong> - Removal of all the structures of the orbit including the eye and periosteum is done in case of extraocular extension of malignancy as in retinoblastoma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiation</strong> - It is recommended in cases of recurrence and metastasis of tumour.</li>

                <p>Exophthalmos in thyroid disorders is an active process.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>The exact cause is obscure as it may be present in hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and elithyroid states. It may be associated with:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Generalised disturbance of the endocrine system.</li>
                    <li>Increased secretion of thyrotropic hormone (TTH) from the anterior lobe of pituitary gland in response to low thyroxin level.</li>
                    <li>Increased secretion of exophthalmos producing substance (EPS) and long acting thyroid stimulators (LATS).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>There is delayed hypersensitivity or autoimmune reaction to thyroglobulin leading to oedema, infiltration, deposition of fat and mucopolysaccharide substances and fibrosis of the orbital tissue.</p>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>In hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis, Graves' disease, exophthalmic goitre)</strong> - There is mild exophthalmos.</li>
                    <li><strong>In hypothyroidism (thyrotropic exophthalmos, exophthalmic ophthalmoplegia)</strong> - An extreme exophthalmos occurs in hypothyroidism (after thyroid gland removal usually).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>There is anterior protrusion of the eyeballs with inability to close the lids.</p>

                            <li><strong>von Graefe's sign</strong> - Upper lid lags on downward movements of the eyeball.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stellwag's sign</strong> - There is infrequent and incomplete blinking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobius's sign</strong> - There is weakness of convergence</li>
                            <li><strong>Jellinek's sign</strong> — There is increased pigmentation of lids.</li>
