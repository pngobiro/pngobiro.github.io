                <p>In ophthalmology, the term 'blindness' strictly means 'the inability to perceive light' but from a practical point of view a person is said to be 'blind' or 'visually handicapped' when he is too blind to perform work for which eye sight is essential. The WHO has proposed a uniform criterion and defined blindness as, 'Visual acuity of less than 3/60 (Snellen) or its equivalent'. In the absence of appropriate vision charts, the WHO has added, "Inability to count fingers in daylight at a distance of 3 meters" to indicate less than 3/60 or its equivalent.</p>

                <h2>Incidence</h2>
                
                <p>In India, there are approximately 1.20 crore blind people which is about one-fourth of the total blind population of the world. This means that 14.9 out of every 1000 Indians are blind, compared to about 3 per thousand in most developed countries. Throughout the developing countries, two-third of the blindness is estimated to be preventable or curable if efforts are made in this direction.</p>

                <h2>CAUSES OF BLINDNESS</h2>

                <h3>1. In India</h3>
                <p>The three great eye health problems are cataract, corneal opacity and malnutrition. The main diseases responsible for visual impairment and blindness in India are as follows:</p>

                <p>The last group includes congenital anomalies, uveitis, posterior segment diseases, tumours, diabetes, hypertension and diseases of nervous system. At present there are more than 22 million cataract cases waiting to be operated in India. About 2 million new cases are being added each year. Majority of curable cataract blind people live in rural areas. 'Eye camps', i.e. 'doctor at the door' is the only way for providing surgical treatment.</p>

                <h3>Magnitude of Blindness in India</h3>
                <p>India accounts for 12 million blind people of the total estimated 37 million blind people globally.</p>
                <p>Prevalence of blindness in India at present is 1.1% (NPCB Survey 2001-2002). It was 0.7% in 1996 (WHO Regional Health report), 1% in 1995 (WHO, 1995) and 1.49% in 1986-1989 (WHO NPCB).</p>

                <h3>2. In Developed Countries</h3>
                <p>The most frequent causes of blindness are cataract, accident, glaucoma, diabetes, hypertension and other vascular diseases, hereditary and congenital conditions and degenerations of retina.</p>

                <h3>3. Global Magnitude of Blindness</h3>
                <p>It is estimated that there are 161 million visually impaired persons all over the world. Out of these 37 million are blind and 124 million persons have low vision. Major causes of global blindness and the estimated number of blind persons are as follows,</p>

                <p>The pattern of blindness in India has changed a lot in the last 4-5 decades. The smallpox has been completely eradicated. Ophthalmia neonatorum, interstitial keratitis and tabes optic atrophy are no longer prevalent. Trachoma blindness is on the decline. However, the blindness from cataract has increased due to the increased longevity of the population. As the diabetics are living longer, the blindness due to diabetic retinopathy is also increasing.</p>

                <p>Rapid industrialization may cause blindness by specific diseases such as poisoning by lead and benzene derivatives in glass and iron workers, cataract and miner's nystagmus. Factory accidents and injury by foreign body can be prevented by appropriated guards, screens and goggles. There are frequent episodes of blindness seen nowadays due to liquor (methanol) poisoning. The iatrogenic blindness is also increasing due to the indiscriminate use of the sulphonamides, ethambutol, chloroquine, oral contraceptives, etc.</p>

                <h2>Prevention of Blindness</h2>
                
                <p>The concept of avoidable blindness, i.e. preventable or curable blindness has gained increasing recognition during recent years.</p>

                <p>The government of India has launched the National Programme for Control of Blindness in the year 1976. The ultimate aim of the national programme is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To reduce blindness in the country from 1.49 to 0.3 per cent by 2000 AD.</li>
                    <li>To provide comprehensive eye care through primary, secondary and tertiary level health care.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>At the apex, a National Institute of Ophthalmology (Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi) has been established for training personnels, research and referral services. The primary health centre, district hospital (secondary) and medical colleges (tertiary) are upgraded to render better and advanced eye health care and manpower development. The mobile eye units are extremely useful in arranging eye camps for cataract operations in remote areas with the cooperation of local voluntary organisation. The establishment of eye banks is of great value in corneal grafting.</p>

                <p>Blindness can be prevented by the following principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Eye health education through mass communication media</li>
                    <li>Improving nutrition and preventing dietery vitamin A deficiency.</li>
                    <li>Treating and controlling the organisms which cause ocular infection.</li>
                    <li>Improving safety conditions on roads, factories and at home.</li>
                    <li>Training and rehabilitation of visually handicapped.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Eye health education is done through mass communication media, e.g. television, radio, film, books, etc. teachers, social workers, community leaders, mobile eye unit, medical and paramedical staff.</p>

                <p>The school eye health services are helpful in health education. The students should be taught to follow the hygiene of vision, i.e. good posture, proper lighting, avoidance of glare, proper distance and angle between the book and the eye.</p>

                <p>Vitamin A prophylaxis can be achieved by vitamin A distribution scheme in India whereby 200,000 IU of vitamin A are given orally at 6 monthly intervals between the ages 1-6 years.</p>

                <h2>NUTRITIONAL BLINDNESS: VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY</h2>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-475.jpg" alt="Chart showing progression of vitamin A deficiency from night blindness to keratomalacia">
                    <figcaption>NUTRITIONAL BLINDNESS: VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>Vitamin A deficiency along with protein energy malnutrition (PEM) results in corneal blindness. Most of the time, vitamin A deficiency is precipitated by PEM and other diseases which precipitate malnutrition (e.g. measles, diarrhoea, or other acute illnesses in children). Together this blindness is termed as 'nutritional blindness', though the main factor is vitamin A deficiency.</p>

                <p>Vitamin A deficiency is a systemic disease that affects cells and organs throughout the body. The resultant changes in epithelial architecture are termed as "keratinizing metaplasia". The characteristic ocular manifestations of vitamin A deficiency ranging from night blindness to corneal softening are termed as 'xerophthalmia' or 'dry eye'.</p>

                <p><strong>Night blindness:</strong> It is usually the earliest manifestation of vitamin A deficiency. Night blindness responds rapidly (within 24-48 hours) to vitamin A therapy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Conjunctival xerosis and Bitot's spot:</strong> The conjunctival epithelium in vitamin A deficiency is transformed from normal columnar to stratified squamous cells with a resultant loss of goblet cells, formation of a granular cell layer and keratinization of the surface.</p>

                <p>Conjunctival xerosis first appears at the temporal side as an isolated oval or triangular patch near the limbus in the inter palpebral fissure. It is almost always present in both eyes. In some cases keratin and saprophytic bacilli accumulate on the xerotic surface, giving it a foamy or cheesy appearance. These lesions are known as Bitot's spots.</p>

                <p><strong>Corneal xerosis:</strong> A hazy, lustreless dry appearance of the cornea is first seen near the inferior limbus. Thick keratinized plaques may form on the corneal surface and are often more dense in the interpalbebral zone.</p>

                <p><strong>Corneal ulceration/ Keratomalacia:</strong> They indicate permanent destruction of a part or full thickness of corneal stroma, resulting in permanent structural alteration.</p>

                <p>An emergency vitamin A therapy may still save the child's eye to some extent.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Xerophthalmic scar:</strong> They are usually bilateral and indicate healed sequelae of prior corneal involvement related to vitamin A deficiency. They include nebula, macula, leucoma, adherent leucoma, anterior staphyloma or phthisis bulbi.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Xerophthalmic fundus (Uyemura's fundus):</strong> Small white lesions may be seen on retina in some cases of vitamin A deficiency. They may be associated with constriction of the visual fields.</p>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>Xerophthalmia is a medical emergency as it carries a high-risk of corneal blindness. Principle of treatment:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Immediate administration of massive doses of vitamin A.</li>
                    <li>Treatment of underlying systemic illness and protein energy malnutrition.</li>
                    <li>Prevention of any recurrence.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment Schedule for Xerophthalmia</h3>
                <h4>Vitamin A: (WHO recommendation)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Immediately upon diagnosis: 200,000 IU vitamin A is given orally.</li>
                    <li>Next day: 200,000 IU vitamin A orally.</li>
                    <li>Within 1-4 weeks: 200,000 IU vitamin A orally.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Children 6-11 months old or less than 8 kg = half the above dose</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-476.jpg" alt="Image showing Bitot's spot on conjunctiva">
                    <figcaption>Bitot's spot</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <ul>
                    <li>Children less then 6 months old = one-quarter of the above dose.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Oral administration is preferred, as it is safe, cheap and highly effective even in presence of mild diarrhoea (as it is also helpful for intestinal epithelium).</p>
                
                <p>Intramuscular injection of vitamin A (water-soluble) 100,000 IU is usually given when:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The children cannot swallow</li>
                    <li>In case of persistent vomiting</li>
                    <li>In severe malabsorption</li>
                    <li>Where the compliance is poor.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Diet and medical care:</strong> Proper treatment includes rehydration, frequent feeding with easily digestible and protein-rich food and general supportive care. Recurrent illnesses, e.g. respiratory infection, diarrhoea, and worm infestation should also be treated.</p>

                <p><strong>Eye care:</strong> In case of corneal involvement:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Broad-spectrum antibiotic eyedrops and ointment.</li>
                    <li>Atropine ointment.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Vitamin A Prophylaxis</h3>
                <p>It can be done by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Increasing the dietary intake of foods rich in vitamin A and provitamin A.</li>
                    <li>Periodic administration of large doses of vitamin A.</li>
                    <li>Administration of fortified commonly consumed food items (vitamin A fortification).</li>
                    <li>Prophylaxis: Vitamin A is given to expecting and nursing mothers. All infants should be breastfed from the first day of birth. The schedule for children is as follows:</li>

                <h2>REHABILITATION OF THE INCURABLE BLINDS</h2>
                
                <p>The incurable blind persons need rehabilitation in a special way so that they can earn their livelihood and live as useful citizens. Rehabilitation can be done by the following methods:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Braille system of education:</strong> This system was invented by Louis Braille a 16-year-old blind French. It is a system of teaching for the blind. The Braille characters are made up of raised dots arranged in 2 columns of three. There are several blind schools where facilities for Braille system of education is available. Partially blind persons may use large print books.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Low vision aids:</strong> The term 'low-vision' denotes visual acuity between 3/60 and 6/24. The visually handicapped people can achieve improved useful vision by several special aids specially designed for near vision. The low vision aids are based on the principle of simple magnification.
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Ordinary magnifying lens: It is a biconvex, circular lens.</li>
                            <li>b. Rectangular magnifying lens: It is more useful for reading.</li>
                            <li>c. Stand magnifier: The size of retinal image is relatively constant.</li>
                            <li>d. Binocular magnifier (Head-band loupe): It requires the incorporation of base in prisms.</li>
                            <li>e. Stepped lens (Fresnel lens): It consists of a plastic sheet with concentric ridges (series of prisms). It is thin and devoid of aberrations.</li>
                            <li>f. Spectacle-born visual aid: Single or multiple lens units, both microscopic and telescopic devices can be built into spectacle frames.</li>
                            <li>g. Jeweller's or watchmaker's loupe: It provides magnified but monocular vision.</li>
                            <li>h. Telescopic (Galilean) system: It provides binocular correction with large field and greater depth. It is a very useful low vision aid.</li>
                            <li>i. Computer added devices like closed circuit televisions, CDs and DVDs for education.</li>
                            <li>j. Non-optical devices like special lamps and large print materials.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Blind people can be trained to move about with the help of a stick, perform household work and look after themselves independently, i.e. without anybody's help and by using a cane.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Vocational rehabilitation:</strong> Blind persons can be trained in making handicrafts, cane binding, book binding, candle and chalk making, cottage industries and as telephone operators. The blind workers are in no ways inferior to the sighted persons, as far as skill is concerned. They need encouragement and job opportunities rather than pity.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Reservation of jobs:</strong> The job opportunities should be made available to blind persons in various institutions.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In conclusion, blindness is a worldwide problem. It is preventable and curable in most of the cases—if only existing knowledge and technology could be systematically applied. It needs a conscious and constant effort from the individuals and the society.</p>
