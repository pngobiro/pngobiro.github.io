                <h2>APPLIED ANATOMY</h2>
                
                <p>Cornea is a clear transparent and elliptical structure with a smooth shining surface. The average diameter is 11-12 mm (horizontal = 12 mm, vertical = 11 mm). The thickness of the central part is 0.52 mm and the peripheral part is 0.67 mm. The central one-third is known as the optical zone. Refractive index of cornea is 1.37. The dioptric power of the cornea is approximately +43 to +45 D.</p>

                <h3>Structure</h3>
                
                <p>The cornea consists of five layers namely:</p>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>The epithelium</strong> - Stratified squamous type of epithelium consists of three cell types namely the basal columnar cells, two or three layers of wing cells and surface cells. It is normally replaced within 7 days when damaged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bowman's membrane</strong> - It is made up of collagen fibrils. It does not regenerate when damaged. This results in the formation of permanent corneal opacity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Substantia propria or stroma</strong> - It forms 90% of corneal thickness. It consists of keratocytes, regularly arranged collagen fibrils and ground substance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Descemet's membrane</strong> - It is a thin but strong homogeneous elastic membrane which can regenerate.</li>
                    <li><strong>The endothelium</strong> - It is a single layer of flattened hexagonal cells. The cell density is about 3000 cells mm² at birth which decreases with advancing age. Corneal decompensation occurs only when more than 75% cells are damaged. It is measured by specular microscopy.</li>
                </ol>

                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-117.jpg" alt="Cross-sectional anatomy of the cornea showing the five distinct layers">
                </figure>

                <h3>Nutrition of the Cornea</h3>
                
                <p>Cornea is an avascular structure. It derives nutrition from:</p>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Perilimbal blood vessels</strong> - Anterior ciliary vessels invade the periphery of the cornea (limbus) for about 1 mm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aqueous humor</strong> - It supplies glucose and other nutrients by process of simple diffusion or active transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oxygen from atmospheric air</strong> - is derived directly through the tear film.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
                
                <p>The nerve supply is purely sensory. It is derived from the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve through the nasociliary branch.</p>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                
                <p>There are two primary functions of the cornea:</p>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li>It acts as a major refracting medium.</li>
                    <li>It protects the intraocular contents.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This is possible by maintaining corneal transparency and replacement of its tissues. Transparency is maintained by:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Regular arrangement of corneal lamellae (lattice theory of cornea)</li>
                    <li>Avascularity</li>
                    <li>Relative state of dehydration</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-120-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing three stages of corneal ulcer development">

                    <figcaption>Stages of corneal ulcer</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>There are three stages namely:</p>

                <h4>1. Progressive stage</h4>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>There is grey zone of infiltration by polymorphs.</li>
                    <li>Localised necrosis and sloughing of sequestrum is present.</li>
                    <li>Saucer-shaped ulcer with overhanging edges due to oedema is characteristic.</li>
                </ul>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-120-2.jpg" alt="Progressive stage of corneal ulcer showing characteristic saucer shape">
                </figure>

                <h4>2. Regressive stage</h4>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>The dead material is thrown off and the oedema subsides.</li>
                    <li>The floor and edges of the ulcer are smooth and transparent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Healing stage</h4>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Minute superficial vessels grow in from the limbus near the ulcer.</li>
                    <li>There is formation of fibrous tissue which fills the gap. The irregular arrangement of fibrous tissue results in opacity, as the new fibres refract the light irregularly. As Bowman's membrane never regenerates, permanent opacity remains if it is damaged.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Pain</strong> - Cornea is richly supplied by ophthalmic division of the 5th nerve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photophobia</strong> - There is undue sensitivity to light.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impairment of visual acuity</strong> occurs due to corneal opacity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lacrimation</strong> - There is excessive reflex tear production.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Signs</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Blepharospasm</strong> - There is tight closure of the eyelids specially in children.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corneal opacification</strong> occurs due to infiltration and oedema.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ciliary congestion</strong> with conjunctival hyperaemia is present.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypopyon</strong> or pus in the anterior chamber may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Staining of the cornea by fluorescein stain</strong>:
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Superficial staining</strong> - It stains the margin of the ulcer bright brilliant green.
                                <p><em>Method</em> - A drop of fluorescein is instilled in the conjunctival sac. Alternatively, disposable strip of fluorescein stain may be used. After few seconds, excess dye is washed off with normal saline.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Deep staining</strong> - It stains the stromal infiltration defect grass green and the endothelium yellow in colour respectively.
                                <p><em>Method</em> - After instillation of fluorescein dye in the conjunctival sac, the lids are kept closed for about 5 minutes. Excess dye is washed off with normal saline.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Slit-lamp examination</strong> shows irregular margins of the ulcer and details of anterior segment of the eye.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Complications</h3>

                <h4>1. Corneal Opacity</h4>
                
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Nebula</strong> - If the corneal scar involves Bowman's membrane and superficial layers of stroma, the resulting opacity is slight. It is so very faint that the finer details of iris are clearly visible through the opacity.
                        <p>A thin diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than localized dense leucoma not covering the whole pupillary area.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Macula</strong> - The corneal opacity is dense when it involves about half the thickness of the stroma. The fine details of the deeper structures are observed partially.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leucoma</strong> - A thick white, dense and totally opaque scar results when almost full thickness of stroma is involved. Nothing can be seen through the leucoma.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Ectatic Cicatrix [Keratectasia]</h4>
                <p><em>(ectasia = bulge forwards, cicatrix = fibrous scar)</em></p>
                
                <p>There is marked thinning at the site of ulcer. It bulges forwards even in the presence of normal intraocular pressure. There is no iris adhesion to the cornea. The cicatrix may become consolidated and flat later on.</p>

                <h4>3. Descemetocele [Keratocele]</h4>
                
                <p>Few ulcers specially those due to pneumococcus and septic organisms extend rapidly. Descemet's membrane offers great resistance but eventually it may herniate as a transparent vesicle called the descemetocele. It may persist surrounded by white cicatricial ring or it may rupture.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_cbb8079e8e68b544f815g-127-1.jpg" alt="Descemetocele formation showing herniation of Descemet's membrane">

                </figure>

                <h4>4. Perforation</h4>
                
                <p><strong>Etiology</strong> - Sudden strain due to cough, sneeze or spasm of orbicularis muscle may cause perforation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Course</strong> - The aqueous gushes out resulting in the collapse of anterior chamber (IOP = zero). There is forward displacement of iris-lens diaphragm. The only benefit is that the nutrition of the cornea improves, pain is relieved and scarring takes place.</p>

                <h4>Complications of Perforation</h4>
                
                <p>These are of extreme danger to the sight.</p>

                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Prolapse of iris</strong> - When part of iris protrudes through the ulcer it is known as prolapse of iris.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anterior synechia</strong> - The adhesion of iris to the posterior surface of cornea is known as the anterior synechia. There is no incarceration of iris within the layers of the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adherent leucoma</strong> - It is a leucomatous opacity in which the iris tissue is incarcerated within the layers of the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anterior staphyloma</strong> - The adherent leucoma becomes ectatic due to secondary glaucoma or weakness of corneal scar tissue. The ectatic cicatrix in which iris is incarcerated is called anterior staphyloma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corneal fistula</strong> - The ulcer ruptures repeatedly due to straining factors. The opening in the cornea is lined by the epithelium therefore it does not heal leading to fistula formation. The aqueous leaks continuously through the corneal fistula. It is usually situated in the centre.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anterior capsular cataract</strong> - It is formed when the lens comes in contact with the ulcer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dislocation or subluxation of lens</strong> occurs due to stretching and rupture of zonule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intraocular haemorrhage</strong> - Sudden lowering of intraocular pressure results in dilatation and rupture of choroidal blood vessels leading to intraocular haemorrhage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purulent iridocyclitis and panophthalmitis</strong> usually occurs in gonococcal infection and hypopyon ulcers.</li>

                <h2>TREATMENT OF CORNEAL ULCER</h2>

                <h3>Principles</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Control of infection</strong> - Infection is controlled by intensive local use of antibiotic drops. Broad-spectrum antibiotic drops, ointment, are given frequently 4-6 times a day. Subconjunctival injections may also be given once or twice daily. Culture and sensitivity should be done before the application of antibiotics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleanliness</strong> - Irrigation with warm saline or soda bicarbonate lotion is advised. It washes away necrotic material, toxin, secretion and pathogenic organisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat</strong> - Heat prevents stasis and encourages repair of the ulcer. Hot fomentation may be given.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest</strong>:
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>1% atropine either as drops or ointment is applied 2-3 times a day. It paralyses the ciliary muscles and provides comfort to the eye by preventing ciliary spasm.</li>
                            <li>Pad and bandage give rest to the eyeball by restricting its movements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Protection</strong>:
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>Pad and bandage protect the eye from dust, wind and harmful external agencies.</li>
                            <li>A shield or dark glasses are used if there is associated conjunctival discharge.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                
                <p>Bacterial corneal ulcer is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment by identification and eradication of causative organism.</p>

                <p>Causative organism can be identified by smear preparation, culture and sensitivity test of the scrapings taken from the base of the ulcer. However, treatment cannot be delayed for the report to be available. It should be started immediately with broad spectrum antibiotics available.</p>

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Gram-positive bacteria</strong> usually responds to chloramphenicol, cephazoline, ciprofloxacin and penicillin, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gram-negative bacteria</strong> usually responds to gentamicin, tobramycin, norfloxacin, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1. Broad spectrum antibiotics</h4>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Topical antibiotic drops</strong> are instilled at half hourly interval in initial stages. Later on frequency can be reduced depending upon the response. Nowadays topical fortified preparations are preferred choice over commercially available antibiotic drops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Antibiotic eye ointment</strong> should be applied at night as it has prolonged action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subconjunctival injection</strong> of gentamicin 40 mg and cephazoline 125 mg once a day for 5 days should also be given in moderate to severe cases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Systemic antibiotics</strong> are usually not required except in fulminating cases with perforation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Atropine sulphate (1%) drops or ointment</h4>
                <p>Should be used to reduce pain from ciliary spasm and to prevent formation of posterior synaechiae from secondary iridocyclitis.</p>

                <h4>3. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs</h4>
                <p>Systemic analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs may be added to relieve pain and oedema.</p>

                <h4>4. General measures</h4>
                <p>Rest, hot fomentation or dry heat, good diet and fresh air helps in faster healing.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box danger">
                    <h4>IMPORTANT NOTE:</h4>
                    <p><strong>IN GENERAL CORTICOSTEROIDS ARE CONTRAINDICATED IN THE TREATMENT OF CORNEAL ULCER.</strong></p>
                    <p>Corticosteroids are not given in routine cases of corneal ulcer as they inhibit healing by fibrosis and also retard epithelialisation. However, if the reaction is very severe, steroids can be administered with caution for a short period under cover of antibiotics.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>TREATMENT OF NON-HEALING CORNEAL ULCER</h3>
                
                <p>In spite of all the above mentioned measures ulceration progresses and pain continues. A non-healing corneal ulcer does not respond to routine treatment for corneal ulcer due to following causes:</p>

                <h4>1. Local causes</h4>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Chronic dacryocystitis</strong> - It is a continuous source of pathogenic bacterial infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased intraocular pressure</strong> - It adversely affects the nutrition of the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trichiasis</strong> - There is constant rubbing of the eyelashes against the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retained foreign body</strong> - It is a source of constant irritation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neuroparalytic ulcers</strong> - There is complete loss of sensation in the cornea.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. General causes</h4>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> - It reduces the resistance of the body against infections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitamin A deficiency</strong> - It leads to xerosis and keratomalacia, thus, decreasing the resistance of the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malnutrition</strong> - This results in delayed healing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immunosuppressive drugs and AIDS</strong> - There is decreased body resistance to infection.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                
                <p>Non-healing corneal ulcer can be treated by:</p>
                
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Cauterization</strong> - The chemical cautery acts as an antiseptic.
                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li>Pure carbolic acid - It acts both as an antiseptic and caustic.</li>
                            <li>Trichloroacetic acid 10-20%</li>
                            <li>Silver nitrate 1% - It is a mild antiseptic.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Paracentesis</strong> - Aqueous is released slowly by making an opening in the lower temporal quadrant of cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conjunctival flap</strong> - The non-healing ulcer may be covered with the conjunctival flap.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapeutic keratoplasty</strong> - Full thickness graft is applied to enhance healing and to prevent perforation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tarsorrhaphy</strong> - It is done in cases of neuroparalytic ulcers and exposure keratitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Treat the underlying cause</strong> which is responsible for non-healing ulcer.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>TREATMENT OF IMPENDING PERFORATION (DESCEMETOCELE)</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Rest</strong> - Preferably bed-rest is advised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure pad and bandage</strong> - By applying extra pad and tight bandage over the eye, support is given to the cornea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intraocular pressure is kept low</strong> by giving oral acetazolamide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Paracentesis</strong> may be done to prevent central perforation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Straining factors are avoided</strong>, e.g. coughing, sneezing or straining at passing stool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapeutic full thickness or penetrating keratoplasty</strong> is done as the last resort.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>TREATMENT OF CORNEAL ABSCESS</h3>
                
                <p>There is a localised collection of pus in the corneal stroma. The epithelium is usually intact and therefore the fluorescein staining is negative. The clinical features are similar to corneal ulcer.</p>

                <h4>Treatment</h4>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Evacuation of pus</strong> is done first by a sterile autoclaved fine needle or knife before starting the topical antibiotic treatment as for corneal ulcer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cauterization</strong> done by chemical (carbolic acid) cautery is also effective.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>TREATMENT OF PERFORATED CORNEAL ULCER</h3>

                <h4>1. Immediate treatment</h4>
                <p>It depends on the site and size of perforation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>If perforation is small in the pupillary area and there is no prolapse of iris:</strong></p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Rest in bed is advised.</li>
                    <li>Atropine and antibiotic ointment are applied.</li>
                    <li>Pressure pad and bandage helps in sealing perforation.</li>
                    <li>Tissue adhesives, e.g. isobutyl cyanoacrylate may be used.</li>
                    <li>Soft contact lens helps in the healing process.</li>
                    <li>Conjunctival flap covers the perforation site and aids healing.</li>
                    <li>Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty may be done as a final resort.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Leucoma</h5>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Optical iridectomy</strong> - The pupil is extended to the periphery by a slit-like iridectomy. It is indicated when the vision is quite good and where facilities for keratoplasty are not available.

                        <ul class="feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Temporal</strong> - When greater field of vision is required, e.g. farmers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nasal</strong> - For near work, e.g., clerk, goldsmith.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Full thickness keratoplasty</strong> is preferred treatment when the ulcer has healed and the vision is markedly reduced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tattooing with gold (brown) or platinum (black)</strong> is advised for cosmetic purpose only in firm blind eyes usually.</li>

                <h5>Adherent leucoma</h5>
                <p>The treatment is same as for leucoma. In addition, synechiotomy is done, i.e. adhesion of the iris is separated by iris repositor to break the peripheral anterior synechiae. This prevents the occurrence of secondary glaucoma.</p>

                <h5>Corneal fistula</h5>
                <p>Full thickness keratoplasty is indicated as the fistulous tract is lined by the epithelium which prevents healing.</p>

                <h2>HYPOPYON ULCER</h2>
                
                <p>Hypopyon ulcer is a corneal ulcer associated with hypopyon, i.e., sterile pus in the anterior chamber, as a result of iridocyclitis. It is important to note that hypopyon is sterile as the leucocytosis is due to the toxins and not by actual invasion of the bacteria.</p>
                
                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <p>It depends on two main factors:</p>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Virulence of the infecting organism</strong> - Pyogenic organisms, e.g. Pneumococcus, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Gonococcus, Moraxella, fungus, etc. may produce hypopyon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistance of the host</strong> - It is commonly seen in old, debilitated, alcoholic, malnourished and immunologically deficient persons. It may occur during or after acute infectious diseases, e.g. measles, scarlet fever or chickenpox.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Predisposing Factors</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li>Chronic dacryocystitis is a continuous source of infection particularly of Pseudomonas pyocyanea and pneumococcus bacteria.</li>
                    <li>Minor injury, e.g. scratches with the nail.</li>
                    <li>Retained minute foreign bodies such as stone, coal, etc.</li>
                    <li>Old, debilitated and alcoholic patients usually suffer from malnourishment.</li>
                    <li>Acute infections such as measles, scarlet fever, etc. occurring commonly in children.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li>In case of a corneal ulcer there is always associated iridocyclitis due to the liberation of toxins by the bacteria, which diffuses into the anterior chamber via the endothelium.</li>
                    <li>This results in dilatation of the blood vessels and outpouring of leucocytes which become enmeshed in the fibrin network. Such hypopyons are fluid and change their position with gravity when the patient's head is changed.</li>
                    <li>These gravitate to the bottom of anterior chamber. It may fill half of the anterior chamber, having straight upper margin. In severe cases, it may completely fill the anterior chamber thus obscuring the iris.</li>
                    <li>The hypopyon is sterile and it usually gets absorbed when hypopyon corneal ulcer is adequately treated with routine treatment for corneal ulcer.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>It varies in type according to the infective agent and age of the patient:</p>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li>Ulcus serpens.</li>

                <p>It is the most common type of hypopyon ulcer. It occurs in adults due to pneumococcus bacteria usually.</p>
                <p>It has a tendency to creep over the cornea in a serpiginous fashion.</p>

                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li>Perforation with iris prolapse may occur due to thinning of cornea.</li>

                    <li>Perforation may heal resulting in leucoma, adherent leucoma, anterior staphyloma or occlusiopupillae causing marked visual impairment.</li>
                    <li>Secondary glaucoma usually follows perforation due to synechia formation.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <p>It is a well-known surgical rule that pus anywhere in the body has to be removed. However, this is not true in case of hypopyon ulcer. The fact that the hypopyon is sterile has great practical importance. When the ulcer is treated properly, the hypopyon gets absorbed automatically.</p>
                
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Early and intensive treatment of corneal ulcer</strong> as mentioned earlier is started at once after culture and sensitivity:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Broad-spectrum antibiotic drops are instilled every few minutes for the first hour. Later it is instilled hourly and then 2 hourly.</li>
                            <li>Topical atropine is applied even if the tension is raised.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotic and atropine eye ointment are applied at bedtime.</li>
                            <li>Subconjunctival injection of antibiotic and atropine may be given.</li>
                            <li>Cauterization if done skillfully may be helpful.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary glaucoma</strong> is the most common cause of failure of treatment in elderly persons. It affects the nutrition and resistance of the cornea. It is treated by:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Topical atropine 1%</li>

                            <li>Intravenous mannitol 20%, 200 ml (hyperosmotic agent)</li>
                            <li>Paracentesis helps in lowering the tension and brings fresh aqueous and nutrient. It is done only in cases of markedly raised intraocular tension.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Scraping and debridement of the ulcer is useful in drug penetration.</li>

                <p>Antifungal drugs-The role of these drugs is limited due to the few approved antifungal drugs and their poor penetration. Topical antifungals are to be instilled for a long-time, as the response is often delayed.</p>

                    <li>Nystatin eye ointment is applied 5 times daily. It is only effective against Candida and is less potent.</li>
                    <li>Topical amphoterecin B (0.25%) is instilled 1 hourly. It is effective against Aspergillus and Candida.</li>

                <h5>b. Systemic</h5>
                <p>Systemic antifungals are indicated if the infection spreads to the sclera and there is impending perforation, e.g. oral ketoconazole or fluconazole 200 mg daily may be given for 2-3 weeks.</p>
                
                <p>Cycloplegics such as atropine is used to prevent posterior synechiae formation and to control iritis by paralysing the ciliary muscle. It also causes vasodilatation.</p>

                    <li>Conjunctival flap is useful in non-healing fungal ulcers.</li>
                    <li>Therapeutic full-thickness keratoplasty is much better solution in cases of non-healing fungal keratitis. Corneal graft is indicated for corneal opacity.</li>

                <h2>KERATOPLASTY (Corneal Transplant or Graft)</h2>
                
                <h3>Types</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Penetrating (full-thickness) keratoplasty</strong> - Full thickness corneal transplant</li>
                    <li><strong>Lamellar (partial-thickness) keratoplasty</strong> - Partial thickness corneal transplant</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Indications</h3>
                <ol class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Optical</strong> - Central corneal opacity (leucoma, macula, nebula) results in marked diminution of vision. Other causes include pseudophakic or aphakic bullous keratopathy, regraft due to graft failure, Fuch's and other corneal dystrophies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapeutic</strong> - Bacterial, fungal and viral infection not responding to standard treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural</strong> - To restore corneal anatomy, e.g. Descemetocele, fistula, after pterygium and dermoid excision, keratoconus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmetic</strong> - It is a relatively rare indication.</li>
