                <h3>The Optic Nerve</h3>
                <p>It extends from the lamina cribrosa upto the optic chiasma.</p>
                <p>The fibres of the optic nerve originate from the nerve fibre layer of the retina. All the retinal fibres converge to form the optic nerve about 5 mm to the nasal side of the macula lutea. The nerve pierces the lamina cribrosa to pass backwards and medially through the orbital cavity. It then passes through the optic foramen of the sphenoid bone, backwards and medially to meet the nerve from the other eye at the optic chiasma.</p>

                <p>The optic nerve is covered with the meningeal sheaths, i.e. the pia mater, arachnoid mater and dura mater after it pierces the lamina cribrosa. These meningeal spaces are continuous with those in the brain.</p>

                <p>The total length of the optic nerve is 5 cm. It can be divided into four parts:</p>

                <h3>Optic Disc</h3>
                <p>It represents the optic nerve head. It has only nerve fibre layer so it does not excite any visual response—"blind spot". It is a pink, oval or circular disc of 1.5 mm diameter. There is a depression in its central part which is known as the "physiological cup". It occupies the central one-third of the optic disc. Therefore, the normal cup: disc ratio is 1:3 or 0.3.</p>

                <h2>PAPILLOEDEMA (CHOKED DISC)</h2>
                
                <p>It is a hydrostatic, non-inflammatory oedema of the optic disc. The optic disc swelling usually results from increased intracranial pressure and venous stasis.</p>

                <h3>Etiology</h3>
                <h4>1. Increased intracranial pressure</h4>
                <p>It is the most common cause of bilateral papilloedema. It may be associated with the following conditions:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Intracranial space occupying lesions</strong>—These include space occupying lesions specially in the midbrain, parieto-occipital region and cerebellum. It may be a brain tumour, abscess, aneurysm, subdural haematoma hydrocephalus, etc. The tumour of cerebellum, midbrain and parieto-occipital region produce papilloedema more rapidly than the lesions involving other areas. The fast progressing lesions produce papilloedema more frequently and acutely than the slow growing lesions.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Foster-Kennedy syndrome</strong>—The frontal lobe, pituitary and middle-ear tumours such as meningiomata of the olfactory groove are sometimes associated with,</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Pressure atrophy of the optic nerve on the side of the lesion due to direct pressure.</li>
                    <li>Papilloedema on the other side due to the effect of generalized raised intracranial pressure.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol type="a" start="2">
                    <li><strong>Systemic conditions</strong> include malignant hypertension, toxemia of pregnancy, cardiopulmonary insufficiency, blood dyscrasias and nephritis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage</strong> can give rise to a papilloedema which is frequent and considerable in extent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meningitis</strong>—It may be suppurative, syphilitic or tubercular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encephalitis, cerebral oedema and encephalopathies.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Pseudotumour cerebri</strong>—It is an important cause of raised intracranial pressure. It is a poorly understood condition, usually found in young obese women. It is characterised by chronic headache and bilateral papilloedema without any localising neurological signs.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>2. Orbit lesions</h4>
                <p>The orbital space occupying lesions are frequently associated with papilloedema on the involved side such as tumours, orbital abscess and cellulitis, aneurysm of ophthalmic artery, pseudotumour and endocrinal exophthalmos.</p>

                <h4>3. Ocular lesions</h4>
                <p>These include marked ocular hypotony, acutely raised intraocular pressure, central retinal vein occlusion, anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and uveitis.</p>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is due to venous stasis which results in the compression of the central retinal vein as it crosses the subdural and subarachnoid spaces.</li>
                    <li>There is vasodilatation at the disc due to hypoxia causing axoplasmic stasis.</li>
                    <li>The nerve fibres at the optic disc become swollen which degenerate later on.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Unilateral versus Bilateral Papilloedema</h3>
                <p>In majority of the cases with raised intracranial pressure, it is bilateral. Papilloedema due to ocular and orbital lesions is usually unilateral. However, unilateral cases as well as of unequal size do occur with raised intracranial pressure, e.g. Foster-Kennedy syndrome.</p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>General symptoms include headache which is made worse by coughing, sneezing or straining.</li>
                    <li>Projectile vomiting (without nausea) is suggestive of raised intracranial pressure.</li>
                    <li>There are transient attacks of blurred vision (amaurosis fugax).</li>
                    <li>Central vision is affected only in late stages.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                <p>There are inflammatory changes in the nerve (true optic neuritis) or in the sheath (perineuritis). There is infiltration and loss of myelin sheath. Finally, degenerative changes and reactionary gliosis occur.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Transient blurring of vision may be present initially.</li>
                    <li>Profound visual loss is the most important clinical feature.</li>

                                    <li>Retinal veins are tortuous and distorted.</li>
                                    <li>Exudates are present at the disc and retina.</li>
                                    <li>Vitreous is cloudy with fine opacities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Neuroretinitis</strong>—When the serious inflammation spreads from the disc towards the neighbouring retina, it is called neuroretinitis.</li>

                    <li><strong>Visual Field Defects</strong>—A generalized depression of the visual field is the most common of visual defect. Central, centrocaecal or paracentral scotoma may be present.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Treatment</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Efforts should be made to find out and treat the underlying cause of papillitis.</li>
                    <li>There is no effective treatment for idiopathic and hereditary optic neuritis and that associated with demyelinating disorders.</li>
                    <li>Corticosteroids may help in early recovery.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Optic neuritis treatment trial (ONTT) group has made the following recommendations for the use of corticosteroids.</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Oral prednisolone therapy alone is contraindicated in the treatment of acute optic neuritis, since it was not shown to improve visual outcome and recurrence rate is high with this regime.</li>
                    <li>A patient presenting with acute optic neuritis should have MRI scan of the brain. If the brain shows lesions supportive of multiple sclerosis, the patient should receive immediate intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gm daily) for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) for 11 days.</li>
                    <li>Indications for intravenous methylprednisolone in acute optic neuritis patients with a normal brain MRI scan are:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis</li>

                </ol>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li>Vitamin B₁, B₆ and B₁₂ injections are given in full doses. Hydroxycobalamine (B₁₂) acts as a detoxicating agent.</li>

                            <li>Temporal pallor of disc (due to involvement of papillomacular bundle) may be present occasionally.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Local pain on moving the eye</strong> is often present. There is tenderness over the attachment of the superior rectus muscle tendon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marcus Gunn pupil</strong>—There is lack of sustained constriction of the pupil to light in swinging flashlight test. It indicates an afferent pupillary defect. It is a diagnostic sign. <strong>Swinging flashlight test</strong>—A bright light is thrown on to one pupil and its constriction is noted. The light is rapidly transferred to the other pupil after 2-3 seconds. This process of swinging of light to and fro across the pupils is repeated several times so that there are equal impulses sent to the midbrain via the optic nerves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Field of vision</strong>—Central, paracentral, sectorial scotomas or ring-shaped scotoma around fixation point may be present</li>
                    <li>Early loss of colour vision and contrast sensitivity may be present due to involvement of optic nerve.</li>

                <h3>Complications</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Recurrences are common specially in demyelinating diseases.</li>
                    <li>Complete blindness may occur eventually.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Malingering</strong>—It is seen in persons who hope to gain some advantage by pretending to be visually defective or handicapped. When one eye is said to be blind and there is absence of objective signs, following tests can be done.
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>A low convex or concave lens (0.25 D) is placed before the 'blind eye' and a high convex lens (+10 D) is kept before the good eye. If the person can read distant types he is malingering.</li>
                            <li>A prism is placed base downwards before the 'good eye' and the patient is asked to look at a light source. If he sees two lights, he is malingering.</li>
                            <li>Snellen's coloured types or FRIEND test—The letters are printed in green and red. A red glass is placed</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
