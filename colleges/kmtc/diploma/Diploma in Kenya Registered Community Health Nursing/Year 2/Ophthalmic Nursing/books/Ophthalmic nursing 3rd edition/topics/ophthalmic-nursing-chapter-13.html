                        <p>Both eyes must move together in a co-ordinated manner. In order for this to occur each
                            extra-ocular muscle is paired with a muscle in the opposite eye. These pairs of muscles are
                            known as synergistic or 'yoke' muscles. For example, to look to the right, the right eye
                            looks outwards, i.e. abducts, while the left eye looks inwards, i.e. adducts. The right
                            lateral rectus muscle abducts the right eye, while the left medial rectus muscle adducts the
                            left eye. These two muscles work together to cause the eyes to look to the right.</p>
                        <p>The right lateral rectus muscle and the left medial rectus muscle are therefore yoke muscles.

                        <p>To look directly upwards and downwards, two pairs of yoke muscles are required to contract.
                            In the other positions, only one pair of yoke muscles is needed.</p>
                        <p>The nine positions of gaze, and yoke muscles needed are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Straight ahead: the primary position of gaze when all the muscles are contracting to
                                maintain the eye in this position.</li>
                            <li>Upwards to the right: right superior rectus; left inferior oblique.</li>
                            <li>To the right: right lateral rectus; left medial rectus.</li>
                            <li>Downwards to the right: right inferior rectus; left superior oblique.</li>

                            <li>Direct elevation: right superior rectus; left inferior oblique and left superior rectus;
                                right inferior oblique.</li>
                            <li>Direct depression: right inferior rectus; left superior oblique and left inferior

                        </ol>
                        <p><b>Convergence</b> is the position of the eyes when looking at something close. In this case
                            both medial recti contract to turn the eye inwards.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Antagonist muscles</h3>
                        <p>When each muscle in the eye contracts, in order for the eye to move the antagonist or
                            opposite muscle in the same eye must relax to allow the first muscle to work; for example,
                            to look to the right, the right lateral rectus contracts and the right medial rectus must
                            relax. In the left eye, the left medial rectus contracts while the left lateral rectus
                            relaxes.</p>

                        <p>Strabismus or squint is a deviation of one or either eye in an inward, outward, upward or
                            downward direction (Fig. 13.2). There are many types of squint. Only the most common will be
                            described here. Orthoptists are highly trained to diagnose which muscle is involved and to
                            treat the deviation in conjunction with ophthalmologists.</p>

                        <p>A squint causes diplopia. In a child under eight years of age, this double vision can be
                            suppressed but an adult is unable to do this so the diplopia persists. The child suppresses
                            the vision in the squinting eye so he no longer sees double, which is more comfortable for
                            him. Until the age of eight, the visual process has not matured and if an eye is not used
                            for any reason it may lose its ability to see. This results in reduced visual acuity, a
                            condition called amblyopia. Because the visual system is not mature until the age of eight,
                            reduced vision can be improved with treatment up to this age. Thereafter loss of visual
                            acuity due to amblyopia will not improve. Therefore it is important that squint and any
                            resulting amblyopia are diagnosed before the age of eight years. This applies to all
                            squints, whether manifest or latent. School eye tests are important to pick up poor vision
                            before it is too late for treatment to be of help.</p>
                        <p>Normal vision with both eyes in use is termed binocular single vision. The images from both
                            eyes together are seen as one visual impression by means of the fusion faculty. The aim of
                            treatment for squint is to restore binocular single vision and prevent or reverse amblyopia.

                        <p>Squints are either non-paralytic or paralytic.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Non-paralytic squint</h3>
                        <p>Non-paralytic squint is the squint of childhood and is sometimes called a concomitant squint.
                            It can be manifest or latent, convergent or divergent, alternating or non-alternating
                            (unilateral):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A manifest squint is where one or other eye deviates from the primary or straight ahead
                                position. It can often be an obvious squint to the observer.</li>
                            <li>A latent squint is where there is a tendency for both eyes to deviate and this is not
                                usually observed unless symptoms such as headaches or diplopia have occurred, in which
                                case the latent squint may have become manifest.</li>
                            <li>A convergent squint is a squint in which one eye turns inwards.</li>
                            <li>A divergent squint is a squint in which one eye turns outwards.</li>
                            <li>An alternating squint is a squint in which the eyes deviate alternately, whereas it is
                                always the same eye which deviates in a non-alternating squint.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes</h4>
                        <p>A non-paralytic squint occurs because there may be obstacles to the correct formation of the
                            image falling on one retina. In other words, there is an obstruction to clear vision in the
                            visual media which results in loss of binocular single vision.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Uncorrected refractive error</h5>
                        <p>Uncorrected refractive error is the commonest cause of squint in childhood. The most usual
                            squint is convergent, the commonest cause being hypermetropia, which causes
                            over-accommodation and therefore over-convergence. In contrast to this, myopia can
                            predispose to a tendency to divergence, because the eyes are already in focus to near vision
                            without the aid of accommodation, convergence is not stimulated and divergence may result.
                            Anisometropia (a different refraction in each eye) causes unequally clear images, which can
                            lead to a squint.</p>
                        <p>The usual pattern of events to occur (if the onset of squint is under the age of eight years)
                            is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>squint leads to loss of binocular single vision</li>
                            <li>loss of binocular single vision results in diplopia</li>
                            <li>diplopia is overcome by suppression of one image</li>
                            <li>suppression leads to amblyopia (a reduction in visual acuity in one eye)</li>
                            <li>the passage of time leads to loss of binocular function (the two eyes being no longer
                                able to see one image together).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Amblyopia does not develop in an alternating squint as both eyes are used alternatively.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Prolonged eye inactivity</h5>
                        <p>Prolonged inactivity of one eye may be a dissociating factor and may enable the affected eye
                            to deviate through disuse:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Opacities in the media, i.e. cornea, lens, vitreous or retina, may cause squint. A
                                cataract or retinoblastoma may present as a squint.</li>
                            <li>Bandaging of one eye - for example following injury to the eye or a unilateral ptosis -
                                may also cause squint.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Examination</h4>
                        <h5>History</h5>
                        <p>A careful history must be taken and should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>family history</b> because there may be a hereditary factor</li>
                            <li><b>age at onset</b> which is an important factor in prognosis for reversing amblyopia
                                and restoring binocular single vision</li>
                            <li><b>nature of onset</b> - the onset of squint may occur in one or several of the
                                following ways:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>suddenly</b> - the squint occurs without any previous sign</li>
                                    <li><b>gradually</b> - the squint appears more and more frequently and possibly
                                        increasing in size over a period of time</li>
                                    <li><b>intermittently,</b> e.g. when tired, upset or unwell; the eye may be straight
                                        at other times</li>
                                    <li><b>constantly</b> - the squint is present all the time</li>
                                    <li>changing in size at different times of day</li>
                                    <li>when looking in a particular position of gaze or at a particular distance</li>
                                    <li>either eye may deviate alternatively or it may always be the same eye that
                                        deviates.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The onset may be associated with some systemic disease because the child is generally unwell.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Visual acuity</h5>
                        <p>Visual acuity will be recorded using the Snellen chart, Sheridan Gardiner test or other
                            tests. Selection of test will be determined by the age, intellectual ability of the patient
                            and their language.</p>
                        <h5>Determination of refractive error</h5>
                        <p>In children a cycloplegic drop such as G. Cyclopentolate $0.5\%$, by prescription or PGD, is
                            needed to prevent accommodation, which would give a false result on retinoscopy. A
                            retinoscope directs a light beam onto the retina and movement of the retinoscope produces
                            movement of the light beam across the retina in a particular direction. A lens is selected
                            and held in front of the eye while continuing to move the retinoscope. A change is noted in
                            the amount and direction of the movement of the light beam. Finally, the lens, which
                            actually neutralises or abolishes the movement of the light beam, determines the refractive
                            error.</p>
                        <h5>Physical examination</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The presence of the following features is noted:

                                    <li>epicanthus - if a child has broad epicanthic folds, it can give the appearance
                                        of a convergent squint but if the cover test is negative this is called a
                                        pseudo-squint</li>
                                    <li>ptosis or other feature leading to asymmetry of the palpebral apertures</li>
                                    <li>nystagmus</li>
                                    <li>an abnormal head posture, which could be compensating for squint</li>
                                    <li>unequal pupil sizes.</li>

                            <li>An inspection of the eyes is carried out:
                                <ul>

                        <p>A penlight is held approximately $1/3$ m from the child. The child must be looking at the
                            light whilst the cover test is carried out. It is important to repeat the cover test using a
                            detailed target, e.g. a small picture on a tongue depressor, because some squints are only
                            present when looking at detailed objects. The cover test should also be carried out at 6 m
                            where possible because other squints are only present when looking into the distance, i.e.
                            intermittent squints.</p>

                            becomes manifest when focusing on a detailed target. Therefore it is important to check the
                            corneal reflections and to carry out the cover test using a light and a detailed target.</p>
                        <p>An intermittent divergent squint may not be present for near but becomes manifest in the
                            distance. Therefore it is important to carry out a cover test for near and distance. The
                            cover test for a latent squint, or an alternate cover test, is where the occluder covers one
                            eye then the other. Observation of the eye that has just been covered is noted.</p>

                        <p>The examiner sits in front of the patient and using a pen torch, and a toy if appropriate,
                            observes both eyes moving in all eight positions of gaze. This will include up, down, both
                            sides and in all four corners, always returning to the straight ahead or primary position.
                            The patient's head must be held still. Any muscle imbalance, over actions and under actions
                            are then noted.</p>
                        <h5>Measuring the angle of deviation</h5>
                        <p>The angle of deviation can be measured using objective or subjective methods. Objective
                            methods are based on the observer neutralising the patient's deviation as it takes up
                            fixation. Subjective measurements are where the patient tells you the position of each image
                            from each eye on a calibrated scale of some sort.</p>
                        <p>The following methods include both objective and subjective measurements:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Prisms and cover test:</b> this is the most commonly used objective method of
                                measuring the angle of a manifest or a latent squint. The measurements are performed at
                                near ( $1/3$ m ), distance ( 6 m ) and occasionally beyond 6 m (far distance). Loose
                                prisms, or a prism bar, are introduced in front of the squinting eye in a manifest
                                squint, or in front of either eye in a latent squint, with the apex of the prism in the
                                direction of the deviation.</li>
                            <li><b>Major amblyoscope (synoptophore):</b> the angle of deviation can be measured both
                                objectively and subjectively. Slides are introduced and the measurement can be read from
                                the scales in degrees or prism dioptres.</li>
                            <li><b>Maddox rod and Maddox wing:</b> The Maddox rod is used in conjunction with a light at
                                6 m and measures small degrees of squint. The Maddox rod is made of a series of parallel
                                cylinders, red in colour, which convert a light image into a red line. This is placed
                                before one eye while the patient is fixing on a light at 6 m distance with both eyes
                                open. The eye looking through the Maddox rod sees a red line instead of a white light
                                and the other eye sees the light as it really is. These images are too dissimilar for
                                fusion to take place, so the eyes deviate to the position of squint. Prisms are
                                introduced until the light and the red line are superimposed. The Maddox wing enables
                                measurements of latent and small manifest deviations to be made at a near distance. The
                                Maddox rod and wing allow measurement of horizontal and vertical deviations. The wing
                                also allows torsional measurements to be made.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Stereoscopic vision</h5>
                        <p>The ability to see in 'depth' or 3D vision is the highest form of binocular sight. The main
                            tests measuring stereo acuity in seconds of arc (the measurement of minimum disparity that
                            gives rise to appreciation of depth) include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frisby test</li>
                            <li>Wirt fly test (Titmus test)</li>
                            <li>TNO (red/green test)</li>
                            <li>Lang stereo test.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>There are several treatment choices for a non-paralytic squint:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Optical treatment:</b> accurate refraction must be carried out and appropriate
                                glasses ordered. This in itself might correct the squint.</li>
                            <li><b>Occlusion therapy:</b> the visual acuity must be assessed and if amblyopia is
                                present, it must be reversed. This is performed by occluding the 'good' eye to encourage
                                the amblyopic eye to work. Occlusion therapy is carried out, according to the state of
                                amblyopia, in the following ways:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>total occlusion</b> - the patch is placed over the 'good' eye itself</li>
                                    <li><b>partial occlusion</b> - the lens of the glasses is covered with tape or paper
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>constant occlusion</b> - total or partial occlusion used from morning till
                                        night</li>
                                    <li><b>part-time occlusion</b> - total or partial occlusion used for a specified
                                        number of hours each day.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Orthoptic exercises</b> are used to stimulate binocular single vision and strengthen
                                fusion by means of binocular instruments such as the synoptophore. This instrument uses
                                pairs of slides, one for each eye, which match together to form a picture; a bird seen
                                with one eye and a cage seen with the other will be seen with both eyes together as a
                                bird in a cage.</li>
                            <li><b>Operative measures:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Early surgery</b> is performed if there is either potential binocular
                                        function present; or poor cosmetic appearance with no binocular vision.</li>
                                    <li><b>Surgery can be delayed</b> if the deviation is cosmetically quite good.</li>
                                    <li><b>Surgery is not performed</b> if the cosmetic appearance is good in the
                                        presence of no binocular function.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Surgery will not improve binocular vision once it has been lost. The muscles operated on in
                            convergent and divergent squint are usually the medial and lateral recti. They may be
                            resected (shortened) or recessed (effectively lengthened). Sometimes surgery is directed to
                            the non-squinting eye, which worries parents and sometimes nurses! It may not matter which
                            eye is operated on, the aim being to align one eye with the other.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Botulinum toxin:</b> botulinum toxin (BT) is used to correct some types of convergent
                                and divergent squint, particularly where surgery may be contraindicated as with Graves'
                                disease. It is primarily used for cosmetic reasons. The BT is injected directly into the
                                muscle; however, the paralysis of the muscle is not instantaneous. It can take up to 48
                                hours to take effect and the action is relatively short lived, between five and eight
                                weeks. Because of this, the treatment needs to be repeated every two to three months.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Paralytic squint</h3>
                        <p>A paralytic or incomitant (non-concomitant) squint is more common in adults than in children.
                            If it occurs in a child under the age of eight years, the child will be able to suppress the
                            resulting double vision and the events that occur with a non-paralytic squint will follow.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adults, however, have no capacity to suppress the vision in one eye to eliminate the
                            diplopia. This can be distressing and can be associated with nausea and giddiness.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes</h4>
                        <p>A paralytic squint is caused by an abnormality in the extra-ocular muscles or their nerve
                            supply.</p>

                                        non-surgical treatment such as wearing glasses, occlusion, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid swimming, contact sports for four weeks.</li>
                                    <li>Children should only need to be kept off school for a few days.</li>
                                    <li>Ensure that the patient has a follow-up orthoptic appointment on discharge.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Stitch abscess.</li>
                            <li>The muscle slipping away from its new position because the sutures have broken.</li>
                            <li>Failure of the operation to result in binocular single vision when this is the expected
                                outcome.</li>
                            <li>Failure of the operation to give a good cosmetic result.</li>
                            <li>Overcorrection of the squint. A convergent squint results in a consecutive divergent
                                squint, and vice versa.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pseudosquint</h3>
                        <p>A pseudosquint is the appearance of a squint occurring in the presence of binocular single
                            vision.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Epicanthus.</li>
                            <li>Abnormal angle alpha: this is a larger or smaller than normal angle between the optic
                                axis and the visual axis. This angle is very similar to that of angles kappa and gamma.
                            </li>
                            <li>Facial asymmetry.</li>
                            <li>Wide or narrow interpupillary distance: a wide interpupillary distance gives the
                                appearance of divergent squint; and a narrow interpupillary distance, convergent squint.
                            </li>
