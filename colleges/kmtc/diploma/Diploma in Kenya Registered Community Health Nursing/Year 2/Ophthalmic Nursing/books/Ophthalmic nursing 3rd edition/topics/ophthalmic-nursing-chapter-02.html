                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Today's ophthalmic nurse will in all probability, have been educated at university to at
                            least diploma level. Programmes to prepare the ophthalmic nurse are offered as part of
                            diploma, degree and masters level. Others caring for the ophthalmic patient are likely to
                            have studied NVQ level 2 or 3 and will have gained their knowledge and skill whilst
                            practising clinically. Within the wider workforce planning agenda other clinical roles are
                            being developed such as assistant practitioners and surgical care practitioners.</p>
                        <p>Ophthalmic nurses will naturally be continuing to expand their practice to include for
                            example: nurse consent; pre-operative assessment; sub-tenon's local anaesthesia; diagnosis
                            and management of ocular emergencies (including telephone triage). The care and management
                            of groups of patients linked to sub-specialities is not uncommon and roles include: stable
                            glaucoma patients; oculoplastic nursing; cataract; corneal; uveitis. With any of these
                            expanded roles, the ophthalmic nurse must be mindful of their professional accountability
                            (Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2002).</p>
                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse must naturally possess all the qualities required of a nurse working in
                            any speciality or environment. There are though, some characteristics that are more
                            important to a nurse specialising in the diseases and conditions of the eye. The eye is very
                            delicate and sensitive. Most of the patients the nurse will attend to will have varying
                            degrees of anxiety about their eye and pain or discomfort in or around the eye. Therefore
                            she must be extremely gentle with her hands and in her manner in order to allay any fears
                            the patient may have about his eyes being touched. The nurse should be aware of her position
                            and work on the patient's right-hand side when dealing with the right eye and vice versa
                            with the left.</p>
                        <p>The eye is small and there is not much room for manoeuvre around it when performing manual
                            nursing procedures. The nurse therefore needs to be manually dexterous. She also needs to
                            have the best possible vision when performing nursing procedures; there is no place for
                            vanity when dealing with the ophthalmic patient, wearing glasses for close work should these
                            be required is essential.</p>
                        <p>As ophthalmic patients can be from any age group, the nurse needs to be familiar with the
                            special requirements of all ages, those of the very young and the old in particular. However
                            it is recognised that specialist paediatric nurses should as a matter of course, care for
                            children. The difficulty here is that there are very few paediatric nurses with an
                            ophthalmic qualification.</p>
                        <p>The nurse must be thoughtful in her approach to the visually impaired person. She must use a
                            variety of interpersonal skills to their best advantage including: touching as appropriate
                            to indicate presence or show concern; introducing herself; indicating when she is leaving;
                            and never shouting. There is a great temptation to assume that a person who is visually
                            impaired is also hard of hearing.</p>
                        <p>The nurse must always bear in mind that there is an individual human being behind the eyes
                            that are being treated, and care for each patient as a whole, unique person.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Ophthalmic patients receive treatment as outpatients, day cases, and in primary care
                            settings. If hospitalised, they tend to spend a minimum of time actually in hospital.
                            Today's ophthalmic nurse has a limited amount of time in which to get to know the patient
                            and be able to assess his needs and therefore must employ clear, succinct assessment skills
                            in order to carry out an effective assessment. Many aspects of patient assessment may be
                            delegated to other carers in the team. For example, a clinical support worker may measure
                            visual acuity, take blood or record an electro cardiogram (ECG); and a technician may
                            perform biometry.</p>
                        <p>Patient assessment remains one of the most important interactions that nurses will have with
                            their patients and in order to do this thoroughly and efficiently requires excellent
                            communication skills. The ophthalmic nurse must therefore, use verbal and non-verbal skills
                            appropriately. Open-ended questions yield more information and an appropriate tone and pitch
                            of voice should be employed. She must be aware of the effects of eye contact, facial
                            expression, posture, gestures and touch on the patients, remembering that non-verbal
                            communication apart from touch may not always be immediately appropriate to the visually
                            impaired. However, if the ophthalmic nurse does not utilise her non-verbal communication
                            skills, it could affect her own attitude and behaviour and the patient or the carer could in
                            turn pick this up. It is also useful to integrate counselling skills such as the use of
                            active listening, silence, and attention and paraphrasing, in order to gain additional
                            understanding of the patient's needs. The ophthalmic nurse also needs to be very observant.
                            The importance of clear and concise record-keeping cannot be overemphasised.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is well recognised by nurses that giving information about procedures for example,
                            relieves anxiety and aids recovery. Not only do patients and carers need to know what is
                            wrong with them and how they will be managed medically or surgically, the majority will also
                            want to know why they are having that particular treatment. Patients and carers have ready
                            access to Internet resources and frequently have downloaded information about their
                            condition and treatment options. The ophthalmic nurse needs to be aware of this and be in a
                            position to advise the patient as to the accuracy and reasonableness of this information.
                            Many hospitals and clinics place patient information on their own Web pages as well as being
                            available on a range of electronic media. Having an understanding of the rationale behind
                            treatment will aid compliance and enable the patient to be actively involved. Patients and
                            carers need information at all stages of management. Patients do benefit from effective
                            pre-operative teaching programmes.</p>
                        <p>Today's care systems are based on multidisciplinary team-working. Nurses are not the only
                            people who will be giving the patient information. Other health professionals such as
                            orthoptists and optometrists also provide ophthalmic services. The role of the voluntary
                            sector, for example HSBP (Henshaw's Society for Blind People), the IGA (International
                            Glaucoma Association) and the RNIB (Royal National Institute for the Blind) must not be
                            forgotten and many outpatient departments have resident representatives to assist the
                            patient in coming to terms with their lives as people with visual impairment. Nurses are
                            well placed to provide the patient with sufficient information about their condition and
                            treatment. The ophthalmic nurse must, therefore, be in possession of sound knowledge in
                            order to impart accurate information. She also needs time and the ability to use
                            communication skills, mentioned above, appropriately. The nurse needs to assess how much
                            information the patient needs and in what depth as well as whether to use lay or
                            professional terminology. The ophthalmic nurse needs to be able to impart information to all
                            age groups. As the majority of patients are elderly, she needs a special understanding of
                            this group. Although the senses are often reduced due to the ageing process, this does not
                            mean that the elderly cannot learn about their health needs. Visually impaired elderly
                            people with a hearing loss are a challenge to the ophthalmic nurse, especially as loss of
                            both of these senses may cause them some confusion.</p>
                        <p>In addition to providing information on the various conditions and their treatment, the nurse
                            also needs to instruct the patient or carer in practical skills that need to be carried out
                            at home, such as instilling drops, lid hygiene or inserting conformer shells. The patient or
                            carer will need time to practise these skills following instruction from the nurse. It is
                            vital that the nurse assesses their competence, which needs to be satisfactory if compliance
                            is to be achieved. There are many reasons why patients fail to comply with their treatment
                            (Williams, 1993; Patel & Speath, 1995). These include: lack of understanding of the
                            diagnosis; if the condition is chronic; forgetfulness; lack of motivation; side effects of
                            the drops; frequency of drop instillation; and multiple pharmacotherapy. Noncompliance may
                            be as high as $95\%$, www.gpnotebook.co.uk (2003), if one takes into account late
                            instillation or missed doses. Physical problems such as hand tremor and weakness or
                            arthritis may be overcome by the use of devices to help in the delivery of drops.</p>
                        <p>Teaching is another area that has been affected by the shortened contact time between nurse
                            and patient. The actual organisation of when and where to carry out teaching is often
                            difficult. Verbal information and instruction must be backed up with the written word, both
                            of which must be clear, unambiguous and appropriate for the individual. This includes the
                            provision of leaflets in other languages, according to the community served. In addition,
                            materials should be available on request in a format that the person with disability can
                            access readily, for example Braille or tape recordings. As mentioned, many hospitals now
                            place patient information on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>The patient's need for information and the nurse's role to give it are vitally important and,
                            in order to save unnecessary repetition in the following text, it will be assumed under each
                            eye condition that this is carried out.</p>
                        <p>Above all, the ophthalmic nurse needs to be a knowledgeable, competent practitioner who
                            instils confidence in the patients with whom she has contact.</p>

                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse of today must be research-aware and should be encouraged to become
                            involved in clinical research studies and clinical audit. Whilst there is an increasing body
                            of ophthalmic nursing research, much of what ophthalmic nurses do is not research based.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are being encouraged to reflect on their practice and the ophthalmic nurse is no
                            exception. Reflection allows time for nurses to ponder on their practice and discover ways
                            to improve their performance. Reflection is encouraged as it goes some way to fill the
                            theory/practice gap in nursing (Conway, 1994).</p>
                        <p>Nurses have continued to expand their roles in response to the changing demands of the

                            duties previously performed by ophthalmic nurses are now within the domain of assistant
                            practitioners and clinical support workers. They too must have the required underpinning
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Ophthalmic nurses have a key role to play in health education and health promotion. This
                            includes informing people of how to avoid accidents in the home or work setting and
                            screening for diseases such as open-angle glaucoma.</p>
                        <p>Ophthalmic nurses have a prime responsibility for the quality of care they deliver,
                            regardless of the setting. The essence of care provides a useful framework for some areas of
                            ophthalmic activity (DoH, 2003). The ophthalmic nurse can use the essence of care framework
                            to audit her practice and to make comparisons with practices outside her own unit.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The outpatient department is the portal into the hospital or unit for the majority of
                            patients attending with eye conditions and may be the only department they visit. The nurse
                            working there should therefore be a good advertisement for the whole hospital or unit.</p>
                        <p>McBride (2000; 2002) has suggested that ophthalmic outpatient facilities fail to meet the
                            needs of the patient with low vision. Nurses have a major role to play in ensuring that the
                            environment and systems work for this category of patients and come up to a good standard.
                        </p>
                        <p>Outpatient departments are always busy and, whilst great progress has been made in ensuring
                            short waits for appointments (including booked appointments), there seems to be no answer to
                            the problem of waiting time in the clinic itself. There are ways that the nurse running the
                            clinic can alleviate the frustrations and boredom experienced due to the waiting. She can
                            inform the patient approximately how long the wait will be and give an explanation for any
                            delay, if possible. This may help avoid tempers becoming frayed. It is also useful to have a
                            snack bar to direct patients and relatives to, where they can while away the time and
                            prevent hypoglycaemia setting in - literally, in the case of diabetics. Also, advising
                            patients about how the clinic works so they understand when for example, a patient returning
                            from a test or investigation is not jumping the queue but rather completing their
                            consultation.</p>
                        <p>Some outpatient departments have involved other allied health professionals in the management
                            of some clinic cases. Optometrist lead glaucoma services is one such example. Other
                            initiatives involve patients being seen out in primary care settings.</p>
                        <p>All patients visiting the outpatient department have their visual acuity recorded, this
                            usually being the responsibility of the nurse. Other nursing procedures (see Chapter 3) may
                            include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>lacrimal sac washouts</li>
                            <li>epilation of lashes</li>
                            <li>taking conjunctival swabs</li>
                            <li>removing sutures</li>
                            <li>removing/inserting/cleaning contact lenses</li>
                            <li>instilling drops/ointment</li>
                            <li>removing/inserting prostheses</li>
                            <li>testing for dry eyes using tear strips</li>
                            <li>applying pad and bandaging</li>
                            <li>recording blood pressure, as hypertension can be associated with retinopathies and
                                central artery and vein occlusions; the blood pressure will need to be recorded if the
                                patient is to undergo surgery and for general screening</li>
                            <li>testing urine and/or blood glucose monitoring to ensure the patient is not diabetic, as
                                diabetes can cause various ophthalmic conditions (see p. 223), and for general
                                screening.</li>
                            <li>minor surgery and investigations will be carried out in the outpatient department, and
                                the nurse will need to become familiar with the procedures and instruments as she may
                                perform the investigations herself; the following are examples of operations and tests
                                performed under local anaesthetic:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>incision and curettage of chalazion</li>
                                    <li>lid surgery</li>
                                    <li>biopsy</li>
                                    <li>removal of lid tumours</li>
                                    <li>retropunctal cautery</li>
                                    <li>3-snip operation</li>
                                    <li>tonometry</li>
                                    <li>perimetry</li>
                                    <li>biometry.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The optometrist and prosthetist will normally have their clinics in this department. The
                            prosthetist works as part of a team, with the surgeon and the oculoplastic nurse. The high
                            number of patients attending the outpatient department poses particular problems for the
                            nurse, as she will be unable to learn of each one's individual needs. She must be aware of
                            those patients who require particular attention in respect of their communication and
                            mobility difficulties. These difficulties may result from visual impairment or other
                            physical impairments or both. These patients will usually be elderly although not always.
                            The nurse needs to be aware of any special needs or circumstances such as diabetes,
                            registered blind. Clinical governance dictates that confidentiality must be assured so
                            information should be held discreetly within the notes, not pinned on the top.</p>
                        <p>The nurse is unable to see every patient as he leaves the department to ensure that he has
                            understood any prescribed treatment or follow-up. However, she must look out for the elderly
                            and hard of hearing in particular, in order to explain any necessary information that the
                            doctor or practitioner may have given. This information should be supported by written
                            information.</p>
                        <p>Some patients will have received bad news from the doctor. Those with age related macular
                            degeneration, for example, will have hoped for treatment to improve their eyesight, only to
                            be told that there is little that can be done apart from providing aids to assist with poor
                            vision. Doctors need to communicate with the nurse about such patients so that the nurse is
                            aware of these patients and available to talk to them, answer their questions and refer them
                            to a social worker if appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The ophthalmic trained nurse will be able to give information to the patient due to be booked
                            to come into hospital for an operation. She will be able to inform the patient of the
                            approximate length of the waiting time for the operation, what it entails, and the length of
                            the hospital stay. She will be able to answer any queries the patient may have. Patient
                            assessment may be undertaken in the outpatient department at this or a subsequent visit.
                            Preassessment should normally be undertaken as near to the operation date as possible to
                            ensure that the information is as up to date as possible.</p>
                        <p>It is of benefit to the patient if he can be shown the ward or day case area. This helps
                            allay fears of coming into hospital and is especially helpful to children and their parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse working in the outpatient department has to deal with many patients in
                            the course of a day. She needs to have sound ophthalmic knowledge to be able to attend to
                            the wide variety of ophthalmic conditions. The eye condition may be a manifestation of a
                            systemic disorder, so she also needs general nursing knowledge in order to give advice and
                            to perform procedures competently. She needs to be competent in carrying out these nursing
                            procedures and, in particular, to be aware of the special needs of the elderly, the very
                            young, the deaf, the infirm and the anxious.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse working in the casualty department is in a similar environment and
                            requires the same sort of skills as the nurse working in the outpatient department. However,
                            there has recently been a proliferation of nurse-led emergency eye services. The majority of
                            these nurses have undertaken a recognised ophthalmic nursing qualification and have
                            undergone a period (usually one year) of in-house training under medical and nursing
                            supervision. These ophthalmic nurse practitioners would see any casualty patients presenting
                            with undifferentiated ocular problems. Within the remit of their role they would diagnose,
                            treat and refer according to protocols. In addition, the ophthalmic nurse must be able to
                            deal with emergencies and decide on priority of care. The following conditions are
                            considered ophthalmic emergencies and the patients will require immediate attention:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sudden loss of vision due to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>central retinal artery occlusion (see p. 169)</li>
                                    <li>central retinal vein occlusion (see p. 170)</li>
                                    <li>giant cell arteritis (see p. 225)</li>
                                    <li>retinal detachment - especially if the macula is still attached (see p. 165)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>primary acute glaucoma (see p. 132)</li>
                            <li>trauma, especially penetrating or perforating injuries (see p. 203)</li>
                            <li>chemical burns (see p. 208)</li>
                            <li>orbital cellulitis (see p. 63).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Urgent cases the nurse may have to deal with which are not classed as emergencies include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>corneal ulcer (see p. 106)</li>
                            <li>vitreous haemorrhage (see p. 184)</li>
                            <li>acute dacryocystitis (see p. 84 )</li>
                            <li>optic nerve disorders (see p. 182)</li>
                            <li>ocular tumours (see p. 127)</li>
                            <li>acute uveitis (see p. 123).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse will need to inform the waiting patients of the approximate waiting time and she
                            may need to explain that some people require priority care and will be attended to as soon
                            as they arrive in the department. Locally, in response to NHS plan guidelines DoH (2000),
                            many departments have escalation policies that 'kick in' if patient waiting times are
                            getting too long.</p>
                        <p>It is the nurse's responsibility to take a good history and decide what priority, if any, the
                            patient should be given. Triage is essential to ensure that real emergencies are given
                            priority. She must give details of the state of the patient's vision on arrival and of the
                            type of injury or eye complaint. The importance of taking an accurate history cannot be
                            overemphasised. The history may give clues to the type of injury sustained that is not
                            evident on initial eye examination. The history must include the following items:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>visual acuity - this may be used for medico-legal purposes especially if an accident has
                                occurred at work and damages might be claimed</li>
                            <li>type of injury:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>if a foreign body entered the eye: (i) what the foreign body was; (ii) when the
                                        accident happened; (iii) how it got into the eye - it is especially important to
                                        find out whether the patient was using a hammer and chisel, and if the foreign
                                        body hit the eye with force, which might indicate that it had penetrated the
                                        eye, in which case an orbital X-ray would need to be ordered; (iv) if protective
                                        goggles were being worn at the time of the incident</li>
                                    <li>If a fluid or powder substance has entered the eye: (i) what the substance is;
                                        (ii) when the incident occurred; (iii) whether it was washed out immediately
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the eye has been scratched: (i) what scratched the eye; (ii) with what force
                                        it did so; (iii) when the incident occurred</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>type of eye complaint - the nurse must elicit whether the following symptoms are present
                                and their duration:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>discharge, especially on waking, noting the colour. In addition, age of the
                                        patient as it could be more serious in babies</li>
                                    <li>watering</li>
                                    <li>photophobia</li>
                                    <li>pain or discomfort, its location and nature</li>
                                    <li>change in vision: (i) blurred vision; (ii) floaters; (iii) visual loss (sudden;
                                        gradual; total; partial - which visual field is affected; linked to head
                                        injury?)</li>
                                    <li>restricted ocular movement</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient should be allocated a triage category and treated accordingly. It should be noted
                            that the ocular trauma could be associated with other injuries and that the latter may need
                            to be treated before the eye injury.</p>
                        <p>If the patient has had an accident, he may need to be treated for shock. Accompanying
                            relatives or friends may also be shocked and anxious.</p>
                        <p>Patients suffering from sudden loss of vision will be anxious, as will those who are to be
                            admitted to hospital, especially if this is unexpected. The nurse must help alleviate these
                            fears and anxieties. She can offer practical help such as informing relatives or arranging
                            transport.</p>
                        <p>The nurse will be expected to carry out varied nursing procedures in the casualty department
                            (see Chapter 3):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the taking and recording of visual acuity</li>
                            <li>examination of the eye - this may be carried out using a torch or with a slit lamp;
                                ophthalmic nurse practitioners would be expected to carry out full anterior segment
                                examination of the eye</li>
                            <li>checking the pupils for relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD)</li>
                            <li>instillation of drops and ointment</li>
                            <li>removal of conjunctival and superficial corneal foreign bodies</li>
                            <li>application of pad and bandaging</li>
                            <li>irrigation of the eye</li>
                            <li>epilation of lashes</li>
                            <li>syringing of the lacrimal ducts</li>
                            <li>removal of sutures</li>
                            <li>removal/insertion of contact lenses</li>
                            <li>removal/insertion of prostheses</li>
                            <li>testing urine</li>
                            <li>recording peripheral blood glucose</li>
                            <li>recording blood pressure</li>
                            <li>taking conjunctival swabs</li>
                            <li>performing tear strip test for dry eyes</li>
                            <li>patient education</li>
                            <li>health and safety advice</li>
                            <li>action to be taken if condition worsens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse must remember while performing these procedures that the patient may feel faint or
                            unwell.</p>
                        <p>The nurse in the casualty department must be able to deal with many people and to cope with
                            unexpected situations that might arise. She must have adequate ophthalmic knowledge to be
                            able to recognise urgent cases and to be able to give certain patients priority care. She
                            also needs to be able to perform a variety of ophthalmic procedures competently and
                            knowledgeably.</p>
                        <p>This is an ideal time to carry out patient education by giving out relevant information
                            leaflets and informing patients on eye protection as appropriate. The nurse in casualty also
                            advises patients over the telephone so it is vital that her knowledge is accurate and her
                            communication skills are appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The management of children with an ocular problem in an eye casualty department requires the
                            ophthalmic nurse to be sensitive to their needs. Very young children can be frightened and
                            anxious in unfamiliar surroundings. The parents are often equally anxious. It seems sensible
                            to manage and treat the child quickly to ensure full co-operation during the examination
                            process. Prolonged waiting time before children are seen will increase their fretfulness and
                            anxiety</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Patients in the ophthalmic day case unit or ward will require pre- and postoperative care, as
                            the majority are admitted for surgery, e.g. cataract extraction; squint surgery; repair of
                            retinal detachment; drainage surgery for chronic glaucoma; following trauma. There may,
                            however, be patients admitted for rest following trauma, for intensive treatment of a severe
                            infection, post-operative complications. The specific nursing care for each ophthalmic
                            condition is detailed in the relevant chapters. However, a general note on nursing care is
                            given here.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre-assessment</h3>
                        <p>Patients having day case or inpatient surgery tend to be pre-assessed a few weeks prior to
                            the operation. This is carried out to assess the needs of the individual patient in order to
                            be able to plan their short period in hospital, to give the necessary information regarding
                            the surgery and to plan with the patient and carers their care following the operation.</p>
                        <p>The care following surgery will involve instillation of drops that in the majority of cases
                            will be performed by the patient himself or his carer. Ideally, teaching drop instillation
                            should be instituted at pre-assessment as there is little time for this during the admission
                            to hospital. Advising patients to purchase artificial tear drops and practise at home
                            following instruction is one way of overcoming the lack of time there is to carry out this
                            teaching and observation of the patient's performance.</p>
                        <p>The nurse has only limited time in which to assess the needs of the patients and must apply
                            all her assessment skills appropriately (see p. 6).</p>
                        <p>As well as giving the usual pre-operative information to the patient, the nurse may carry out
                            the following procedures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>visual acuity (see p. 21)</li>
                            <li>tonometry (see p. 51)</li>
                            <li>biometry (see p. 53)</li>
                            <li>ECG</li>
                            <li>focimetry</li>
                            <li>slit lamp examination for blepharitis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Information leaflets regarding the surgery and hospital stay should be given to the patient
                            to support the verbal information and instructions that the nurse will give. These can be
                            translated into languages other than English if necessary. This, together with answering any
                            queries the patient or carer may have, will help allay fears. Clinical governance requires
                            that patients are actively involved in the production of patient information of any type.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre-operative care</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the routine pre-operative care for surgery being performed under either local
                            or general anaesthesia, the nurse may be required to carry out the following procedures,
                            depending on the personal preferences of the ophthalmic surgeon (see Chapter 3):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instilling mydriatic drops prior to cataract extraction or retinal detachment surgery as
                                the pupil needs to be dilated for such surgery to be performed</li>
                            <li>Instilling miotic drops prior to trabeculectomy and keratoplasty</li>
                            <li>Instilling local anaesthetic drops if the operation is to be performed under a local
                                anaesthetic, such as G. oxybuprocaine $0.4\%$.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These drops are usually administered against a prescription or patient group direction (PGD).
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Post-operative care</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the normal post-operative care required by any patient after surgery, the
                            ophthalmic nurse will need to follow a routine such as that described here, although this
                            will vary to some extent according to hospital practice.</p>
                        <p><b>Eye care:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Dressings</b> - the eye will usually only be cleaned on the day following day case
                                surgery, unless the patient is kept in hospital longer; cleaning is usually performed
                                once a day or more frequently if indicated.</li>
                            <li><b>Inspection of the eye</b> - the eye will be examined post-operatively (see Chapter
                                3).</li>
                            <li><b>Instillation of drops</b> - if prescribed, given accordingly; ointment, if prescribed
                                may be applied at night.</li>
                            <li><b>Protection of the eye</b> - eye pads or cartella shields may be worn on the first
                                post-operative day; cartella shields are usually worn only at night for two weeks
                                following cataract surgery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Discharge</b> - all patients should be given instructions about care and follow-up:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Eye drops</b> - patient's and carer's ability to instil drops should be checked.
                                Ideally this will have commenced at pre-assessment. Names of drops and times of
                                instillation must be written down.</li>
                            <li><b>Cleaning the eye</b> - if the eye is sticky in the mornings, it should be cleaned
                                using cooled, boiled water in a clean receptacle and cotton wool or gauze. Advise
                                patients to avoid using dry cotton wool near the eye, as fibres can get into it.</li>
                            <li><b>General instructions</b> - patients should avoid stooping down too low in case they
                                lose their balance. If appropriate the patient should be advised to avoid anything
                                causing increased exertion that will raise the intraocular pressure, such as lifting
                                anything heavy. Patients should take care when they wash their hair to avoid getting
                                soap or water into the eye as this would cause irritation that could result in rubbing
                                behaviour. These restrictions should be heeded for two weeks initially but are becoming
                                increasingly less necessary with small incision surgery. They must especially take care
                                not to knock the eye, which could cause haemorrhage or the iris to prolapse through the
                                wound.</li>
                            <li><b>Outpatient appointment</b> - ensure that the patient has an appointment, usually for
                                one or two weeks following discharge. Transport may need to be arranged for the day.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Primary care</b> - the nurse may need to arrange for a community nurse, home help,
                                meals on wheels, for the patient prior to discharge.</li>
                            <li><b>Convalescence</b> - not used often but in some areas recuperation in a convalescent,
                                residential or nursing home can be arranged for patients before they return to their own
                                homes.</li>
                            <li>Specialist procedures such as vitrectomy may require a patient to 'posture' in certain
                                positions to ensure a satisfactory surgical outcome. To ensure that the patient complies
                                with the posturing instructions, especially if they live alone, it may be necessary to
                                involve other agencies such as those provided by social services and primary care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is helpful if all the above information and instructions are written down as well as given
                            verbally, as there is often much detail to absorb in the excitement of going home.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing procedures</h3>
                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse working on the ward and in day case needs to be able to assess the
                            patients and plan their care on an individual basis. She must understand the pre- and
                            post-operative care required for each type of ophthalmic operation. She needs to be able to
                            carry out certain ophthalmic procedures competently and knowledgeably. The nurse must also
                            plan the patient's discharge in advance, ensuring that all relevant agencies are involved.
                            She must be knowledgeable in all ophthalmic aspects in order to discuss relevant points with
                            the patient and relatives so that the hospital stay can be made as easy and pleasant as
                            possible for all concerned.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The nurse working in an ophthalmic theatre will need to be familiar with the nursing
                            responsibilities and general duties required of any theatre nurse. In addition, she will
                            need to know the following aspects of ophthalmic theatre nursing, though the details will
                            vary from hospital to hospital.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preparation of the patient</h3>
                        <p>Care begins in the anaesthetic room where the nurse greets the patient and ensures their
                            comfort on the chair or operating table. She will take a handover report from the day case
                            or ward nurse. The anaesthetic nurse will establish that she has the correct patient, the
                            surgical procedure for which the patient has given consent, the eye to be operated on and if
                            marked, any relevant medical and surgical history including medications. The identity
                            bracelet, if worn, is cross-referenced to the case notes.</p>
                        <p>Once on the operating table, the patient must be positioned safely and correctly, especially
                            if a general anaesthetic is being administered. A Rubens pillow is used to position and
                            support the adult patient's head and a head ring for a child. Local anaesthetic drops, if no
                            general anaesthetic is to be given, may be instilled prior to the operation commencing.</p>
                        <p>If the patient is having the operation under a local anaesthetic, it is important that a
                            nurse sits and holds his hand during the procedure. This not only reassures the patient but
                            can give the nurse an indication of his condition. Intravenous sedatives, e.g. medazelam,
                            may be given to the patient.</p>
                        <p>During the operation the patient's face will be covered with a sterile towel. This may make
                            the patient feel claustrophobic and perhaps disorientated. Usually a supply of oxygen at 4
                            litres per minute with an air intake or air alone is administered to the patient. If oxygen
                            is being given, the supply must be switched off if cautery is used, as it constitutes a fire
                            hazard.</p>
                        <p>The nurse holding the patient's hand during local or topical procedures, in order to reassure
                            the patient as well as to establish a communication link to pick up on patient discomfort
                            intra-operatively, is a vital role. She will be able to feel any pressure from the patient's
                            hand indicating that he may be feeling discomfort or pain.</p>
                        <p>The nurse will also observe the monitoring equipment, noting the pulse rate, blood pressure
                            and oxygen saturation. Any deviation from normal will be reported to the surgeon and
                            recorded in the nursing record.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Knowledge of the instruments</h3>
                        <p>The nurse must have a good knowledge of the instruments required for each operation performed
                            on the eye. The suture materials used in ophthalmic surgery tend to be very fine. Because of
                            microsurgical technique some ophthalmic surgery does not require sutures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Technique in handling the instruments</h3>
                        <p>Preferably a non-touch technique is carried out, using forceps to handle the needles and
                            sutures. The tips of the instruments should not be touched with the fingers as this may
                            cause injury and also it may damage the instrument.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Wearing surgical gloves</h3>
                        <p>Gloves with powder must not be used, as the starch it contains is an irritant to the eye.
                            Surgical gloves containing no powder are available such as Biogel M worn by surgeons and
                            scrub nurses for microsurgery. Latex-free gloves must be available where there is known
                            allergy. The trend is to maximise the amount of latex-free equipment in the operating
                            theatre.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Care of the instruments</h3>
                        <p>Ophthalmic instruments tend to be small, delicate and expensive, and great care must be taken
                            when handling them. Every piece of equipment must have its own label and each set of
                            instruments should be labelled and numbered. Sets of instruments must not be split up. A
                            record of which individual instruments and sets of instruments have been used for a
                            particular procedure must be retained in the case notes. These procedures are vital to
                            enable tracking to take place of equipment for the purposes of audit.</p>
                        <p>Instruments should be decontaminated and sterilised in specialist departments and following
                            Department of Health guidelines. This is normally done in a central sterilisation unit.
                            Before instruments are sent for sterilisation, the nurse should wipe micro instruments with
                            spears dipped in water or balanced salt solution. Enzyme foam spray is used to remove
                            detritus and protein from instruments. This procedure if followed, will help prevent the
                            transmission of CJD. Sharps should either be disposable or retractable for safety and to
                            prevent cross infection. Lumened instruments need to be flushed with sterile water and air
                            according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quick rinse machines are available
                            commercially for this purpose, delivering $120 \text{ml} \text{ H}_{2}\text{O}$ and $120
                            \text{ml}$ of air.</p>
                        <p>Instruments are placed in trays lined on the base with lock down latexfree sheets which serve
                            to hold the instruments in place securely during the wash cycle.</p>
                        <p>Sterilisation is usually by downward displacement vacuumed autoclave at a temperature of
                            $130^{\circ}\text{C}$ for three full minutes, the full cycle lasting 40 minutes in total.
                            Each instrument must be seen to be in good working order, not rusted or damaged, and should
                            be examined under a magnified light source before being sterilised.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The operation and use of equipment</h3>
                        <p>The nurse must be familiar with the equipment used in the ophthalmic theatre:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the operating microscope which is used for most intra-ocular surgery</li>
                            <li>the cryotherapy machine used for retinal detachment surgery</li>
                            <li>phaco emulsifier machines which are used for extracapsular cataract extractions and for
                                vitrectomy surgery</li>
                            <li>magnets used for removing intra-ocular and intracorneal magnetic foreign bodies;
                                magnetic instruments are used with the magnet and must be demagnetised following use
                            </li>
                            <li>cautery machines:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>bipolar cautery is used on the eye and no diathermy plate is required</li>
                                    <li>macropolar cautery is used on lids and does require a diathermy plate</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>laser machines</li>
                            <li>emergency equipment such as defibrillators and suction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse working in the ophthalmic theatre must appreciate the delicate nature of the
                            surgery being undertaken. She needs to understand the importance of quietness, speed,
                            attentiveness, cleanliness and sterility. The nurse must also know the particular procedures
                            for each ophthalmic operation at which she will be assisting and be prepared to develop her
                            knowledge as new procedures and instruments are introduced.</p>
