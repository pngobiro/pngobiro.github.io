                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are numerous types of glaucoma and each has the potential to cause blindness. In the UK
                            it accounts for 15% of blind registrations. A general characteristic of glaucoma is a rise
                            in the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) that is sufficient to cause damage to the optic nerve
                            head. IOP is determined by the balance between the rate of production and the rate of
                            drainage of aqueous fluid. Normal intra-ocular pressure is $15-20 \text{ mmHg}$, but this
                            measurement depends to some extent on which method is used to measure it. In addition, the
                            thickness of the cornea can influence IOP readings. Thin corneas give rise to artificially
                            low readings and thicker corneas may give rise to artificially high readings. For this
                            reason, corneal pachymetry is performed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Methods of measuring intra-ocular pressure</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Digital</h4>
                        <p>The patient looks downwards, closing the eye to be examined, and the nurse gently palpates
                            the eyeball with the two index fingers to assess the degree of 'hardness'. This is not an
                            accurate measurement but an eye with raised pressure will feel harder than one with normal
                            pressure. It is a useful initial method of assessment, especially if none of the specialised
                            equipment needed for measuring intra-ocular pressure is available, as in the GP's surgery.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Goldmann applanation tonometer</h4>
                        <p>The tonometer head comprises a double prism. It is attached to a slit lamp. This is a contact
                            method of determining the IOP, and the eye must be anaesthetised first with anaesthetic
                            drops such as Proxymetacaine Hydrochloride $0.5\%$. Fluorescein sodium drops are also
                            instilled to stain the tear film and allow the semicircles in the tonometer head (prism) to
                            be viewed. The dial should be pre-set between 1 and 2. The cobalt blue light is used and the
                            prism is placed against the cornea and the pressure measurement is read off a dial on the
                            tonometer. The reading on the dial has to be multiplied by ten.</p>
                        <p>The tonometer should be calibrated on a daily basis to ensure accuracy.</p>
                        <p>Because of concerns about cross infection, disposable prism heads or prism sheaths should be
                            used. Where non-disposable prisms are used, they must be properly disinfected between use.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Perkins' applanation tonometer</h4>
                        <p>The Perkins' applanation tonometer is a hand-held tonometer, working on the principles of the
                            Goldmann tonometer mentioned above. It is useful for patients who are unable to sit at a
                            slit lamp, e.g. those who are in wheelchairs, who are bed-bound or unconscious. The method
                            of use and normal pressure is the same as for the Goldmann tonometer.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tonopen</h4>
                        <p>Tonopens are small pen-like instruments that measure pressure in a similar fashion to the
                            applanation method. This method is becoming increasingly popular as the operator does not
                            have to have skill in the use of the slit lamp.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Non-contact tonometer</h4>
                        <p>Non-contract tonometers, employed by optometrists, use a puff of air blown against the eye.
                            The time required to flatten the cornea is converted into a figure to denote the
                            intra-ocular pressure.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Schiotz tonometry</h4>
                        <p>A contact method of measuring IOP that does not require a power source. This is rarely used
                            in developed countries.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The anterior chamber</h3>
                        <p>The anterior chamber is the area between the posterior surface of the cornea and the anterior
                            surface of the iris. The angle of the anterior chamber may be examined using a gonioscope
                            (see p. 134).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The posterior chamber</h3>
                        <p>The posterior chamber is the area between the posterior surface of the iris and the anterior
                            surface of the lens and suspensory ligaments. Both these chambers are filled with aqueous
                            fluid.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aqueous fluid</h3>
                        <p>Aqueous is a clear fluid produced by the ciliary processes of the ciliary body (see p. 121).
                            It flows from the ciliary body into the posterior chamber, through the pupil, into the
                            anterior chamber, and drains through the anterior chamber angle at the rate of approximately
                            $2 \mu\text{l}/\text{minute}$.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Composition of aqueous</h4>
                        <p>Aqueous is similar in constitution to plasma: $99\%$ water and $1\%$ nutrients, e.g. sodium,
                            potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose. Volume is approximately $125 \mu\text{l}$.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Functions of aqueous</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to maintain intra-ocular pressure</li>
                            <li>to provide a clear medium for refraction</li>
                            <li>to provide nourishment to the lens; and to the posterior surface of the cornea.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The angle of the anterior chamber</h3>
                        <p>The angle of the anterior chamber lies between the limbus (corneal-scleral junction) and the
                            iris and it surrounds the circumference of the anterior chamber. It is composed of the
                            trabecular meshwork and the canal of Schlemm (see Fig. 9.1). The trabecular meshwork is made
                            up of fibrous connective tissue, perforated with oval holes (sieve like) and lined with
                            endothelium, which is continuous with that of the posterior surface of the cornea. There are
                            three distinct parts: the uveal meshwork, which is innermost extending from the iris root to
                            Schwalbe's line; the middle section is the corneo-scleral meshwork - this is the largest
                            section; the endothelial meshwork communicates directly with Schlemm's canal.</p>
                        <p>Aqueous drains via two routes: $90\%$ through the meshwork from the anterior chamber into the
                            canal of Schlemm. This is an oval-shaped channel lined with endothelium. Between 25 and 30
                            collector channels leave the canal of Schlemm and anastomose to form the intra-scleral
                            plexus. From here the aqueous drains into the aqueous veins, the vortex veins and the
                            inferior ophthalmic vein. The uveoscleral route accounts for the remaining $10\%$ of aqueous
                            drainage. Aqueous flows across the ciliary body to the suprachoroidal space, from here it
                            enters the venous circulation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Function of the angle</h4>
                        <p>The angle is for the drainage of aqueous fluid from the eye into the venous circulation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The blood supply to and drainage from the angle of the anterior chamber is via:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anterior ciliary arteries</li>
                            <li>aqueous veins.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Glaucoma is a group of conditions that can cause permanent sight loss. There is damage to the
                            optic nerve head that may or may not be the result of a rise in the intra-ocular pressure.
                            It is the damage to the optic nerve head that results in visual field loss (see Colour Plate
                            10).</p>
                        <p>The four types of glaucoma, each with a different aetiology, are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>primary acute glaucoma (PAG)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Primary acute glaucoma (acute closed-angle glaucoma)</h3>
                        <p>Primary acute glaucoma (PAG) affects one in 1000 over the age of 40. The incidence increases
                            with age and affects women four times more frequently than men. The condition can be divided
                            into two types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>primary pupil block</li>
                            <li>primary irido-trabecular block.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pupil block</h4>
                        <p>Some $94\%$ of PAG cases are of the pupil block type. The eye that is predisposed to this
                            type has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a dome iris</li>
                            <li>an iris that is characteristically bowed forward</li>
                            <li>hypermetropia</li>
                            <li>a shallow anterior chamber</li>
                            <li>a narrow drainage angle</li>
                            <li>a large anteriorly placed lens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pupil becomes blocked by the lens when the pupil is semi-dilated. The aqueous cannot flow
                            through the pupil, resulting in a rise in pressure behind the iris. This causes the iris to
                            be pushed forward (iris bombe) and the forward-placed iris blocks the drainage angle.
                            Treatment for this involves the use of miotic drops such as Pilocarpine $2\%$, which brings
                            the iris away from the angle and laser iridotomy which will allow the aqueous to pass into
                            the anterior chamber, bypassing the blocked pupil. Beta-blockers such as Timoptol are used
                            to reduce aqueous secretion in the affected eye and as a prophylactic measure in the other
                            eye.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Note</h4>
                            <p>Yag laser iridotomy is performed when the eye has responded to treatment, usually the
                                next day and the fellow eye is also treated as a prophylactic measure.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Irido-trabecular block</h4>
                        <p>Irido-trabecular block only occurs in 6% of PAG cases. In irido-trabecular block the eye
                            typically has:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a plateau iris</li>
                            <li>emmetropia</li>
                            <li>a deep anterior chamber</li>
                            <li>deeply recessed angles.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pupillary dilation leads to a progressive irido-trabecular blockage. Treatment is by the use
                            of miotic drops to bring the iris away from the angle.</p>
                        <p>PAG usually presents unilaterally, but the fellow eye can also be affected, so it must
                            receive prophylactic treatment.</p>
                        <p>PAG can be divided into five stages which may overlap but the overlap may not be orderly from
                            one stage to the next:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>latent - asymptomatic</li>
                            <li>intermittent or sub-acute</li>
                            <li>acute</li>
                            <li>chronic</li>
                            <li>absolute - end stage.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Latent</h4>
                        <p>As the patients are asymptomatic the condition is diagnosed either at a routine eye
                            examination or when another eye condition is being investigated. These patients must be
                            warned of the prodromal symptoms (see below) in case they progress to the next stage.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intermittent or sub-acute</h4>
                        <p>A rapid closure of parts of the angle (see Gonioscopy below) causes the pressure to rise.
                            This results in certain prodromal symptoms and signs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>headache</li>
                            <li>eye pain</li>
                            <li>blurred vision and haloes seen around lights due to corneal oedema</li>
                            <li>nausea</li>
                            <li>general malaise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These prodromal symptoms and signs usually occur at night and improve by the morning when the
                            miosed pupil during sleep has come away from the angle. Patients often think they have a
                            migraine or 'sick headache'. An attack may develop into an acute attack or bypass this
                            stage. As more of the angle becomes blocked with subsequent attacks, chronic closed-angle
                            glaucoma develops. It is therefore important to diagnose and treat this stage early.
                            Treatment is by laser iridotomy followed by intensive miotic drops.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigations</h4>
                        <p><b>Provocative tests:</b> Provocative tests are performed on patients with prodromal or
                            latent symptoms to see if the intra-ocular pressure rises when the eye has been subjected to
                            certain situations. Although rare, they are still in use in some centres.</p>
                        <p><b>Non-provocative tests - Gonioscopy:</b> the depth of the patient's anterior chamber angle
                            can be assessed by the use of a gonioscope. This is a large contact lens with either two or
                            three mirrors placed at differing angles to each other (Fig. 10.1). This enables the angle
                            of the anterior chamber to be viewed when used with the slit lamp. The patient's eye is
                            anaesthetised with anaesthetic drops such as Proxymetacaine hydrochloride $0.5\%$. A
                            lubricant such as Methylcellulose is applied to the surface of the lens that is placed
                            against the cornea. This lubricates the lens and fills the space between the lens and the
                            cornea. The degree to which the angle is open is graded using a grading system such as
                            Shaffer. This system records the degree to which the angle is open on a scale from 0 to $4$;
                            0 being closed and 4 being fully open. Grades 1 and 2 demonstrate that angle closure is
                            probable/possible. The circumference of the angle usually has variable degrees of closure.
                        </p>

                        <p>This is an ophthalmic emergency as the acute raise in intra-ocular pressure can damage the

                                generally feeling unwell. These symptoms can sometimes be confused with other conditions
                                such as acute abdomen and, with the dilated pupil, neurological conditions.</li>
                            <li>Reassurance and explanation.</li>
                            <li>Possible admission to hospital.</li>

                        <h5>Nursing priorities</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inform medical staff at once. Immediate treatment will bring relief of symptoms and
                                prevent complications occurring.</li>
                            <li>Prepare medication and commence instillation of drops as soon as possible after they
                                have been prescribed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Immediate nursing action</h5>
                        <p>Test visual acuity, if patient is fit enough.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain that treatment to the eye will relieve general symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Lay the patient on a couch in a quiet, darkened area.</li>
                            <li>Provide the patient with a vomit bowl and tissues.</li>
                            <li>He may appreciate a cold compress on the forehead.</li>
                            <li>Prepare Acetazolamide 500 mg to be given intravenously by the doctor to reduce the
                                production of aqueous.</li>
                            <li>Commence the instillation of G. Pilocarpine $4\%$ four times per day to the affected eye
                                once it has been prescribed. Intensive miotics are not effective in pulling away the
                                iris from the angle as the sphincter muscle is usually ischaemic if the pressure is
                                above 30 mmHg (Kanski, 2003).</li>
                            <li>Commence G. Pilocarpine one to two times a day to unaffected eye.</li>
                            <li>Commence a beta-blocker (e.g. Betagan - Levobunolol hydrochloride) to the affected eye.
                            </li>
                            <li>Commence steroid drops, e.g. Prednisolone acetate (Pred-forte) drops, to the affected
                                eye as there is usually an associated inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Give analgesics and/or anti-emetics if headache and nausea and vomiting continue despite
                                treatment.</li>
                            <li>Offer mouthwash if vomiting to freshen the mouth and breath (DoH, 2003).</li>
                            <li>Prepare further treatment if necessary to reduce the intra-ocular pressure if initial
                                treatment has failed to bring it down:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>intravenous Mannitol $20\%$ - 200 ml given over one to two hours
                                        <ol type="i">
                                            <li>care for intravenous rate of flow and the site of the cannula, as
                                                leakage into the surrounding tissues causes phlebitis</li>
                                            <li>assist the patient to the toilet or give a urinal or bedpan as Mannitol
                                                has a diuretic effect.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Glycerol ( $1-5 \text{ mg}/\text{kg}$ body weight) orally, in orange juice to
                                        disguise the taste. This in itself may induce nausea and vomiting.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient may resent the frequent attention he requires in the initial stages of treatment
                            of this condition and may just want to be left alone. Handle the patient sympathetically and
                            show understanding of his feelings.</p>
                        <h5>Further nursing action</h5>
                        <p>Prepare the patient for laser iridotomy to both eyes (prophylactically to the fellow eye).
                            Such preparation is restricted to explanation of the procedure and ensuring that the patient
                            has their pain assessed and appropriate analgesia provided before they attend for the laser
                            treatment. If the patient is still nauseous, anti-emetics should also be given as
                            prescribed.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Chronic</h4>
                        <p>Often referred to as 'creeping angle closure', this is when repeated attacks of either
                            intermittent or untreated acute episodes cause further adhesions of the peripheral iris to
                            the posterior surface of the cornea (peripheral anterior synaechiae), thus closing the
                            angle. The signs and symptoms are similar to chronic open-angle glaucoma (see below).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Absolute</h4>
                        <p>This is the end stage of primary acute, chronic and secondary (see below and p. 144) glaucoma
                            when treatment has failed. Cataracts are usually present and occur due to the medical or
                            surgical treatment rather than to the disease process (Kuppens et al., 1995).</p>
                        <p>Blind, painful eyes which occur at this stage are best treated by enucleation (see Chapter
                            15). Alternatively, periodic retrobulbar or facial nerve injections can be administered.
                            Phthisis bulbi, or shrinkage of the eye, occurs as it atrophies when enucleation is the most
                            appropriate course of action.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chronic open-angle glaucoma</h3>
                        <p>Chronic open-angle glaucoma occurs in patients of either sex over the age of 45 years with
                            symptoms usually occurring after the age of 65 if the disease is undetected. This is not to
                            be confused with the chronic form of primary acute glaucoma. It has an insidious onset and
                            is slowly progressive. The patient does not usually notice symptoms until the disease has
                            progressed so far as to result in marked visual field loss. This is because it is the nasal
                            visual field that is lost initially, the fellow eye compensates for the vision loss. It is a
                            bilateral condition, with one eye often being involved earlier and more severely than the
                            other. The patient usually first notices that he cannot see so well in his peripheral vision
                            and has started knocking into things. He often thinks it is just old age or something a new
                            pair of glasses will correct. Hence it is optometrists who often refer these patients to
                            ophthalmologists.</p>
                        <p>Certain optometrists have received additional training in the diagnosis of chronic open-angle
                            glaucoma. They have glaucoma suspects referred to them by fellow optometrists. The
                            optometrist undertakes a thorough examination of the patient and only refers on to an
                            ophthalmologist those people with glaucoma. This allows the patient reassured they do not
                            have the disease and allows them to be discharged. It is thought that without such schemes
                            as many as $20\%$ of referrals to hospitals are false positives.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cause</h4>
                        <p>The cause of chronic glaucoma is not really understood, but there are several risk factors
                            (Kanski, 2003):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>raised intra-ocular pressure</li>
                            <li>family history</li>
                            <li>history of migraine or vasospasm</li>
                            <li>high myopia</li>
                            <li>central retinal vein occlusion</li>
                            <li>retinal detachment caused by a retinal hole</li>
                            <li>Fuch's dystrophy</li>
                            <li>increasing age</li>
                            <li>diabetes mellitus</li>
                            <li>raised systolic blood pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is also a higher incidence in the Afro-Caribbean population (Laske et al., 1994). The
                            aqueous cannot drain away and the intra-ocular pressure rises. The optic nerve head is
                            composed of millions of nerve fibres as they exit the eye. Where the central retinal artery
                            and vein enter and exit through the middle of these fibres, this is referred to as the optic
                            cup. In open-angle glaucoma the cup becomes larger as the nerve fibres atrophy, due to the
                            pressure on them, producing loss of peripheral vision. Typically there is a loss in the
                            nasal peripheral field at first, with progressive loss of the rest of the peripheral field
                            (Fig. 10.2). Central vision is usually retained longer but will also be lost if treatment is
                            not given or is unsuccessful. Sometimes patients experience loss of central vision before
                            peripheral vision has been affected.</p>
                        <p>Chronic glaucoma affects $2\%$ of the population and is familial in $10\%$ of cases (Kanski,
                            2003). Anyone with immediate relatives with this disease should receive an ophthalmic
                            check-up, which is free in the UK, every three to five years after the age of 40. Treatment
                            can then be commenced as soon as signs occur, before symptoms are noted, so that sight can
                            be saved.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigations</h4>
                        <p>Perimetry, posterior segment examination and applanation tonometry are carried out to
                            diagnose and monitor the disease. Corneal pachymetry is also performed to determine the
                            thickness of the cornea.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Perimetry</h4>
                        <p>These tests are performed to assess the degree of peripheral and central visual loss (see p.
                            54). They are used to detect the disease and follow its progress. There are several
                            different types of test but they all use the same principle. The patient, with one eye
                            covered, stares at a white spot or light. Without moving his eye from this spot or light he
                            indicates verbally or by pressing a buzzer as soon as he sees another spot or light entering
                            his peripheral vision from any angle in the $360^{\circ}$ circle. Most machines these days
                            are computerised.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Posterior segment examination</h4>
                        <p>Examination of the optic disc can be made using a slit lamp and hand held magnifying lenses
                            such as 60 D ; 78 D ; 90 D , to assess the degree of cupping, state of the neuro-retinal rim
                            and any changes to the retinal vasculature, e.g. bayoneting or flame haemorrhages.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Laser scanning tomography</h4>
                        <p>This is a more sophisticated investigation of the optic disc which quantifies the areas of
                            neural tissue at the optic disc by taking sections through the nerve head in a similar
                            manner to a CT scan.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tonometry</h4>
                        <p>Measurement of the intra-ocular pressure is recorded (see p. 51). The pressure is not always
                            markedly raised, especially early in the disease.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Gonioscopy</h4>
                        <p>Gonioscopy will be carried out to assess the degree to which the angle is open (see p. 134).
                            Patients may have narrow angles as well as chronic glaucoma.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Phasing</h4>
                        <p>The patient normally attends as a day case to see if the intra-ocular pressure is raised at
                            various times of the day. There is a normal diurnal pattern to IOP, with the pressure being
                            higher in the mornings. The intra-ocular pressure is normally recorded every four to six
                            hours, ideally by the same operator and with the same equipment.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HRT (Heidelberg retinal topograph)</h4>
                        <p>3-dimensional topographic measurements of the optic disc and retina.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">OCT (optical coherence tomography)</h4>
                        <p>OCT uses laser to bring back information about the layers of the retina and also optic disc
                            measurement. It is patient and user-friendly and dilation of the pupil is not essential.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cupped optic disc. The disc becomes oval vertically, and pale with the blood vessels
                                being displaced nasally and the nerve fibre rim becoming narrower. A normal cup is 0.3 ;
                                a glaucomatous cup is $0.5-0.8$. (These values are expressed as ratios - the diameter of
                                the cup is expressed as a fraction of the diameter of the disc giving a cup/disc ratio.)
                            </li>
                            <li>Loss of visual fields, typically peripheral field initially and central field later
                                (Fig. 10.2).</li>
                            <li>Raised intra-ocular pressure up to 25 mmHg .</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>An understanding of the condition, treatment and prognosis.</li>
                            <li>Someone to listen and explain procedures.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing action</h4>
                        <p>Guide/help patient while he is at the hospital. His degree of visual impairment will depend
                            on the amount of glaucomatous damage. If he has peripheral field loss, he will tend to knock
                            into furniture, doors, etc, and will need to be escorted to the varying departments during
                            his visit. McBride (2000 and 2002) found that hospitals were not meeting the needs of people
                            with visual impairment. Patients need people to respect them as human beings and not just
                            another case. Nurses should be pro-active in ensuring that the environment is conducive to
                            the needs of people with visual impairment.</p>
                        <p>Assist the patient with or perform perimetry. These tests require concentration on the part
                            of the patient. As many patients are elderly this is not easy to maintain and therefore the
                            patient needs encouragement and assistance during these tests.</p>
                        <p>Provide the patient with information on his treatment and treatment options which will be
                            either:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Medical</b> - it is not wise to employ more than two topical medications as changes
                                to the conjunctiva which may occur after three years' use may compromise the success of
                                a trabeculectomy (Broadway et al., 1994). Most frequently, the choice will be mono
                                therapy initially.</li>
                            <li><b>Laser</b> - effective in short-term control (Migdal, 1995).</li>
                            <li><b>Surgical</b> - surgery is now being performed earlier in the disease than in the past
                                (Migdal, 1994). When performed early in the disease the intraocular pressure is well
                                controlled (Migdal, 1995). It is important to emphasise that lost sight cannot be
                                restored and that the aim of treatment is to preserve what sight is remaining.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medical treatment</h4>
                        <p>The model for the management and treatment of people with open-angle glaucoma is increasingly
                            a shared responsibility. Nurses and optometrists have expanded their roles to include
                            managing caseloads of patients with stable glaucoma. Protocols and guidelines following risk
                            assessment support such roles.</p>
                        <p>As compliance can be a particular problem in this chronic condition (Patel & Speath, 1995)
                            there is a need to emphasise the importance of instilling the drops in order to control the
                            IOP, with a view to preventing further visual field loss. Following clinical examination and
                            interpretation of results, discussion with the patient should be about explaining findings,
                            ensuring they have an understanding of what has been said. Answer any queries the patient
                            may have. A target IOP will be set, usually $30\%$ reduction from the baseline measurement
                            (EGS, 2003). When setting the target pressure factors relating to the patient's quality of
                            life should be taken into account such as their level of anxiety relative to the chronic
                            nature of the condition, current level of vision loss, cost, inconvenience and side effects
                            of treatment.</p>
                        <p>Instruct the patient about his drops and any other medication; they need to be aware of the
                            effects and side effects. The following medications may be instigated:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prostaglandin analogues, e.g. Latanaprost $0.005\%$ or Travoprost $0.004\%$ nocte.</li>
                            <li>Beta-blocker, e.g. Timolol maleate (Timoptol) twice a day or Betaxolol $0.25\%$ twice a
                                day.</li>
                            <li>Miotics, e.g. Pilocarpine $1\%-4\%$ four times a day.</li>
                            <li>Acetazolamide tablets 250-500 mg four times a day or slow-release twice a day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With drop instillation, there is a need to prevent systemic absorption. This can be achieved
                            by asking the patient to close their eye gently after instilling the drop and count slowly
                            to 60 before they open it again.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Combined topical preparations, e.g. Cosopt (dorzolomide $2\%$ and timolol $0.5\%$ ) or
                                Xalacom (latanoprost $0.005\%$ and timolol $0.5\%$ ).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where topical medication proves to be ineffective, consideration should be given to changing
                            the medication before adding additional medication. Medication may be added where there is
                            some response to treatment but the target IOP has not been achieved. (MREH, 2004).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Laser treatment</h4>
                        <p>Prepare the patient for laser (see p. 48) trabeculoplasty. This procedure involves bombarding
                            the trabecular meshwork with the laser. It is thought that scarring of the tissue stretches
                            the meshwork and opens it up.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical treatment</h4>
                        <p>Admit patient to the day unit or ward.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prepare patient for operation, which is usually performed under a local anaesthetic
                                unless there are indications for general anaesthetic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Trabeculectomy is the commonest type of drainage operation performed. This operation involves
                            making a scleral flap and removing a strip of trabecular meshwork below this flap. The
                            scleral flap is sutured back into place, but as this does not heal properly, it causes a
                            fistula through which the aqueous can drain into the scleral vessels. The bulge over the
                            scleral flap, lying under the conjunctiva, is called a 'bleb'.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give post-operative care:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Eye dressing:

                                            <li>Remove and discard the cartella shield.</li>
                                            <li>A bleb should be noted under the conjunctiva.</li>
                                            <li>The anterior chamber will be shallow but should not be flat. If it is
                                                flat, the bleb is probably draining too much aqueous. A firm pad and
                                                bandage should be applied to seal the bleb. The medical staff should be
                                                notified.</li>

                                to their surgery are more prone to fibrosis (Broadway, 1994). Cytotoxic agents, such as
                                5-fluorouracil or mitomycin, given at the time of surgery or a few days
                                post-operatively, can prevent this occurring (Kanski, 2003). Care must be taken when
                                handling cytotoxic agents. Wear protective gloves, goggles, facemask and apron when
                                drawing it up. Ensure correct disposal of used syringes, needles and other equipment
                                used in an appropriately labelled container.</li>

                                    <li>Dislocation (see p. 159). The dislocated lens falls into the drainage angle or
                                        into the posterior chamber blocking the pupil.</li>
                                    <li>Cataract formation (see p. 149).

                                            <li>The enlarged lens pushes forwards, blocking the pupil or angle. This is
                                                called intumescence of the lens.</li>

                            of the similarity in presenting signs and symptoms to primary acute glaucoma, and the other
                            eye must be examined for depth of the anterior chamber.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing action</h4>
                        <p>The cause of the secondary glaucoma, once diagnosed, is treated first. Therefore the nursing
                            action will be that of the cause.</p>
                        <p>The intra-ocular pressure is reduced by medical treatment initially. Surgical intervention
                            may be required if medical treatment fails to keep the intraocular pressure within normal
                            limits. Nursing action will therefore be instruction of the patient on instillation of drops
                            and taking medication, and administration of pre- and post-operative care when surgery is
                            performed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Buphthalmos/childhood glaucoma (ox-eye)</h3>
                        <p>Buphthalmos is a rare congenital condition affecting one in 10000 births and resulting in
                            increased intra-ocular pressure caused by a defect or blockage of the drainage angle by an
                            embryonic membrane. Occasionally the canal of Schlemm is absent. Forty percent have raised
                            intra-ocular pressures in utero, $50\%$ manifest in the first year of life and $10\%$
                            manifest between the first and third year of life.</p>
                        <p>It is usually a bilateral condition, boys being more commonly affected than girls.</p>

                                thinned and appears bluish due to the pigment of the uveal tract showing through. The
                                cornea also stretches. The enlargement of these two structures gives the child's eye the
                                appearance of an ox-eye.</li>
                            <li>Deep anterior chamber. The lens is pushed backwards by the increased pressure, thus

                                <ul>
                                    <li>monitor for pain and give prescribed analgesia</li>
                                    <li>instillation of antibiotic and/or steroid drops - a mydriatic may be used</li>
                                    <li>observation of the 'bleb' and depth of anterior chamber following trabeculectomy
                                        (see p. 142).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the glaucoma is unilateral, amblyopia must be prevented in that eye (see p. 188). Patching
                            of the unaffected eye will be instituted to encourage the child to use the glaucomatous eye.

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prognosis</h4>
                        <p>The prognosis depends on when the disease became manifest (see above). The earlier the
                            disease is present, the worse the prognosis, and visual impairment may be severe.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Corneal/scleral perforation due to the thinning of those structures. Perforation may
                                occur with the least trauma.</li>
                            <li>Exposure keratitis due to the lids being unable to lubricate the enlarged cornea
                                adequately.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A bandage contact lens can be used to prevent and treat both these conditions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Juvenile glaucoma</h3>
                        <p>Juvenile glaucoma is associated with neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, rubella and
                            aniridia. It presents later than buphthalmos and behaves like chronic open-angle glaucoma.
                            Hence care of the patient is similar.</p>
