                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane lining the upper and lower lids and
                            covering the globe up to the limbus.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Areas of the conjunctiva</h3>
                        <p>There are three areas to the conjunctiva:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Palpebral conjunctiva</b> - lines the upper and lower lids.</li>
                            <li><b>Bulbar conjunctiva</b> - reflects back to cover the sclera up to the limbus.</li>
                            <li><b>Fornices</b> - the upper and lower fornices are blind sacs, formed where the bulbar
                                and palpebral conjunctiva fold back over each other.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Layers of the conjunctiva</h3>
                        <p>The epithelial layer contains the goblet cells; the stromal layer contains the blood vessels,
                            nerves and the glands of Krause and Wolfring (in upper only).</p>
                        <p>The conjunctiva is connected to Tenon's Capsule around the limbus. Elsewhere it is loosely
                            attached, especially in the fornices where there are folds of the conjunctiva. This allows
                            for easy mobility of the eyeball.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Functions of the conjunctiva</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allows easy movement of the eyeball.</li>
                            <li>Goblet cells provide mucin for the tear film.</li>
                            <li>It is a protective layer to the eyeball by being a physical barrier and by its rich
                                blood supply.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blood supply</h3>
                        <p>There is a rich blood supply, especially in the fornices, delivered and drained via:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anterior ciliary artery and vein</li>
                            <li>superior and inferior medial palpebral artery and vein</li>
                            <li>conjunctival artery and vein.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nerve supply</h3>
                        <p>The nerve supply to the conjunctiva is by the long ciliary branch of the nasociliary nerve
                            from the trigeminal nerve.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lymphatic drainage</h3>
                        <p>Lymphatic drainage is through the pre-auricular, parotid and submaxillary nodes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bacterial conjunctivitis</h4>
                        <p>Bacterial conjunctivitis can be either acute or chronic.</p>
                        <h5>Causative organisms</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Streptococcus.</li>
                            <li>Staphylococcus aureus.</li>
                            <li>Рлеитососсия.</li>
                            <li>Gопососсиs.</li>
                            <li>Haemolytic Streptococcus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Signs</h5>
                        <p>Typically there is conjunctival injection, especially in the fornices where the blood supply
                            is rich (Fig. 7.1). The eye may, on the other hand, be white or only mildly red. Discharge
                            is variable, but typically is present in the mornings, and on waking the eye is difficult to
                            open because the eyelids are stuck together. This is a very important point when taking a
                            history from a patient with suspected conjunctivitis. The eyelids may be red and inflamed.
                            The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. The vision is always unaffected and there is
                            usually no pain. The patient may complain of a gritty or foreign body sensation, some
                            discomfort and very occasionally very mild photophobia.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Check the patient's visual acuity.</li>
                            <li>Swabs are only necessary if there is any doubt of the diagnosis or if the condition has
                                not resolved.</li>
                            <li>Obtain an accurate history from patient to determine a correct diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>Examination of the eye on slit lamp to confirm diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Clean the eye(s) and instruct the patient on cleaning it (them), using cooled, boiled
                                water.</li>
                            <li>Give verbal and written instruction on how to instil the eye drops. This is usually
                                Chloramphenicol drops, which may be prescribed four times a day for a period of 7-10
                                days. In severe cases, Chloramphenicol drops may be prescribed every two hours for two
                                days and then four times a day for 7-10 days. If warranted, an ointment can also be
                                prescribed for night-time application. In order to reduce the risk of complication
                                arising from the use of chloramphenicol drops, it is advisable to check for any
                                family/history of blood disorder since there have been reported cases of aplastic
                                anaemia (Field, Martin & Witchell, 1999). Caution should also be exercised in women who
                                are pregnant. If in doubt, Fucidic Acid (Fucithalmic) can be prescribed instead. In
                                children, it is wise to prescribe Fucidic Acid as this only necessitates a twice-daily
                                drop regime.</li>
                            <li>Instruct patient on how to prevent the spread of infection either to his other eye or to
                                other members of the household:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Wash hands before and after instilling eye medications.</li>
                                    <li>Use separate face flannels and towels in the home, as this is the usual method
                                        of spread of infection. Change face flannels and towels daily.</li>
                                    <li>Use clean tissues rather than handkerchief to reduce the spread of infection.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Change pillowcases daily.</li>
                                    <li>Keep Chloramphenicol drops in a cool place, preferably in a fridge.</li>
                                    <li>Never share drops and ointment with anyone else.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>It is important that patients are reminded to finish all the prescribed course of
                                treatment.</li>
                            <li>Warn him not to wear a pad over the eye, as it provides a suitable environment for a
                                further bacterial growth.</li>
                            <li>If eye make-up is used, advise the patient to discard and buy new cosmetics when
                                infection has cleared up.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Severe conjunctivitis occurring in a baby less than 28 days old is a notifiable disease. This
                            may be caused by Gonococcus, Streptococcus, or Chlamydia which is the most common cause.
                            However, this condition needs to be distinguished from the neonatal conjunctivitis caused by
                            nasolacrimal obstruction with other bacterial infection, trauma and inclusion conjunctivitis
                            agents.</p>

                            Trachoma is caused by serotypes A, Ba, C. It is common in hot, dry climates where there is a
                            low standard of hygiene and flies are abundant. The disease runs a long and chronic course.
                            The incubation period is $5-14$ days. In a child, the onset is insidious, but it is acute in
                            an adult.</p>

                        <p>Fungal conjunctivitis is caused by Candida albicans. Babies can be affected during birth
                            through an infected birth canal. Fine white plaques are apparent on the conjunctiva.
                            Affected adults have blepharitis.</p>
                        <p>The treatment is with nystatin drops and ointment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Subconjunctival haemorrhage</h3>
                        <p>Subconjunctival haemorrhage occurs as a result of blunt or penetrating injury (see Chapter
                            14) but it can also occur spontaneously or as a result of a sudden increase in pressure in
                            the eye, as occurs with violent sneezing or heavy lifting. The subconjunctival blood vessels
                            burst, with the affected area varying in size; in severe cases the haemorrhage can cover the
                            whole of the sclera causing swelling but usually sparing the superior aspect as it pools
                            inferiorly from gravity. In cases occurring spontaneously, the patients usually have few
                            symptoms apart from a dull ache. It is a condition that looks more severe than it is. It can
                            be a sign of hypertension, vascular disease or a blood clotting disorder.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing action</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask the patient if he had exerted any undue pressure before the haemorrhage occurred,
                                e.g. by heavy digging in the garden, sneezing fit, rubbing the eye.</li>
                            <li>Take the blood pressure; if abnormal, inform the doctor.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the patient that the haemorrhage will not cover the cornea.</li>
                            <li>Inform him that it may spread further before it begins to resolve and that it may take
                                two to three weeks to clear completely, similar to a bruise. Usually there is no
                                specific treatment.</li>
                            <li>Check if patients are on Aspirin, Warfarin or any other relevant medication.</li>
                            <li>Advise patient to see GP for advice such as INR check if appropriate.</li>
                            <li>If sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is as a result of trauma, the eye has to be carefully
                                examined under the slit lamp for any other injuries.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pterygium</h3>
                        <p>A pterygium is a triangular-shaped nodule in the conjunctiva (Fig. 7.5), usually occurring on
                            the nasal side, but it can be temporal. It usually occurs in people who live in hot, dry
                            climates or who work in the open air. It is a degenerative process and can encroach on the
                            cornea. If it affects the vision, it can be removed under local anaesthetic. Beta rays or
                            cytotoxic eyedrops can be given following removal to prevent recurrence.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pinguecula</h3>
                        <p>A pinguecula is a yellow, triangular nodule found in the conjunctiva of the elderly and in
                            people who work in exposed conditions. It affects the nasal side and later the temporal
                            side. It does not spread to the cornea and no treatment is necessary unless it becomes
                            inflamed, when steroid drops will reduce the condition. It can be removed for cosmetic
                            reasons.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Concretions</h3>
                        <p>Concretions are white deposits found in the conjunctiva. They are fairly common and are
                            usually symptomless. Occasionally they are large enough to give a foreign-body sensation,
                            when they can be removed under local anaesthetic (see p. 51). If bleeding occurs during this
                            procedure, a pad and bandage should be applied.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conjunctival cysts</h3>
                        <p>Cysts can occur in the conjunctiva. If they cause symptoms, they are easily punctured under
                            local anaesthetic (see p. 51). This can be a recurrent condition.</p>
