                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The ophthalmic patient may be of any age, from a few days to over 100 years old. Ophthalmic
                            conditions affect all age groups, though most of the ophthalmic patients seen are elderly.
                        </p>
                        <p>Most infants and children will have parents who wish to be involved in their child's care.
                            The child whose parents are either unable or unwilling to become involved will need the
                            extra care and attention of a nurse to reassure him in unfamiliar and possibly frightening
                            surroundings.</p>
                        <p>The ophthalmic patient may have other diseases such as diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis and
                            arthritis, as these have ocular manifestations. He may also suffer from unrelated diseases.
                            Co-morbidity can be challenging for the ophthalmic nurse who will have to make decisions
                            about care and management based on need.</p>
                        <p>The ophthalmic patient will arrive at the eye hospital or unit either as a referral to the
                            outpatient department or as a casualty, where many are selfreferred and may not be
                            'emergencies' as such. They will present with a variety of conditions, from a lump on the
                            lid to sudden visual loss or severe ocular trauma.</p>
                        <p>Most people will be anxious on a first visit to a hospital. Even for the elderly but
                            otherwise fit person, it might be his first experience of a hospital. Those arriving
                            following trauma will be in varying degrees of shock depending on the nature and type of
                            accident. They and their relatives may be very anxious. Something that seems fairly minor to
                            the nurse with ophthalmic knowledge may, to the layman, appear serious and be thought to
                            threaten sight.</p>
                        <p>Many people have a fear of their eyes being touched, making examination difficult. Some feel
                            faint - or do faint - while certain procedures, such as removal of a foreign body, are being
                            performed.</p>
                        <p>There are some old wives' tales about the eye. One of the most common is that the eye can be
                            removed from the socket for examination and treatment, and be replaced afterwards. This kind
                            of false information does not help the patient's frame of mind.</p>
                        <p>Each person will arrive at the hospital with his own individual personality and past
                            experience to influence any attitude towards the eye condition.</p>
                        <p>Some will be stoical, others extremely agitated. Those with chronic or recurrent eye
                            conditions may become more used to visiting the eye hospital. Most patients having
                            ophthalmic surgery are outpatients, day cases or overnight-stay patients. This means they
                            have a very short time to adjust to the hospital setting and have little time to ask the
                            questions that may be initially forgotten in the midst of all the activity. They may feel
                            reluctant to express minor concerns when there appears to be little contact time with
                            nurses.</p>
                        <p>The actual visual impairment experienced by the patient will vary with the eye condition.
                            With many conditions there is no, or only slight, visual impairment and this may be
                            temporary. Others cause gross visual loss that may have occurred suddenly or gradually over
                            the years. This visual loss may be untreatable and permanent, may be progressive, or sight
                            may be restored. Some patients will have only one eye affected and others both eyes,
                            probably to different degrees. Some will have blurred vision; some will only be able to make
                            out movements. Others will be able to differentiate only between light and dark, or will see
                            nothing at all. Some will have lost their central vision, others their peripheral vision.
                            Some patients will see better in bright light than dim light, and vice versa. Some degrees
                            of visual loss can be very upsetting to the patient and prove to be a severe impairment to
                            daily living. All patients experiencing severe visual loss will require practical and
                            emotional help in coming to terms with it, regardless of the cause and the course it has
                            taken.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Research carried out by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) (Bruce et al.,
                            1991) suggested that three-quarters of people eligible for registration are not in fact
                            registered. There is no reason to suppose that this situation has changed. People are
                            reluctant to take the final step as it can appear to be the giving up of any hope that
                            treatment will help. But this need not be the case. Blind or partial sight registration can
                            be a much more liberating experience for many as they realise, with help and support, that
                            they can maximise their quality of life.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blind register</h3>
                        <p>The statutory definition for the purpose of registration as a blind person under the National
                            Assistance Act 1948 is that the person 'is so blind as to be unable to perform any work for
                            which eyesight is essential'. This refers to any form of employment, not only that which the
                            patient formerly followed. It also only takes into account visual impairment, disregarding
                            other bodily or mental infirmities. People with a visual acuity of less than $3/60$ on the
                            Snellen chart (see p. 21) or with a visual acuity of $6/60$ but with a marked peripheral
                            field defect will be eligible for registration.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Partially sighted register</h3>
                        <p>There is no statutory definition of partial sight although a person who does not qualify to
                            be registered as blind but nevertheless is substantially visually impaired can be registered
                            as partially sighted. Those people with $3/60$ to $6/60$ vision and full peripheral field,
                            those with vision up to $3/60$ with moderate visual field contraction, opacities in the
                            media, aphakia and those with $6/18$ or better visual acuity but marked field loss can be
                            included on this register. In England and Wales a Letter of Vision Impairment (LVI 2003) is
                            obtainable from high street optometrists. In outpatient settings staff complete the Referral
                            of Vision Impaired Patient (RVI 2003). Patients can obtain one if eligible and take this to
                            their social services department.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assistance and rehabilitation</h3>
                        <p>The National Assistance Act 1948 directs all local authorities to compile a register of blind
                            and partially sighted people residing in their area and to provide advice, guidance and
                            services to enable them and their families to maintain their independence and live as full a
                            life as possible.</p>
                        <p>Registration is voluntary. People can choose to register but if they do register they can
                            have their names removed from the register at any time should they wish. The local authority
                            has the responsibility of reviewing the register regularly and updating the circumstances of
                            the people on it. Local authorities must offer services to all those identified as visually
                            impaired, whether they choose to register or not. However, registration is necessary to
                            qualify for financial benefits and for help from the many voluntary organisations.
                            Registration is a good guide as to whether a person is coming to terms with their sight
                            loss.</p>
                        <p>The process of registration starts with the ophthalmologist certifying on a form. A new
                            system for registering as blind was introduced in England and Wales in November 2003. The
                            Certificate of Visual Impairment (CVI 2003) replaces the old BD 8. It is argued that the new
                            system is easier to use and will speed up the process. The BP1 in Scotland and A655 in
                            Northern Ireland are still in place that a person is eligible for either blind or partially
                            sighted registration. The person signs this form agreeing for information on the form to be
                            shared with their local social services, general practitioner and the Department of
                            Population Census which maintains records of all those opting to share this information.</p>
                        <p>The Social Services Department has the responsibility of registering people. Some social
                            services departments have delegated this task to their local voluntary organisation which
                            deals with the blind and partially sighted people within their area. The role of the social
                            worker is that of counsellor. They provide support and information about the services
                            available. This includes entitlement to benefits and referral to other statutory bodies
                            involved with retraining, special needs education for those of school and college age,
                            rehabilitation, employment, social, leisure and recreational activities, and introduction to
                            self-help groups.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are a number of voluntary organisations that work with the visually impaired. Most
                            local areas or counties have their own organisations. These are established to provide aids
                            and social contact for the visually impaired. Many local authorities have an arrangement
                            with voluntary organisations to provide services to facilitate independent living such as
                            talking or tactile watches and clocks, to alarms that sound when rained upon so that the
                            washing can be brought in. The increase in technology has resulted in equipment being
                            available, for example, to enlarge print onto a TV screen, to convert the written word into
                            Braille or to use voice synthesisers.</p>
                        <p>Local voluntary organisations are often centres of social contact for the visually impaired
                            and their carers. Some voluntary organisations maintain contact through radio stations;
                            Glasgow for example has a radio station dedicated entirely to people with visual impairment.
                        </p>
                        <p>The needs of people from ethnic minority groups should not be overlooked. Ethnic Enable
                            (www.ethnicenable.com) is an organisation set up to assist people with visual impairment who
                            are from specific ethnic groups.</p>
