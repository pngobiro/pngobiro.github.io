                        <p>The retina is composed of ten layers: one epithelial layer and nine neural layers. There is a
                            potential space between the epithelial layer and neural layers which is significant in
                            retinal detachment. The retina extends from the ora serrata anteriorly to the optic disc
                            posteriorly where the nerve fibres leave the eye as the optic nerve.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ten layers of the retina</h3>
                        <p>These are illustrated in Fig. 12.1:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The epithelial layer lies at the posterior of the structure beneath the choroid and
                                contains varying amounts of melanin pigment. It absorbs light that is not picked up by
                                the rods and cones.</li>
                            <li>The receptor layer contains the rods and cones, which are the two main types of nerve
                                endings in the retina. The rods, numbering about 120 million in each eye, are situated
                                mainly at the periphery of the retina. They function in dim light. The cones, numbering
                                around seven million in each eye, are situated at the centre of the retina and are
                                concentrated, in particular, in the fovea of the macula. They function in bright light,
                                pick up colours and make detailed vision possible.</li>
                            <li>The external limiting membrane is like a sheet of wire netting and has a supportive
                                function.</li>
                            <li>The outer nuclear layer contains the nuclei of the rods and cones.</li>
                            <li>The outer plexiform layer contains the axons of the rods and cones and the dendrites of
                                the bipolar cells.</li>
                            <li>The inner nuclear layer contains the nuclei of the bipolar cells.</li>
                            <li>The inner plexiform layer contains the axons of bipolar cells and the dendrites of the
                                ganglion cells.</li>
                            <li>The ganglion cell layer contains the nuclei of the ganglion cells.</li>
                            <li>The nerve fibre layer contains the axons of the ganglion cells which pass through the
                                optic disc and lamina cibrosa to become continuous with the optic nerve.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Areas of the retina</h3>
                        <p><b>Ora serrata:</b> the anterior termination of the retina where the retinal pigment
                            epithelial layer continues forwards to become the ciliary epithelium. The neural layer of
                            the retina ends at the ora serrata.</p>
                        <p><b>Macula (Fig. 12.2):</b> an area of the retina 1.5 mm in diameter situated 3 mm to the
                            temporal side of the optic disc. It contains a high concentration of cones. In its centre is
                            the fovea centralis, a slight depression where only cones are present. The other layers of
                            the retina are absent here, causing a depression and making it thinner than the rest of the
                            retina. The macula is the region of the retina where central precise vision takes place. It
                            is not completely developed until six months after birth. No blood vessels cross the macula
                            and it receives its blood supply entirely from the choriocapillaries.</p>
                        <p><b>Optic disc (Fig. 12.2):</b> the area of the retina where the axons of the ganglion cells
                            leave the eye through the lamina cribrosa to become continuous with the optic nerve. It
                            therefore contains no nerve cells, so that vision cannot take place here. This is known as
                            the 'blind spot'. The central retinal artery and vein pass through the optic disc. Its blood
                            supply is from the posterior ciliary artery, a branch of the temporal artery.</p>

                        <p>The outer layers of the retina are supplied by the choriocapillaries of the choroid. The
                            inner layers of the retina are supplied by the central retinal artery. The central retinal
                            vein drains the venous blood.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Function of the retina</h3>
                        <p>The retinal nerve cells pick up and transmit impulses from light rays reaching the retina.
                            These impulses then travel via the optic pathways to the visual cortex where they are
                            interpreted as sight (see Fig. 12.3). As light rays travel in straight lines they will fall
                            on the diagonally opposite area of the retina from the object in view; for example, the
                            light rays from an object viewed superiorly will fall on the inferior area of the retina.
                            The same happens on the horizontal plane. The brain converts the image so it appears the
                            right way up.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The optic nerve</h3>
                        <p>The optic nerve runs from the optic disc through the optic foramen to the optic chiasma where
                            it becomes the optic tract. It is 5 cm in length and surrounded by pia mater, arachnoid
                            mater and dura mater. Its blood supply is via the ophthalmic artery and vein.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The optic pathways</h4>
                        <p>These are illustrated in Fig. 12.3. The optic nerve leaves each eye, passing through the
                            optic foramen to the optic chiasma. From there the fibres from the left-hand side of each
                            eye travel in the left-hand side of the brain and the right-hand fibres travel in the
                            right-hand side of the brain. Thus the nasal fibres in the left eye cross at the chiasma to
                            travel on the right side and the nasal fibres of the right eye cross to travel on the left
                            side. The temporal fibres of each eye stay on their respective side. From the optic chiasma
                            the fibres travel in the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate bodies where they pass into
                            the optic radiations. From there the fibres pass to the visual area of the occipital cortex
                            where sight is interpreted.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The vitreous</h3>
                        <p>The vitreous fills the vitreous chamber which is the posterior segment of the eye lying
                            between the lens and the retina (not to be confused with the posterior chamber).</p>
                        <p>It is a semi-gelatinous, transparent substance having no blood or nerve supply.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Composition</h4>
                        <p>The vitreous is $98\%-99\%$ water; and $1\%-2\%$ hyaluronic acid and collagen fibres.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Attachments</h4>
                        <p>The vitreous is attached more firmly to the underlying retina at the ora serrata and around
                            the optic disc. Elsewhere it lies loosely against the retina. Sometimes it attaches itself
                            to blood vessels, which could bleed if the vitreous pulled on them.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Functions of the vitreous</h4>
                        <p><b>Refractions of light:</b> the light rays travel in a converged manner through the vitreous
                            towards the retina.</p>
                        <p>It maintains the shape of the eye; if it were lost, the eye would collapse. Vitreous cannot
                            be replaced naturally by the eye.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Colour vision</h3>
                        <p>The cones in the retina can be divided into three types: red, blue and green. Each of these
                            types is sensitive to different light rays. The red absorb long waves, the green mid-length
                            waves and the blue short waves. These differing wave lengths - or a combination of them -
                            are interpreted as colour.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Rhodopsin</h3>
                        <p>Rhodopsin is a photosensitive chemical present in the rods in the retina. In low-intensity
                            light rhodopsin breaks down, taking a few moments to work and enabling the eye to adapt to
                            dim light. When changing from low intensity light to bright light, it takes a few seconds to
                            bleach the rhodopsin and enable the eye to adapt to bright light. Vitamin A is necessary for
                            rhodopsin to function, thus a deficiency of vitamin A can lead to night blindness.</p>
