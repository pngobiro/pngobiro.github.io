                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Ophthalmic nursing procedures will vary to some degree between hospitals or units. Those
                            listed here can be used as guidelines but local policies must be followed. It is also
                            important to remember that all ophthalmic nursing procedures should take into account
                            patient education, infection control and health and safety.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Education of the ophthalmic patient</h3>
                        <p>Most ophthalmic nursing and medical procedures carried out can seem extremely daunting to the
                            patient and the majority of patients can be squeamish of any procedures involving their
                            eyes. It is therefore very important that prior to any nursing and medical procedures the
                            patient is fully informed of the nature and process of the procedure. Explanations must take
                            into account the patient's learning style and intellectual ability, their physical and
                            emotional state and any sensory deficits.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infection control</h3>
                        <p>Extra-ocular and intra-ocular infection can have a potentially devastating effect on the
                            ocular diagnosis of the patient and their carers and the importance of hand washing before
                            and after each patient contact cannot be overemphasised. Infection control also includes
                            other measures such as employing single-use disposable items, correct decontamination and
                            sterilisation of equipment; correct sharps and waste disposal; and observing standard and
                            transmission based precautions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Health and safety issues</h3>
                        <p>When performing ophthalmic procedures, the patient's head should always be well supported to
                            prevent any accidental damage to the eye. All ophthalmic procedures should be performed with
                            a good light source and adequate magnification. Any used ophthalmic instruments should
                            follow National Guidelines for decontamination and instructions for any 'single patient use'
                            equipment must be stringently adhered to.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Visual acuity is the measurement of acuteness of central vision only. An accurate assessment
                            of visual acuity is one of the most important parts of any ophthalmic examination. Visual
                            acuity is a test of the visual system from the occipital cortex to the cornea. Accurate
                            visual acuity testing requires:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>patient's co-operation and comprehension of the test</li>
                            <li>ability to recognise the forms displayed</li>
                            <li>clear ocular media and correct focusing</li>
                            <li>ability of the eyes to converge simultaneously</li>
                            <li>good retinal function</li>
                            <li>intact visual pathways and occipital cortex.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When all these criteria are present, it is a good test of macula function (North, 2001).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Common charts used in the measurement of distance visual acuity
                        </h3>
                        <p>The most common chart for measuring distance visual acuity in a literate adult is the Snellen
                            chart.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Distance vision (Fig. 3.1)</h4>
                        <p>Distance vision is tested at 6 m as rays of light from this distance are nearly parallel. If
                            the patient wears glasses constantly, vision may be recorded with and without glasses, but
                            this must be noted on the record. Each eye is tested and recorded separately, the other
                            being covered with a card held by the examiner.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_528bfcb6246e1ffc35cag-029-1.jpg"

                        </figure>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Snellen's test type</h4>
                        <p>Heavy block letters, numbers or symbols printed in black on a white background, are arranged
                            on a chart in nine rows of graded size, diminishing from the top downwards. The top letter
                            can be read by the normal eye at a distance of 60 m , and the following rows should be read
                            at $36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, 5, 4$ m respectively.</p>
                        <p>The patient is seated 6 m from the chart, which must be adequately lit, and asked to read
                            down to the smallest letter he can distinguish, using one eye at a time.</p>
                        <p>Visual acuity is expressed as a fraction and abbreviated as VA. The numerator is the distance
                            in metres at which a person can read a given line of letters. The denominator is the
                            distance at which a person with normal average vision can read the same line, e.g. if the
                            seventh line is read at a distance of 6 m , this is VA 6/6. If some letters in the line are
                            read but not all, it is expressed as, for example, VA 6/6-2, or VA 6/9 + 2.</p>
                        <p>For vision less than $6/60$ the distance between the patient and the chart is reduced a metre
                            at a time and the vision is recorded accordingly as, for example, $5/60, 4/60, 3/60, 2/60,
                            1/60$.</p>
                        <p>If the patient cannot read the top letter at a distance of 1 metre, the examiner's hand is
                            held at $0.9$ m, $0.6$ m or $0.3$ m away against a dark background and the patient is asked
                            to count the number of fingers held up. If he answers correctly, record VA = CF (count
                            fingers). For less vision the hand is moved in front of the eye at 0.3 m , record VA = HM
                            (hand movement).</p>
                        <p>In the case of less vision, test for projection of light by shining a torch into the eye from
                            different directions to see if the patient can tell from which direction it comes. If he
                            sees the light but not the direction, it is noted as VA = PL (perception of light). This
                            test is performed in a dark room. If no light is seen, record NO PL, which is total
                            blindness. A 'pinhole disc' is used if the VA is less than $6/6$ or $6/9$, which may improve
                            VA. If considerable increase in vision is obtained, it may usually be assumed that there is
                            no gross abnormality, but a refractive error.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">General considerations when performing visual acuity</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to assess accurately a patient's visual acuity (both distance and near), it is
                                extremely important that the test type or reading material is correctly illuminated,
                                i.e. if using a Snellen box, that all the bulbs are in working order. When testing a
                                patient's near vision, ensure that there is an adequate light source.</li>
                            <li>It is also important to record if a patient uses contact lenses and if these were worn
                                at time of testing.</li>
                            <li>Since each eye is tested separately, it is a good idea to occlude the other eye with his
                                outpatient card or occluder to avoid patient 'cheating' by looking through the gaps
                                between their fingers. Similarly it is a good idea to rotate the chart round for
                                frequent attendees to the eye outpatient to minimise patients memorising the letters on
                                the chart.</li>
                            <li>It is important that the appropriate testing chart, such as the Sheridan Gardner test
                                chart, Kay picture chart or the E chart (see below for explanations), is used on
                                patients with any learning disabilities and language difficulties. Good communication
                                skills and patience are needed in these circumstances</li>
                            <li>The measurement of visual acuity in children also requires special skill and patience
                                and it is important that an appropriate chart is used on those who are unable to
                                recognise the alphabet.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sheridan Gardner test chart</h4>
                        <p>This chart can be used for children and patients who are illiterate. This test type has a
                            single reversible letter on each line. For example, A,V,N. The child holds the card with
                            these letters printed on. The child is asked to point to the letter on his card which
                            corresponds to the letter on the test type. This test can be used for very young children as
                            well as they do not have to name a letter.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Kay Picture chart</h4>
                        <p>This chart is again used with patients who are illiterate or children. Instead of letters,
                            the book contains pictures. The pictures in the book are also of varying sizes. The patient
                            is asked what the picture represents. In order to avoid any misunderstanding amongst
                            patients with language difficulties, it is good practice to ask the hospital's official
                            interpreter to translate for patients.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">E chart</h4>
                        <p>This again is mainly used for patients who are illiterate. In the chart, the Es face in
                            different directions. The patient is asked to hold a wooden E in his hand and to turn it the
                            same way as the one the examiner is pointing to on the test chart.</p>
                        <p>It is important to remember that apart from the Snellen chart, any other charts used to test
                            the patient's visual acuity must be written down, for example, if the Kay picture chart is
                            used, this must be indicated in the notes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">LogMAR chart</h4>
                        <p>The logMAR (Fig. 3.2) chart has been designed to overcome some of the limitations of the
                            Snellen chart in measuring distance visual acuity. There are five letters of 'almost equal
                            legibility' on each of the rows. Spacing between letters on each row is equal to one letter
                            width and spacing between rows is equal to the height of the letters on the smaller row. The
                            chart is designed for a standard testing at 4 m.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Near vision</h3>
                        <p>Near vision is tested by cards consisting of different sizes of ordinary printer's type, each
                            card being numbered. The eyes are tested and recorded separately, and if the patient uses
                            reading glasses, these should be worn during the test.</p>
                        <p>The card is held at a comfortable distance (approximately 25 cm ) and should be well
                            illuminated by a light from behind the patient's shoulder. The near vision is recorded as
                            the card number of the smallest size type he can most easily read.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Although the main focus in this section is on examining the eye, it is good nursing practice
                            to take a holistic approach to patient care. Ensure that the patient you are going to
                            examine is made comfortable and pain free. For any patients with a traumatic eye injury,
                            ensure that the patient is not suffering from shock and has not sustained any other
                            injuries. Always consider the patient's age and psychological state.</p>
                        <p>Patients attending with an acute eye problem should always have their ophthalmic history
                            taken first to ascertain the nature and acuteness of the problem. For example, patients
                            attending with a chemical injury treatment should always be instigated prior to examining
                            the eye.</p>
                        <p>When examining a patient's eye, first look at the patient's face as a whole to determine
                            facial symmetry and note any obvious palsy, ptosis, proptosis, obvious trauma, ocular
                            movement or allergic reactions.</p>
                        <p>The eye is always examined from the outside inwards. If only one eye is affected, inspect the
                            'good' eye first for comparison.</p>
                        <p>Ask the patient to open both eyes as this is easier than opening one. Use a slit-lamp or a
                            good pen torch. Ensure that the patient's head is well supported. If the patient is in pain,
                            topical anaesthetic drops may be necessary. However, the patient's pain must be assessed
                            before administering any topical anaesthetic. The patient's pain can be assessed using a
                            pain-rating tool such as the verbal pain scale. Care should be taken not to 'misuse' the
                            topical anaesthetic in controlling a patient's corneal pain since this can actually delay
                            corneal epithelial healing. On no account must these drops be given to the patient to take
                            home. If the patient is in a great deal of pain, more effective oral analgesia or a
                            non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Voltarol can be prescribed.</p>
                        <p>If there is a history of glass or fibreglass in the eye or the history indicates possible
                            penetrating injury or perforation, local anaesthetic should not be instilled. The reason for
                            the former is to more easily identify if the glass/ fibreglass has been removed; the latter
                            to avoid the drug entering the eye.</p>

                                patient receives the correct procedure and to obtain the patient's consent and
                                co-operation.</li>

                                became contaminated. Essential in order to prevent infection from transient organisms.

                            <li>Assemble equipment. If both eyes are to be swabbed label swabs 'right' and 'left' in

                        <p>When teaching patients and carers the correct technique for cleaning and instilling
                            drops/ointment to the eye, there are some general principles to follow (Shaw, 2001).</p>
                        <p>The aim of all eye medications is to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect from the
                            ophthalmic medications and to minimise risks, side effects and complications associated with
                            their use.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The medication is delivered in a manner that avoids risk of trauma and/or cross
                                infection. The latter includes care of drop dispenser and any drop aid used, and
                                instillation technique.</li>
                            <li>The drops and ointment should be administered in the correct strength, to the correct
                                patient, into the correct eye, at the correct time and at the appropriate interval.</li>
                            <li>All patients must have their drop technique assessed even if they are currently
                                instilling drops for other ophthalmic conditions, e.g. chronic glaucoma.</li>
                            <li>Maximise the opportunity for self-medication by the patient, taking into account their
                                state of well-being. Style and technique will vary between individuals; if the patient
                                is observed to have a drop technique that is adequate, do not change it. Where
                                necessary, make the arrangements for district nurse support.</li>
                            <li>In a hospital setting, a record must be kept of all drops instilled and ointment
                                applied.</li>
                            <li>Medication that has passed its expiry date must not be used. Any opened drops and
                                medication must not be used after 28 days (British Medical Association & Royal
                                Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 2004).</li>
                            <li>Patients need to know the action and the possible side effects of their medication.</li>
                            <li>Unless directed otherwise by medical staff, ask the patient to remove their contact
                                lenses prior to instilling drops and ointment. Depending on the patient's ocular
                                problem, it may be necessary to advise the patient to stop wearing contact lenses until
                                the condition has resolved and treatment is completed.</li>
                            <li>Patients need to know that drops can sting and may leave an unpleasant taste in the
                                mouth.</li>
                            <li>If patients are on more than one type of drop and/or ointment to the same eye, the order
                                of delivery should be as per pharmacy criteria.</li>
                            <li>Normally, one drop is sufficient. Additional drops may reduce the effectiveness as this
                                increases tear duct stimulation and outflow. It may also increase the amount of
                                systematic absorption. In addition, any excess drops may overflow onto the cheek and
                                over a period of time may cause skin irritation.</li>
                            <li>The capacity of the fornix is approximately $30 \mu\text{l}$ and the average drop size
                                is between $25-50 \mu\text{l}$.</li>
                            <li>With certain medications, there will be a specific request from the ophthalmologist to
                                occlude the punctum to reduce still further any risk of systemic absorption via mucous
                                membranes of the canaliculi, nose and mouth. However, some medications may be prescribed
                                specifically for their action on the lacrimal apparatus and so punctal occlusion is not
                                desirable. In addition, it is not desirable to occlude the punctum digitally following
                                some types of surgery.</li>
                            <li>As the period for effective therapeutic absorption of medication is from 1 to 1.5
                                minutes, patients should be taught to close their eyes slowly and to keep closed for a
                                slow count to 60. Keeping the lids gently closed without squeezing reduces lacrimal duct
                                outflow and maximises medication contact with ocular structures (Wilson & O'Mahoney,
                                1999).</li>
                            <li>An appropriate time interval of approximately three minutes is necessary between each
                                drop in order to prevent dilution and overflow.</li>
                            <li>All medication should be delivered to the correct location. This is generally the lower
                                fornix but can include the cornea, lids, periocular wounds and the socket.</li>
                            <li>Drops must be stored according to manufacturers' instructions. This includes some drops
                                to be stored in a refrigerator at all times when not in use and others only in the
                                refrigerator before opening.</li>
                            <li>Before using eye drops, patients - or whoever is instilling the drops - should be
                                instructed to shake the bottle to ensure even distribution.</li>
                            <li>Pharmacy will label all drop boxes with patient, dose, order and storage instructions.
                                They will also have available upon request, large print labels.</li>
                            <li>Certain medications may have an effect on vision. This effect may be transient or last
                                the duration of the treatment.</li>

                            <li>Ointment should be applied after any prescribed drops have been instilled leaving
                                approximately a three minute interval between medications.</li>
                            <li>Ointment may be prescribed for structures other than the eye.</li>
                            <li>Ointment may be prescribed for use after first dressing, and this may not happen for up
                                to one week in the case of some oculoplastic surgery.</li>
                            <li>If requested, visual acuity should be recorded before ointment is applied as ointment
                                clouds vision. Any existing ointment excess is normally removed prior to taking visual
                                acuity measurement.</li>
                            <li>A 2.5 cm (one inch) strip of ointment should be applied to the inner edge of the lower
                                fornix of the appropriate eye.</li>
                            <li>The patient should close their eye and remove excess ointment with a swab.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be advised that the ointment is likely to cause blurring of vision
                                because of its viscous nature.</li>
                            <li>In the case of wounds on the lids, face or eye socket, ointment should be squeezed
                                directly onto the wound. It may be dispersed using a moistened swab. If requested to do
                                so by the ophthalmic surgeon, the wound or scar should be massaged using the ointment.

                        <p>Compliance with medication or other therapeutic regimen may be defined as a 'responsible
                            process of self care, in which the patient works to maintain his or her health in close
                            collaboration with health care staff; instead of following rules that are prescribed, the
                            patient shows an active commitment to self care.' (Kyngas et al., 2000).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drops and ointment are drugs and some eye medications will have a systemic affect other
                                than on the eye.</li>
                            <li>All trust/employer policies for drug administration should be followed in conjunction
                                with these principles. This includes hand hygiene.</li>
                            <li>Explain to the patient what you are going to do and obtain their consent and
                                co-operation.</li>
                            <li>Where appropriate, involve the patient/partner/carer. Involve the district nurse where
                                it is felt necessary to ensure the eye treatment is delivered.</li>
                            <li>Staff should be honest about effects and side effects of drops including stinging and
                                discomfort.</li>
                            <li>For inpatients - including any day cases - a patient already on glaucoma medication
                                prior to surgery, should have it confirmed that any new medication prescribed is in
                                addition to or instead of the glaucoma medication.</li>
                            <li>Before the patient is discharged, always ensure that all relevant eye medications,
                                including any that the patient may have been on prior to any ocular surgery, have been
                                prescribed.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The medical and nursing staff will tell the patient about the drops or ointment used.
                            </li>
                            <li>The nursing staff will instruct the patient on when and how to instil their drops and/or
                                apply ointment safely.</li>
                            <li>Staff should instruct the patient about the importance of hand washing before and after
                                instilling drops or applying ointment to help prevent infection.</li>
                            <li>Staff must ask the patient about any current medication as this could affect the choice
                                of treatment.</li>
                            <li>Pharmacy and nursing staff should determine the best way to help the patient distinguish
                                between the different types of drop bottles that have been prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Nursing and medical staff should talk with the patient at each visit about how they are
                                managing the drops or ointment regimen.</li>
                            <li>Staff should advise the patient that devices are available for purchase to help with eye
                                drop administration. These include bottle attachments to help squeeze the bottle; those
                                to help open the cap; and those to help the patient remember to take the next drop.
                                Information on these devices is available in the hospital pharmacy or community
                                pharmacy. The district nurse or practice nurse may also have the relevant information.
                            </li>
                            <li>Remind the patient that drops and ointments are prescribed for their use only. They
                                should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, which in some cases will
                                be in the refrigerator.</li>
                            <li>As with all drugs, advise the patient that medications should be stored in a place out
                                of reach of children and animals.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Check identity of the patient and drops/ointment against the prescription with assistant
                                if available. Check that the drops/ointment have not expired. In order to ensure the
                                correct patient receives the correct drops/ointment and to obtain the patient's consent
                                and co-operation.</li>
                            <li>Wash hands at the beginning and end of the procedure, and at any point when your hands
                                became contaminated.</li>
                            <li>Position hand holding bottle/dropper/tube gently on patient's forehead. This helps to
                                prevent bottle/dropper/tube touching patient's eye if moved.</li>
                            <li>Hold down lower lid with tissue/gauze square in other hand. This exposes conjunctival
                                sac into which drop/ointment can be instilled.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient to look up. This ensures that drop falls into lower fornix and not onto
                                the cornea which would cause patient to blink.</li>
                            <li>Instil one drop into lower fornix towards outer canthus or squeeze 5 mm ointment along
                                lower fornix from inner canthus towards outer canthus. If the drop is instilled near
                                inner canthus it will drain straight down the tear duct before it is of any therapeutic
                                value. Only one drop to be instilled at one time as additional drops will overflow.</li>
                            <li>Release lid and ask patient to gently close eye without squeezing then count slowly to
                                60 before opening. This allows time for absorption of drops and helps prevent systemic
                                absorption.</li>
                            <li>Gently wipe away excess drops or ointment. This is for patient's comfort and to prevent
                                possible drug irritation on skin.</li>
                            <li>Dispose of tissue/gauze squares in nearest clinical waste bin.</li>
                            <li>Sign prescription sheet, to indicate drops have been administered.</li>

                            applied firmly as the eyelid is prevented from irritating the abrasion.</p>
                        <p>If a pad is to be applied, it is important that the eye is firmly closed under the pad to
                            avoid corneal abrasion. In some instances it is useful to apply a piece of paraffin gauze
                            over the eyelids, then a pad or half a pad folded in two and finally a pad applied flat over
                            the eye. This method is useful in the casualty or outpatient departments but should not be
                            used on postoperative patients as it will put too much pressure on the globe, unless
                            pressure needs to be applied post-operatively, e.g. to seal a leaking wound. Secure the pad
                            with three pieces of tape. For the right eye, the first piece of tape should be placed over
                            the centre of the pad, diagonally from 1 to 7 o'clock. For the left eye, it is placed
                            diagonally from 11 to 5 o'clock. The second and third pieces of tape are placed each side of
                            this central piece, parallel to it. Position the ends of each piece of tape on each other so
                            that removal is easier and kinder to the patient. Pads may be applied to post-operative
                            patients undergoing certain oculoplastic procedures. Cartella shields are now in common use
                            in most ocular surgical cases instead of a pad.</p>
                        <p>In cases of chemical injury, the eye should never be padded.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disadvantages of eye pads</h3>
                        <p>Eye pads have several disadvantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>corneal abrasion can be caused if the eye is not closed under the pad</li>
                            <li>good medium for bacterial growth</li>
                            <li>they are flammable</li>
                            <li>they are uncomfortable to wear</li>
                            <li>if the lids are swollen, a lid abrasion may occur</li>
                            <li>corneal healing rate reduced (Kirkpatrick et al., 1993).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bandages</h3>
                        <p>There are several different methods of applying an eye bandage. One method is described here
                            which provides a secure, comfortable, effective result.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take the bandage once around the forehead.</li>
                            <li>Bring it up under the ear on the affected side and over the centre of the eye pad.</li>
                            <li>Repeat this twice, covering the eye pad above and below the first central turn.</li>
                            <li>Take the bandage once more around the forehead and secure it.</li>
                            <li>Take care when bandaging not to occlude the 'good eye' or the patient's ears.</li>
                        </ol>
