                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The ophthalmic nurse requires special skills of observation (see Chapter 3), history-taking
                            and the ability to care for a patient who has received trauma to the eye or its surrounding
                            area (see Chapter 2).</p>
                        <p>Penetrating (perforating) injury and ocular burns are considered ophthalmic emergencies.
                            Blunt trauma can result in serious ocular damage. Therefore the nurse must take an accurate
                            history, examine the eye carefully and decide in what order of priority each patient
                            presenting with ocular trauma needs to be placed.</p>
                        <p>A blow to the eyeball causes shock waves to pass through it, damaging many structures such as
                            the cornea, iris, lens and retina. Blunt trauma may accompany a penetrating injury,
                            therefore any patient presenting with a history of a forceful blow to the eye must have all
                            ocular structures examined carefully. The importance of accurate history-taking and accurate
                            measurement of visual acuity cannot be overemphasised.</p>
                        <p>Children presenting with ocular trauma whose history is not appropriate for the injury
                            sustained must be carefully screened for any sign of child abuse and appropriate action
                            taken if found.</p>
                        <p>Minims drops which are sterile and preservative free must be used in all eye examination for
                            ocular trauma.</p>
                        <p>Patients presenting with ocular trauma must have their visual acuity checked to establish
                            baseline reading.</p>
                        <p>It is assumed in the following text that all patients will be treated for accompanying shock
                            if present and that this may be a priority. Where appropriate a tetanus toxoid injection
                            must be given if the skin or ocular tissue has been cut.</p>

                        <p>An intra-ocular foreign body (IOFB) results when something enters the eye under force, such

                            itself in any of the structures of the eye and examination may not reveal its presence,
                            highlighting the importance of history-taking. History-taking should include whether
                            appropriate eye protection has been worn at time of injury.</p>

                        <p>Fractures of the orbit occur as a result of trauma. Usually they are easily recognised by the
                            irregularity of the outline of the orbit. A 'blow-out' fracture of the orbit occurs
                            following trauma to the maxillary bone which fractures and the eye tends to sink down into
                            the gap created in the bone. Patients with suspected 'blow-out' fracture should be told not
                            to blow their nose to minimise emphysema. Emphysema (the skin crackles when pressed) may be
                            present due to a fracture maxillary sinus.</p>

                        <p>Laceration of the lacrimal drainage apparatus is fairly common. If the canaliculus is torn
                            accurate apposition of the tear ducts must be performed to prevent permanent epiphora. In

                        <p>Ocular burns can result in patients losing their sight.</p>
                        <p>Acid substances entering the eye coagulate with the protein of the ocular surface and cease
                            to act although damage is caused by the initial impact. Alkaline substances, such as lime
                            found in cement and brick dust, continue to be active in the eye, destroying the superficial
                            layers and penetrating the anterior segment of the eye. Collagenase is released by the
                            cornea following an alkali burn and this destroys the cornea. It is therefore vitally
                            important that the eye(s) are thoroughly cleaned of all particles of lime. Immediate washing
                            of the eye with whatever harmless liquid is at hand is the best first aim measure that can
                            be employed. The patient should then be transferred to an ophthalmic unit. The eye must
                            never be padded following chemical injury.</p>

                        <p>The excimer laser has been used to treat chemical burns. Keratoepithelioplasty (KEP) or

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <h5>Symblephron</h5>
                        <p>Symblephron is the adhesion of the bulbar conjunctiva to the palpebral conjunctiva (Fig.
                            14.3). It occurs following alkaline burns to the eye when the epithelial layer of the
                            conjunctiva is stripped off and the two areas of the conjunctiva stick together. When this
                            occurs the fornices are lost and the eye is immobile. The lids may not be able to cover and
                            protect the eyeball. It is therefore important to keep the fornices well lubricated and to
                            apply a bandage contact lens to separate the two conjunctival surfaces or to rod them to
                            break up any adhesions that might occur. This latter procedure can be painful. Nasal mucosal
                            grafts can be performed.</p>

                        <p>Many different kinds of foreign bodies can adhere to the cornea: dirt specks, sawdust, pieces
                            of metal or rust (Fig. 14.4). Anyone working in an environment, whether at work or at home,
                            where particles can fly into the eye, or working with a hammer and chisel, should wear
                            protective goggles. But these do not always afford complete protection.</p>
                        <p>The eye with a corneal foreign body present may or may not be red, depending on what the
                            foreign body is, how long it has been in the eye and how much the patient has rubbed it.</p>

                                important if the accident has occurred at work. It may be necessary to instil a drop of
                                local anaesthetic into the eye before the patient can read the Snellen chart.</li>
                            <li>Assist the doctor or nurse practitioner to remove the foreign body (see p. 36).</li>
                            <li>Apply antibiotic ointment.</li>
                            <li>Apply a pad if necessary for patient comfort but bear in mind recent research indicating
                                that the corneal epithelium is slower to heal under a pad (Visto, 2000)</li>
                            <li>If the foreign body is a piece of metal, a rust ring may be left around the abrasion
                                resulting from the foreign body. This rust ring will need to be removed either at the
                                first visit or the following one. A dental burr may be used for this procedure.</li>
                            <li>Instil G. Homatropine $2\%$ to prevent the complication of uveitis occurring.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient is not driving if he has an eye pad on. Although it is not illegal to
                                drive with one eye padded, it is not safe to do so and the patient's insurance will not
                                be valid. Stereoscopic vision is lost and the field of vision reduced, especially if the
                                right eye is covered. If the patient has arrived by car and there is no-one to take him
                                home, he can be given a pad to apply at home following instructions on how to do so.

                                the likelihood of corneal melt. Caution should be exercised when prescribing any

                                after the initial incident. The patient on waking finds he has difficulty opening the
                                eye and that it is painful. On examination the epithelium will have debrided again. This
                                occurs because the epithelium is loosely adherent to Bowman's membrane. There may be an
                                hereditary tendency to recurrent erosions. The treatment is as above. The excimer laser
                                has been used to treat these erosions. Application of eye ointment such as simple eye
                                ointment at night can prevent this recurring condition.</li>
