                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The lacrimal gland</h3>
                        <p>The lacrimal gland is situated in the upper, outer quadrant of the orbit, in the lacrimal
                            fossa of the frontal bone. It is almond-shaped and is divided into two lobes by the levator
                            palpebral muscle:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the superior or orbital lobe</li>
                            <li>the inferior or palpebral lobe.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are 10 to 12 drainage channels leaving the lacrimal gland to convey tears to openings
                            in the upper fornix.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The lacrimal artery and vein supply and drain blood to and from the lacrimal gland.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>Nerve supply to the lacrimal gland is via the lacrimal nerve, the first branch of the
                            ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Function of the lacrimal gland</h4>
                        <p>The function of the lacrimal gland is to produce tears in response to stimulation of the
                            trigeminal nerve through, for example, emotion; foreign body on the cornea or conjunctiva;
                            or noxious fumes, such as smoke or peeled onions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The lacrimal drainage system</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The puncta</h4>
                        <p>The upper and lower puncta are small round or slightly oval apertures situated on the lid
                            margin on a slight elevation called the lacrimal papilla. This is a pale area, due to the
                            presence of few blood vessels, about 6 mm from the inner canthus. Both puncta are normally
                            turned inwards towards the bulbar conjunctiva so tears can drain into them. Fibres of the
                            orbicularis muscle surround them.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The canaliculi</h4>
                        <p>The upper and lower canaliculi are narrow ducts passing from each puncta vertically for
                            1.5-2.0 mm, which then turn medially and travel horizontally for 10 mm . They usually unite
                            to form a common canaliculus for about 1 mm before opening out into the lacrimal sac.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The lacrimal sac</h4>
                        <p>The lacrimal sac is situated in the lacrimal fossa of the lacrimal bone. It is blind-ended
                            superiorly, 5 mm wide and 12-14 mm in length. Fibres of the orbicularis and Horner's muscles
                            surround the sac.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The nasolacrimal duct</h4>
                        <p>The nasolacrimal duct is a downward continuation of the sac for $12-24 \text{ mm}$ before
                            opening into the inferior meatus of the nose beneath the inferior turbinate bone. The valve
                            of Hasner, a mucosal fold, covers part of the opening. All the passages of the lacrimal
                            drainage system are lined with epithelium.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>Blood is supplied to the nasolacrimal duct via the nasal artery and the superior and inferior
                            medial palpebral artery. Drainage is via the nasal vein and the superior and inferior medial
                            palpebral veins.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>The infratrochlear nerve, a branch of the nasociliary nerve, which is the third branch of the
                            ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, provides the nerve supply for the nasolacrimal
                            duct.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lymphatic drainage</h4>
                        <p>Lymph is drained from the nasolacrimal duct via the submaxillary nodes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The tear film</h3>
                        <p>The tear film is a mixture of secretions from the accessory tear glands of Krause and
                            Wolfring, the goblets cells of the conjunctiva and the Meibomian glands of the eyelids. The
                            tear film is a constant film of fluid bathing the conjunctiva and cornea. The lacrimal gland
                            produces excess tears.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Three layers of the tear film</h4>
                        <p>These layers are illustrated in Fig. 6.2:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Oil:</b> the outer layer, produced by the Meibomian glands of the tarsal plates and
                                also the glands of Moll and Zeis. The oily layer prevents evaporation and spillage of
                                tears over the lid margin.</li>
                            <li><b>Aqueous:</b> the middle layer, the 'tears proper', produced by the lacrimal gland and
                                the glands of Krause and Wolfring.</li>
                            <li><b>Mucin:</b> the inner layer, produced by the goblet cells of the conjunctiva, is a
                                wetting substance for easy spread over the cornea.</li>
                        </ol>

                                Dacryocystorhinostomy(DCR) is performed to open up a new drainage channel into the nasal
                                cavity. This may be performed using an endoscope or a more traditional external approach
                                through the skin. Sometimes a tube is left in situ (DCR and tubes) for 3-6 months to
                                maintain the patency of the new drainage channels. These tubes should not interfere with
                                the cornea unless they extrude.</li>

                            <li>In the immediate post-operative period, the patient must be monitored carefully for any
                                epistaxis (nosebleed). Blood loss from this can be catastrophic. The haemorrhage may be
                                overt or could be via the back of the throat.</li>
                            <li>A pressure dressing will remain in place until the dressing the morning after surgery.
                                This should be observed for signs of haemorrhage.</li>
                            <li>In the case of endoscopic DCR, a nasal pack will be in situ. This too must be observed
                                for haemorrhage. It usually is removed the next day.</li>
                            <li>Standard DCR:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Clean the eye and suture line.</li>
                                    <li>Instil antibiotic drops; occasionally antibiotic cream is prescribed to be
                                        applied to the suture line. The surgeon may recommend that this is gently
                                        massaged in to reduce scarring.</li>
                                    <li>Remove sutures 5-7 days post-operatively (usually in out-patient department).

                                    <li>Instruct the patient not to blow his nose vigorously as this could cause

                                    <li>If a tube is present, it will be removed in the outpatient department. The

                                carried out if the dilation fails. During this procedure, performed under local
                                anaesthetic, snips are made behind the punctum to release the muscle around the punctum.

                        <p>Dryness of the eye results from any disease associated with deficiency of any of the layers
                            of the tear film as well as lid or corneal surface abnormalities. Its name (dry eyes)
                            implies a non-significant condition. This is not the case. In addition to being very
                            uncomfortable, it has the potential to be sight threatening.</p>
