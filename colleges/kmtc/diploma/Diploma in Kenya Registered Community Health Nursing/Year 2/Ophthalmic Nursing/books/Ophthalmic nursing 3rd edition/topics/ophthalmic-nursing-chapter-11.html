                        <p>The lens is a biconvex, transparent, avascular structure with no nerve supply (Fig. 11.1). It
                            measures 9 mm by 4 mm in diameter. The lens lies behind the iris and in front of the
                            vitreous. It is supported by the zonules or suspensory ligaments, which attach it to the
                            ciliary processes.</p>
                        <p>The lens has an elastic capsule, which enables it to change shape during accommodation (see
                            p. 121). This capsule is semipermeable to water and electrolytes. The lens receives its
                            nourishment from the aqueous humour.</p>
                        <p>The anterior surface has a single layer of epithelial cells. The anterior pole is less convex
                            than the posterior pole.</p>
                        <p>The cortex of the lens is composed of a gelatinous substance and lamella fibres, which are
                            arranged in layers, like an onion and originate from the anterior epithelial layer. These
                            fibres are continually being produced so that the lens enlarges slowly throughout life,
                            compressing towards the centre. Where the lamella fibres meet end-to-end, suture lines are
                            formed. In the nucleus these are Y -shaped and when viewed with the slit lamp, can be seen
                            to be erect anteriorly, i.e. Y , and inverted posteriorly, i.e. $\lambda$.</p>
                        <p>The nucleus is composed of sclerosed lens fibres. These are old cortical fibres that cannot
                            be cast off and are therefore massed together in the centre as the nucleus. The nucleus
                            grows in size and is harder than the cortex.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Composition of the lens</h3>
                        <p>The lens is 65% water and 35% protein. In addition, there are trace minerals, the most
                            important being sodium, potassium and calcium.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Function of the crystalline lens</h3>
                        <p>The function of the lens is to focus light rays on the retina by 'accommodation' (see p.
                            121). The lens has a power of approximately 21 diopters (21 D). After the age of 45 years,
                            the lens has become so solid that it gradually loses its ability to change shape. This means
                            that the lens cannot accommodate for near vision, a condition called presbyopia. Spectacles
                            are therefore needed for reading and close work. The presbyopia slowly progresses until
                            about the age of 70 years, those affected requiring increasingly stronger lenses for reading
                            and fine work.</p>

                        <p>Cataracts can be defined according to their type, location and degree.</p>

                            <li>anterior pole cataract</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Degrees of cataract</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Immature cataract</b> - part of the lens is opaque.</li>
                            <li><b>Mature cataract</b> - the whole lens is opaque and may be swollen (intumescent) (see
                                Fig. 11.2).</li>
                            <li><b>Hypermature cataract</b> - the lens becomes dehydrated because water has escaped from
                                the lens, leaving an opaque lens and wrinkled capsule.</li>
                            <li><b>Phacolytic lens</b> - lens matter leaks out causing uveitis and secondary glaucoma.
                                Cataracts should be extracted before this situation arises.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The mature and hypermature cataracts can be viewed through the pupil. An immature cataract

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rubella or malnutrition in the first trimester of pregnancy results in a lamellar
                                cataract in the baby.</li>
                            <li>Abnormal development of the eye in the fetus causes pressure on the anterior pole,
                                resulting in an anterior pole cataract.</li>
                            <li>A tag of hyaloid membrane remaining from fetal life can result in a posterior pole
                                cataract (the hyaloid artery runs from the retina to the lens during fetal life).</li>
                            <li>Metabolic disturbance such as galactosaemia results in a nuclear cataract.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs of a cataract in a baby or child</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A white pupil may be noted by the parents or health visitor. It may be unilateral or
                                bilateral. The cause of the white pupil must be diagnosed to differentiate it from the
                                more serious condition retinoblastoma (see p. 177).</li>
                            <li>The parents may notice that the child does not see well. They may also notice changes in
                                the child's behaviour such as loss of concentration as they cannot follow word,
                                pictures, etc., inability to catch a ball because of loss of depth perception.</li>
                            <li>A squint will indicate that there is a lesion in the visual pathway preventing the sight
                                from developing. The cause again must be differentiated from a retinoblastoma.</li>
                            <li>It is important that cataracts are removed as soon as possible to prevent amblyopia
                                occurring (see p. 188). This is especially important if the cataracts are bilateral and
                                dense, when extraction should be carried out before the baby is two months old.</li>
                            <li>The rule of thumb is that if the fundus can be seen, then light must be reaching the
                                retina. Amblyopia (see p. 188) will therefore not develop. Removal of the lens will
                                itself cause amblyopia as the light rays are not directed onto the retina by the lens.
                                Compliance with aphakic correction (see p. 156) is therefore very important in these
                                children.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Familial cataract</h3>
                        <p>Familial cataracts can occur, but they are rare, affecting the $30-40$ year age group.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Age related cataract</h3>
                        <p>Age related cataracts occur in patients over the age of 60 years. They result from sclerosis
                            of the lens due to a degenerative process. The rate of progression varies. It is usually a
                            bilateral condition, one eye being affected before the other.</p>
                        <p>The cataract is either nuclear or cortical.</p>
                        <p>A nuclear cataract affects the central lens and takes on a brown colour. In this instance the
                            patient sees better in dim light when the pupil is dilated and the light rays can enter the
                            eye around the central opacity. Mydriatics can be given to dilate the pupil and give some
                            vision around the cataract.</p>
                        <p>A cortical cataract affects the periphery of the lens and looks white. This type of cataract
                            can produce a uni-ocular diplopia as the opacity splits the light rays. Vision is usually
                            better in bright light when the pupil constricts and so reduces the peripheral distortion.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Traumatic cataract - see p. 217</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Toxic cataract</h3>
                        <p>Toxic substances can affect the metabolism of the lens and cause opacity formation. Radiation
                            and drugs such as topical steroids have this effect.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cataracts secondary to existing eye diseases</h3>
                        <p>Glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachments, retinopathies, choroiditis and uveitis
                            upset the metabolism of the lens, causing cataract formation. The opacities form in the
                            posterior sub capsular area, eventually involving the entire lens.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cataracts associated with systemic disease</h3>
                        <p>Some systemic diseases cause an upset in the metabolism of the lens, causing, in the main,
                            posterior sub capsular opacities.</p>
                        <p><b>Diabetes mellitus, Type 1 and Type 2:</b> the increased glucose level in the aqueous
                            humour is taken up by the lens disturbing its metabolism. Cataracts can occur with rapid
                            onset in juvenile diabetics, the lens becoming completely opaque within several weeks. In
                            older diabetic patients the opacities are nuclear, posterior sub-capsular or cortical in
                            nature and take longer to develop.</p>
                        <p><b>Hypoparathyroidism:</b> cataract formation from this cause is usually seen after the
                            removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroid gland removal. It can be idiopathic. Low
                            calcium levels disturb the lens metabolism.</p>
                        <p><b>Atopic disease:</b> dermatological conditions such as eczema and scleroderma can, when

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Effects on vision of a cataract</h3>
                        <p>Patients with cataracts complain of gradually fading vision, often complaining that their
                            vision is 'misty'. Other visual disturbances include distortion of images, changes in colour
                            vision. Depending on the site of the cataract, as has been mentioned above, they may be able
                            to see better in dim or bright conditions. Some complain of dazzling bright lights due to
                            irregular refraction of rays through the opacities in the lens. Some patients experience
                            monocular diplopia. Posterior capsular opacities cause difficulty in near vision, leaving
                            distance vision unaffected.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Patient's needs</h3>
                        <p>The patient's needs are many and varied but include information on the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>knowledge of the condition</li>
                            <li>how the cataract will be treated and whether they will have an artificial lens implanted
                            </li>
                            <li>type of anaesthetic</li>
                            <li>informed consent to the surgery</li>
                            <li>when they can have the surgery</li>
                            <li>how long they will be at the hospital or treatment centre</li>
                            <li>how their vision will be after the operation and how long before they can get new
                                glasses</li>
                            <li>how to manage their post-operative eye drops</li>
                            <li>how to clean their eye</li>
                            <li>wearing the cartella shield at night time (usually at night for one or two weeks only)
                            </li>
                            <li>recognising and managing post-operative complications</li>
                            <li>resuming normal activities</li>
                            <li>written information/advice sheets</li>
                            <li>detail of any follow up appointment</li>
                            <li>how soon the other eye can be operated on (if needed).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cataract extraction is normally performed as a day case unless there are factors that require
                            inpatient admission. The waiting times for cataract surgery are much shorter, some centres
                            having no waiting list at all.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre-assessment</h3>
                        <p>Many centres now have cataract pathway management documents to guide the process from first
                            visit to discharge. These may be accessed electronically or as hard copy. They are designed
                            to streamline care from the multidisciplinary team. The patient may be seen by optometrists
                            and nurses for the pre-operative and post-operative management phase of care, only seeing
                            the doctor for the surgical procedure itself.</p>
                        <p>Special needs should be identified at or before the pre-assessment visit such as the need for
                            an interpreter, whether transport is needed, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre-operative investigations</h3>
                        <p><b>Keratometry</b> (see p. 53).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">'B' Scan</h4>
                        <p>The ' B ' Scan is an ultrasound scan used before cataract extractions. It gives a
                            three-dimensional picture of the eye, showing up any abnormality in the media, such as a
                            retinal detachment or tumour. This examination is necessary because the ophthalmologist is
                            unable to examine the fundus through an opaque lens. If a tumour or retinal detachment were
                            noted, the lens extraction might not take place, as no improvement in vision would occur.
                        </p>
                        <p>Visual potential may need to be tested for because, for example, a patient may not have good
                            post-operative visual acuity due to undiagnosed, agerelated macular degeneration (see p.
                            179). OCT (see p. 140) is an example of a diagnostic tool.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pre- and post-operative care</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing action</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prepare the patient for a general or local anaesthetic. Probably the most frequently
                                used local anaesthetic method now is Sub-Tenon's as it has fewer complications/risks
                                than more traditional methods. Some ophthalmic surgeons advocate the use of topical
                                local anaesthetic agents. The pupil will be dilated before surgery so that the surgeon
                                can see and access the cataract during surgery.</li>
                            <li>Give post-operative care.</li>
                            <li>Eye care:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>On examination with a good pen-torch or slit lamp, the conjunctiva will be
                                        mildly injected:
                                        <ol type="i">
                                            <li>the cornea should be clear</li>
                                            <li>the anterior chamber should be deep and quiet</li>
                                            <li>the pupil should be central - it may still be dilated from the effects
                                                of the pre-operative mydriatics and slightly eccentric initially.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If a posterior chamber intra-ocular lens is in situ, its reflection may be noted through
                                the pupil.</li>
                            <li>An antibiotic and steroid drop will be instilled.</li>
                            <li>Cataract surgery is usually considered fairly pain free. Paracetamol can be taken for
                                mild pain or dull ache that is sometimes experienced.</li>
                            <li>Post-operative information leaflet must be given.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Phacoemulsification requires less stringent post-operative restrictions, swimming and driving
                            being the two main activities to be avoided until advised otherwise, usually at the first
                            post-operative outpatient visit. This is because swimming could cause irritation and eye
                            rubbing response; and vision may be insufficient to meet the DVLA guidelines.</p>
                        <p>The patient may be seen and discharged by a health professional other than a doctor. This is
                            usually a specially trained nurse or optometrist.</p>
                        <p>Patients will normally be advised to visit their optician two to four weeks after surgery for
                            refraction and should they require glasses, the prescription will be given.</p>
                        <p>Listing for the second eye (if there is cataract) should be done as appropriate, often the
                            assessment being undertaken over the telephone.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cataract operations</h3>
                        <p>The approach is via a limbal incision under a conjunctival flap or via a peripheral corneal
                            incision.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Phacoemulsification</h4>
                        <p>This is the most frequently used method with cataract in the adult patient. With
                            phacoemulsification the lens is broken down by ultrasonic vibrations. This technique is
                            becoming increasingly popular as it reduces the risk of expulsive haemorrhage and
                            post-operative astigmatism (McNicholl, 1995) as the incision is smaller (as small as 3 mm in
                            some cases) than that used in the operations described above. Suturing the wound is not
                            required if it is properly sealed. A foldable intra-ocular lens is positioned in the
                            posterior chamber. Alternatively, the wound is enlarged to accommodate a non-foldable lens
                            implant.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cool laser</h4>
                        <p>This procedure is similar to phacoemulsification but uses 'cool laser' shock waves to
                            fragment the lens. The fragments are aspirated. There are fewer intraoperative
                            complications. As with the phacoemulsification technique, a lens implant is inserted
                            (O'hEineachain, 2002).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Needling or lens aspiration</h4>
                        <p>Needling or lens aspiration is performed on an infant or child under the age of 15 years. The
                            cortex and nucleus of the lens are irrigated out through an incision in the anterior lens
                            capsule, leaving the posterior capsule behind in order to prevent vitreous prolapse. At this
                            age, the lens matter is soft enough to be aspirated.</p>
                        <p>The posterior lens capsule left behind often scleroses causing visual impairment when a
                            capsulotomy will be performed using the Yag laser.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">'Lensectomy' (phacofragmentation)</h4>
                        <p>Lensectomy involves removing the entire lens and capsule and an anterior segment of the
                            vitreous using specialised equipment. It is used for congenital cataracts and has the
                            advantage of not requiring future capsulotomies.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intracapsular lens extraction</h4>
                        <p>In an intracapsular lens extraction, the entire lens plus its capsule is removed. An enzyme
                            chymotripsin is introduced into the eye to dissolve the zonular fibres. The lens is then
                            free of its attachments and can be removed from the eye by forceps or the cryoprobe. An
                            anterior chamber intra-ocular lens will be implanted (see below). This procedure is rarely
                            employed nowadays, but the nurse may encounter patients having had this type of surgery in
                            the past.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extracapsular lens extraction (ECCE)</h4>
                        <p>In an extracapsular lens extraction the anterior lens capsule, the cortex and nucleus are
                            removed, leaving the posterior lens capsule in place. The type of incision made in the
                            anterior lens capsule may vary, e.g. endocapsular, capsulorhexis. Following this type of
                            surgery, cortical matter may proliferate on the intact posterior capsule, a condition
                            requiring capsulotomy (see above). A posterior chamber intra-ocular lens will be implanted.

                        <p>Aphakia is the absence of the lens. Without the lens the eye becomes very hypermetropic,
                            requiring some kind of lens replacement to enable the patient to see adequately. The only
                            people who do not require correction of the aphakia are those who are very myopic in whom
                            the absence of the lens causes the light rays to focus on the retina.</p>
                        <p>Aphakia causes loss of accommodation so patients will need correction for both near and
                            distance vision. Following surgery, a degree of astigmatism will result, requiring
                            correction as well.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of correction</h3>
                        <p>Aphakia can be corrected using glasses, contact lenses or intra-ocular lenses.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Aphakic glasses</h4>
                        <p>These glasses are rarely used nowadays. If they are worn, the patient needs to be made aware
                            of the 'Jack-in-the box' effect they have on vision, objects appear to be jumping into the
                            field of vision. They may be used in babies when contact lenses are unsuitable.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Contact lenses</h4>
                        <p>Contact lenses are increasingly being superseded by intra-ocular lenses (see below) but
                            nurses may meet patients who have had earlier surgery and wear contact lenses to correct
                            their aphakia.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>can be used for unilateral aphakia</li>
                            <li>give a full field of vision</li>
                            <li>can be used in babies and children</li>
                            <li>only cause $7\%$ magnification.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages (see also Appendix 2)</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients have to become accustomed to wearing contact lenses; some may find them
                                intolerable.</li>
                            <li>Corneal abrasions and infections can result from contact lens wearing and from unclean
                                lenses.</li>
                            <li>Patients with arthritis cannot manipulate them but extended-wear lenses overcome this
                                problem.</li>
                            <li>The lenses are easily lost.</li>
                            <li>They need scrupulous cleaning, especially soft contact lenses.</li>
                            <li>People with bilateral aphakia may find difficulty in putting the first lens in because
                                of poor sight in the other eye. Again, extended-wear lenses can overcome this.</li>
                            <li>They are expensive for those who are not eligible to have them supplied by the NHS.</li>
                            <li>They may not be suitable to be worn in some occupations, e.g. when working in a dusty
                                environment.</li>

                        <h5>Uses</h5>
                        <p>Unilateral and bilateral aphakia.</p>
                        <h5>Types</h5>
                        <p>There are many different types of lenses made by the various companies. The following are
                            examples what is available on the market.</p>
                        <p>Lenses are either rigid or foldable and come in a variety of materials including
                            polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and acrylic. Some foldable lenses can be injected into the
                            lens capsule. Where needed, multifocal and varifocal lenses can be used.</p>
                        <p>The lenses are designed specifically for either the anterior chamber or the posterior
                            chamber.</p>
                        <p>Those for the anterior chamber, whilst they are rarely used now, are used following an
                            intra-capsular extraction or if the posterior capsule ruptures during surgery.</p>
                        <p>Posterior chamber lenses are inserted into the posterior chamber of the eye following an
                            extracapsular extraction, fitting into the posterior lens capsule which has been left
                            behind. Newer lenses are being manufactured with 'laser ridges' to keep the lens away from
                            the capsule to prevent the lens being damaged by the laser beam during a capsulotomy.</p>
                        <p>Folding lenses, e.g. Acrysoft, are used with phacoemulsification and are placed in the
                            posterior capsule. They require a much smaller incision. Some are designed so that they can
                            be injected into the capsule.</p>
                        <h5>Selection</h5>
                        <p>The choice of type and power of the IOL is determined by the surgeon who will take into
                            account the needs of the patient. Such needs include the anatomy and physiology of the eye,
                            whether the patient is myopic or hypermetropic. When the patient is having both eyes
                            treated, there may be opportunity to alter focal length.</p>
                        <h5>Advantages</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full field of vision is attained 24 hours a day.</li>
                            <li>They can be inserted at any time after the initial cataract extraction.</li>
                            <li>No manual dexterity or manipulation is required by the wearer.</li>
                            <li>They are suitable for workers in industry or those in a humid environment/occupation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Vision is good even without glasses. Bifocal intra-ocular lenses are available (Pearce,
                                1996), and are increasingly being used</li>
                            <li>Posterior chamber intra-ocular lenses have been successfully implanted in children
                                (Brady et al., 1995).</li>
                            <li>Heparin-coated lenses can be used in patients with diabetes and also those who have
                                repeated attacks of uveitis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They can cause uveitis and glaucoma.</li>
                            <li>They can dislocate.</li>
                            <li>Anterior chamber lenses may cause bullous keratopathy.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A total dislocation of the lens or a partial dislocation (subluxation) can occur. This can be
                            a result of trauma, it may be hereditary, or be associated with certain syndromes such as
                            Marfan's syndrome. Vision will be blurred, but the degree of visual disturbance depends on
                            the degree of dislocation. A partially dislocated lens can usually be seen through the
                            pupil. A cataract may develop in the lens. A dislocated lens can cause uveitis or glaucoma
                            by blocking either the posterior or anterior chambers.</p>
                        <p>If no complications occur, dislocated lenses are best left untreated. If complications do
                            occur, treatment should be given to the complications before cataract extraction is
                            attempted, as surgery in these instances is difficult.</p>
