                        <p>The uveal tract comprises the middle vascular pigmented layer of the eye. It is composed of
                            three areas:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The choroid</h3>
                        <p>The choroid lies between the sclera and retina and extends from the optic nerve forwards to
                            the ora serrata where it joins the ciliary body. It is composed of four layers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the suprachoroid, containing pigment cells, elastic tissue and collagen</li>
                            <li>the vascular layer, comprising large and small blood vessels with pigment cells
                                contained in the stroma surrounding the vessels; the large vessels are mainly veins</li>
                            <li>the choriocapillaries, comprising fenestrated capillary vessels</li>
                            <li>Bruch's membrane, which is a barrier with fenestrations which allow nutrients through to
                                the underlying retina; it is also a supportive membrane.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Function of the choroid</h4>
                        <p>The function of the choroid is to provide nourishment to the outer layer of the underlying
                            retina.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The blood supply and drainage is via the short posterior ciliary artery; and the choroidal
                            and vortex veins.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>The posterior ciliary nerve from the oculomotor nerve provides the nerve supply to the
                            choroid.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The ciliary body</h3>
                        <p>The ciliary body is a triangular structure lying between the choroid and the iris, being 6 mm
                            wide. It has three areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The pars plana is the posterior aspect lying next to the ora serrata and is 4 mm wide.
                            </li>
                            <li>The pars plicata is the area which lies between the pars plana and the iris and is 2 mm
                                wide. It contains $70-80$ radiating strips, the ciliary processes. These processes are
                                composed of vascular tissue, mainly veins and capillaries. They are 2 mm long and 0.5 mm
                                wide. Their function is to produce and secrete aqueous which fills the posterior chamber
                                and then flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber. The zonular fibres or
                                suspensory ligaments, which hold the lens in place, originate in the valleys formed by
                                the processes.</li>
                            <li>The ciliary muscles lie in the anterior section of the ciliary body, underneath the
                                sclera. The ciliary muscles are known as the muscles of accommodation. They contract and
                                relax to change the shape of the lens so that light rays can be brought to a focus on
                                the retina when looking at objects at varying distances. When the ciliary muscles
                                contract, the zonules relax and decrease the tension on the lens capsule. The lens thus
                                becomes more spherical and light rays can be focused on the retina for near vision. When
                                the ciliary muscles relax, the zonules tighten and there is increased tension on the
                                lens capsule. The lens thus becomes less spherical and light rays are focused on the
                                retina for distance vision.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The blood supply to and drainage from the ciliary body is via:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anterior ciliary arteries and veins</li>
                            <li>long posterior ciliary arteries and veins</li>
                            <li>vortex vein.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>The nerve supply is through the short ciliary nerve from the oculomotor nerve.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The iris</h3>
                        <p>The iris is the coloured circular diaphragm situated behind the cornea and in front of the
                            lens. It is attached at its periphery to the ciliary body. The pupil is the aperture in the
                            middle of the iris. The iris forms the posterior wall of the anterior chamber and the
                            anterior wall of the posterior chamber. There are two zones:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the ciliary zone on the periphery</li>
                            <li>the pupillary zone on the central aspect.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Three layers of the iris</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the endothelium</li>
                            <li>the stroma containing connective tissue, pigment cells, blood vessels, nerves and
                                muscles</li>
                            <li>pigment epithelium which is an extension of the pigment epithelium of the retina (note
                                that the epithelium of the iris is situated at the back of the structure).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Muscle of the iris</h4>
                        <p>There are two muscles in the iris, whose actions are either to constrict or dilate the pupil:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sphincter muscle is a circular muscle lying around the pupillary zone. This muscle
                                constricts the pupil. It is served by the short ciliary nerve of the oculomotor nerve.
                            </li>
                            <li>The dilator muscle is a radial muscle lying under the pigmented layer of the iris. As
                                its name indicates it is the muscle that dilates the pupil and is supplied by the long
                                ciliary nerve from the nasociliary nerve, the third branch of the ophthalmic division of
                                the trigeminal nerve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The sphincter muscle is more powerful than the dilator muscle, so if both muscles are equally
                            affected by intra-ocular inflammation the pupil will tend to constrict. The sphincter muscle
                            and the ciliary muscle both have their nerve supply from the oculomotor nerve, therefore
                            drugs stimulating or paralysing this nerve will affect both dilation and accommodation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Colour of the iris</h4>
                        <p>The pigment melanin gives the colour to the iris. The colour depends on the amount of pigment
                            laid down in the stroma after birth. This is genetically determined. The pigment in the
                            pigment epithelium is present at birth and is consistent throughout life. This gives newborn
                            babies light-coloured eyes. After a few days of life pigment begins to be laid down in the
                            stroma and the baby's eyes become darker. The more melanin laid down, the darker the eyes
                            become. All babies are therefore born with light-coloured eyes, despite what some doting
                            parents may say. The amount of pigment produced in the stroma can vary during life, so that
                            the colour of eyes can alter. Dark irises with dense pigment cause the pupil to take longer
                            to dilate following instillation of mydriatics.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The arterial blood supply is via the long posterior ciliary arteries. The capillaries from
                            these arteries anastomose with the anterior ciliary arteries to form the arterial circle of
                            the iris. The venous drainage is through the anterior ciliary veins and vortex veins.</p>

                                'mutton fat' because of their appearance.</li>
                            <li>The anterior chamber is of normal depth but 'flare and cells' may be seen in the beam of
                                the slit lamp. Flares are as a result of exudative protein from the inflamed iris and
                                cells are seen as leucocytes. Inflammatory cells may be sufficient in number to settle
                                and form a hypopyon.</li>
                            <li>The iris vessels may be dilated. A nodule may be present if the cause is tuberculosis.

                            <li>The intra-ocular pressure may be elevated.</li>
                            <li>The pupil is small because the iris muscles are in spasm and the sphincter muscle is the
                                stronger of the two iris muscles. The pupil will be irregular if posterior synaechiae
                                has occurred when the posterior surface of the swollen iris adheres to the anterior
                                surface of the lens.</li>
                            <li>There may be cells in the vitreous</li>
                            <li>Macular oedema may be present in severe anterior or intermediate uveitis</li>

                                that have formed.</li>
                            <li>Instil prescribed mydriatic drops, often a 'cocktail' will be used, e.g. G.
                                Phenylephrine Hydrochloride $10\%$ and G. Cyclopentolate $1\%$. These may need to be
                                repeated if synaechiae are present.</li>
                            <li>The application of heat by means of eyepads soaked in hot water and wrung out then
                                placed over but not on closed lids will enhance the action of the mydriatics and cause
                                the pupil to dilate quicker. The heat will also afford some pain relief. Do not apply
                                the hot pads directly onto the closed eyelids.</li>
                            <li>A subconjunctival injection of mydriatics, e.g. Mydricaine may need to be given (see p.
                                43). This may be given in conjunction with steroids such as Betnesol.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient understands the treatment to be instilled at home. This will be a:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>mydriatic, e.g. G. Cyclopentolate $1\%$ twice a day;</li>
                                    <li>steroid, e.g. Prednisolone Forte 1% two-hourly or four times a day depending on
                                        severity.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>If investigations are to be carried out, ensure the patient understands where and when
                                to attend for these. These tests will include: X-rays skull, chest and joints to exclude
                                sarcoid, tuberculosis, arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; blood tests - haemoglobin,
                                full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serology and autoimmune profile.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient knows when to return for follow-up treatment which will probably be
                                in one or two days.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Often the management of patients with uveitis can be complex and time consuming and according
                            to Jones (1998), the management of these patients must be optimised by early setting of
                            targets for achievement, gaining patient's understanding and co-operation and by setting
                            clear plans for management. Ophthalmic nurse practitioners have a large role to play in
                            achieving these goals.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Secondary glaucoma from three causes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Posterior synaechiae, if not broken down, can cause a ring synaechiae when all
                                        of the pupillary zone of the iris is bound down to the anterior lens surface.
                                        The aqueous cannot flow through the pupil, so as the pressure builds up in the
                                        posterior chamber, the iris is pushed forward. This condition is known as iris
                                        bombe. Ring synaechiae can be divided surgically if mydriatics do not cause the
                                        pupil to dilate and thus break the synaechiae.</li>
                                    <li>The peripheral anterior surface of the iris bombe adheres to the peripheral
                                        posterior surface of the cornea causing peripheral anterior synaechiae. These
                                        block the drainage angle.</li>
                                    <li>Debris from the inflamed iris blocks the drainage angle.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Choroiditis</h3>
                        <p>Choroiditis is a condition manifesting itself as patches of inflammation on the choroid. On
                            examination with an ophthalmoscope fluffy white patches can be seen through a hazy vitreous.
                            When these patches heal, they leave pigmented areas of scar tissue.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>The patient complains of reduced vision due to infiltrates in the vitreous and of an
                            increased number of vitreous floaters. In $60\%$ of cases, the cause is unknown. It can be
                            caused by toxocara, toxoplasmosis (see Colour Plate 8) or syphilis. If the cause is known,
                            this should be treated. A short course of high-dose steroids is also given.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ophthalmic manifestations of HIV infection</h3>
                        <p>Patients with HIV maybe presented with ocular manifestations involving the anterior or
                            posterior segment of the eye. Due to recent advances in therapeutic agents for treating such
                            infections, early diagnosis is important. All HIV patients should undergo an
                            ophthalmological review so that prompt treatment can be instigated where appropriate.
                            Anterior segment diseases of HIV includes Kaposi's sarcoma of the eyelids, conjunctiva and
                            rarely the orbit. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, herpes simplex virus and fungal infections can
                            be associated with early clinical manifestations of HIV infection. Uveitis, Reiter's
                            syndrome and syphilis are frequently seen in HIV patients. Posterior segment disease
                            afflicting HIV sufferers involved the retina, choroid and optic nerve and are categorized
                            into two: those associated with noninfectious causes and those infected with a variety of
                            infectious disorders. Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV) is found in $25-40\%$ of patients with
                            HIV and is the most common retinal infection. Treatment for CMV included Ganciclovir or
                            Foscarnet or a combination of both these agents.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tumours</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Benign naevi</h4>
                        <p>These can be present in the uveal tract and must be observed carefully and regularly for
                            malignant changes. They can be removed by laser. Melanomas are the variety of malignant
                            tumour affecting the uveal tract. They are more common in the choroid but can occur in the
                            iris and, more rarely, in the ciliary body where they carry a higher mortality.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Melanoma of the choroid</h4>
                        <p>This can occur at any age but is more common over the age of 55 years. It usually occurs in
                            the posterior pole and as it grows it pushes the retina forwards. A retinal detachment thus
                            caused is often the first sign of a melanoma, so careful differential diagnoses must be made
                            between a malignant and a simple retinal detachment. The edge of a malignant detachment is
                            usually smoother than that of a simple detachment. Investigations include transillumination,
                            colour fundus photography and ocular ultrasound. Treatment is with ruthenium or iodine
                            plaques, proton beam radiotherapy, transscleral or trans-vitreal local resection or laser
                            photocoagulation. The aim is to conserve the eye. Enucleation is reserved for patients who
                            have visual loss, pain and poor cosmetic appearance, and those who are unable to cope with
                            the thought of tumour spread or with prolonged treatment and follow-up. A length of optic
                            nerve must also be removed with the whole eyeball. If the optic nerve is found to be
                            involved on histological examination, radiotherapy should be given to the socket. The
                            five-year mortality rate varies from $16\%$ for small tumours less than 10 mm in diameter,
                            to $53\%$ for tumours larger than 15 mm (Damato, 1995). For nursing care following
                            enucleation, see p. 220.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Melanoma of the iris</h4>
                        <p>This is illustrated in Colour Plate 9. If a naevus in the iris is noted to be enlarging,
                            local excision should be performed. The prognosis, providing treatment is prompt, is usually
                            good.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Melanoma of the ciliary body</h4>
                        <p>Ciliary body melanoma comprises of only 12% of uveal melanoma (Kanski, 2003). Due to the
                            location of the ciliary body, small ciliary body melanomas are often quite difficult to
                            locate and patients are often asymptomatic. Patients presenting with a large ciliary body
                            melanoma may complain of a painless blurred vision due to secondary lens subluxation or
                            astigmatism. Other secondary complications include hyphaema, cataract, retinal detachment
                            and haemorrhage.</p>
