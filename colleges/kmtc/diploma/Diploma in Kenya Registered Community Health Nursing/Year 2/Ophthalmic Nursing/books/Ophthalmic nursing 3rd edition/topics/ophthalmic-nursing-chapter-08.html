                        <p>The cornea and sclera comprise the outer, protective layer of the eyeball. The cornea forms
                            the anterior one-sixth and the sclera the posterior five-sixths.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The cornea</h3>
                        <p>The cornea is a transparent structure which fits into the surrounding sclera like a
                            watchglass. It is convex, avascular and highly sensitive. The site where the cornea becomes
                            continuous with the sclera is known as the corneal limbus.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Measurements</h4>
                        <p>Vertical 10.6 mm ; horizontal 11.5 mm ; thickness 0.6 mm centrally and 1.0 mm peripherally.
                        </p>
                        <p>The thinness of the cornea is significant and must be considered when removing corneal
                            foreign bodies.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Five layers of the cornea</h4>
                        <p>These are illustrated in Fig. 8.1</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Epithelium:</b> there are five to six layers of epithelial cells, which are
                                continuous with the conjunctival epithelium. The basement membrane is the innermost
                                layer of the epithelium. The epithelium is the only layer of the cornea that regenerates
                                following trauma.</li>
                            <li><b>Bowman's membrane:</b> a layer of connective tissue. Does not regenerate when
                                damaged.</li>
                            <li><b>Stroma:</b> this comprises $90\%$ of the cornea. It is composed of parallel
                                connective tissue.</li>
                            <li><b>Descemet's membrane:</b> a layer of elastic fibres which regenerates when damaged.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Endothelium:</b> a single layer of endothelial cells which are metabolically active
                                and their primary function is the control of stromal hydration. The endothelium
                                elongates when damaged.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_12_528bfcb6246e1ffc35cag-112-1.jpg"

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Functions of the cornea</h4>
                        <p><b>Protection.</b></p>
                        <p><b>Refraction of light.</b> The convex shape of the cornea allows most of the refraction of
                            light rays within the eye to take place here, approximately 40 dioptres. The cornea must
                            remain transparent to allow light rays to enter the eye and for sight to be clear.</p>
                        <p>Clarity is maintained by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Avascularity of the structure:</b> no blood vessels to impede the transmission of
                                light rays.</li>
                            <li><b>Uniform structure of the stromal layer:</b> the fibres lie in a parallel fashion; if
                                they are pushed apart, for example by oedema, the structure becomes opaque and blurred
                                vision results.</li>
                            <li><b>Dehydration:</b> the cornea is kept dehydrated by the endothelial layer. This is a
                                sodium pump whereby sodium, and therefore water, is pumped out of the cornea to be
                                replaced by potassium. Where this layer is damaged the pump ceases to work efficiently.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood supply</h4>
                        <p>The blood supply and drainage is via the anterior ciliary artery and vein by limbal
                            diffusion.</p>
                        <p>The cornea also receives some nourishment from aqueous and the tear film.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>The cornea is highly sensitive, receiving its nerve supply from the long ciliary nerve of the
                            nasociliary nerve. This is the third branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
                            nerve. The nerve endings lie under the epithelial layer.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The sclera</h3>
                        <p>'Sclera' in Greek means 'hard'. The sclera is the 'white' of the eye, composed of dense,
                            white, non-uniform collagen fibres. It is kept hydrated and is, therefore, opaque. The
                            sclera extends from the cornea (the limbus) to the optic nerve.</p>
                        <p>It is $0.6-1.00 \text{ mm}$ thick, although where the four recti muscles are inserted into
                            it, it is only 0.3 mm thick. It has a protective function.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Areas of the sclera</h4>
                        <p>There are four areas to note:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Lamina cibrosa:</b> a sieve-like structure where a few strands of scleral tissue pass
                                behind the optic disc.</li>
                            <li><b>Posterior aperture:</b> lies around the optic nerve and is the area where the long
                                and short ciliary vessels and nerves penetrate the sclera to travel forward in the eye
                                to supply the choroid and ciliary body.</li>
                            <li><b>Four middle apertures:</b> situated at the 'equator' where the four vortex veins exit
                                through the sclera.</li>
                            <li><b>Anterior aperture:</b> lies 4 mm posterior to the limbus where the anterior ciliary
                                vessels puncture the sclera.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The limbus</h4>
                        <p>The limbus is the transitional zone, 1.2 mm wide between the cornea, conjunctiva and sclera.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The episclera</h4>
                        <p>The episclera is a fine elastic tissue covering the surface of the sclera. It has a rich
                            blood supply from the long posterior ciliary arteries to nourish the sclera lying beneath
                            it.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Scleral nerve supply</h4>
                        <p>The ciliary nerve from the oculomotor nerve provides the nerve supply to the sclera.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physiology of corneal symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Pain</b> - due to many pain fibres being present in the cornea.</li>
                            <li><b>Blurred or reduced vision</b> - due to a lesion obstructing light rays entering and
                                refracting at the cornea.</li>
                            <li><b>Photophobia and watering</b> - due to irritation of the corneal nerve endings.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Exposure keratitis</h3>
                        <p>Exposure keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea resulting from drying of the cornea
                            because the eyelids cannot protect it adequately. It is potentially a dangerous condition
                            as, without treatment, it can lead to ulceration and perforation of the cornea.</p>
                        <p>The lids are unable to cover the cornea either because of proptosis of the eyeball or the
                            inability of the lids to move over the eyeball. Once recognised, this condition must be
                            treated promptly with measures being taken to protect the cornea. Bandage contact lenses can
                            be used or a tarsorrhaphy performed with the use of eye ointment to form a protective layer.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Corneal ulcers</h3>
                        <p>Corneal ulcers develop as a result of local necrosis of corneal tissue by bacteria, viruses,
                            fungi or Acanthamoeba. The most common corneal ulcer is caused by bacteria such as
                            Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas or Streptococcus. Bacterial invasion and infection can be as a
                            result of corneal trauma, corneal foreign body, chronic blepharitis and contact lens
                            wearing. Lid abnormalities such as entropion, trichiasis, and corneal exposure due to
                            incomplete eyelid closure - such as Bell's palsy - may also lead to the development of
                            corneal ulcer.</p>

                                        for the first 24 hours. This means that the patient will be having drops
                                        instilled every 15 miutes. The frequency will be reduced according to the
                                        response.</li>
                                    <li>Ointment, e.g. Oc. Chloramphenicol and Gentamicin at night at a later stage.

                                    <li>If very severe, intravenous antibiotics may be given.</li>

                            <li>Give analgesic drugs as prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Instil topical mydriatics for associated uveitis.</li>
                            <li>It is important to recognise signs of sleep deprivation - such as loss of appetite,
                                depression, mood swings - and it is important that this is addressed. It is a good idea
                                to nurse these patients in a side ward and make every effort to minimise the noise
                                level. The room should be darkened and interruptions kept to a minimum. Patients should
                                be offered warm drinks and a light diet. When patient is well enough, educate patient
                                (and where appropriate relatives) in drop instillation technique in preparation for
                                discharge home.</li>
                            <li>It is also important to address any psychological needs of the patient. Good clear
                                explanations at every stage of the management of the corneal ulcer will help to
                                alleviate any anxiety and fear. Where appropriate, involvement of other agencies such as
                                dietician, district nurses and social worker.</li>
                            <li>If the patient is to be treated as an outpatient, instruct him in the instillation of
                                drops and ointment as above. The frequency may be less, e.g. two-hourly. Ensure he has
                                analgesics at home.</li>
                            <li>Advise him to wear dark glasses for the photophobia but not to cover the eye with a pad.
                                Explain that the pad could provide an environment in which the infection could thrive.
                            </li>
                            <li>Warn him that treatment may be prolonged, perhaps for several weeks until healing is
                                complete.</li>
                            <li>Topical steroids may be introduced once the ulcer begins to heal.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the patient for botulinum injection to induce a ptosis which will cover the
                                cornea.</li>

                            <li>Uveitis with its own complications (see p. 123).</li>
                            <li>Descemetocele formation: the elastic Descemet's membrane affords some protection against
                                the spreading ulcer. The corneal layers above it have been destroyed and Descemet's
                                membrane herniates through the ulcer. When this happens perforation may occur.</li>
                            <li>Perforation of the cornea: this may be a dangerous situation as not only can sight be
                                lost but the eye itself. If the infection is severe and has spread to the internal
                                structures of the eye, the eye will need to be removed (see Chapter 15), as no useful
                                vision will be saved and the patient will experience severe pain.</li>

                                case uveitis also occurs. A very low dose of steroids may then be required. G.

                        <p>This is caused by the herpes zoster virus attacking the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
                            nerve (Fig. 8.3). It therefore follows the path of the nerve over the forehead and into the
                            eye. It usually affects the elderly and can be very debilitating. The disease starts with
                            pain over the forehead and scalp on the affected side. A day or so later vesicles appear on
                            the same area and may cover the upper lid. These then break down and weep serous fluid
                            before drying up and forming scabs. The patient feels ill, anorexic and nauseated and may be
                            pyrexial.</p>
                        <p>If the nasociliary nerve is affected, the cornea will be involved with white infiltrate and
                            lesions may appear on the side of the nose. This is known as a positive Hutchinson's sign.

                        <p>Interstitial keratitis is due to congenital syphilis, manifesting itself when the patient is
                            aged between 5 and 20 years. The disease can also occur as a result of other complications
                            such as leprosy and tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is on the increase in this country (British
                            Thoracic Society, 2004) as the number of immigrants and asylum seekers from countries with a
                            high incidence of tuberculosis rises. Certain viruses such as measles virus, mumps virus can
                            also cause a type of interstitial keratitis. There is involvement of the deep corneal layers
                            and if left untreated, the entire cornea develops a ground-glass appearance. There is also
                            invasion of new blood vessels from the limbus.</p>
                        <p>The patient complains of pain, watering eye, photophobia, and blepharospasm, and reduced
                            vision. The eye is red and the cornea oedematous. Other signs of congenital syphilis may be
                            present: saddle nose, deafness and notched incisor teeth.</p>
                        <p>There is no specific treatment. Any treatment given is aimed at preventing uveitis and the
                            formation of posterior synechiae by giving mydriatics and steroid drops. Wearing dark
                            glasses may help the photophobia. Corneal grafting may be necessary if corneal scarring
                            becomes severe enough to obscure vision.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bullous keratopathy</h3>
                        <p>Bullous keratopathy is prolonged oedema of the cornea resulting in the epithelium being
                            raised into large vesicles or bullae. It is a difficult condition to treat and the bullae
                            may burst periodically causing intense irritating symptoms. It occurs following disturbance
                            to the endothelium when aqueous is allowed to percolate into the stroma. This could be as a
                            result of trauma, surgery (especially intra-ocular lens implants) or longstanding, poorly
                            controlled glaucoma.</p>
                        <p>Hypertonic (5%) saline drops can be used to reduce the corneal oedema and improve vision
                            (Kanski, 2003). Grafting may be necessary. Bandage contact lenses make the condition less
                            painful and also flatten the bullae.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Corneal dystrophies</h3>
                        <p>Corneal dystrophies can be categorised according to the corneal layer involved:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>epithelial/anterior Gogan's, map-dot, recurrent erosions, Reis-Bockler</li>
                            <li>stromal granular, macular, lattice</li>
                            <li>endothelial/posterior Fuch's.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These dystrophies cause increasing visual loss. Corneal grafting is the main form of
                            treatment but the dystrophy can recur in the 'new' cornea. Recurrent erosions can be treated
                            with the excimer laser.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Keratoconus</h3>
                        <p>Keratoconus or conical cornea is due to a congenital weakness of the cornea, manifesting
                            itself in the early teens. It can be associated with conditions such as eczema, learning
                            disability or blindness as sufferers of these conditions tend to rub their eyes.</p>
                        <p>It is a bilateral condition, one eye usually being affected before the other. The central
                            cornea becomes progressively thinner and more conical in shape (Fig. 8.4). The patient
                            complains of blurred vision due to increasing astigmatism of the cornea.</p>

                        <p>Initially the treatment will be with contact lenses to correct the astigmatism and protect
                            the cornea. The astigmatism is too severe to be corrected by spectacles. As the conical
                            shape progresses, an ordinary contact lens becomes useless. Grafting is performed, ideally
                            before the cornea becomes too thin.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications</h4>
                        <p>Acute hydrops of the cornea can occur as a result of rupture of Descemets's membrane usually
                            due to eye rubbing by the patient. Over a period of time, acute hydrops usually clears
                            spontaneously but often leaves scarring.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Autogenous:</b> rarely, a patient requiring a corneal graft has a fellow eye which is
                                blind but with a healthy cornea which can be used for grafting.</li>
                            <li><b>Live donor:</b> an enucleated eye with a healthy cornea can be used for grafting onto
                                another patient.</li>
                            <li><b>Cadavers:</b> most of the corneas used for grafting are obtained by this method. They
                                must be removed within 12 hours of death and are stored in media. Organ culture medium
                                permits storage for up to 30 days.</li>

                        <p>A culture is taken from the eyes before removal to exclude any infection. Blood is taken to
                            exclude hepatitis B and HIV. Both eyes are taken, including a part of the optic nerve. A
                            suture is fed through the nerve and used to suspend the eye in a sterile jar to prevent the
                            cornea becoming damaged. A prosthesis might be put in each socket or the eyelids are sutured
                            together.</p>
                        <p>There are national eye donor banks in the UK in Bristol and Manchester, which store eyes

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Human amniotic membrane transplantation</h4>
                        <p>The first use of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) was in 1940 by De Rotth who used
                            this technique in treating symblepharon. In 1946, Sorsby & Symons successfully treated
                            patients with corneal burn following caustic burns. Since then, AMT has been used for
                            persistent corneal epithelial defect (Lee & Tseng, 1997), leaking filtering blebs after
                            glaucoma surgery (Budenz et al., 2000), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Tsubota, 1996) and many
                            other corneal diseases including systemic diseases which may cause ocular surface damage.
                        </p>
                        <p>Human amniotic membrane is believed to be nonimmunogenic which makes it ideal in corneal
                            graft in promoting non-rejection. AMT promotes epithelial healing, reduced inflammation,
                            increased comfort, and decreased severity of vascularization.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Osteo-odonto-keraprosthesis (OOKP) surgery</h4>
                        <p>Osteo-odonto-keraprosthesis technique is used in treating patients who are not suitable for
                            conventional corneal graft surgery such as severely dry eyes or multiple corneal graft
                            failure. The success of this type of surgery will depend on the lack of any previous
                            ophthalmic history such as retinal disease, glaucoma and optic nerve involvement.</p>
                        <p>The surgery uses the patient's own tooth root and alveolar bone to act as vital support to an
                            optical cylinder. The patient undergoes a vigorous preassessment check including a B-scan,
                            assessment of the retina and optic nerve functioning and in some cases electroretinogram and
                            visual evoked potential. The patient also has an oral assessment by the maxillo-facial
                            surgeon and radiography where a decision is made as to which tooth to harvest. The canine
                            tooth is usually harvested and in the absence of a suitable tooth, a relative's tooth may be
                            used after suitable HLA match. The surgery is usually performed in two stages, which allow
                            the growth of soft tissues around the osteo-odonto lamina and for the reconstruction of the
                            ocular surface, by vascularisation. Potential complication could include buccal mucous
                            ulceration in the early post-operative phase especially in smokers.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse needs to ascertain that the patient understands that he will be receiving a
                                donor cornea which is most likely to come from a cadaver. The use of the word 'graft'
                                instead of 'transplant' may result in the patient being unaware of the true implications
                                of this type of surgery. The nurse may want to involve the doctor or may discuss this
                                with the patient on her own. Some patients may be distressed at the knowledge. Others
                                having known for a while, may only face up to the fact at the time of surgery, while
                                some may not have had the opportunity for discussion before. The nurse needs to be aware
                                of those who require further discussion and talk it through with them.</li>

                            <li>Institute pre-operative care. The pupil may be constricted in penetrating keratoplasty
                                to prevent damage to the lens during the operation unless a cataract is to be removed at
                                the same time.</li>
                            <li>Carry out post-operative care. At the first dressing ensure that the graft is in place,
                                the sutures intact and that the anterior chamber is formed. Aqueous may have leaked
                                through the suture line causing a flat anterior chamber. Instil antibiotic or antibiotic

                            <li>Astigmatism caused by too tight sutures which may need adjusting. Topography can confirm

                        <p>Corneal topography uses computerised equipment to measure and calculate the curvature of the
                            corneal surface points. The basic principle of corneal topography involves the projection of
                            multiple light concentric rings onto the cornea. The reflected image is captured on a
                            special camera and these images are analysed by computer software, with the results
                            displayed in a variety of formats. These are known as topographic maps. Every map has a
                            colour scale that assigns particular colour to certain keratometric dioptric range. Corneal
                            topography is often used clinically for detecting and evaluating the severity of patients
                            with keratoconus, postoperative healing patterns (excimer laser, photorefractive keratectomy
                            - PRK), radial keratotomy and keratoplasty. The topographic diagnosis of keratoconus is
                            often suggested by high central cornea power (normal cornea flattens progressively from the
                            centre to the periphery), a disparity between the two corneas of a given patient and a large
                            difference between the corneal apex and the periphery. However, long term contact lens
                            wearer can inadvertently simulate early keratoconus.</p>

                        <p>Pachometers measure the corneal thickness (normal corneal thicker in the periphery 1 mm
                            reducing to 0.58 mm centrally) and are a good indicator for endothelial function. The
                            endothelial cells can be photographed and counted - a procedure known as specular
                            photomicroscopy. This involves a special mounted slit lamp like camera which allows the
                            corneal endothelium to be visualised and photographed. The density of the endothelial cells
                            can be counted as well as any endothelial cells deviating from normal (normal endothelial
                            cells are hexagonal in shape). Conditions such as diabetes, anterior segment surgery,
                            glaucoma and contact lens wearing can all contribute to endothelial dysfunction.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of corneal pain</h3>
                        <p>Corneal pain is managed using topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
                        <p>The avascular cornea is one of the most sensitive tissues in the body, with the highest
                            density of sensory neurones per mm just below the epithelium (Davies et al., 1984) four to
                            five times greater than in the finger pads (Corbett et al., 1999). Any epithelial loss leads
                            to the exposure of the sub-epithelial plexus nerve endings. Subsequently, the patient's main
                            complaint will be one of pain. The management of corneal pain has often in the past been
                            neglected and patients are frequently quite distressed as their pain can become almost
                            intolerable. Their normal daily activities are often disrupted, including their sleep
                            pattern. In addition to their pain, patients may also be complaining of a red eye,
                            photophobia, foreign body or gritty sensation, lacrimation and a possible decrease in
                            vision.</p>
                        <p>The most frequent cause of corneal pain, apart from surgery, is corneal abrasion. Traumatic
                            corneal abrasion is one of the commonest causes of attendance in any emergency centre and
                            these abrasions range from very small to large epithelial defect. Small abrasions usually
                            heal without serious sequelae but larger and deeper corneal involvement can leave scar
                            formation. Traumatic corneal abrasions can be as a result of any ocular injuries such as
                            finger nails, twigs, foreign bodies, work-related injuries such as welding flash and
                            chemical injuries. Other examples of possible causes of corneal abrasion include contact
                            lens wearer, and epithelial disease such as dry eyes.</p>
                        <p>During the healing process of the corneal epithelium, the epithelial cells from the corneal
                            limbus flatten and spread across the defect until it is covered completely. At the same
                            time, new cells migrated from the basal layer of the epithelium.</p>
                        <p>The current management of severe corneal pain associated with a corneal abrasion is
                            cycloplegics such as G. Homatropine 2% and advice to take oral analgesia. The use of topical
                            non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Voltarol (diclofenac) or Acular (kerotolac) is not
                            used routinely. A review of the ophthalmic literature in the use of non-steroidal
                            anti-inflammatory in controlling corneal pain is well documented.</p>
                        <p>Jayamanne et al. (1997) report in their study that the use of topical Voltarol significantly
                            reduced pain after traumatic corneal abrasion. Szerenyi et al. (1994) also studied the
                            effect of Voltarol which significantly lowered corneal sensitivity in normal eyes and
                            reduced discomfort, pain and inflammation following photo-refractive keratoplasty. Another
                            study Brahma et al. (1996) reports on the use of Flurbiprofen as a topical analgesia for
                            superficial corneal injuries and found that it provides more effective pain relief than
                            traditional treatments for superficial corneal injuries. These patients also took less oral
                            analgesia, had normal sleep pattern and took less time off work. McDonald (1998) examined
                            the use of Acular for relief of corneal pain in 26 patients. It was found to be useful in
                            controlling patients' pain. None of the studies showed any significant adverse effects from
                            the use of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory. So far, no evidence exists in the
                            medical literature that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory interferes with the rate
                            of corneal epithelial healing and this fact is well documented (McGarey et al., 1993; Hersch
                            et al., 1990). This 'risk' is further reduced through limited dose and duration of use.</p>
                        <p>The routine prescription of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory must be considered in any
                            patients presenting with corneal pain following corneal abrasion on a verbal pain rating
                            scale of four or more. Caution must be exercised in patients with a history of corneal
                            ulcers, herpes virus infection, corneal dystrophies, post-operative corneal graft or recent
                            ocular surgery within three months. In addition, any patients who are asthmatic or who have
                            known allergies to any topical analgesia or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory should also
                            proceed with caution.</p>

                        <p>Episcleritis is inflammation of the episclera (Fig. 8.6). It may be unilateral or bilateral
                            and can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, gout and ulcerative colitis but the cause
                            is often unknown.</p>

                        <p>There is a localised area of redness, usually triangular, with the apex pointing towards the
                            limbus. There may or may not be a nodule present in the area of redness. The area is tender
                            and, on examination, the conjunctiva moves freely over the enlarged episcleral blood
                            vessels. Treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Acular.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Scleritis</h3>
                        <p>Scleritis is a rare condition affecting women more than men. In 50% of cases it is associated
                            with connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It
                            can also be associated with uveitis, glaucoma and cataract. If it is anterior, the eye will
                            be red, with tenderness over the affected area. If it is posterior, the eye will look white.
                            Pain is the main feature and may be severe. Steroid drops will be used for anterior
                            scleritis and systemic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen for posterior scleritis.
