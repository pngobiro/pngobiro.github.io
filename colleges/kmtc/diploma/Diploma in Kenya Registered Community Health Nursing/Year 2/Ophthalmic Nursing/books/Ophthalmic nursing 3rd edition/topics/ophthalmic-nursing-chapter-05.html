                        <p>The eyeball or globe is protected by the bony socket or orbit in which it sits (Fig. 5.1).
                            The orbit is composed of seven bones:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>maxilla</li>

                        <p>Each orbit has four walls: a floor, roof, lateral wall and medial wall. The two medial walls
                            are parallel to each other and the two orbits diverge to allow for a greater field of
                            vision. The orbits are pyramid-shaped with the apex posteriorly.</p>

                        <p>Orbital cellulitis (Fig. 5.4 and Colour Plate 5) is an acute purulent inflammation of the
                            cellular tissue of the orbit. It is an ophthalmic emergency because of optic nerve
                            compression. It is more common in children and is usually unilateral.</p>

                            <li>All suspected cases of orbital cellulitis will need to have a CT scan to look for any
                                sight/life-threatening subperiosteal and orbital collections. The scan will also show
                                evidence of any adjacent sinus disease. If adjacent sinus disease is not located but
                                intraconal opacity seen on the CT scan, trauma or foreign body should be suspected.</li>

                            <li>The infection may spread backwards into the brain causing:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>cavernous sinus thrombosis</li>
                                    <li>meningitis</li>

                            <li>Exposure keratopathy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If orbital cellulitis occurs in a child, he is usually referred to an ear, nose and throat
                            specialist, as the cause is invariably from ethmoidal/maxillary sinus.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preseptal cellulitis</h3>
                        <p>This is infection of the eyelids only, i.e. preseptal. Preseptal cellulitis is often preceded
                            by infection of the teeth or sinuses, by trauma or infected lid chalazion (inflammatory
                            cyst). The infection does not spread beyond the orbital septum of the upper lid into the
                            orbit. The signs and symptoms are similar to orbital cellulitis but the condition is not so
                            dangerous.</p>
                        <p>If a child presents with obvious lid cyst, treat with oral antibiotics and consider drainage.
                            The child must be reviewed daily until improvement is seen. The child is to be admitted if
                            unwell, if in pain, if it is due to trauma, if no clear history, if parental understanding
                            is poor or if significant ptosis is obstructing examination.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cavernous sinus thrombosis</h3>
                        <p>The cavernous sinus is situated near the pituitary gland. Through it pass many of the veins
                            draining structures around the face, including the orbit, globe, nose, mouth, sinuses and
                            the meninges. Thus infection can spread from any of these structures into the cavernous
                            sinus. It may also spread from a general infectious disease or septic focus elsewhere in the
                            body. It is a serious condition. Fifty percent of cases are bilateral.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>

                                and are thus involved.</li>
                            <li>dilated pupil(s), usually non-reactive due to the trigeminal nerve being involved as it
                                also passes through the cavernous sinus</li>
                            <li>anaesthetic cornea due to the involvement of the trigeminal nerve</li>
                            <li>reduced visual acuity due to pressure</li>

                        <p>Graves' disease describes the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is thought to be due
                            to an autoimmune problem. It usually affects women between the ages of 20 and 45 who have
                            signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis together with ophthalmic signs. Ophthalmic signs can
                            occur in patients who are clinically euthyroid and in these cases the disease is referred to
                            as ophthalmic Graves' disease. The signs and symptoms tend to be similar.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Signs</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Exophthalmos</b> - unilateral or bilateral. Inflammatory exudates and plasma cell
                                infiltration of the orbital fat and extra-ocular muscles push the globe forwards (Fig.
                                5.5).</li>
                            <li><b>Lid lag</b> - when looking downwards, the top lid normally moves with the eye. In
                                this condition, the lid moves very slowly down or not at all. This is possibly due to
                                sympathetic overactivity of Müller's muscle.</li>
                            <li><b>Lid retraction</b> - the upper lid retracts, giving the typical 'stare' associated
                                with thyroid eye disease. The sclera above the cornea is visible. This is probably due
                                to involvement of the levator muscle.</li>
                            <li><b>Corneal exposure</b> - corneal exposure occurs because:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>the lids are unable to close over the protruding globe</li>
                                    <li>defective blinking occurs because of involvement of the lid muscles.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><b>Exophthalmoplegia</b> - this is the inability to move the eye in the fields of gaze
                                because the extra-ocular muscles are involved due to infiltration and later fibrosis.
                                Diplopia results.</li>
                            <li>In hyperthyroidism, signs of thyrotoxicosis such as tachycardia and muscular tremors may
                                be present.</li>

                        <p>A chalazion is a swelling of one of the Meibomian glands due to a blockage of its duct (Fig.
                            5.6). It can affect either the upper or lower lid. It may become infected, when it is
                            sometimes called an internal hordeolum. Staphylococci are commonly the cause of the
                            infection. The swelling may fluctuate in size during the course of the condition. Some
                            chalazions point to the skin surface. Some people appear to be prone to this condition and
                            should be examined to ensure that they are not diabetic. Some chalazions are so large as to
                            obstruct vision and, by pressing on the cornea, cause astigmatism.</p>

                                muscle. It is usually bilateral. The child with bilateral congenital ptosis has to tilt
                                his head backwards to be able to see properly. This will prevent amblyopia developing
                                (see p. 189). There is a danger that amblyopia will occur with unilateral ptosis.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bell's palsy</h3>
                        <p>Bell's palsy is due to paralysis of the seventh nerve with resulting incomplete lids closure
                            and corneal exposure. As a result of ineffective lid closure and corneal exposure, patients
                            may present with a painful, red watery eye. The early management of Bell's palsy is aimed at
                            the painful red eye. Initially copious topical lubricant and taping of the eyelid at night
                            is all that is required. The patient will need constant reassurance and support at every
                            stage. If corneal exposure is severe, a temporary lateral tarsorrhaphy may be needed.
                            Lateral tarsorrhaphy joins the upper and lower lids laterally in order to reduce the
                            palpebral aperture and protect the cornea. The long-term management of poor lid closure may
                            include the implantation of gold weights into the upper lid. This procedure allows a better
                            lid closure and a more natural blink. Possible complications may include extrusion or
                            migration (Collin & Rose, 2001).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blepharospasm</h3>
                        <p>This is a condition that causes forceful, painful spasm eyelid closure resulting in
                            difficulty in opening the eye. Photophobia is present and the condition is exacerbated by
                            bright lights, stress and excessive movement around the person. It can cause the individual
                            concerned to become socially isolated and unable to work. There may be some accompanying
                            contraction of the lower facial muscles. Treatment is by injections of Botulinum (Osaka &
                            Keltner, 1991) into the orbicularis muscle. This is repeated every two to three months.</p>

                            <li>Mohs' micrographic surgery (where available) is used in the management of periocular
                                basal cell carcinoma. Mohs' micrographic surgery allows each cancerous layer to be
                                visualised through the microscope. Excision of the cancerous layer continues until
                                cancer-free layers are obtained.</li>

                            <li>Prepare the patient and equipment for removal of the tumour. Skin grafting or flaps may
                                be necessary depending on the size and position of the tumour.</li>
                            <li>Send specimen to the laboratory for histology.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Surgery to the lids must be performed with great care to avoid either an ectropion, entropion
                            or trichiasis resulting.</p>
