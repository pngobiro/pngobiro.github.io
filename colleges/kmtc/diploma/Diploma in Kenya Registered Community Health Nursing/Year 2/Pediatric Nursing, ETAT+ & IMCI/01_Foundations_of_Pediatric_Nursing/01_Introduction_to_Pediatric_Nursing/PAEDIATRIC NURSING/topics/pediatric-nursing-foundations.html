                            <li>It includes the five stages of development according to erik erickson. Thus, infancy, toddler, preschool, school and adolescent.</li>
                            <li>It focuses on their growth & development to ensure they are given the opportunities to achieve their full potential as adults.</li>
                            <li>The young are most vulnerable or disadvantaged in society hence need special attention. Children are individuals, not little adults who must be seen as part of the family.</li>

                            <li>Providing paediatric care to children and families requires knowledge of different dynamics that influence it in contemporary society</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nurses are confronted by difficult ethical/ legal decisions especially for nurses taking care of children in critical care conditions e.g. Does one resuscitate a child or not? Hence the need to understand some legal/ ethical guidelines that can resolve these dilemmas.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Different governments have different legal laws and regulations. Though children have right to informed consent, usually, it's the legal guardian or parents who take the consent .children are said to "assent" i.e. Paediatric client has been informed about the procedure and is willing to permit it being performed. However, assent is not legally required but important for child's cooperation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">When is informed consent not required?</h3>
                        <p>Emergency situations - emergency life saving procedure. But should be after attempts have been made to contract parent or legal guardian. Adolescents can consent.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Forensic examination - where evidence is required .may not require informed consent but still is vital for child's assent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Minors can consent for care in a number of situations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where child may avoid care of caregivers e.g. Pregnancy, drug abuse treatment, contraception, treatment of STIs.</li>
                            <li>If minor is considered to be emancipated i.e. Legal recognition that a minor lives independently and is legally responsible for his or her own support and decision making.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Refusal of medical care by parent/caregiver</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually, this occurs if health care conflicts parent's religious beliefs. Parents may refuse to act to the best interest of the child. In such cases, the government may make legal decision of the child.</li>
                            <li>The theory of parens patrie is applied. This is a legal rule allowing government to make decision in place of parents when they are unable or unwilling e.g. to provide for the best interest of the child.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A concerned attitude calls for a kind approach and understanding on your part.</li>
                            <li>Avoid criticising child's parent/guardian who is misinformed about the nature of disease, causes and prognosis</li>
                            <li>The parents/guardians should be allowed to accompany their children to the assigned bed within the ward.</li>
                            <li>The parents should receive pleasant and friendly reception in a clean and a quiet environment</li>
                            <li>The older child, if not seriously ill on admission, should be introduced to other children. This reduces possible anxiety and stress.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, the parents should be introduced to other parents. It is important you use the correct names and pronunciation.</li>
                            <li>You should carry out the procedures carefully and methodically. You should also be ready to answer any questions clearly and fully as ambiguity may cause distress and misunderstanding to parents/ guardians.</li>
                            <li>If older children are not seriously ill and are mobile, they and their parents/ guardians should be introduced to the ward or unit, including orientation to available facilities such as call bell, toilets, bathrooms and playroom.</li>
                            <li>Information such as visiting hours for friends, parents, guardians and siblings including types of food and drinks, which may be brought should be given.</li>
                            <li>You should make every effort to find out from the parents/guardians the child's likes, dislikes and the name they commonly use to call him/her. Such investigations will enable you to adapt accordingly.</li>
                            <li>The same enquiries should apply to family history and spiritual beliefs, which you should address without causing embarrassment</li>
                            <li>Finally, informed consent for care and operation should be obtained before the parents/ guardians leave for home.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">History taking</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In almost all cases, the history is usually taken from the parents or guardians, especially when the child is young. For older children, additional information as to how they feel may be obtained directly.</li>
                            <li>The most important details to be recorded should include medical history, that is, whether the child has been ill before and the nature of any previous illness. It is also necessary to find out whether the patient has had any surgery before and for what purpose.</li>
                            <li>You should also take the family, social and economic history because these may be contributing factors to illness. In addition, the mother's obstetric history.</li>
                            <li>While taking the patient's history, you will have the opportunity to apply your communication, interviewing and teaching skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physical examination</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In order to make a nursing diagnosis and prepare the nursing care plan, you should perform an objective physical examination from head to toe.</li>
                            <li>When examining a child, try and make friends first exercising all the patience. Be flexible in the order of examination, that is, do upsetting and disturbing procedures last. In most cases the standard techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation is used.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Position/place for examination</h3>
                        <p>When examining a child, it is important to seek the help of the parent or guardian to prevent unnecessary movement and resentment by the child.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The young children will have to be undressed by the parent/guardian, while the examination will be performed on his/her laps.</li>
                            <li>The use of distracters may also win the child's confidence and enhance his co-operation.</li>
                            <li>You should talk to the child and mother in a low voice and persuasive manner maintaining eye contact at the level to that of the patient.</li>
                            <li>Older children may be given the necessary instruction on what to do and should be allowed to choose the position they wish to adopt during physical examination.</li>
                            <li>The child's developmental and nutritional status is also assessed during the physical examination</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">investigation</h3>
                        <p>Some of the common investigations, which you may handle include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body fluids, excretions and secretions, and tissues for culture and sensitivity tests;</li>
                            <li>Blood for white cell counts and differentials;</li>
                            <li>Haemoglobin and malarial parasites;</li>
                            <li>Grouping and cross matching;</li>
                            <li>Urine for microscopic, albumen, sugar, acetone;</li>
                            <li>Stool for ova and cysts and occult blood;</li>
                            <li>Radiological investigations, although for very young babies this may have to be kept to a minimum;</li>
                            <li>Endoscopic investigations may also be carried out but only in a few selected patients according to the problems they are suffering from;</li>
                            <li>Sputum for microscopic culture and sensitivity. Where the patient is unable to produce the specimen, insertion of a naso-gastric tube may be considered and stomach content aspirated and sent to laboratory.</li>
                            <li>You should endeavour to ensure that the parents and the patients are physically and psychologically prepared before, during and after the procedures.</li>
                            <li>Above all, the principles of infection control must be observed when handling specimen.</li>
