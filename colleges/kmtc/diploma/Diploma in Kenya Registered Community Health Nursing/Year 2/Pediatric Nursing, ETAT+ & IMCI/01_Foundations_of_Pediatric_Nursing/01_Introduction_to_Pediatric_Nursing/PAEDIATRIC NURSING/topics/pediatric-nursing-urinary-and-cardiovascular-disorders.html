                        <ul>
                            <li>This is a disease that affects the glomeruli of both kidneys.</li>
                            <li>It may follow exposure to a variety of foreign protein substances, the most common of which are bacterial (haemolytic streptococci) and viral infections.</li>
                            <li>Note that it is not the streptococci that cause the problem directly but their toxin/poisonous products.</li>
                            <li>However, in many cases, the antigen causing glomerulonephritis is unknown.</li>
                            <li>The condition is as a result of an antigen-antibody complex reacting with the glomerular tissue to produce swelling and death of capillary cells. The organism causes sore throat or skin disease initially; then ten to fourteen days later, an allergic inflammation occurs in the kidneys. It tends to occur more commonly in children and young adults. Recovery is complete in over 95% of cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is history of sore throat seven to ten days previously;</li>
                            <li>The patient has fatigue (tiredness);</li>
                            <li>Complaints of pyrexia and tachycardia present;</li>
                            <li>Hypertension with mild, moderate, severe headache;</li>
                            <li>Oedema, which may be generalized but more noticeable in the face. This is due to salt and water retention. In a few cases ascites/pleural effusion may be present;</li>
                            <li>Oliguria;</li>
                            <li>Haematuria;</li>
                            <li>Proteinuria;</li>
                            <li>Dyspnoea due to pulmonary oedema;</li>
                            <li>Uraemia, that is, blood urea and creatinine raised above normal (normal blood urea is $15-40 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mls}$ );</li>
                            <li>Anorexia is usually present.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should be put on complete bed rest in a warm well-ventilated room until his/her temperature subsides, the blood pressure (bp) falls and no blood or protein is visible in the urine.</li>
                            <li>Vital signs should be recorded regularly. Temperature, pulse and respiration (tpr) and blood pressure (bp) should be monitored every four hours and any abnormalities should be reported.</li>
                            <li>Bp should be taken lying down and standing to exclude postural hypotension. You should maintain an input and output chart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Note:</h4>
                            <p>Diseased kidneys do need rest, therefore, a low protein diet is recommended ( 40 G daily).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restrict the patient's fluid intake to $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day plus the amount of urine passed during that period until diuresis occurs.</li>
                            <li>Aim to lessen kidney activity. As previously mentioned, all urine should be tested four hourly for protein and blood.</li>
                            <li>24 hour urine collection to estimate the amount of protein lost in the urine may be sent to the laboratory.</li>
                            <li>Esbach's urine testing at the ward level may also be performed 24 hourly.</li>
                            <li>More carbohydrates should be consumed, such as glucose and orange drinks.</li>
                            <li>A normal diet is gradually resumed according to the urinary output.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be weighed once daily as a means of determining whether the oedema is decreasing.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that you pay special attention to the hygiene of the skin, mouth and pressure areas.</li>
                            <li>paracetamol and brufen may be prescribed for pyrexia.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics, usually penicillin v or benzyl penicillin, are recommended for sore throat or any respiratory diseases.</li>
                            <li>One or two doses of frusemide (a diuretic) will often help to reduce the oedema.</li>
                            <li>Occupational therapy and psychological care are also important. The child should be occupied by playing or reading in bed as he will feel bored and needs reassurance. Parents should also be involved in the care for their child and should also be constantly reassured.</li>
                            <li>While providing nursing care for the patient, you should be aware of the main complications that may present, which in this case are chronic nephritis and acute or chronic renal failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">complications</h4>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NEPHROTIC SYNDROME</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This term refers to a condition involving increased permeability of the glomeruli. It is associated with a variety of renal diseases generally characterized by oedema, proteinuria (albuminuria) and low serum albumin. It affects children and adults alike.</li>
                            <li>When the kidney fails to perform its normal function of filtration, there is an excessive loss of protein in the urine.</li>
                            <li>This loss of protein leads to low serum albumin.</li>
                            <li>Low serum albumin causes a low osmotic pressure in the blood.</li>
                            <li>This consequently results in generalized oedema.</li>
                            <li>In 75% of cases in childhood, the cause is unknown (idiosyncratic).the remaining 25% cases occur as part of variety of disorders.</li>

                            <li>Glomerulonephritis, which is an inflammation of the kidney glomeruli (filtrate);</li>
                            <li>Amyloidosis, which is a condition leading to an accumulation of starch-like substances in various body tissues. Causes of this are unknown;</li>
                            <li>Diabetic nephropathy, that is, a degenerative condition of the kidneys due to diabetes;</li>
                            <li>Acute infections with septicaemia;</li>
                            <li>Drug overdose, for example, of sulpha drugs;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oedema, which results because of salt and water retention;</li>
                            <li>Puffy eyes in the morning. Swollen feet and ankles later in the day. The patient may also have swollen genitalia;</li>
                            <li>Susceptibility to infection;</li>
                            <li>Pyrexia and tachycardia whose degree depends on the extent of onset of infection;</li>
                            <li>Proteinuria (loss of protein in urine) usually confirmed by testing urine. To the naked eye urine appears dark;</li>
                            <li>There may be blood in urine.</li>
                            <li>Blood pressure is normal in idiosyncratic cases, but may be raised in other cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">investigation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medical investigations will include a daily esbach test, routine examination of urine,</li>
                            <li>urine culture and sensitivity.</li>
                            <li>You should also test for blood hb, haemogram, wbc, casts, culture and sensitivity, urea, electrolytes, esr and plasma protein levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should be nursed in fowler's position and you should take precautions to prevent pressure sores.</li>
                            <li>Bed rest should be prescribed if the oedema is severe. Otherwise, the child should be allowed to move around.</li>
                            <li>Diuretics, for example, frusemide (lasix), are normally administered to reduce the oedema.</li>
                            <li>Potassium chloride is given in order to prevent potassium loss due to the lasix.</li>
                            <li>Cortico-steroids, for example, prednisone is given and continued until the urine is free from protein and remains normal for 10 days to 2 weeks.</li>
                            <li>Immunosuppressant drugs, for example, cyclophosphamide is recommended if a relapse occurs after prednisone.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A weekly wbc is also necessary, particularly if the patient is on cyclophosphamide.</li>
                            <li>Give the patient meals that are high in protein and carbohydrates and low in salt.</li>
                            <li>Restrict fluid intake and maintain fluid chart strictly.</li>
                            <li>Weigh daily to assess degree of oedema.</li>
                            <li>You should set esbach 24 hourly, or alternatively, send urine to laboratory for protein loss estimate.</li>
                            <li>In addition, you should observe tpr and bp 4 hourly and ensure that good hygiene is maintained.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Urinary tract infection</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This infection occurs in infancy affecting both girls and boys equally.</li>
                            <li>In the first years of life, however, more girls than boys are infected because the former tend to have shorter urethra.</li>
                            <li>Children tend to suffer more from lower urinary infections, that is, infections of the urethra and bladder.</li>
                            <li>The micro-organisms commonly responsible for urinary tract infection are escherichia coli (e. Coli). They ascend from the vulva and urethra to the bladder. Occasionally, as the problem develops, the ureters and renal pelvis are involved resulting in pyelonephritis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pre-disposing factors include,</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These include congenital abnormalities of the renal tract, especially those that interfere with the flow of urine, for example, hypospadias and epispadias.</li>
                            <li>Meningomyelocele and paralysis of the urinary bladder, especially those associated with spinal injuries (paraplegia) are also common causes.</li>
                            <li>Unrecognized phimosis</li>
                            <li>local infections due to injuries caused by children playing or inserting foreign bodies into their own genitalia may also be causal factors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The escherichia coli (e. Coli) is the most common causative micro organism but others may also be responsible.</li>
                            <li>The infection begins from the lower portion of the urinary tract, causing inflammatory changes and involving the sphincter valve at the base of the bladder.</li>
                            <li>This makes the valve incompetent and results in urinary reflux to the ureters.</li>
                            <li>The reflux allows upper urinary tract infections to occur, causing a gradual dilatation of the renal pelvis.</li>
                            <li>Recurrent bladder infections cause tissue irritation, which makes the patient have desire to frequently micturate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There will be burning painful micturition (dysuria);</li>
                            <li>Lower abdominal pain and desire to pass urine more frequently;</li>
                            <li>The patient is pyrexial and irritable;</li>
                            <li>An unexplained persistent fever;</li>

                        <p>When diagnosing a patient with nephroblastoma, the following characteristics should be kept in mind:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In early stages it is symptomatic;</li>
                            <li>The condition occurs in the first three years of life;</li>
                            <li>The child is usually brought to hospital because of gross abdominal enlargement and pain;</li>
                            <li>Renal colic and haematuria;</li>
                            <li>Urinary suppression and urinary infection;</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Proper diagnostic investigations should always begin with accurate history taking.</li>
                            <li>This should be followed by a careful physical examination,</li>
                            <li>which should include an intravenous pyelogram</li>
                            <li>cystoscopy to exclude ureteric involvement,</li>
                            <li>abdominal and chest x-ray to assess the extent of metastasis and</li>

                        <p>The condition is best managed by a nephrectomy or nephrouterectomy.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This should be commenced as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be nursed on bed rest while the investigations and management are being organized.</li>
                            <li>An intravenous pyelogram is aimed at detecting whether the renal pelvis is distorted and the kidney displaced.</li>
                            <li>Abdominal palpation should be carried out carefully and kept to a minimum to prevent the systemic spread of cancer cells to the renal veins.</li>

                        <p>The nurse must make every effort to prevent infections, to accurately observe and record fluid intake and output and to selectively manage the patient's dietary intake.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On return from the theatre, the child is nursed in semi-prone position and the airway cleared to ensure adequate ventilation.</li>
                            <li>After recovery, he/she should be nursed in recumbent and finally upright position to facilitate drainage from the nephrectomy bed.</li>
                            <li>Clinical observations of tpr/bp and general appearance should be recorded every one to four hours as the condition improves.</li>
                            <li>Specific observations include drainage from redivac, corrugated tube and wound.</li>
                            <li>Strict urinary output is observed, recorded and reported to the doctor. A fluid balance chart should be accurately maintained.</li>
                            <li>If oedema or oliguria is found to be present, you should restrict fluid intake.</li>
                            <li>If stones have formed in the renal system, or there is an onset of infection, you should increase the fluid intake.</li>
                            <li>This, however, must be done in consultation with the doctor.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be given low salt and low protein diet for oedematous and uraemic patients, while the carbohydrate intake should be increased.</li>
                            <li>Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor electrolyte levels, haemoglobin, blood urea and creatinine.</li>
                            <li>Naso-gastric tube aspiration in the early stages is necessary, especially when the patient feels nauseated.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen therapy is recommended but only when necessary. Strict oral toilet should be maintained four hourly throughout.</li>
                            <li>Physiotherapy and early ambulation should be encouraged to prevent complications.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Congenital heart failure is the major cause of death (other than prematurity)in the first year of life.</li>
                            <li>The most common is the ventricular septal defect.</li>
                            <li>Congenital heart defects lead to heart failure.</li>
                            <li>In foetal life, much of the pulmonary arterial blood is passed through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta (carrying blood of mixed gases).</li>
                            <li>This is because the pressure on the right side of the heart is higher than the pressure within the aorta.</li>
                            <li>At birth, the wall muscles of the ductus arteriosus constrict in readiness to close.</li>
                            <li>Complete closure may not occur sometimes until the second or third month of life.</li>
                            <li>Soon after birth, the pressure on the left chambers of the heart becomes higher than that on the right side.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The foetal heart is completely developed in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>At this stage, one of several anomalies may occur from mal-development of the heart or the great blood vessels, leading to heart disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Such defects may be hereditary, caused by inherent genetic defects.</li>
                            <li>They may also be caused by a vitamin deficiency or viral infection such as rubella (german measles) occurring in the first three months of pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Foetal intra-cardiac disease is possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After birth, there may be failure of closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Other factors known to contribute to these abnormalities are the effects of radiation and drugs such as thalidomide, phenytoin sodium and alcohol.</li>
                            <li>Cardio-vascular malformation is known to occur in about 8 per 1000 births. It causes about half of the deaths due to congenital defects in the first year of life.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The collateral circulation in infants is normal when blood flows from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the descending thoracic aorta.</li>
                            <li>At birth, due to constriction and change of pressures on both sides, the ductus degenerate to what is called ligamentum arteriosum within 24-72 hours.</li>
                            <li>When this ductus arteriosus does not close, oxygenated blood from the aorta flows to the pulmonary artery, mixing with the deoxygenated blood there.</li>
                            <li>A large pda will result in heart failure with all its complications.</li>
                            <li>It is twice as common in female babies as in males (ratio 2:1).</li>
                            <li>Reasons for its occurrence are unclear.</li>
                            <li>In most cases, the diagnosis may not be made until the child is 3-4 years old, when the heart murmur may be detected on a routine medical check up.</li>

                            <li>There is a characteristic machinery-like murmur.</li>
                            <li>A widened pulse pressure and bounding pulses result from runoff of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery.</li>
                            <li>Patients are at risk for bacterial endocarditis and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease in later life from chronic excessive pulmonary blood flow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Administration of indomethacin (prostaglandin inhibitor) has proved successful in closing a patent ductus in premature infants and some newborns.</li>
                            <li>Surgical intervention is also possible in correcting this condition.</li>
                            <li>Closure with placement of an occluder device during cardiac catheterization is done in some places.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Coarction of the aorta</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is a localized narrowing near the insertion of the ductus arteriosus, resulting in increased pressure proximal to the defect (head and upper extremities) and decreased pressure distal to the obstruction (body and lower extremities).</li>
                            <li>It is also a localized malformation caused by deformity of the aorta resulting in the narrowing of the lumen of that vessel.</li>

                        <p>Types:</p>

                            <li>the infantile or pre-ductal type, where constriction occurs between the sub-clavian artery and the ductus arteriosus</li>
                            <li>post-ductal type, where constriction occurs at or distal to the ductus arteriosus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical manifestation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Since there is increased pressure proximal to the defect and decreased pressure distal to the defect, the patient becomes hypertensive;</li>
                            <li>Headache, dizziness and fainting;</li>
                            <li>Epistaxis and later cerebral vascular accident (stroke);</li>
                            <li>Pulse rate in the lower limbs is very low. The legs are colder than the arms. Any active exercise results in cramps of the lower limbs due to tissue anoxia;</li>
                            <li>Heart murmur may or may not be present.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The condition is managed through surgical repair (corctectomy) before adulthood.</li>
                            <li>It involves removal of narrow areas followed by anastomosis. Prognosis is usually good.</li>

                            <li>This is a defect whereby the blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium under pressure from the left side of the heart or an abnormal opening between the atria, allowing blood from the higher-pressure left atrium to flow into the lower pressure right atrium.</li>
                            <li>This results in increased right ventricular output and pulmonary engorgement.</li>
                            <li>This condition is also usually discovered on routine medical examination when systolic pressure is found to have a blowing murmur in the area of pulmonary artery.</li>
                            <li>Children suffering from atrial septal defects tend to be susceptible to pneumonia and rheumatic fever</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They are of three types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Asd 1 - opening at lower end of septum; may be associated with mitral valve abnormalities</li>
                            <li>Asd 2 - opening near centre of septum</li>
                            <li>Sinus venosus defect - opening near junction of superior vena cava and right atrium; may be associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.</li>
                            <li>Management of this condition involves surgical repair either through close- or open-heart surgery.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This is an abnormal opening between the right and the left ventricles.</li>
                            <li>If the defect is large enough, the blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle resulting in right ventricular overload and hypertrophy.</li>
                            <li>The small openings tend to close spontaneously.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tetralogy of Fallot</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the most common type of congenital heart disease.</li>
                            <li>It varies in severity but is characterized by a combination of four defects presenting themselves at the same time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These defects are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pulmonary artery stenosis;</li>
                            <li>Ventricular septal defect;</li>
                            <li>Over-riding aorta (dextroposition);</li>
                            <li>Hypertrophy of the right ventricle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this condition, the blood from the systemic circulation returning to the right atrium and right ventricle is restricted by the pulmonary stenosis so that it flows through the ventricular septal defect into the left ventricle and then to the aorta (right to left shunt). The pressure exerted against the pulmonary stenosis leads to right ventricular hypertrophy.</li>
                            <li>Since the blood from the right ventricle is deoxygenated, the child becomes cyanosed.</li>
                            <li>Although the blood cannot leave the right ventricle the normal way, the pulmonary blood flow may be increased by pulmonary collateral circulation and sometimes by ductus arteriosus.</li>
                            <li>The body will attempt to compensate for the un-oxygenated blood by producing more red blood cells which will result in an increase of red blood cells (polycythaemia).</li>
                            <li>This will lead to an increased blood viscosity, hence thrombophlebitis, emboli or stroke (cerebral vascular accident).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cyanosis, which may be mild or severe and occur depending on the degree of the defect. If blood shunts from the right side to the left side of the heart, the cyanosis will be more marked and noticeable on the mucous membranes of the lips, mouth, pharynx and fingernails;</li>
                            <li>Dyspnoea, due to pulmonary oedema and increased carbondioxide level in the blood (systemic anoxia);</li>
                            <li>Polycythaemia (excessive rise of red blood cells in the circulation). This increases blood viscosity resulting into arterial thrombosis, which may block the vessels supplying the brain with blood and result in growth failure;</li>
                            <li>Clubbing of fingers and toes may be present after the first year of life;</li>
                            <li>Cardiac murmur is recognized during medical examination, especially when stenosis is present.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <p>Depending on the child's condition the management can be divided into two categories.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Palliative surgery</h5>
                        <p>This is a temporary approach used when the patient's condition does not allow for corrective surgery. There are several methods involved.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first is the waterston shunt-side-to-side anastomosis of the ascending thoracic aorta and right pulmonary artery.</li>
                            <li>The blalock -taussig procedure is commonly used for older infants and children. In this procedure, the sub-clavian artery is joined to the pulmonary artery.</li>
                            <li>Finally, pott's procedure involves joining the upper descending aorta to the left pulmonary artery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Corrective surgery</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This operation requires the use of of deep hypothermia and cardio-pulmonary by-pass approach for young children and heart-lung bypass for the older children.</li>
                            <li>Transposition of the great vessels is performed.</li>
                            <li>These activities are undertaken in special health facilities with intensive care units.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute rheumatic heart disease (rhd) is an acute inflammatory reaction.</li>
                            <li>It may involve the endocardium, including the valves, resulting in scarring, distortion and stenosis of the valves.</li>
                            <li>It may also involve the myocardium where necrosis occurs and on healing, leaves scars, or the pericardium where it may cause adhesions to surrounding tissues.</li>
                            <li>The development of symptoms of chronic rhd in later life depends on the location and severity of the damage and other factors.</li>
                            <li>This type of heart disease, which usually occurs in children, has its origin in rheumatic fever.</li>
                            <li>The fever is associated with haemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat, mainly tonsillitis and pharyngitis, experienced two to three weeks before the onset of the fever.</li>
                            <li>About $90 \%$ of first fever attacks occur among persons aged five to fifteen years of age.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All the three layers of the heart gradually become affected, especially the endocardium.</li>
                            <li>This is known as endocarditis of the left side of the heart.</li>
                            <li>The infection may also progress to affect the mitral valve or other valves in the heart.</li>
                            <li>The flaps, which form the valve, become swollen and oedematous with small and firmly attached vegetable-like deposits.</li>
                            <li>In the acute stage, the valve becomes incompetent, resulting in subsequent fibrosis and thickening.</li>
                            <li>The tendonous cords (cordae tendineae) become shortened. This causes stenosis, with or without incompetence.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The child complains of headache, vomiting, moderate fever of $37^{20} \mathrm{C}$ to $37^{\circ \circ} \mathrm{c}$ but can be higher, fur tongue, sweating and occasionally constipation. These are signs of emerging toxaemia;</li>
                            <li>Pulse rate is elevated, corresponding to temperature;</li>
                            <li>On examination, the patient has a severely painful movable joint, which begins with one and gradually spreading to others. Normally the knees, elbows, wrists, ankles are affected;</li>
                            <li>Occasionally these joints are reddened, swollen and warm to the touch. There may be nodules over these joints;</li>
                            <li>When the child has been ill for a prolonged period of time, anaemia will develop, indicating danger of permanent heart damage;</li>
                            <li>Some patients may occasionally faint and develop slightly pinkish rash appearing on the chest. This may occur intermittently for several months.</li>

                            <li>Vital signs observations of temperature, pulse and respiration should be taken and recorded every two hours, and any abnormalities immediately reported to the doctor;</li>
                            <li>Take particular interest in the painful joints. Small soft pillows should be used to support the affected limb providing comfort. You should ensure that bed cradle is in place to keep beddings off the lower limbs;</li>
                            <li>The child should be on complete bed rest with all activities carried out by the nurses. You should explain to older children and their parents why such steps are being taken;</li>
                            <li>The child should be given light, well-balanced meals and you should assign one nurse to feed him/her, if he is too ill to do so himself or whenever he/she is in pain;</li>
                            <li>Slowly progressive passive exercise in bed and occupational therapy is advised. As the child's condition improves, he/she will be mobilized within the ward;</li>
                            <li>Involve the family in the child's care, as this care will have to continue at home.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the parents that the child with rheumatic heart disease should be encouraged to continue with normal activities as far as possible and emphasise that over-protection will not facilitate recovery.</li>

                            <li>However, several drugs may be given, mainly to control pain and for prophylaxis.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics, such as penicillin v, or amoxil as prophylactic, are commonly used.</li>
                            <li>Analgesics, such as aspirin or brufen, may be the alternative choice.</li>
                            <li>The doses depend on the age and individual patient's needs.</li>
