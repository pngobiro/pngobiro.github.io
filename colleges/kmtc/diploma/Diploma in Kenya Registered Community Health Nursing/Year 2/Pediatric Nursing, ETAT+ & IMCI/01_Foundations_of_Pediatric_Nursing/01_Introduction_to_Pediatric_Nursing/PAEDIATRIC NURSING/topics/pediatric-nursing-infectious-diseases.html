                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Meningitis simply means inflammation of the meninges.</li>
                            <li>The brain and spinal cord covering membranes more commonly infected are the pia and arachnoid matters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causative organisms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci). This micro-organism is intracellular gram negative diplococcus. There are six sero strains (groups), namely a, b, c, d, x and y.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Epidemiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In many parts of the african continent, sero group a is the main cause of epidemics and usually meningococcal meningitis is the commonest of the types of meningitis accounting for 90% of cases.</li>
                            <li>Other types of meningitis may be caused by pneumococci, salmonella, staphylococci.</li>
                            <li>However, viruses and mycobacterium tubercle bacilli occasionally cause meningitis.</li>
                            <li>The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days but commonly 3 to 4 days.</li>
                            <li>Meningococcal meningitis is an infectious disease, which can be passed from one person to another so long as meningococci are present in the discharges from the nose and mouth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normally, the meningococci are found in the nasopharynx without disturbing the host or carrier.</li>
                            <li>The reservoir is mainly human.</li>
                            <li>Illness results from either increased invasiveness of the bacteria or lower body resistance of the host.</li>
                            <li>Some people have deficit or deficiency of some gamma immunoglobulin, which in some cases runs in families. This explains why some epidemics run in the family, while others are symptom less carriers.</li>
                            <li>Meningococcal meningitis is mostly common in children and young adults.</li>
                            <li>When the surrounding blood vessels around the nasopharynx are invaded, the organisms enter the cerebral spinal fluid (csf) spreading throughout the sub-arachnoid space.</li>
                            <li>This inflammatory process increases the cerebral spinal fluid secretion in the ventricles resulting in the interference with the csf flow throughout the ventricular aqueducts.</li>
                            <li>The colour of the csf changes according to the causative micro-organism.</li>
                            <li>The cranial nerves may be affected as the infection spreads further resulting in neurological symptoms.</li>
                            <li>When the csf flow is interfered with, hydrocephalus may occur especially in infancy.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Overcrowding and poor ventilation are the main pre-disposing factors, given that the mode of entry of micro-organisms is through inhalation, that is, the exogenous type of infection.</li>
                            <li>The organisms may also enter into the bloodstream through cracks in the respiratory tract in which it has been normal flora (i.e. endogeneous infection).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <p>The following are some of the features usually associated with meningitis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usually the onset is acute and sudden with older children complaining of headache, which becomes severe and spreads down the neck;</li>
                            <li>The patient becomes pyrexial with tachycardia;</li>
                            <li>Rigors are often present;</li>
                            <li>Painful back and limbs are present;</li>
                            <li>The patient's neck and possibly the spinal column become stiff/rigid;</li>
                            <li>Kernig’s sign is positive: patient supine with hip flexed to $90^{\circ}$; pain and inability to fully extend the knee is positive; negative if can fully extend knee.</li>
                            <li>Because of fever, convulsions may occur;</li>
                            <li>The young child cries with a high-pitched voice;</li>
                            <li>Anorexia is usually present;</li>
                            <li>In very young babies anterior fontanelle may bulge outwards instead of positive kerning's sign;</li>
                            <li>The child is irritable, drowsy and goes in to comatose state;</li>
                            <li>Photophobia is usually common. In some cases circulatory collapse with petechial haemorrhage may occur (bleeding spots) on the skin;</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis and vomiting are present</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic investigations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Begin by taking the patient’s personal history.</li>
                            <li>A physical examination should follow.</li>
                            <li>A lumbar puncture is performed to analyze csf and may show that polymorph cells are increased, csf is turbid in appearance (cloudy), the pressure is raised, glucose level is lower than normal and/or the amount of proteins is raised.</li>
                            <li>You should also investigate other suspected infections, for example, measles, malaria, typhoid, broncho-pneumonia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">management</h3>
                        <p>The main goals of intervention are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify the micro-organism;</li>
                            <li>Control the spread of infection;</li>
                            <li>Initiate therapy immediately;</li>
                            <li>Maintain clear airway in a well-ventilated room;</li>
                            <li>Put up intravenous infusion with the prescribed antibiotics;</li>
                            <li>Maintain fluid balance chart;</li>
                            <li>Identify contacts in the family, and elsewhere as they will require treatment, too.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The secondary goal is to prevent complications. This can be achieved by the following nursing activities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constant and vigilant nursing assessment for increased intracranial pressure;</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and maintaining fluid intake. If intracranial pressure is present then restrict the fluid intake;</li>
                            <li>Observing the infusion site for anything abnormal that might occur;</li>
                            <li>Observing drug side effects and taking appropriate measures;</li>
                            <li>Using dim light in the environment and controlling noise;</li>
                            <li>Regularly changing the patient's position to prevent pressure sores and control convulsions.</li>
                            <li>Observing the vital signs;</li>
                            <li>two to four hourly tepid sponging,</li>
                            <li>Ensure comfort by providing an electric fan if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Maintaining general body and oral hygiene;</li>
                            <li>Physiotherapy when condition improves at a later date.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient is admitted into an isolated cubicle to protect other children and barrier nursing is instituted at least for the first 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>The room should be quiet and darkened.</li>

                            <li>This is an infectious respiratory disease, which is characterized by an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the lungs, pharynx, trachea and bronchi. Thick, stringy mucus is produced which the child tries to expectorate by coughing. The attacks of coughing reach a peak of violence, ending in an inspiratory whoop.</li>
                            <li>The infection is caused by a type of bacterium called bordetella pertussis (or pertussis bacillus).</li>

                        <p>The following are some of the main clinical features of whooping cough:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute illness, with a slow onset of cough and fever resembling common cold (catarrhal stage). The catarrhal stage takes a period of approximately fourteen days;</li>
                            <li>The cough increases and manifests as spasms of cough while breathing out (expiration) followed by crowing or whooping while breathing in (inspiration);</li>
                            <li>In mild cases, or in babies, the typical whoop may be missing;</li>
                            <li>Young babies may be very ill or have attacks of not breathing (apnoea) resulting in cyanosis;</li>
                            <li>Coughing attacks are always associated with vomiting and strings of sticky mucus usually hang down the sides of the mouth and are more common at night;</li>
                            <li>The underneath and the sides of the tongue may be sore and ulcerated;</li>
                            <li>The whoop can last several weeks and may recur every time the child has another acute respiratory infection. There is a high mortality rate in young babies;</li>
                            <li>Leucocytosis (up to $100,000 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) and lymphocytosis are usually present and these are quite important in confirming the diagnosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing care and treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You should nurse the child on complete bed rest to prevent paroxysms of coughing.</li>
                            <li>The room environment should be kept warm and humid.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen therapy should be given continuously or when the child is cyanosed.</li>
                            <li>The child's nutritional status should be maintained by giving small, frequent feeds and when the child vomits, an attempt should be made to re-feed him/her.</li>
                            <li>For a child with whooping cough you should maintain a fluid balance chart and observe the child's vital signs, which is, temperature, pulse, respiration. Record findings every two to four hours until the condition improves.</li>
                            <li>Give health education to the parents.</li>
                            <li>Continue to maintain the child's personal hygiene.</li>
                            <li>Medical treatment includes erythromycin $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily or septrin $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bd for two weeks. This can reduce the duration of infection if administered within the first week of the illness.</li>
                            <li>Mild sedatives to keep the child quiet should be given, for example, chloral hydrate or phenobarbitone (heavy sedation must be avoided).</li>
                            <li>Phenegram in a dose of 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening may reduce whooping and vomiting and ensure a good night sleep.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics may be given to prevent secondary complications.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Poliomyelitis is an acute infectious viral disease of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and sometimes of the lower part of the brain.</li>
                            <li>It occurs sporadically or is epidemiological and usually affects the under fives but mainly under threes. It is characterized by varying degrees of paralysis.</li>
                            <li>The causative microorganism is poliovirus.</li>
                            <li>There are three types of viruses. Type 1 is known as brunhilde, which is commonly associated with paralytic illness.</li>
                            <li>Type 2 is called lansing and type 3 is also known as leon. The latter two are less commonly associated with paralysis.</li>
                            <li>It has an incubation period of three to six days but can extend between three to twenty one days.</li>
                            <li>It has an infective period of three to fourteen days. The virus spreads mainly through the oral route (gastro-intestinal tract) and then spreads to the lymphatic system. It can also spread through droplets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient presents with fever of $39-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$;</li>
                            <li>General malaise;</li>
                            <li>Vomiting and headache;</li>
                            <li>Painful and tender muscles follow this a few days later;</li>
                            <li>Paralysis of one or more limbs occurs as the muscles become weakened.</li>
                            <li>The paralysis of the respiratory muscles follows without the child developing any other illness (this is referred to as flaccid paralysis).</li>
                            <li>Only the motor system is affected but without sensory loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">types</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Paralytic type</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This can be divided into spinal polio, where the virus attacks the anterior horn of the grey matter (newness) and bulbar polio, where the virus attacks the grey matter of the brain stem probably following a tooth extraction during an epidemic.</li>
                            <li>The patient normally shows signs of having the flu, usually complicated by pneumonia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Non-paralytic type</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient experiences muscle pain and stiffness. This type of polio can also change to a paralytic type as a result of any kind of stress by im injection, walking long distances and chilly weather.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">investigations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude the possibility of meningitis. Cerebral spinal fluid is usually clear in colour. Both lymphocytes and polymorphs may be present in the csf.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This can be divided into supportive and preventive management.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be strictly confined to bed. Activities in the first two weeks of the infection risk possible increased paralysis and should, therefore, be avoided.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be nursed in isolation.</li>
                            <li>Pain should be controlled through the administration of analgesics, for example, paracetamol, and sedatives eg valium or phenobarbitone.</li>
                            <li>Regular respiratory suction and postural drainage should be performed.</li>
                            <li>N.g tube feeding should be high calorie and include substantial amounts of protein.</li>
                            <li>Change the patient's position every four hours to avoid bedsores.</li>
                            <li>Surgical procedures should also be avoided.</li>
                            <li>No injections should be administered during this acute stage as they may precipitate paralysis.</li>
                            <li>Immobilize the affected limbs during the acute stage of the illness, using splints to prevent flexion deformities and promote rest.</li>
                            <li>After the acute stage has passed, you should begin gradual and gentle exercise of the affected limbs.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that there is proper disposal of faeces and urine to prevent spread of infection.</li>
                            <li>Urinary catheterisation must be passed but principles of asepsis must be observed strictly.</li>
                            <li>Maintain an intravenous infusion and fluid balance chart. Oxygen therapy may be used when necessary.</li>
                            <li>A tracheotomy and use of a mechanical respirator may be indicated should the patient's condition deteriorate.</li>
                            <li>After being discharged, the child should return to the clinic at regular intervals to ensure flexion deformities do not occur.</li>
                            <li>A plaster of paris or back slab should be applied to the limbs if these deformities actually occur.</li>
                            <li>Special shoes and callipers may help severely affected children.</li>
                            <li>Prolonged rehabilitation will be required at a later date when the patient is fully recovered.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">prevention</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If polio occurs in an area, the district medical officer of health should be notified in writing immediately.</li>
                            <li>Sabin oral vaccines are given to children to prevent them from getting poliomyelitis whenever there is an outbreak and routinely in mch clinics.</li>

                            <li>The causative organism is varcella zoster virus (vzv).</li>
                            <li>It is spread in several ways. These include through airborne droplet infection, direct or indirect contact and dry scabs and nut infections.</li>
                            <li>Droplets from the respiratory tract can transmit the varicella zoster virus from one person to another. Even the wind is now known to transmit the virus particles from the skin of the infected person over a distance of meters to another person.</li>
                            <li>Once infected, the disease leaves immunity against chicken pox but the virus remains within the body and may reappear later in adult life as the herpes zoster when the person's immunity is weakened, for example, in aids, diabetes, leukaemia and old age.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine</li>
                            <li>Screening of blood donors, use of disposable sharps, disinfecting work areas in lab, use of PPE when handling patients</li>
                            <li>In order to prevent spread of infections, you should make every effort to ensure that your hands are thoroughly washed after handling the patient, as well as all the articles, including linen, used by him/her.</li>
                            <li>The toilets should be cleaned with disinfectants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">complications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute fulminating hepatitis characterized by rapidly rising bilirubin;</li>
                            <li>Encephalopathy, which is a degenerative process of the brain;</li>
                            <li>Oedema and ascites will always be present in the advanced stage;</li>
                            <li>Hepatic com-unconsciousness due to liver failure;</li>
                            <li>Chronic active hepatitis with hepatic dysfunction plus cirrhosis of the liver;</li>
                            <li>In some cases cirrhosis of the liver may undergo malignant changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: Nowadays, active immunization with a hepatitis $b$ vaccine is available. This is given in three doses. The first is followed by a second four weeks later. The third is administered six weeks thereafter.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HEPATITIS C</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This type of virus has ribonucleic acid (rna) in its nucleus. It causes hepatitis in similar way to hepatitis b, although the risk to health care workers and sexual transmission is less marked.</li>
                            <li>The main difference however, is its high rate of persistent infection, which increases the likelihood of the patient developing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.</li>
                            <li>It has an incubation period of approximately 2 to 26 weeks from the initial entry of the virus.</li>
                            <li>It is transmitted in the same way as hepatitis b except that both sexual and vertical transmission are quite uncommon. There is no specific mode of prevention.</li>
                            <li>Nursing care is the same as for hepatitis b.</li>
