                        <p>This is a term used to describe a group of foot deformities.</p>
                        <p>Any foot deformity involving the ankle is called talipes, derived from talus meaning ankle and pes meaning foot.</p>
                        <p>it is one of the most common congenital orthopaedic deformities, which occurs in approximately 1 in 700 to 1 in 1000 live births.</p>
                        <p>For unknown reasons, it is more common in boys than in girls.</p>
                        <p>Causes are unknown, but there are several theories. It is believed to be hereditary and may be a developmental defect in utero as a result of malpresentation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talipes, or clubfoot as it is sometimes called, is characterized by an abnormal twist or position in utero, which remains fixed.</li>
                            <li>The pathology varies from slight changes in the structure of the foot to abnormalities in the metatarsals and tarsals (bones of the foot and ankle).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TYPES OF TALIPES</h4>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Talipes equinovarus</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this condition, the foot is fixed in plantar flexion and deviates medially, that is, the heel is elevated off the ground.</li>
                            <li>It occurs in 95% of those children who have talipes.</li>
                            <li>If not corrected early, the child will walk on the toes and outer border of the foot.</li>
                            <li>These types of talipes may occur unilaterally or bilaterally.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Talipes calcaneovalgus</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The foot is dorsiflexed and deviates laterally resulting in the heel turning outwards from the midline of the body and the anterior part of the foot is elevated on the outer border.</li>
                            <li>If not corrected, the child will walk on an outwardly turned heel and the inner border of the foot.</li>
                            <li>It tends to occur unilaterally.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Talipes cavovarus</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The heel is turned inwards (inverted) from the midline of the leg but only the outer portion of the sole rests on the ground.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Talipes equinovalgus</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The heel is elevated and turned outwards (averted) from the midline of the body.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Talipes calcaneovarus</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The heel is turned towards the midline of the body and anterior part of the foot is elevated.</li>
                            <li>Only the heel rests on the floor.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Differential diagnosis</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At birth, you should be able to differentiate the structural abnormalities from paralytic deformity, which may occur in conjunction with meningomyelocele, that is, the protrusion of meninges, and possibly nerve structures through congenital opening in the lower spinal column.</li>
                            <li>Radiographic investigation by a doctor may be helpful if there is doubt.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Success in management will depend on how soon the treatment is commenced.</li>
                            <li>In most cases, it is recommended that it be commenced soon after birth preferably within 36 to 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>The short-term goal is to correct deformity and to maintain the affected area in the normal position as much as possible.</li>
                            <li>The long-term goal is to prevent recurrence of deformity.</li>
                            <li>Any delay in treatment makes the corrective measures more difficult because the bones and the muscles of the foot and leg tend to develop abnormally while the tendons become shorter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Conservative management</h5>
                        <p>Manipulation of the foot is carried out manually together with an exercise programme several times a day.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These should be done very gently to avoid pain and swelling which may occur if the management is not properly carried out.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The mother may also be taught to participate in the care of this child under supervision.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After some months, a strapping should be applied to the foot.</li>
                            <li>Plaster of paris or a splint may be applied to maintain the position after the manipulation has been performed and the correct position achieved.</li>
                            <li>Where a splint (denis browne splint) or p.o.p. is used, the mother should be instructed to inform the nurses should any skin redness occur in the area.</li>
                            <li>Special boots may also be used, especially for the older children who may come to the hospital later for talipes correction.</li>
                            <li>Parents should be given health education in preparation for their child's discharge from hospital.</li>
                            <li>The need for follow up with the clinic should be emphasized as the condition mav recur.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical management</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Where conservative treatment has failed, or where the older child is brought to hospital rather late, surgical corrective measures may be undertaken.</li>
                            <li>The operation is called tenotomy.</li>
                            <li>This is cutting and realigning the achilles tendon.</li>
                            <li>The division of contracted soft tissues may be necessary, especially among those children who are about ten years or more.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This is an abnormal condition of fluid around the brain or inside the ventricles.</li>
                            <li>The incidence varies according to the geographical location where it occurs.</li>
                            <li>It is usually a result of an interference with the circulation or absorption of cerebral spinal fluid.</li>
                            <li>The production of csf is dependent largely on active ion transportation across the epithelial membrane of the choroid plexus.</li>
                            <li>The ion mostly transported into the cavities of the ventricles is sodium.</li>
                            <li>The amount of cerebral spinal fluid produced is normally equivalent to the amount reabsorbed.</li>

                            <li>In this type of hydrocephalus, the obstruction is outside the ventricular system.</li>
                            <li>The problem is caused by blockage or occlusion of the sub-arachnoid cisterns around the brain stem.</li>
                            <li>The fluid, which is not being absorbed, compresses the brain and distends the cranial cavity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The obstruction here is within the ventricular systems, leading to interference with the flow of the cerebral spinal fluid to the sub-arachnoid space.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes include:</h5>

                            <li>Congenital defect-developmental, for example, arnod chiari malformation and aqueduct stenosis;</li>
                            <li>Acquired defects, for example, cerebral abscess, compression of the aqueduct by either aneurysm or haematoma, brain tumour of either cerebellar haematoma, brain stem haematoma and/or colloid cyst.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A physical assessment should be undertaken to ascertain the extent and seriousness of the condition, taking into account the infant's age and period of onset.</li>
                            <li>The head circumference (occipo-frontal circumference) should be regularly measured.</li>
                            <li>Medical treatment with acetazolamide (diamox) should be commenced to reduce the production of cerebral spinal fluid in mild cases of hydrocephalus.</li>
                            <li>Repeated lumbar punctures may be performed to maintain normal celebral spinal fluid pressure.</li>
                            <li>Surgical intervention may also be undertaken, depending on the severity of the condition.</li>
                            <li>This consists of the removal of obstructions such as tumours, cysts and haemorrhage (haematoma).</li>
                            <li>Another procedure that may be performed is a ventriculostomy, which involves the destruction of the third and fourth ventricle or the choroid plexus.</li>
                            <li>A radio opaque ventricular catheter is inserted to shunt cerebro-spinal fluid (csf) from the ventricle to another area outside the central nervous system, for example, the abdominal cavity.</li>
                            <li>These catheters have valves to prevent flow back of blood or any other secretion into the ventricles.</li>
                            <li>Types of valves in use are the spitz -holter valve system, hakim shunting system and heyer-schulte-pudenz catheter.</li>

                            <li>The nurse monitors signs of increased intracranial pressure and reports to the surgeon any changes.</li>
                            <li>You should continue to frequently measure the head circumference.</li>
                            <li>You should palpate the fontanelles gently for possible separation of sutures and tension.</li>
                            <li>Vital signs should be taken and recorded (tpr/bp) every one or two hours. Any deviations should be reported immediately.</li>
                            <li>The child's behavioural changes, including persistent cries should be recorded and reported.</li>
                            <li>Regularly change the child's position in bed to prevent bed sores, that is, two hourly.</li>
                            <li>The neck should be supported when being moved.</li>
                            <li>The parents are encouraged to participate in their child's care during his stay in hospital in preparation for discharge.</li>

                            <li>The pre-operative care provided should continue after surgery, in addition to routine post-operative care.</li>
                            <li>Immediately after surgery, vital signs should be monitored and recorded in one-hour intervals, paying particular attention to increasing intracranial pressure (blood pressure/pulse rate, temperature and respiratory rate carefully noted).</li>
                            <li>Other neurological observations, for example, the assessment of the level of consciousness should also be continued.</li>
                            <li>The dressings on the operation site should be checked regularly.</li>
                            <li>You should always ensure that the child lies on the good side to prevent pressure on the shunt valve.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, he/she should lie flat on his back.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus is a clinical symptom characterised by hyperglycaemia due to relative deficiencies of insulin action caused by either a diminished excretion by the islets of langerhans of the pancreas or due to the presence of insulin antagonists which render any insulin produced ineffective for carbohydrate metabolism resulting in glycosuria, ketosis and eventually coma.</li>
                            <li>Although diabetes mellitus can occur in childhood, it is very rare in those under the age of 2 years and where it occurs, there is a family history of diabetes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The real cause of this failure to function of the pancreatic islet of langerhans is unknown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, several possible pre-disposing factors have been identified:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infection, particularly viral, has been blamed for precipitating the problem;</li>
                            <li>Genetic factors account for a third of the cases;</li>
                            <li>Environmental factors promote clinical presentation;</li>
                            <li>Diet may play a role, for example, children on cow's milk early in their infancy are more likely to get the condition;</li>
                            <li>Stress stimulates the secretion of counter-regulatory hormones and also modulates immune activity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus occurs from a relatively deficient or complete absence of insulin. This changes the metabolism of the body.</li>
                            <li>In order to maintain life, the use of insulin may be necessary especially in insulin dependent diabetes.</li>
                            <li>When insulin is deficient, or its action is hindered, glucose uptake and the storage of glycogen and fat are decreased.</li>
                            <li>These events lead to the starvation of body cells and the accumulation of glucose (hyperglycaemia) and fat in the blood in the form of free fatty acids and ketone bodies.</li>
                            <li>The failure of glucose to enter the cells leads to increased blood glucose level.</li>
                            <li>The increased concentration causes fluid movement from the intracellular to the extra-cellular spaces and into the kidneys.</li>
                            <li>Once the renal threshold is exceeded, glycosuria (glucose in urine) follows and this is accompanied by polyuria.</li>
                            <li>Polyuria leads to electrolyte depletion and dehydration, which increases thirst (polydipsia), while cellular starvation results in hunger.</li>
                            <li>Fat breakdown causes increased free fatty acids in the blood, which the liver converts to ketone bodies betahydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic and acetone. These, being acidic, lower blood ph.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical features</h4>
                        <p>Although there is always some similarity of clinical presentation in diabetic children to that of adults, some differences tend to exist;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In children the onset is usually very sudden;</li>
                            <li>It appears as though emotional stress and infections such as measles and tonsillitis tend to trigger its onset;</li>
                            <li>Excessive thirst and polyuria with high specific gravity;</li>
                            <li>The child who never wets the bed at night changes to bed-wetting. The child gradually becomes lethargic, weak and irritable;</li>
                            <li>As dehydration occurs, the skin and tongue become dry;</li>
                            <li>Rapid weight loss and developmental deterioration;</li>
                            <li>The child may complain of abdominal pain;</li>
                            <li>The penis or vulva is often red and irritated due to high sugar content in the urine</li>
                            <li>The urine contains sugar and acetone;</li>
                            <li>Vomiting may be present as ketosis increases;</li>
                            <li>This tends to speed up the occurrence of diabetic coma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic investigations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus is more often overlooked or missed because other childhood illnesses overshadow the symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Certain investigations are essential in confirming the diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>A personal history should be taken from the parents.</li>
                            <li>A physical examination should then be undertaken, which includes blood specimen for sugar level estimation, a glucose tolerance test and urine testing for sugar and acetone.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The child with diabetes mellitus should be admitted to the paediatric ward.</li>
                            <li>Depending on his/her age, the parents should be requested to stay so as to participate in his care. This is important because when the child finally returns home, the parents will be able to continue with his home care.</li>
                            <li>You should continue to reassure the patients and parents periodically.</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for monitoring his vital signs of temperature, pulse, respiration, blood sugar level 4 hourly and fluid intake and output. These must be recorded on the available charts.</li>
                            <li>An intravenous infusion of normal saline and dextrose $5 \%$, calculated on drops per minute on a volume-controlled pump to maintain continuous flow rate without overloading the circulation should be administered.</li>
                            <li>The doctor and nurses should aim at stabilization of the child's diabetes as soon as he/she is admitted in hospital.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The child's own appetite should be allowed to regulate his blood sugar level. A very energetic child will become hungry from time to time and all this needs to be taken into account when planning his/her dietary requirement and insulin needs.</li>
                            <li>In order to maintain normal development, a diabetic child should normally be allowed to eat a less restrictive diet with the exception of large amounts of foods high in carbohydrate.</li>
                            <li>Plenty of oral fluids should be encouraged as well as good general body hygiene.</li>
                            <li>The child and parents should be taught how to manage diabetes. This includes insulin administration, urinalysis, diet control and any other essential health care pertaining to this condition.</li>
                            <li>They should be helped to learn how to calculate insulin dosages, vary sites of injections and how to maintain the diabetic chart at home. Above all, they should be assisted to come to terms with the incurable medical condition as a disability.</li>

                            <li>The function of the eustachian tubes is to clear secretions produced by the middle ear into the nasopharynx in order to equalize the external air pressure with the pressure in the middle ear.</li>
                            <li>Disease in the middle ear is usually common in infancy and early childhood for several reasons:</li>
                            <li>The eustachian tubes in very young children are wider, shorter and lie in a more horizontal position than those of adults and older children;</li>
                            <li>Young children's eustachian tubes open more easily than those of adults and older children because the supportive cartilage is stiff;</li>
                            <li>Children, have numerous tymphoid tissues plus adenoids in the pharynx, which can easily obstruct the openings of the tube;</li>

                            <li>Infections easily occur in young children because they have an immature humeral defence mechanism;</li>
                            <li>Children have frequent incidences of the upper respiratory tract infections, thereby permitting micro-organisms to ascend through the eustachian tubes to the middle ears;</li>
                            <li>The drainage from the eustachian tubes is reduced by frequent accumulation of liquids and milk in the pharyngeal cavity because infants and the young children usually assume supine position.</li>

                            <li>Begin with a personal history from the parents or guardians of the child.</li>
                            <li>A physical examination, to include the ears, throat and cervical lymph nodes, should be undertaken.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, take pus swabs for culture and sensitivity from the discharging ears.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing mgt</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to severe pain, pyrexia and discomfort, the child is best nursed on bed rest with the affected side downwards to facilitate drainage of pus if any. This is done until the temperature settles.</li>
                            <li>Pain is best controlled by use of mild analgesics such as paracetamol given three times a day. This will also help to lower the temperature.</li>
                            <li>The child's vital signs including observations of temperature, pulse and respiration are best taken and recorded four hourly.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medical treatment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antibiotics such as ampicillin or amoxyl syrup to be administered orally or by intramuscular injection.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, septrin syrup may be prescribed.</li>
                            <li>When the eardrum is grossly bulging, surgical measures may have to be undertaken. This procedure is known as a myringotomy (incision of the eardrum) to facilitate pus drainage from the middle ear.</li>
                            <li>Daily or bd aural toilet should be performed using normal saline.</li>
                            <li>A pad is held over the ear with a strapping (no packing of ear should be carried out in such cases).</li>
                            <li>Pain usually abates after pus has been drained out.</li>
                        </ul>
