- Describe the effects of illness and hospitalization in a child
- Describe childfhood illness/conditions:
- Manage childhood illnesses using IMCI guidelines

\section*{PAEDIAIRIC N(URSING}
- Paediatric nursing is defined as the art and science that deals with management of childhood related disorders/diseases.
- Paediatric nursing is concerned with the health of infants, children and adolescents, their growth and development and their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults.

\section*{Components of pediatric nursing}
- The nursing care of children from birth through adolescence includes;
- health promotion,
- disease prevention,
- illness management, and
- Gealth restoration

\section*{Age group}
- Child health is based on promotion of health/healthful living of a well child
- Internationally, the upper age limit of a child is 21 years. In Kenya, it is 12 years.
- A neonate is a newborn from birth to 28 days of age

\section*{Nursing process in pediatric nursing}
- The care of children and their families requires the application of the nursing process in accordance with accepted standards of practice, professional performance, and ethics.

\section*{Quality pediatric care}
- Quality pediatric care is:
- Developmentally appropriate,
- Family centered,
- Culturally sensitive, and
- Evidence-based.

\section*{Additional fallmarks of quality care}
$\checkmark$ Compassion,
$\checkmark$ advocacy,
$\checkmark$ care coordination,
$\checkmark$ continuity of care, and
$\checkmark$ a holistic approach
- These themes provide the context for standards that direct the practice of pediatric nurses.

\section*{ROLE OF THE PEDIAIRIC NURSE}
- Therapeutic relationship role
- Family care role
- Advocacy role
- Disease prevention/Health promotion role
- Supportive / counseling role
- Restorative role

\section*{1. Therapeutic relationship Role}

This by relating to children and their families and able to distinguish their feelings and needs.

\section*{2. Family advocacy/caring}

Nurse work with family members, identify their goals and needs and plan interventions that meet the defined problems.

\section*{3. As an advocate}

The nurse assists children and their families in making informed choices and acting in the child best interest.

\section*{4.Disease prevention/Health promotion}
- Disease prevention/Health - Nurses involved with caring for children must practice preventive health. Example is safety .

\section*{4. Support/counselling}

Attention to emotional needs requires support and sometimes counselling.

\section*{5. Restorative role}
- This involves meeting the physical and emotional needs of children including feeding, bathing, toileting, dressing, security and socialization

\section*{OTHERROLES}
- Health education
- Psychologic support and counselling
- Coordination and collaboration
- Researcher
- Health care planning

\section*{MODELS OF CARE IN( PEDIATRIC NURSING}
1. Family-centered care
2. Relationsfip-based care
- These are two models of care used in the delivery of nursing care to children.
- In both models, the importance of the family to the child is emphasized.
- In both, the unit of care is the child and the caregiver(s).

\section*{FAMILY-CENIERED CARE MODEL}
- Core concepts of family-centered care include the following:
- Dignity and respect for the child and family
- Information sharing with the family
- Participation in care by the family
- Collaboration with the family to plan and provide care

\section*{Relationship-based care}
- Core concepts of relationship-based care include the following:
- The child and family remain the focal point in the plan of care.
- The nurse makes an effort to develop a relationship with the child's family members and provides one-to-one time for conversations with the child and family on each shift.

\section*{Relationsfip-based care}
- Care is individualized to meet the specific needs of the child, based on issues that arise in the one-to one conversations with the child and family.
- All staff members strive to respect, understand, and address the child's and family's concerns.

\section*{Relationship-based care}
-Children and families are actively engaged in all aspects of care, including decision making.
- Open communication must occur between child, family, and staff.
- The child's well-being and dignity must be safeguarded in all aspects of communication and care.

\section*{TREN(DS IV(PEDIATRIC YURSING PRACTICE}
- Increased numbers of children requiring mental health services
- Increased numbers of children becoming ill as a result of antibiotic-resistant organisms
- Increased usage of blood conservation techniques for hospitalized children

\section*{TREN(DS IN(PEDIATRIC NURSING PRACTICE}
- Increased admissions due to:
- Environmental risk factors, such as dangerous living environments, unstable households, and risky behaviors
- Deficient knowledge base of caregivers, such as not following or understanding the treatment regimen
- Lack of primary care access

\section*{TREN(DS IN(PEDIAIRIC NURSING PRACTICE}
- Increased emphasis on provision of safety education (e.g., Internet safety, dealing with bullying)

\section*{OTHER TREN(DS}
- Earlier onset of puberty and its ramifications for adolescent sexual health
- Shift in the focus of medical/nursing care from disease treatment to health promotion and disease prevention
- Provision of health education in the school system

\section*{OTHERTRENDS}
- Increased incorporation of families in the overall care of children
- Increased numbers of children requiring frome-care provision
- Increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorders and childhood depression, requiring more education and research in these areas

\section*{NEWDISEASES IN(PAEDS}
- Increased childhood incidence of the following conditions:
- Obesity
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Asthma
- Autism

\section*{GROWTH AN(D DEVELOPMENIT}
- Objectives
- Define the following terms
- Growth
- Development
- Maturation
- Cearnig
- State the stages of development and their respective ages
- Explain the principles of growth and development
- Discuss four theories of growth and development
- Sigmund freud- psychosexual development
- ErickEriKson-psychosocial development
- Piaget-cognitive development
- Kohlberg-moral development

\section*{Growth and development.}
- Growth: -increase in structure - the physical changes in the anatomy of the child.
- implies a change in quantity
- Increase in number and size of cells thus increasing the size and weight of the whole or any of the parts
- It is qualitative in nature
- Development: - increase in function
- Changes occur in the physiological aspect of the child and they accompany growth
- Development also involves the changing from a lower to a more advanced stage of complexity
- Development is achieved through growth, maturation and learning
- It is qualitative in nature
- Maturation: is the process of the unfolding of the genetic inherited tendencies within the child
- Some children are "late" matures while others are "rapid" matures
- All children mature at their own rate
- It is described as an increase in competence and adaptability
- There is a "qualitative" change
- Learning: is a "change of behavior"
- It is the result of experience, experimentation, and training
- The ability to learn is dependent upon the inborn capacity for mental development
- NOTE: Maturation and Learning are interrelated. No learning can take place unless the child is mature enough to understand and the behavior is changed. The learning process can be hindered if the child is not given the opportunity learning by axperience and from others when the time is optimum.

\section*{Stages of development and their respective age ranges}
- Childhood develoment is devided into stages as follows;
- Prenatal; conception to birtfi
- Infancy: birth to 12-18 months
- neonatal; birth to 27-28 days
- infancy: 1-12 months of age
- Early childfiood: 1-6 years
- toddler 1-3 years
- Preschool: 3-6 years
- School Age: 6-12 years
- Adolescent: 13-18 years

\section*{Developmental Phases}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Reviod & Age \\
\hline Prenatal period & Conception to birth \\
\hline Neonatal & Birth to 28days \\
\hline Infancy period & 1 month to approximately 12 months \\
\hline Toddler & 1 year to 3 years \\
\hline Early childhood period & 1 year to 6 years \\
\hline Preschool & 3 years to 6 years. \\
\hline Middle childfiood & 6 to 11 years \\
\hline Late childhood & 11 to 19 years \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Principles of $\mathcal{G} \mathcal{G} \mathcal{D}$}
1. The cephalo-caudal principle-gradual change in head size relative to body size during fuman growth.
2. Proxi-distal principle-The spinal cord develops before the outer parts
3. Development depends on maturation and learning
4. Development proceeds from the simple (concrete) to the more complex
5. Growth and development is a continuous process
6. Growth and development proceed from the general to specific
7. There are individual rates of growth and development

\section*{Basic principles of growth and development.}
- Growth and development occur in an orderly sequence.
- The sequence of development is the same for all children but the rate is different
- Children creep before they stand and stand before they walk
- talk before they read and read before they write
- Each stage of development is an outgrowth of the previous stage
- Growth and development continue from conception to maturity.
- Differences in growth and development rates.
- All children are on their own schedules and are unique to themselves
- Variation of Growth Rates for Different Body Structures
- Not all body parts mature at the same rate
- The brain is completely grown by age 7 but is not matured until years later
- Growth and Development is a Total Process
- The growth and development of a child is a PHYSICAL, MENTAL SOCIAL and EMOTIONAL process
- The development of a "whole being"

\section*{Patterns of Growth and Development}

Cephalocaudal Pattern (head to toe)

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Proximodistal Pattern (from center outward)}
\end{figure}

\section*{Periods of greatest growth}
- A rapid pace during the foetal period-supply with the essentials through its mother's placenta.
- A rapid pace from birth to 2 years-provided the child's health is maintained and the essential requirements are given.

\section*{Periods of greatest growth}
- A slower pace from 2 years to puberty and the process is prolonged.
- The child's height gradually increases under the influence of hormones.
- This also plays a part in the psychosocial development of the child.
- When the child reaches puberty, the sex hormones facilitate the individual's physical, psychological and emotional development.

\section*{Periods of greatest growth}
- $\mathcal{A}$ rapid pace from puberty to approximately 15 years
- A sharp decline from 16 years to approximately 24 years when full adult size is reached

\section*{Factors that Influence Growth and Development}
- Genetics
- Environment
- Culture
- Nutrition
- Health status
- Family
- Parental attitudes
- Child-rearing philosophies

\section*{Genetic influences on growth and development}
- pattern, rate, rhythm and extent:
- governed by genes interplaying with environment
- intrauterine life extremely important in growth and healthy development of the child

\section*{Cultural influences}
- Must be considered when assessing growth and development
- Customs vs. work demands from different cultures

\section*{Nutritional influences}
- Begins during the prenatal period
- $\mathcal{L B W} /$ preterm can result from poor prenatal nutrition
- Socio-economics may impact growth

\section*{Developmental Theories Growth and Development}

\section*{What is a Theory}
- Organized and logical set of statements about a subject, frameworks to clarify, to make sense of.
- Human Development Theory: Models intended to account for how and why people become who they are, tries to explain and predict fuman behavior.

\section*{Why study theory?}
- Provides a framework
- Offers logic for observations and explanations
- How and why people act
- Important for nurses to combine theory, practice, and research
- 入urses assess responses to illness and treatments

\section*{Theorists Associated with Development}

Oral Stage: Birth to 18 Months
Anal Stage: 18 months to three years
Phallic stage: 3 years to $7-8$ years
Latency Stage: 7-8 years to puberty
Genital Stage- Pubertu to Adulthood

\section*{Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development}
- Jean Piaget (1896-1980) Swiss psychologist who became leading theorist in 1930s
- Piaget believed that "children are active thinkers, constantly trying to construct more advanced understandings of the world"
- Cognitive development is a stage process

\section*{Piaget's Approach}
- Primary method was to ask children to solve problems and to question them about the reasoning befind their solutions
- Discovered that children think in radically different ways than adults
- Proposed that development occurs as a series of 'stages' differing in how the world is understood

\section*{Piaget}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Preoperational Stage (2-7 years) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Emergence of symbolic thought \\
- Egocentrism \\
- Lack of the concept of conservation \\
- Animism
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Concrete Operational (7-12 years) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Increasingly logical thought \\
- Classification and categorization \\
- Less egocentric \\
- Conservation \\
- No abstract or hypothetical reason
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Formal Operational Stage (age 12 - adulthood) & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Hypothetico-deductive reasoning \\
- Emerges gradually \\
- Continues to develop into adulthood
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Intellectual Development (Piaget)}

Concrete Operational (7 to 11)
- Logical \& coherent thought
- Can distinguish fact from fantasy

Formal Operations (11 to 15 to adulthood)
Acquisition of abstract reasoning leading to
Analytical thinking
Problem solving

\section*{Rules for Toddlers}
- If I like it, it's mine.
- If it's in my hand, it's mine.
- If I can take it from you, it's mine.
- If I had it a little while ago, it's mine.
- If it's mine, it must never appear to be yours in any way.

\section*{Rules for Toddlers, continued}
- If I'm doing or building something, all the pieces are mine.
- If it looks like mine, it's mine.
- If I saw it first, it's mine.
- If you are playing with something, and you put it down, it automatically becomes mine.
- If it's broken,
it's yours!

\section*{Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development}
- Assessed moral reasoning by posing hypothetical moral dilemmas and examining the reasoning befind people's answers
- Proposed six stages, each taking into account a broader portion of the social world

\section*{Levels of Moral Reasoning}
- Preconventional-moral reasoning is based on external rewards and punishments
- Conventional-laws and rules are upheld simply because they are laws and rules
- Postconventional-reasoning based on personal moral standards

\section*{Kohlberg's Levels of Moral Development}
- Preconventional
- Conventional
- Postconventional

Moral reasoning is controlled by external rewards and punishments.

Internal standards are imposed by others.

Morality is internal, not based on external standards.

\section*{Let's Practice!}

\section*{Situation 1}

Ashley borrowed her father's car. She and her friend Kayla were very late coming home that evening. They were further delayed at a stop light on a quiet street. After what seemed to be an unnecessary long wait, Kayla reminded Ashley that they were late. Ashley continued to wait, insisting that if everyone ignored stop lights when it was personally convenient to do so, no street would be safe.
- At what stage do you think Ashley's decision was? Why?

\section*{Situation 2}

Jordan was not prepared for a difficult chem. Exam, so he wrote some important formulas on a slip of paper which he put in his pocket before the test. Iust before the test began, the teacher informed the class that any student caught cheating would automatically fail the test. Even though Jordan needed the information he wrote, he didn't use it because the teacher stood too close to his desk during the entire exam.
- At what stage? Why?

\section*{Situation 3}

Early in the school year, DeShawn who started at varsity basketball, asked Caitlin for a date. Caitlin was not attracted to DeShawn and politely declined. A few weeks later Caitlin tried out for cheerleading and made it. Several of the other cheerleaders were dating boys on the team. When DeShawn asked Caitlin to go with fim to a party that the team was having after an important game, she accepted.
- At what stage? Why?

\section*{Situation 4}

Kyle asked his older sister, Gabby, if he could borrow her car so that he and his friend could go to the beach. Gabby reminded her brother that she never wanted him to drive her car. She suggested, however, that if it was all right with him, they could all go together. Soon after they got to the beach, Kyle's friend got ill. Ryle asked Gabby if she could drive his friend home. Gabby refused, saying that she had just come all that way and she was not going to turn around and go right back. Kyle tried unsuccessfully to find a way to get his friend home. Finally, while Gabby was swimming, he wrote her a note telling her he would be back soon as possible, took her car keys, and drove his friend back home.

\section*{Situation 5}

As Jason's father was leaving for work in the morning, he asked Jason to clean out the garage sometime during the day. Jason responded, saying he already had plans to play tennis that day. Around noon, Jason and two friends made plans that required Jason to borrow his father's car that evening. Jason decided to skip playing tennis and clean the garage.

\section*{Care of hospitalized child}

\section*{"Atraumatic Care"}

Use of interventions that eliminate or minimize psychological and physical distress that is experienced by children and their families in the health care system

\section*{Promotion of normal development}
- Infants: oral-motor development
- Toddlers: encourage mobility \& exploration, language development
- Preschoolers: assistance with self-care
- School-aged: socialization, provision of games \& tasks for mastery
- Adolescents: increased independence in managing own care

\section*{Stressors of Hospitalization}
1.Separation Anxiety 2.Loss of Control 3.Bodily Injury \& Pain

\section*{1. Separation Anxiety (Universal fear of toddler)}
- Protest: loud, demanding cries, rejects comfort measures
- Despair: lies on abdomen, flat facial expression, weight loss, insomnia, loss of developmental skills
- Denial or Detachment: silent expressionless child, deterioration of developmental milestones, may have trouble forming close relationships

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}

Anxiety r/t separation from parents during hospitalization.

Goal: child will exhibit minimal evidence of separation anxiety during hospitalization.

Outcome criteria: observe child's positive interactions with staff members \& adherence to hospital routine, appropriate for age \&

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
- Limit admissions
- Limit hospital stay
- Reduce pain
- Adequately prepare child for procedures
- Open visiting (include siblings)
- Primary nursing
- Use of play
- Hospital bed = "safe area"
- Increase control

\section*{2. Loss of Control}
- Children loose control over their:
- Routine
- Body
- Basic decisions
- Loss of school, boredom
- Ability to socialize

\section*{Interventions}

Infants: Provide consistent care
Toddlers: maintain consistent routine
Tơ Toddlers often have security objects such as a stuffed animal that help them feel safe and secure
(\% Preschoolers: need adequate preparation to unfamiliar experiences, fear bodily injury
(\% School-aged: provide schoolwork, social
Adolescents: same as schoolage, privacy

\section*{Interventions: Play!}

Provides diversion, brings about relaxation.
;-Helps child feel more secure in strange environment.

Helps lessen stress of separation.
Means for release of tension \& fears.
Means for accomplishing therapeutic goals.
Allows making choices \& being in control.

\section*{3. Bodily Injury}
- Procedures are uncomfortable
- Disease processes are painful
- Postoperative pain can be very severe

\section*{Assess for Pain}

Infants: watch facial expression, FLACC Toddlers: grimace, clench teeth, restless Preschoolers: can locate pain, use face scale, fear bodily injury \& mutilation, literal
School-aged: fear disability \& death, pain is punishment, "magical quality" of germs, can use faces scale
Adolescents: use same pain scale as adults

\section*{Pediatric Pain Assessment}

\section*{Pain is whatever the child experiencing it says it is".}

\end{figure}

Children are under-medicated because of these MOYTHS:
$\checkmark$ infants don't feel pain
$\checkmark$ children tolerate pain better than adults
$\checkmark$ children cannot tell you where it hurts
$\checkmark$ children always tell the truth about pain
$\checkmark$ children become accustomed to painful procedures
parents do not want to be involved in child's pain control
$\checkmark$ narcotics are more dangerous for children

\section*{Interventions}
- Nurses have an ethical obligation to relieve a child's suffering
- In addition adequate pain relief leads to
- earlier mobilization
- shortened hospital stays
- reduced costs.

\section*{Assess the child using QUESTI:}
- Question the child.
- Use pain rating scales.
- Evaluate behavior \& physiologic changes.
- Secure the parents' involvement
- Take into consideration: cause of pain.

\section*{Take action \& evaluate results.}

\section*{Interventions}
- Medicate for Pain
- Non Pharmacological Therapy
- Cutaneous Stimulation
- Distraction
- Guided Imagery
- Hot or Cold application

\section*{Hospitalization for all pediatric patients}

GOALS:
- Child will be prepared.
- Child will experience little or no separation.
- Child will maintain sense of control.
- Child will exhibit decreased fear of bodily injury.

\section*{EIAT}

At the end of the unit you will be able to:
$\square$ Triage all sick children when they arrive at a health facility, into the following categories:
$\checkmark$ those with emergency signs
$\checkmark$ those with priority signs
$\checkmark$ those who are non-urgent cases.
Assess a child's airway and breathing and give emergency treatments.
$\square$ Assess the child's status of circulation and level of consciousness.
Manage shock, coma, and convulsions in a child.
$\square$ Assess and manage severe dehydration in a child with diarrhoea.
$\square$ Plan and implement ETAT in your own working area in your hospital.
- Many deaths in hospital occur within 24 hours of admission.
- Some of these deaths can be prevented if very sick children are quickly identified on their arrival and treatment is started without delay.
- In many hospitals around the world, children are not checked before a senior health worker examines them; as a result, some seriously ill patients have to wait a very long time before they are seen and treated.
- Children are known to have died of a treatable condition when waiting in the queue for their turn.
- The idea of triage is to prevent this from happening.

\section*{Triaging of Sick Children}
- Is the process of sorting of patients into priority groups according to their needs and the resources available.
- It involves rapidly examining all sick children when they first arrive in hospital in order to place them in one of the following categories:
i. Those with EMERGENCYSIGNS who require immediate emergency treatment.
ii. Those with PRIORITY SIGNS should be given priority in the queue.
iii. Those who have no emergency or priority signs and therefore are NON-URGENI cases can wait their turn in the queue

\section*{The triaging process}
- Triaging should not take much time. For a child who does not have emergency signs, it takes on average 20 seconds.
- The health worker should learn to assess several signs at the same time.
- FOREXAMPLE
- A child who is smiling or crying does not have severe respiratory distress, shock or coma. The health worker looks at the child, observes the chest for breathing and priority signs such as severe malnutrition and listens to abnormal sounds such as stridor or grunting.

\section*{METHODS OF TRIAGING}
- Several methods are available to facilitate the triaging process.
- One example is a stamp being used in Malawi consisting of the "ABCD" signs in which the health worker circles the correct step and initiates emergency treatment " $\mathbf{E}$ " or puts them in priority groups " $\mathbf{P}$ " or " $\mathbf{Q}$ " for children who can wait in the queue.
- Colours can also be used for differentiating the three groups, giving a red sticker to emergency cases, a yellow for priority and green for the queue.
- Who should be triaged?
- When and where should triaging take place?
- Who should triage?

\section*{EMERGENCYSIGNS}
i. Those with EMERGENCY SIGNS who require immediate emergency treatment.
- If you find any emergency signs, do the following immediately:
"> Start to give appropriate emergency treatment.
" Call a senior health worker and other health workers to help.
"> Carry out emergency Laboratory investigations.
ii. Those with PRIORITY SIGNS
- They should be given priority in the queue, so that they cav rapidly be assessed and treated without delay.
iii. Those who have no emergency or priority signs and therefore are NON-URGENI cases.
- These children can wait their turn in the queue for assessment and treatment.

\section*{Re-view}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Categories after triage & Action required \\
\hline EMERGENCY CASES & Deed immediate emergency treatment \\
\hline PRIORITY CASES & Need assessment and rapid attention \\
\hline NON-URGENI CASES & Can wait their turn in the queue \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Emergency Signs}
- Triage of patients involves looking for signs of serious illness or injury.
- Children with these signs require very urgent life support procedures.
- Relate to the 'ABCD'
- Airway
- Breatfing
- Circulation/Consciousness/Convulsion/Coma
- Defiydration
- During care of children with such signs
- Always assess for any danger in the environment to self and to patient
- Call for help
- Weigh if possible

\section*{Airway}

\section*{- Checkfor airway obstruction}

\section*{- Management}
- Look, listen, feel.
- If obstructed by foreign bodies, secretions or head position perform head manouvers(Neutral position for neonates, Iaw thrust or head-tilt chin-lift for older children) to open the airway, suck all secretions.
- An airway (oropharyngeal tube) can be inserted if available
- If foreign body remove it, or perform backslaps or Heimlich manouver to expel them
- Re-assess after every intervention

\section*{Breatfiing}
- Checkfor
- Central cyanosis
- Severe respiratory distress
- Weak or absent breathing
- Management
- Look, listen, feel for breathing
- If not breathing, give 5 rescue breaths; each breath should last 2-3 seconds. Check rise in chest with each breath given
- Re-assess
- Support breathing with oxygen via right-sized and well fitting

\section*{Circulation}
- Checkfor:
- Capillary refill of more than 3 seconds
- Weak, rapid thready pulse
- Absent or Slow heart rate of less than 606eats/min
- Management
- If pulse is slow (<606pm for infants and neonates), weak or absent and breatfing is absent perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 15 chest compressions: 2 breaths
- Reassess at regular intervals
- If no change after CPR
- Give I.V Adrenaline 0.1ml/Kg body weight of 1:10 000 adrenaline concentration
- Continue CPR for 3 mins. Reassess
- Repeat adrenaline a $2^{\text {nd }}$ dose if necessary
- If pulse is $>606 p m$, continue breathing support with oxys
- lookfor sign of defiydration or poor circulation and give emergency I.V fluid ( $1^{\text {st }}$ Bolus of 20mls/Kg body weight of Ringer's lactate or N(ormal saline)
- Consider treating for fypoglycemia, continue full examination to consider cause of illness
- When to Stop CPR
- If no gasping or breathing after 20 minutes of CPR or gasping but no breathing after 30 minutes
- Decision to stop resuscitation depends on local resources

\section*{Convulsions}

\section*{- Management}
- I.V diazepam $0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{Kg}$ body weight or rectal $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{Kg}$ body K weight
- Reassess
- Repeat diazepam if still convulsing
- Reassess
- If still convulsing, give I.M phenobarbital 20mg/Kg body weight( $\mathcal{N}$ eonates) or $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{Kg}$ body weight for infants and young children

\section*{Consciousness/Coma}
- Assess for level of consciousness using AVPUI scale
- $\mathcal{A}$-Alert
- $\mathcal{V}$ - responds to $\mathcal{V}$ oice
- $P$ - responds to Pain
- $\mathcal{U}$ - Unconscious/Unresponsive - This is a child in coma
- A child who is not alert but responds to voice is lethargic
- Defiydration results due to diarrhoea
- Check if the child:
- Is lethargic or unconscious
- Has sunken eyes
- Skin pinch goes back very slowly
- Management is by IV fluid therapy as described at 'Circulation'
- When $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{B} \mathcal{C D}$ has been completed and there are no emergency signs, continue to assess the PRIORITY SIGNS.

\section*{PRIORITY SIGNS}
- Priority signs should alert you to a child who needs prompt, not emergency assessment.
- Children with these should be front of the queue.
- Clinical review as soon as possible, Weigfr, Baseline observations
- Use the acronym 3IPR MOB
- Tiny - Sick infant aged < 2 months
- If the child appears very young, ask the mother his age
- Temperature - very figh > 39.50C
- A child that feels very hot may have high fever. Children with high fever on touch need prompt treatment
- Pain - child in severe pain
- may be due to severe conditions such as acute abdomen, meningitis, etc.
- Poisoning - mother reports poisoning
- A child with a fistory of swallowing drugs or other dangerous substances needs to be assessed immediately, as he can deteriorate rapidly and might need specific treatments depending on the substance taken
- Pallor - severe palmar pallor
- Is a sign of severe anaemia which might need urgent transfusion
- Restless / Irritable / Floppy
- Lethargic child i.e. Child who is at $\mathcal{V}$ in the $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{V}$ PU scale
- Respiratory distress
- e.g. Lower chest wall indrawing (not severe), or difficulty in breatfing
- N(B: Severe respiratory distress is an emergency sign
- Referral - has an urgent referral letter
- Read the note carefully and determine if the child has an urgent problem.
- Malnutrition - Visible severe wasting; a sign of marasmus
- To assess for this sign, look rapidly at the arms and legs as well as the child's chest.
- Oedema of both feet
- is an important diagnostic feature of kwashiorkor, another form of severe malnutrition
- Burns - severe burns

Burns are extremely painful and children who seem quite well can deteriorate rapidly
