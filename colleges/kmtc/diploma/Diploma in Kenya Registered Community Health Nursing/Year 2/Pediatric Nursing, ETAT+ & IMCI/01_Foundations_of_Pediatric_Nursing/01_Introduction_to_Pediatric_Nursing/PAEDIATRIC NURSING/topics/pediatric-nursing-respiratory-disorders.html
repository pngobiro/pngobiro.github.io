                            <li>This is an acute inflammation of one or more bronchi in children, which affects those below the age of 4 years.</li>
                            <li>The infection is more prevalent in the younger children than the older ones because the former group have low resistance.</li>
                            <li>The disease is always associated with the upper respiratory tract infections caused by various types of micro organisms such as the influenza virus, streptococci, and pneumococci.</li>
                            <li>In some cases it is associated with certain communicable or infectious diseases such as whooping cough, measles, typhoid fever just to name a few.</li>
                            <li>Acute bronchitis may present itself as mild or severe manifestation.</li>
                            <li>It frequently attacks malnourished and debilitated children from overcrowded homes.</li>
                            <li>Environmental air pollution, allergic conditions and climatic changes, especially cold months and housing may precipitate the condition.</li>
                            <li>Some young children with congenital heart defects or fibrocystic disease of the pancreas also tend to develop acute bronchitis due to their low immunity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generally weak and unwell;</li>
                            <li>His/her cheeks and skin may be flushed and the mouth may be dry;</li>
                            <li>Has dyspnoea leading to restlessness and irritability; On checking the vital signs, the child will be pyrexial with temperature running between 39 to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and in some cases even above those figures;</li>
                            <li>The respiration, though increased, is usually shallow due to pleural pain;</li>
                            <li>Older children normally complain of anterior chest pain, which may increase with frequent cough at first;</li>
                            <li>Later on, the cough may become productive and the patient will be exhausted as a result of the above symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unless the condition is severe, hospitalisation may not be necessary.</li>
                            <li>Should hospital care be required, the child should be admitted in a cubicle and barrier nursed.</li>
                            <li>The environment should be kept warm, humidified and well ventilated until the medical personnel are sure he does not have any communicable disease.</li>
                            <li>Bed rest should be maintained until his temperature returns to normal.</li>
                            <li>His vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are taken and recorded one to two hourly.</li>
                            <li>Mechanical methods of lowering the body temperature should be employed as found fit.</li>
                            <li>The child can adopt any comfortable position he likes.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen administration is given when necessary via a ventimask for older children and a tent for young ones. Oxygen should be humidified.</li>
                            <li>The use of a steam tent may be considered for some patients according to their needs.</li>
                            <li>The patient's position in bed should be changed four hourly, paying particular attention to his pressure areas.</li>
                            <li>General bodily care will be necessary to make him feel more comfortable.</li>
                            <li>Bowel activities should also be monitored.</li>
                            <li>The child requires plenty of oral fluids or intravenous infusion to liquefy the respiratory secretion making it easier to expectorate.</li>
                            <li>Suction may be used where the patient is unable to cough up the secretions. For oral drinks, warm milk or warm lemon and honey are enjoyable and very effective.</li>
                            <li>A light but nourishing diet should be given to older children while the young may benefit from dilute milk feeds.</li>
                            <li>A fluid balance chart should always be maintained until the child is able to feed normally, pyrexia settles and general condition much improved.</li>

                            <li>Antibiotics such as crystalline penicillin may be given four to six hours in the first two to three days.</li>
                            <li>This is often changed to other types such as ampicillin, cloxacillin or amoxycillin syrup, which should be given together with vitamin B to prevent thrush and/or diarrhoea, which tend to occur when these drugs are used.</li>
                            <li>Antipyretics such as paracetamol are also prescribed and given to help lower the temperature. They can also control chest pain, which the patient may complain of.</li>

                            <li>This is a combined inflammatory disease process, which affects the larynx, trachea and bronchi simultaneously.</li>
                            <li>Infections of the respiratory tract are generally not limited to one anatomical area in small children, but affect other areas as well because of their close proximity.</li>
                            <li>Acute infections of the larynx and trachea are more frequent in toddlers than in older children and are considered more serious because young children have relatively smaller airways, which become easily obstructed when the inflammation occurs.</li>
                            <li>The inflammation of the larynx and trachea are collectively called croup syndrome, which involves acute epiglotitis, acute laryngitis, and acute laryngo-tracheobronchitis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In acute laryngo-tracheo bronchitis, the onset is gradual.</li>
                            <li>It occurs more frequently in the course of a viral upper respiratory tract illness.</li>
                            <li>When it occurs, it may increase in severity within a 24-hour period.</li>
                            <li>Maximum airway obstruction occurs below the vocal cords.</li>
                            <li>It is also worth noting that the smooth muscle in the lower respiratory tract still lacks cartilaginous support because this does not develop until adolescence.</li>
                            <li>It follows, therefore, that, when infected, there is constriction of the lower airway prompting an increased volume of respiratory secretions.</li>
                            <li>These are the sources of obstruction, which eventually interfere with exchange of gases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He/she may have a harsh voice, barking or brassy cough;</li>
                            <li>Inspiratory rate gradually increases but expiratory rate may sometimes increase as an alternative. This is referred to as stridor;</li>
                            <li>The child is pyrexial with a temperature of 39 degrees to 40 degrees celsius;</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia is present as the infection spreads downwards to the bronchi and bronchioles moderate.</li>
                            <li>There is persistent airway obstruction (rarely complete) with dyspnoea where the patient uses accessory muscles of respiration;</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis, restlessness and anxiety are always present. The patient gradually looks pale.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The child with laryngo-tracheo bronchitis should be hospitalised and placed in intensive nursing care in a separate room or cubicle.</li>
                            <li>He/she should be barrier nursed on bed rest until his/her condition improves. The main objectives of care should be to:</li>
                            <li>Promote rest during the acute stage;</li>
                            <li>Maintain adequate airway for exchange of gases;</li>
                            <li>Provide high humidity and oxygen in the environment where the patient is being nursed;</li>
                            <li>Ensure adequate and appropriate fluids and nutrition;</li>
                            <li>Provide support and health education to parents.</li>
                            <li>Once the child has been admitted, care must be taken to ensure the cubicle or room is well ventilated, quiet and clean.</li>
                            <li>Only a few visitors or carers should be allowed in the room. They should use all the facilities available for barrier nursing.</li>
                            <li>be vigilant of the patient's condition by taking and recording his vital signs, particular emphasis being laid on his respiratory pattern.</li>
                            <li>These complications may include actual or suspected epiglotitis, respiratory distress characterized by progressive stridor, restlessness, rapid pulse rate, hypoxia, cyanosis or pallor or hyperpyrexia in a child who appears toxic.</li>
                            <li>While the child remains ill, a naso-gastric tube is passed for feeding purposes</li>
                            <li>while intravenous infusion remains in progress. The fluid balance chart should be maintained, paying special attention to urinary output.</li>
                            <li>The child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are recorded two to four hourly.</li>
                            <li>Humidified oxygen therapy is given, while respiratory suction is carried out as necessary.</li>
                            <li>The position is changed two hourly but try to allow the child to assume the position he/she is most comfortable with provided the airway is clear.</li>
                            <li>Treat pressure areas four hourly.</li>
                            <li>General hygiene, including frequent oral toileting, should be maintained on daily basis.</li>
                            <li>The child may be prescribed antibiotics, which may have to be administered by injection initially. These may include ampicillin or chloramphenicol.</li>
                            <li>Other broad-spectrum antibiotics may also be considered singly or in combination.</li>
                            <li>Other drugs used are corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids is beneficial because their antiinflammatory effects decrease subglotic oedema.</li>
                            <li>The child with this condition is distressed and to reduce this the family should be allowed and in fact encouraged to remain with the child as much as possible especially if this reduces the distress.</li>

                            <li>Inflammation of tonsils is usually an acute infection, which is very common in children, occurring as a result of pharyngitis.</li>
                            <li>It is most frequently caused by haemolytic streptococcus.</li>
                            <li>Although it is a bacterial infection, the virus can also cause enlarged tonsils, which may meet in the midline and obstruct the food and air passages.</li>
                            <li>If the adenoids are also involved, they block the posterior nares resulting in mouth breathing.</li>
                            <li>In addition to this, the eustachian tubes may be blocked resulting in otitis media.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CLINICAL FEATURES</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient looks very ill, especially those below school going age;</li>
                            <li>The child frequently holds the neck stiffly. This is likely to be confused with meningitis;</li>
                            <li>As the condition progresses, the lymphatic nodes enlarge, especially in the mesentery causing mesenteric adenitis and cervical adenitis;</li>
                            <li>The patient becomes pyrexial with a flushed face. Temperature may rise to 39.4 degrees celsius;</li>
                            <li>Headache may be frequent, forcing the child to turn his head from the light;</li>
                            <li>The lips are dry and cracked, although in some cases the saliva may dribble from the mouth due to inability to swallow easily;</li>
                            <li>Dysphagia may be experienced.</li>

                            <li>Repeated tonsillitis treated medically may require surgical removal due to the fear that peritonsillar abscesses may form (boat et al, 1983).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should be barrier nursed on bed rest in any comfortable position he chooses for the first 24 to 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>A throat swab should be taken to the laboratory to confirm the causative organism before drugs are ordered.</li>
                            <li>During the febrile stage, his temperature, pulse and respiration should be monitored and recorded two hourly.</li>
                            <li>Bed clothing and personal wear should be reduced and a cradle used to keep off the weight on the patient.</li>
                            <li>An electric fan and tepid sponge may be used to lower the fever.</li>
                            <li>Mouth care should be carried out four hourly using appropriate approved lotions, such as glycothymoline in saline.</li>
                            <li>Oral fluid intake is encouraged and should be given slowly in small amounts at a time.</li>
                            <li>Meals should be warm, in liquid form, so that the patient can swallow without discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Parents should continually be reassured and all attempts made to prevent convulsions.</li>
                            <li>Crystalline penicillin is given intramuscularly or intravenously in the early stage and then changed to other oral antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>Soluble aspirin syrup is given three times a day.</li>
                            <li>The dose of medication should be calculated in relation to the weight of the child.</li>
                            <li>You should note that a tonsillectomy is never performed for acute tonsillitis.</li>
                            <li>The child should be isolated from those suffering from the following conditions: congenital heart disease; nephritis and acute rheumatism.</li>
                            <li>This is because streptococcal infections can cause very serious infections to patients with these conditions.</li>

                            <li>It is a common practice that when a decision to remove tonsils has been taken, adenoids must also be removed at the same time.</li>
                            <li>The operation is rarely performed on children under the age of 3 years unless they have developed airway obstruction.</li>

                        <p>A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways causing airway hyper-responsiveness, mucosal edema, and mucus production.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is a very common respiratory disease, which affects the tracheo-bronchial tree due to hyper-reactivity to various stimuli. It is reversible, episodic and results into obstruction of the airway.</li>
                            <li>Although it affects all age groups, it is known to cause chronic respiratory disability in childhood.</li>
                            <li>The onset of childhood asthma normally occurs during the first five years of life. It is more common in boys than girls, but later on, in adolescence, the ratio of boys to girls becomes almost equal.</li>
                            <li>The exact cause of bronchial asthma is unknown but many factors are suspected.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intrinsic factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These refer to some clinical manifestations within the patient, especially those of the airway obstruction.</li>
                            <li>The onset of a bronchial asthmatic attack is triggered by non-specific factors.</li>
                            <li>There is no allergic response although a family history of asthma may be present.</li>
                            <li>The triggers to broncho-spasm and wheezing may include one or more of the following:</li>
                            <li>Viral respiratory infections;</li>
                            <li>Emotional stress or excitement;</li>
                            <li>Exercise;</li>
                            <li>Drugs such as aspirin;</li>
                            <li>Inhalation of irritating substances such as cigarette smoke, strong perfumes or air pollutants</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Extrinsic factors</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient may be allergic to certain substances found within the environment.</li>
                            <li>These include inhalation of specific allergens, like house dust, feathers, animal hairs, pollen among others.</li>
                            <li>Extrinsic allergies can be detected by performing skin tests using various reagents, which can help to identify the offending substance.</li>
                            <li>A good personal history account may also enable the clinician to associate family allergy to the child's disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is oedema and swelling of the mucous membrane of the bronchi.</li>
                            <li>This is accompanied by increased secretion and accumulation of tenacious (thick and sticky) mucus inside the bronchi and bronchioles.</li>
                            <li>This state of affairs interferes with the normal exchange of gases within the lungs, resulting in clinical presentations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The typical asthmatic attack starts gradually and the patient will notice wheezing and shortness of breath on exertion;</li>
                            <li>As the condition progresses, the patient respiration worsens with the slightest effort, leading to difficulties in expelling the air from the lungs on expiration;</li>
                            <li>Dry unproductive cough develops, as mucous secretions cannot drain properly, leading to blockage of the smaller bronchioles.</li>
                            <li>When there is chest infection, there may be mucoid sputum;</li>
                            <li>The patient becomes increasingly dyspnoeic and exhausted as he uses accessory muscles of respiration;</li>
                            <li>There will be cyanosis and sweating;</li>
                            <li>The patient becomes anxious, frightened and tense making the condition worse;</li>
                            <li>Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic investigations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is no specific laboratory test for bronchial asthma. However, the following investigations may suffice to confirm the diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>family history, especially when wheezing is noted in the first instance.</li>
                            <li>History of allergy in the family predisposes asthma in the child.</li>
                            <li>Undertake a thorough physical examination.</li>
                            <li>During attacks of acute episode, cyanosis and use of accessory muscles of respiration must be noted.</li>
                            <li>Blood from a vein should be taken to the laboratory for a white blood cell count, with specific reference to eosinophil. This tends to be elevated in allergic conditions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During the acute stage of an asthmatic attack, aim at assisting the child towards optimum respiratory functioning, growth and social development.</li>
                            <li>provide emotional support and education.</li>
                            <li>ensure that the child is on complete bed rest correctly positioned, more significantly, sitting upright and well supported on the back with pillows.</li>
                            <li>One nurse or the parent/guardian should always stay by the bedside to provide psychological support.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen should be administered continuously at low rate to counter cyanosis.</li>
                            <li>The child may have to be put on intravenous infusion, with or without added medication</li>
                            <li>Maintain a fluid balance chart to ensure that the child does not become dehydrated from excessive perspiration.</li>
                            <li>A light, nourishing diet with high protein and vitamin content, and oral fluids should be introduced as soon as the condition improves.</li>
                            <li>The child's personal hygiene should be considered at all times</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Broncho-dilators</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This category includes adrenaline (epinephrine) given as 1:1000 strength, in a dose of $0.01 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight, up to 0.3 ml subcutaneously, for three doses at 20 minutes interval during an acute attack.</li>
                            <li>Aminophyllin (theophyllin) with caution may also be given $1-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight by intravenous route, but can alternatively be added into normal saline infusion and the child observed strictly $1 / 4$ hourly.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>They include prednisolone or methyprednisolone in a dose of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight intravenously then $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. Six hours later for status asthmaticus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Antibiotics</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be given when there is evidence of respiratory tract infections</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Status asthmaticus</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Status asthmaticus should be regarded as a medical emergency because it will quickly result in asphyxia.</li>
                            <li>The child should be admitted in the intensive care unit or a cubicle in a general ward, for proper care and continuous monitoring.</li>
                            <li>This is a severe asthmatic attack, which is persistent and prolonged in duration where three to four injections of broncho-dilators have been administered with no relief of broncho spasms and wheezing.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The clinical manifestations are the same as those seen in severe asthma:</li>
                            <li>labored breathing, prolonged exhalation,</li>
                            <li>engorged neck veins, and wheezing. However, the extent of wheezing does not indicate the severity of the attack.</li>
                            <li>As the obstruction worsens, the wheezing may disappear, and this is frequently a sign of impending respiratory failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>in the emergency setting, the patient is treated initially with a short-acting beta-adrenergic agonist and corticosteroids.</li>
                            <li>The patient usually requires supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids for hydration.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen therapy is initiated to treat dyspnea,central cyanosis, and hypoxemia.</li>
                            <li>Humidified oxygen by eitherVenturi mask or nasal catheter is administered.</li>
                            <li>The flow is based on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas values. The PaO is maintained at 65 to 85 mm Hg .</li>
                            <li>Sedative medications are contraindicated.</li>
                            <li>If there is no response to repeated treatments, hospitalization is required.</li>
                            <li>Other criteria indicating the need for hospitalization include :</li>
                            <li>poor pulmonary function test results and deteriorating blood gas levels (respiratory acidosis), which may indicate that the patient is tiring and will require mechanical ventilation.</li>
                            <li>Although most patients do not need mechanical ventilation, it is used for patients in respiratory failure, for those who tire and are too fatigued by the attempt to breathe, or for those whose conditions do not respond to initial treatment.</li>

                            <li>oxygen, an intravenous infusion with added continuous aminophyllin (theophyllin) and corticosteroids to relieve airway obstruction.</li>
                            <li>The fluid balance chart should be strictly maintained to help in identifying the onset of dehydration.</li>
                            <li>Blood gases analysis should be undertaken regularly and any deviations corrected to ensure acidosis does not occur.</li>
                            <li>Any electrolyte imbalance should be corrected after the blood has been analyzed.</li>
                            <li>Where there is respiratory distress, intermittent positive pressure respiration (ippr) is used following the insertion of endotracheal tube and oxygen therapy given.</li>
