\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Pediatric is concerned with health of infants, children, \& adolescents.
- It includes the five stages of development according to erik erickson. Thus, infancy, toddler, preschool, school and adolescent.
- It focuses on their growth \& development to ensure they are given the opportunities to achieve their full potential as adults.
- The young are most vulnerable or disadvantaged in society hence need special attention. Children are individuals, not little adults who must be seen as part of the family.
- Child health needs to be approached from a holistic and family centered approach.
- Providing paediatric care to children and families requires knowledge of different dynamics that influence it in contemporary society
${ }^{-}$Examples of such changes include: parenting styles; nature and structure of families; breakdown of traditional family systems; eating habits; level of activity; information acquisition means ;adoption of western cultures ;technical advancement.

\section*{The child in the context of the family}
- No other factor in a child's life has a greater influence than the family, which is the first and the most important socializing agent in one's life.
- Successful socialization is the process by which children acquire beliefs, values and behaviours deemed significant in the society, this is a function of parenting and other familial interactions.
- Their well-being is inextricably linked to the families, communities \& the society they live.
- Many familial factors have impact on children. Divorce, family size, absent fathers, working mothers, sibling position, and sex.

\section*{Legal and ethical issues of paediatrics}

Nurses are confronted by difficult ethical/ legal decisions especially for nurses taking care of children in critical care conditions e.g. Does one resuscitate a child or not? Hence the need to understand some legal/ ethical guidelines that can resolve these dilemmas.
- Different governments have different legal laws and regulations. Though children have right to informed consent, usually, it's the legal guardian or parents who take the consent .children are said to "assent" i.e. Paediatric client has been informed about the procedure and is willing to permit it being performed. However, assent is not legally required but important for child's cooperation.

When is informed consent not required?
Emergency situations - emergency life saving procedure. But should be after attempts have been made to contract parent or legal guardian. Adolescents can consent.
${ }^{-}$Forensic examination - where evidence is required .may not require informed consent but still is vital for child's assent.

\section*{Minors can consent for care in a number of situations}
- Where child may avoid care of caregivers e.g. Pregnancy, drug abuse treatment, contraception, treatment of STIs.
- If minor is considered to be emancipated i.e. Legal recognition that a minor lives independently and is legally responsible for his or her own support and decision making.

Refusal of medical care by parent/caregiver
${ }^{-}$Usually, this occurs if health care conflicts parent's religious beliefs. Parents may refuse to act to the best interest of the child. In such cases, the government may make legal decision of the child.
- The theory of parens patrie is applied. This is a legal rule allowing government to make decision in place of parents when they are unable or unwilling e.g. To provide for the best interest of the child.

\section*{Perspective on pediatric nursing}
1. Family centered care:
- paediatric care involves care of children and their entire family.
- Family centered care considers family contributions and involvement in the plan and delivery of child care

\section*{characteristics of family centered care}

Policy recognition of need for family in child's life.
Enhance professional- family collaboration at all levels of care.
- Exchange of unbiased and complete information between family and professionals.
- Incorporate into policy recognition of uniqueness of each family in race, education, creed, culture and economic situations.
- Enhance family to family networking - social support especially families of children with chronic illness/ aged caretakers.
${ }^{-}$Ensure home, hospital and community child- health services are of high standards.
- Family centered care empowers the family in relation to their child care.
- The nurse should always look at how the child functions within the family and how this influences his/her health. Gaps/ deficits of care should be noted and addressed.
2. Atraumatic care:
- care that minimizes or eliminates physical or psychological distress for children and other families in the health care environment.
- Many interventions are traumatic, stressful; painful hence the nurse should recognize them and provide care that minimizes them.

Principles for the basis for atraumatic care
${ }^{-}$Identify stress for child and family
- Minimize separation of child and care givers
- Minimize or prevent pain
- Examples of atraumatic interventions include: prepare child/family before every procedure especially surgery e.g. Allow the child to play with equipment, visit the hospital prior to the surgery and reassurance ; involve caregivers to support the child; control pain by administering analgesics freely and provide social support to the family .

\section*{Role of the paediatric nurse}

The primary roles of the nurse include:
- care giver ,
- patient advocacy
- health education,
- researcher
- manager/ leader

Secondary role include:
- coordinator ,
- collaborator ,
- Communicator
- consultant .

Advanced practice roles
- nurse practitioner,
- clinical nurse specialist
- care manager

\section*{Nurse, child and family communication}

Nurses need to use effective communication skills in every interaction to:
- enhance cooperation of family and
- ensure interventions are likely to be optional because of good rapport.

\section*{Communication...}
- Nurses’ ability to establish a therapeutic relationship is related to her communication abilities i.e ability for therapeutic communication.
- It’s a vital tool for history taking, physical examination, health education and maintaining adequate rapport with child/ care giver
- it is the basic requirement for family or caregiver centered pediatric care.

\section*{Effective communication}
- There are certain considerations that are vital for effective communication:
- rapport and trust,
- respect
- empathy
- listening

\section*{Communication principles based on developmental level}
- Infants: allow warm up to strangers; respond to cries timely; use soothing \& calm voice; talk to infant directly; crying, cooing, whining, or body movement, face.
- Toddlers: approach carefully - not to cause fear; integrate familiar objects in care; use dolls, story telling and picture books in conservation.
${ }^{-}$Pre-school: allow choices as appropriate; use play, story telling; speak honestly, simple language, concise; prepare procedure 1-3 hours before they are done.
- School age: use books, diagrams, and videos in preparing for procedure .prepare them for the procedure many days before. allow the child to express feelings.

Adolescent: prepare them one week before the procedure. Provide respect and privacy. Use appropriate medical terminologies.
- Use creative methods to explain experiences and procedures. The idea that they construct should be merged with the real world by listening to them.
- Attentiveness, acceptance, and freedom is important for adolescents and should be provided. do not trivialise information they think is important for them.

Communicating with the caregiver
- Explain equipment \& procedures thoroughly
- address the question and concerns of caregivers honestly
- teach caregivers what to expect the child will look like and feel like during treatment .
${ }^{-}$Help caregivers to understand the bigger picture that is the long term/ short term effect of treatment e.g. Orchitis.
- Teach and allow the caregiver to carry out as many aspects of the child's care as feasible. make reassurance a part of family interactions, ask caregivers how they are doing

\section*{Principles of effective communication in paeds settings}
- Talk to caregivers if child is shy or appears hesitant.
- Use objects (toys, dolls, stuffed animals) instead of questioning child directly.
${ }^{-}$Provide privacy for older child
- Use clear, specific single phrases in confident, quiet and unhurried speech.
- Position - eye level.
- Allow expression of thoughts/ feelings.
- Provide honest answers
- Offer choices only if they exist
- Use a variety of age - appropriate methods/ techniques.

\section*{General principles of paediatric nursing}
${ }^{-}$Admission procedure
- History taking
- Physical exam and the place for the examination
- Investigations
${ }^{-}$IMCI

\section*{Admission procedure}
- A concerned attitude calls for a kind approach and understanding on your part.
- Avoid criticising child's parent/guardian who is misinformed about the nature of disease, causes and prognosis
- The parents/guardians should be allowed to accompany their children to the assigned bed within the ward.
- The parents should receive pleasant and friendly reception in a clean and a quiet environment
- The older child, if not seriously ill on admission, should be introduced to other children. This reduces possible anxiety and stress.
- Similarly, the parents should be introduced to other parents. It is important you use the correct names and pronunciation.
- You should carry out the procedures carefully and methodically. You should also be ready to answer any questions clearly and fully as ambiguity may cause distress and misunderstanding to parents/ guardians.
- If older children are not seriously ill and are mobile, they and their parents/ guardians should be introduced to the ward or unit, including orientation to available facilities such as call bell, toilets, bathrooms and playroom.
- Information such as visiting hours for friends, parents, guardians and siblings including types of food and drinks, which may be brought should be given.
- You should make every effort to find out from the parents/guardians the child's likes, dislikes and the name they commonly use to call him/her. Such investigations will enable you to adapt accordingly.
- The same enquiries should apply to family history and spiritual beliefs, which you should address without causing embarrassment
- Finally, informed consent for care and operation should be obtained before the parents/ guardians leave for home.

\section*{History taking}
- In almost all cases, the history is usually taken from the parents or guardians, especially when the child is young. For older children, additional information as to how they feel may be obtained directly.
- The most important details to be recorded should include medical history, that is, whether the child has been ill before and the nature of any previous illness. It is also necessary to find out whether the patient has had any surgery before and for what purpose.
- You should also take the family, social and economic history because these may be contributing factors to illness. In addition, the mother's obstetric history.
- While taking the patient's history, you will have the opportunity to apply your communication, interviewing and teaching skills.

\section*{Physical examination}
- In order to make a nursing diagnosis and prepare the nursing care plan, you should perform an objective physical examination from head to toe.
- When examining a child, try and make friends first exercising all the patience. Be flexible in the order of examination, that is, do upsetting and disturbing procedures last. In most cases the standard techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation is used.

\section*{Position/place for examination}

When examining a child, it is important to seek the help of the parent or guardian to prevent unnecessary movement and resentment by the child.
- The young children will have to be undressed by the parent/guardian, while the examination will be performed on his/her laps.
- The use of distracters may also win the child's confidence and enhance his co-operation.
- You should talk to the child and mother in a low voice and persuasive manner maintaining eye contact at the level to that of the patient.
- Older children may be given the necessary instruction on what to do and should be allowed to choose the position they wish to adopt during physical examination.
- The child's developmental and nutritional status is also assessed during the physical examination

\section*{investigation}

Some of the common investigations, which you may handle include:
- Body fluids, excretions and secretions, and tissues for culture and sensitivity tests;
${ }^{-}$Blood for white cell counts and differentials;
$\checkmark$ Haemoglobin and malarial parasites;
$\checkmark$ Grouping and cross matching;
- Urine for microscopic, albumen, sugar, acetone;
- Stool for ova and cysts and occult blood;
${ }^{-}$Radiological investigations, although for very young babies this may have to be kept to a minimum;
- Endoscopic investigations may also be carried out but only in a few selected patients according to the problems they are suffering from;
- Sputum for microscopic culture and sensitivity. Where the patient is unable to produce the specimen, insertion of a naso-gastric tube may be considered and stomach content aspirated and sent to laboratory.
- You should endeavour to ensure that the parents and the patients are physically and psychologically prepared before, during and after the procedures.
- Above all, the principles of infection control must be observed when handling specimen.

\section*{IMCI}
- This is a strategy, which combines improved management of childhood illnesses with aspects of nutrition, immunization and several other important influences on child health, including maternal health.
- The imci strategy aims at reducing infant mortality rate, severity of illness and disability by integrating treatment and prevention of major childhood illness to contribute to an improved growth and development.
- Projections based on global burden of diseases analysis of 1996 shows that five specific diseases, that is, acute respiratory infection, measles, malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea will continue to be major contributors of childhood mortality right up to the year 2020, unless drastic and significant efforts are made to control them.

Nutritional problems

\section*{RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY}
- This is a syndrome of the skeletal change found in chronic renal failure.
${ }^{-}$It is usually a result of alterations in the calcium phosphate metabolism.
- Normally, the calcium phosphate maintains electrolytes in an insoluble state. As the renal Glomerular filtrate rate decreases, phosphate stops being excreted by the kidneys.
- Calcium complexes form and are deposited in various parts of the body. This is referred to as metastatic calcification.
- Low calcium stimulates a rise in parathyroid hormone secretion, which causes bone reabsorption of calcium.
- This eventually leads to demineralisation of the bones and elevated alkaline phosphates level.
${ }^{-}$In children the disease resembles rickets and in adults it resembles Osteomalacia.

\section*{Clinical features}
- growth retardation,
- muscle weakness,
- bone pain,
- skeleton deformities
${ }^{-}$slipped epiphyses.
- The areas of the body most commonly affected are the joints, eyes, muscles, myocardium, lungs and blood vessels. The latter can lead to gangrene of fingers and toes.

\section*{complications}
- Osteomalacia, which is a lack of mineralization of newly formed bone as a result of hypocalcaemia;
- Ostitis fibrosa is a condition caused by reabsorption of calcium from the bone and replacement by fibrous tissue. The primary cause here is increased level of parathyroid hormone (parathormone);
- Metastatic calcification, which results when the soft body tissues become calcified as a result of calcium phosphate deposits to these tissues.

Infectious diseases

\section*{INFECTIOUS CHILDHOOD DISEASES}
- Children are more prone to infections than adults because they have low body resistance.
- They are also susceptible, as a result of their mobility, especially during the toddler stage of coming into contact with dirt and other harmful things.
${ }^{-}$In this section we shall look at the various common infectious diseases which affect children.

\section*{Meningococcal meningitis}
- Meningitis simply means inflammation of the meninges.
- The brain and spinal cord covering membranes more commonly infected are the pia and arachnoid matters. Causative organisms
- Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci). This micro-organism is intracellular gram negative diplococcus. There are six sero strains (groups), namely a, b, c, d, x and y.

\section*{Epidemiology}
${ }^{-}$In many parts of the african continent, sero group a is the main cause of epidemics and usually meningococcal meningitis is the commonest of the types of meningitis accounting for 90\% of cases.
- Other types of meningitis may be caused by pneumococci, salmonella, staphylococci.
- However, viruses and mycobacterium tubercle bacilli occasionally cause meningitis.
- The incubation period ranges from 2 to 10 days but commonly 3 to 4 days.
- Meningococcal meningitis is an infectious disease, which can be passed from one person to another so long as meningococci are present in the discharges from the nose and mouth.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Normally, the meningococci are found in the nasopharynx without disturbing the host or carrier.
- The reservoir is mainly human.
- Illness results from either increased invasiveness of the bacteria or lower body resistance of the host.
- Some people have deficit or deficiency of some gamma immunoglobulin, which in some cases runs in families. This explains why some epidemics run in the family, while others are symptom less carriers.
- Meningococcal meningitis is mostly common in children and young adults.
- When the surrounding blood vessels around the nasopharynx are invaded, the organisms enter the cerebral spinal fluid (csf) spreading throughout the sub-arachnoid space.
- This inflammatory process increases the cerebral spinal fluid secretion in the ventricles resulting in the interference with the csf flow throughout the ventricular aqueducts.
- The colour of the csf changes according to the causative micro-organism.
- The cranial nerves may be affected as the infection spreads further resulting in neurological symptoms.
- When the csf flow is interfered with, hydrocephalus may occur especially in infancy.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- Overcrowding and poor ventilation are the main pre-disposing factors, given that the mode of entry of micro-organisms is through inhalation, that is, the exogenous type of infection.
- The organisms may also enter into the bloodstream through cracks in the respiratory tract in which it has been normal flora (i.e. endogeneous infection).

\section*{Clinical features}

The following are some of the features usually associated with meningitis:
- Usually the onset is acute and sudden with older children complaining of headache, which becomes severe and spreads down the neck;
- The patient becomes pyrexial with tachycardia;
- Rigors are often present;

\section*{Clinical.....}
- Painful back and limbs are present;
- The patient's neck and possibly the spinal column become stiff/rigid;
${ }^{-}$Kernig’s sign is positive: patient supine with hip flexed to $90^{\circ}$; pain and inability to fully extend the knee is positive; negative if can fully extend knee.
- Because of fever, convulsions may occur;
${ }^{-}$The young child cries with a high-pitched voice;

\section*{Clinical....}
- Anorexia is usually present;
- In very young babies anterior fontanelle may bulge outwards instead of positive kerning's sign;
- The child is irritable, drowsy and goes in to comatose state;
${ }^{-}$Photophobia is usually common. In some cases circulatory collapse with petechial haemorrhage may occur (bleeding spots) on the skin;
- Cyanosis and vomiting are present

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
- Begin by taking the patient’s personal history.
- A physical examination should follow.
- A lumbar puncture is performed to analyze csf and may show that polymorph cells are increased, csf is turbid in appearance (cloudy), the pressure is raised, glucose level is lower than normal and/or the amount of proteins is raised.
- You should also investigate other suspected infections, for example, measles, malaria, typhoid, broncho-pneumonia.

\section*{management}

The main goals of intervention are to:
${ }^{-}$Identify the micro-organism;
- Control the spread of infection;
- Initiate therapy immediately;
- Maintain clear airway in a well-ventilated room;
${ }^{-}$Put up intravenous infusion with the prescribed antibiotics;
- Maintain fluid balance chart;
- Identify contacts in the family, and elsewhere as they will require treatment, too.

\section*{Mgt...}

The secondary goal is to prevent complications. This can be achieved by the following nursing activities:
${ }^{-}$Constant and vigilant nursing assessment for increased intracranial pressure;
- Monitoring and maintaining fluid intake. If intracranial pressure is present then restrict the fluid intake;
- Observing the infusion site for anything abnormal that might occur;
${ }^{-}$Observing drug side effects and taking appropriate measures;
${ }^{-}$Using dim light in the environment and controlling noise;

\section*{Mgt...}
${ }^{-}$Regularly changing the patient's position to prevent pressure sores and control convulsions.
- Observing the vital signs;
- two to four hourly tepid sponging,
- Ensure comfort by providing an electric fan if necessary.
- Maintaining general body and oral hygiene;
- Physiotherapy when condition improves at a later date.

\section*{Nursing care and treatment}
- The patient is admitted into an isolated cubicle to protect other children and barrier nursing is instituted at least for the first 48 hours.
- The room should be quiet and darkened.
${ }^{-}$Shock, if present or anticipated, should be effectively managed.

\section*{Drug therapy should be commenced at once to include}
- crystalline penicillin 300 mg (500,000 i. U.)/kg/day, ten times the normal dose given intravenously or intramuscularly three to four hourly until temperature falls then six hourly for fourteen days.

\section*{Mgt....}
- And Chloramphenicol (chloromycetin) can also be administered at $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day i.m six hourly until apyrexial and general condition improves usually five to seven days then change to oral syrup for a total of fourteen days.
${ }^{-}$Phenobarbitone $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day tds is advised for convulsions up to 10 mg tds.
- An ampicillin injection may be given in combination with the chloramphenicol and crystapen.
${ }^{-} \mathrm{Nb}$. Always use a combination of antibiotics in meningitis

\section*{complications}
- Meningococcal septicaemia;
- Hypostatic pneumonia;
- Peripheral circulatory shock;
- Adrenal damage;
- Central nervous system: hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies, mental retardation, subdural effusions, deafness, blindness, and epilepsy.

\section*{prognosis}
${ }^{-}$If the condition is identified early, and effectively treated, the mortality rate does not exceed 5\%.
- However, if treatment is delayed the mortality rate is $30 \%$, but those who survive usually have permanent brain damage.

\section*{Prevention and control}
- Cases of meningococcal infection should be isolated and treated. As it is a communicable disease, identified cases should be reported or notified to the district medical officer of health immediately for control measures.
- The community should be informed of the importance of early reporting and treatment.
- The dangers of overcrowding should be stressed.
- Prophylactic penicillin should be given to household contacts. In suspected epidemic children, who are drowsy or have fits, a referral should be made for screening and further observations.
- Suspected outbreaks in schools should be investigated and surveillance maintained.

Read and make notes on :
- Cryptococcal meningitis
- Bacterial meningitis
- TB meningitis

\section*{Whooping cough}
- This is an infectious respiratory disease, which is characterized by an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the lungs, pharynx, trachea and bronchi. Thick, stringy mucus is produced which the child tries to expectorate by coughing. The attacks of coughing reach a peak of violence, ending in an inspiratory whoop.
- The infection is caused by a type of bacterium called bordetella pertussis (or pertussis bacillus).
Mode of transmission
- direct contact with soiled fomites or
- through airborne droplets spread from the infected person.

\section*{Incubation period}
- The incubation period is usually seven to fourteen days but the infectivity period is from two days before the onset of cough and continues for up to four or even six weeks.

\section*{epidemiology}
- This is a worldwide disease common among children aged between two to three years reaching up to five years. In infants of up to one year, it presents in a very severe form with a very high mortality rate. Both sexes are equally affected.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}

The following are some of the main clinical features of whooping cough:
- Acute illness, with a slow onset of cough and fever resembling common cold (catarrhal stage). The catarrhal stage takes a period of approximately fourteen days;
- The cough increases and manifests as spasms of cough while breathing out (expiration) followed by crowing or whooping while breathing in (inspiration);
${ }^{-}$In mild cases, or in babies, the typical whoop may be missing;
- Young babies may be very ill or have attacks of not breathing (apnoea) resulting in cyanosis;
- Coughing attacks are always associated with vomiting and strings of sticky mucus usually hang down the sides of the mouth and are more common at night;
- The underneath and the sides of the tongue may be sore and ulcerated;
- The whoop can last several weeks and may recur every time the child has another acute respiratory infection. There is a high mortality rate in young babies;
- Leucocytosis (up to $100,000 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) and lymphocytosis are usually present and these are quite important in confirming the diagnosis.

\section*{Nursing care and treatment}
- You should nurse the child on complete bed rest to prevent paroxysms of coughing.
- The room environment should be kept warm and humid.
- Oxygen therapy should be given continuously or when the child is cyanosed.
- The child's nutritional status should be maintained by giving small, frequent feeds and when the child vomits, an attempt should be made to re-feed him/her.
- For a child with whooping cough you should maintain a fluid balance chart and observe the child's vital signs, which is, temperature, pulse, respiration. Record findings every two to four hours until the condition improves.
- Give health education to the parents.
- Continue to maintain the child's personal hygiene.
- Medical treatment includes erythromycin $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily or septrin $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bd for two weeks. This can reduce the duration of infection if administered within the first week of the illness.
- Mild sedatives to keep the child quiet should be given, for example, chloral hydrate or phenobarbitone (heavy sedation must be avoided).
- Phenegram in a dose of 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening may reduce whooping and vomiting and ensure a good night sleep.
- Antibiotics may be given to prevent secondary complications.

\section*{complications}
${ }^{-}$Pneumonia which should be treated with antibiotics;
- Encephalopathy including convulsions which can be alleviated by performing a lumber puncture to relieve intra-cranial pressure;
- Surgical emphysema (gaseous distension) escaping into the mediastinum and into subcutaneous tissues;
${ }^{-}$Sub-conjuctival haemorrhage;
- Bronchiectasis and lung collapse;
- Otitis media;
${ }^{-}$Marasmus (malnutrition);
- Epistaxis;
${ }^{-}$Inguinal hernia and rectal prolapse.

\section*{prevention}
- The primary form of prevention is immunisation. also necessary.
- Children should be kept in well-ventilated houses.
- prevent contact between small babies and children who have pertussis whenever possible.
- Children who have household contacts should receive a course of erythromycin.

\section*{poliomyelitis}
- Poliomyelitis is an acute infectious viral disease of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and sometimes of the lower part of the brain.
- It occurs sporadically or is epidemiological and usually affects the under fives but mainly under threes. It is characterized by varying degrees of paralysis.
- The causative microorganism is poliovirus.
- There are three types of viruses. Type 1 is known as brunhilde, which is commonly associated with paralytic illness.
- Type 2 is called lansing and type 3 is also known as leon. The latter two are less commonly associated with paralysis.
${ }^{-}$It has an incubation period of three to six days but can extend between three to twenty one days.
- It has an infective period of three to fourteen days. The virus spreads mainly through the oral route (gastro-intestinal tract) and then spreads to the lymphatic system. It can also spread through droplets.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
- The patient presents with fever of $39-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$;
- General malaise;
- Vomiting and headache;
- Painful and tender muscles follow this a few days later;
- Paralysis of one or more limbs occurs as the muscles become weakened.
- The paralysis of the respiratory muscles follows without the child developing any other illness (this is referred to as flaccid paralysis).
- Only the motor system is affected but without sensory loss.

\section*{types}

\section*{Paralytic type}
- This can be divided into spinal polio, where the virus attacks the anterior horn of the grey matter (newness) and bulbar polio, where the virus attacks the grey matter of the brain stem probably following a tooth extraction during an epidemic.
- The patient normally shows signs of having the flu, usually complicated by pneumonia.

\section*{Non-paralytic type}
- The patient experiences muscle pain and stiffness. This type of polio can also change to a paralytic type as a result of any kind of stress by im injection, walking long distances and chilly weather.

\section*{investigations}
- A lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude the possibility of meningitis. Cerebral spinal fluid is usually clear in colour. Both lymphocytes and polymorphs may be present in the csf.

\section*{management}
- This can be divided into supportive and preventive management.
- The patient should be strictly confined to bed. Activities in the first two weeks of the infection risk possible increased paralysis and should, therefore, be avoided.
- The patient should be nursed in isolation.
- Pain should be controlled through the administration of analgesics, for example, paracetamol, and sedatives eg valium or phenobarbitone.
- Regular respiratory suction and postural drainage should be performed.
${ }^{-}$N.g tube feeding should be high calorie and include substantial amounts of protein.
- Change the patient's position every four hours to avoid bedsores.
- Surgical procedures should also be avoided.
- No injections should be administered during this acute stage as they may precipitate paralysis.
${ }^{-}$Immobilize the affected limbs during the acute stage of the illness, using splints to prevent flexion deformities and promote rest.
- After the acute stage has passed, you should begin gradual and gentle exercise of the affected limbs.
- Ensure that there is proper disposal of faeces and urine to prevent spread of infection.
- Urinary catheterisation must be passed but principles of asepsis must be observed strictly.
- Maintain an intravenous infusion and fluid balance chart. Oxygen therapy may be used when necessary.
- A tracheotomy and use of a mechanical respirator may be indicated should the patient's condition deteriorate.
${ }^{-}$After being discharged, the child should return to the clinic at regular intervals to ensure flexion deformities do not occur.
- A plaster of paris or back slab should be applied to the limbs if these deformities actually occur.
- Special shoes and callipers may help severely affected children.
- Prolonged rehabilitation will be required at a later date when the patient is fully recovered.

\section*{prevention}
${ }^{-}$If polio occurs in an area, the district medical officer of health should be notified in writing immediately.
- Sabin oral vaccines are given to children to prevent them from getting poliomyelitis whenever there is an outbreak and routinely in mch clinics.
- Parents should be encouraged to ensure their children are immunized.

\section*{Chicken pox (varicella)}
- This is a mild viral infection, which is extremely contagious.
- Fever and a typical skin rash characterize it.
- The causative organism is varcella zoster virus (vzv).
- It is spread in several ways. These include through airborne droplet infection, direct or indirect contact and dry scabs and nut infections.
- Droplets from the respiratory tract can transmit the varicella zoster virus from one person to another. Even the wind is now known to transmit the virus particles from the skin of the infected person over a distance of meters to another person.
- Once infected, the disease leaves immunity against chicken pox but the virus remains within the body and may reappear later in adult life as the herpes zoster when the person's immunity is weakened, for example, in aids, diabetes, leukaemia and old age.

\section*{Incubation period}
${ }^{-}$It has an incubation period of ten to twenty one days.
- The period of communicability is about 5 days before the rash to 6 days after the appearance of the vesicles.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
- The infection presents itself in the following ways:
- Slight fever and sore throat are the first to appear in older children while younger children are affected by a skin rash;
- Maculopapular rash, which becomes vesicular within a few hours, appears on the trunk and spreads to the face, armpits, scalp and sometimes the extremities. Distribution to palms and soles is seldom. Vesicles are usually superficial on the skin and in the mouth following the sensory nerve. Groups of new pocks of rash will appear over many days;
- Pustules may form but usually the vesicles collapse and dry up after three to four days leaving no scars;
- Anorexia and headache may be present;
- Skin irritation (itching) and lymphoadenopathy are sometimes present.

\section*{management}
- Confine the child to bed until the pyrexia settles down. Monitor the vital signs at regular intervals.
- The child requires plenty of fluids and a nourishing diet. The fingernails should be kept short and the child has to be restrained from scratching.
- General body cleanliness should be maintained. Soothing lotions, such as calamine, should be applied to the skin to soothe itching.
- Antibiotics are given prophylactically. Occasionallv. the child mav have to be sedated.

\section*{Complications}
- Complications include secondary infections of skin lesions. Pneumonia or encephalitis may also occur, but these are rare. Other possible complications may be thrombocytopenia, arthritis and nephritis.

\section*{Prevention and control}
- As part of active immunization, the live varicella vaccine is used selectively for immune suppressed children. The varicella-zoster immune globulin is used for high-risk individuals.

\section*{measles}
- This is an acute highly infectious disease. It is caused by the measles virus.
- Transmission is by droplet spread or direct contact with secretions of the nose and throat of infected persons. The child is most infectious to others during the prodromal phase, often, before the diagnosis is made.

\section*{Incubation period}
${ }^{-}$It has an incubation period of 7 to 14 days usually 10 to 12 days.

\section*{Isolation period}
- The isolation period is 5 days after appearance of the rash.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}

Prodromal phase:
- This may last 3 to 7 days
- The first symptoms are runny nose, fever, conjunctivitis and coughing.
- These may be a faint rash which disappears quickly in the prodromal period.
- Koplik spots appear 24-48 hours before the main rash
- Koplik spots are small white spots on a red base inside the cheeks, usually opposite the lower molars, but may occur on gums and inside lips as well.
Stage of advance:-
- The maculo - popular rash starts behind the ears and on the forehead and spreads downwards.
- It takes about 3 days to reach the feet, at which point it starts to fade. Fever is high and lasts for 4 to 5 days.

\section*{complications}
- Otitis media
- Respiratory infection
- Pneumonia - this is usually a viral pneumonitis
${ }^{-}$Pulmonary tb
- Kerato - conjunctivitis
- Encephalitis is a serious complication often fatal or with residual brain damage
- Gastroenteritis
- Oral thrush and/or oral herpes

\section*{management}
- Treatment is supportive, there is no specific treatment available.
- Supportive treatment include:-
- Antipyretics
- Plenty of oral fluids
- Eye and mouth hygiene
- Vit a 200,000 units orally daily for two days.
- Check the child frequently for complication.
- Uncomplicated cases can be nursed at home but complicated cases infants and malnourished children should be treated in a hospital with isolation facilities.

\section*{prevention}
- Measles can be prevented through active immunization with attenuated live virus vaccine.
- All children should be vaccinated against measles as per DVI/UVIS schedule of immunization.
- The infection can be aborted if vaccine is given within 12 hours of exposure.

\section*{MUMPS(infective/epidemic parotitis)}
- This is a viral infectious disease of the parotid glands, which can also affect other glands as well. It can spread by droplets or contact with the salivary secretions of the infected person.

\section*{Incubation period}
- The incubation period varies from patient to patient but is on average between 14 and 21 days of infectivity after the onset of the parotid glands swelling. All or some of the following symptoms may be present:

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
All or some of the following symptoms may be present:
The salivary glands, namely, parotid, sublingual and submaxillary glands may be infected;
Painful swelling occurs in these glands. This may be one sided or both sides;
The child develops fever, and complains of headache and malaise;
There is dysphagia (painful swallowing);
The tongue is furred and mouth dry due to diminished saliva;
Moderate lymphocytosis is noted on blood examination;
The tenderness may last two to three days then gradually subside

\section*{Nursing care}
${ }^{-}$Isolate during period of communicability.
${ }^{-}$Maintain bed rest in a warm room until swelling subsides.
- Give analgesics and antipyretics as required.
- Encourage fluids and soft bland foods.
${ }^{-}$Avoid foods which contain acid and which require chewing because they may increase pain.
- Apply heat or cold compress to neck whichever is more comfortable.
- Observe the child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration and record them every four hours.

\section*{prevention}
- Since the condition is caused by a virus, there is no specific drug treatment.
- However, the active immunity of a live attenuated vaccine is available for those who are not already infected.
- The mumps virus vaccine is best given before puberty.

\section*{complications}
- The child may develop deafness;
- Inflammations of genital organs, such as the ovaries called oophoritis in girls and testes orchitis in boys may occur. In both cases this may result in sterility in adulthood;
- Meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the meninges and brain);
- Pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas.

\section*{HEPATITIS}
- This is the inflammation of the liver most commonly caused by various types of viruses, namely a, b, c, d and e. In this sub-section, we shall briefly look at hepatitis $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$ and c as they are related to paediatric illnesses.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV), infectious hepatitis
This virus usually occurs in epidemic form. It spreads from man to man by the faecal-oral route ingestion of contaminated material. The virus is excreted in stools and urine from 3 weeks before to 1 week after the onset of clinical symptoms. The incubation period is about 3 weeks.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- Gastro-intestinal upset (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting)
- Fever, headache, joint, pains, tiredness
- Jaundice
- Clay-coloured stools, dark-brown urine
- Enlarged and tender liver

\section*{Laboratory investigations}
- Serum bilirubin (increase of mainly direct bilirubin)
${ }^{-}$Liver function tests (abnormal)

\section*{NOTE}
- The disease is usually milder in children than in adults. Many cases of infectious hepatitis take a sub-clinical course, without jaundice; there may be only mild symptoms such as slight fever and loss of appetite for a few days. Very occasionally, the disease is severe and may cause death due to acute liver failure.

\section*{management}
- Most cases get better without treatment
- Bed rest is usually recommended while jaundice is obvious
- Hygienic disposal of stool and urine
- Hand washing after contact with the patient
- Free diet (but fatty foods are likely to be refused).
- Refer patients to hospital if:-
- jaundice is very severe
- Vomiting persists
- Confusion, coma or bleeding tendency occur
- A vaccine is now available for contacts.

\section*{Hepatitis B virus(serum hepatitis)}
- Although a common infection on a global scale, it is more prevalent in sub-sahara africa because of the high perinatal transmission rate and close contact between toddlers.
${ }^{-}$It can also be spread through other routes. It is caused by the hepatitis b virus (hbv).
- The incubation period tends to be longer than that of other viruses, which affect the liver but usually in the range of 40 to 180 days.
- The communicability period is just a few days to one month during which period the individual has become a carrier. In many countries the carrier number is as high as 5-20\%.

\section*{route of transmission}
- Trans-placental route - mother to foetus through the placenta (vertical);
${ }^{-}$Blood transfusion, if the donor blood was not properly screened;
- Contact with other body fluids and secretions;
- Haemodialysis, especially children;
${ }^{-}$Through injections with contaminated needles and broken skin surface.

\section*{investigation}
- Diagnostic investigations include the examination of venous blood specimen in the laboratory when hepatitis b antigen/antibodies are found to be positive.
${ }^{-}$Blood should be examined for bilirubin and alkaline phosphates but tests are not always conclusive.
- A liver function test may also be carried out but should be avoided in children.

\section*{Clinical features}
- The clinical manifestations occur very slowly.
- These may begin with mild fever, anorexia, general malaise, nausea and vomiting.
- As the condition progresses, the patient will complain of abdominal discomfort.
- Occasionally mild jaundice may be present. Bile in the urine and low white blood count may be noticed.

\section*{Medical management}
- Alpha-interferon is the single modality of therapy that offers the most promise.
Antiviral agents: lamivudine and adefovir.
- Bed rest
- Adequate nutrition: restrict proteins if symptoms indicate impaired liver’s ability to metabolize protein byproducts.
- Antacids and antiemetics for dyspepsia and vomiting.
- Fluid therapy
${ }^{-}$Evaluate for other blood borne diseases.

\section*{Nursing management}
- When nursing a child admitted to your ward with this condition, you should allow him to regulate his own activities.
- The diet should be high protein, high calorie, and high carbohydrate but low fat.
- Vomiting, which may be persistent ought to be managed by intravenous administration of fluids.
A fluid balance chart is maintained during this period. Precautionary measures, which include wearing gloves, when carrying out intimate procedures should be observed.
- No specific drug treatment in children but certain antibiotics may be administered when there is onset of complications.

\section*{prevention}
- Active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine
- Screening of blood donors, use of disposable sharps, disinfecting work areas in lab, use of PPE when handling patients
${ }^{-}$In order to prevent spread of infections, you should make every effort to ensure that your hands are thoroughly washed after handling the patient, as well as all the articles, including linen, used by him/her.
- The toilets should be cleaned with disinfectants.

\section*{complications}
- Acute fulminating hepatitis characterized by rapidly rising bilirubin;
- Encephalopathy, which is a degenerative process of the brain;
- Oedema and ascites will always be present in the advanced stage;
- Hepatic com-unconsciousness due to liver failure;
- Chronic active hepatitis with hepatic dysfunction plus cirrhosis of the liver;
- In some cases cirrhosis of the liver may undergo malignant changes.
NB:
- Nowadays, active immunization with a hepatitis $b$ vaccine is available. This is given in three doses. The first is followed by a second four weeks later. The third is administered six weeks thereafter.

\section*{HEPATITIS C}
- This type of virus has ribonucleic acid (rna) in its nucleus. It causes hepatitis in similar way to hepatitis b, although the risk to health care workers and sexual transmission is less marked.
- The main difference however, is its high rate of persistent infection, which increases the likelihood of the patient developing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.
${ }^{-}$It has an incubation period of approximately 2 to 26 weeks from the initial entry of the virus.
- It is transmitted in the same way as hepatitis b except that both sexual and vertical transmission are quite uncommon. There is no specific mode of prevention.
- Nursing care is the same as for hepatitis b.

RESPIRATORY TRACT

\section*{ACUTE BRONCHITIS}
- This is an acute inflammation of one or more bronchi in children, which affects those below the age of 4 years.
- The infection is more prevalent in the younger children than the older ones because the former group have low resistance.
- The disease is always associated with the upper respiratory tract infections caused by various types of micro organisms such as the influenza virus, streptococci, and pneumococci.
- In some cases it is associated with certain communicable or infectious diseases such as whooping cough, measles, typhoid fever just to name a few.
- Acute bronchitis may present itself as mild or severe manifestation.
- It frequently attacks malnourished and debilitated children from overcrowded homes.
- Environmental air pollution, allergic conditions and climatic changes, especially cold months and housing may precipitate the condition.
- Some young children with congenital heart defects or fibrocystic disease of the pancreas also tend to develop acute bronchitis due to their low immunity.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Generally weak and unwell;
- His/her cheeks and skin may be flushed and the mouth may be dry;
- Has dyspnoea leading to restlessness and irritability; On checking the vital signs, the child will be pyrexial with temperature running between 39 to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and in some cases even above those figures;
- The respiration, though increased, is usually shallow due to pleural pain;
- Older children normally complain of anterior chest pain, which may increase with frequent cough at first;
- Later on, the cough may become productive and the patient will be exhausted as a result of the above symptoms.

\section*{management}
- Unless the condition is severe, hospitalisation may not be necessary.
- Should hospital care be required, the child should be admitted in a cubicle and barrier nursed.
- The environment should be kept warm, humidified and well ventilated until the medical personnel are sure he does not have any communicable disease.
- Bed rest should be maintained until his temperature returns to normal.
${ }^{-}$His vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are taken and recorded one to two hourly.
- Mechanical methods of lowering the body temperature should be employed as found fit.
- The child can adopt any comfortable position he likes.
- Oxygen administration is given when necessary via a ventimask for older children and a tent for young ones. Oxygen should be humidified.
- The use of a steam tent may be considered for some patients according to their needs.
- The patient's position in bed should be changed four hourly, paying particular attention to his pressure areas.
- General bodily care will be necessary to make him feel more comfortable.
${ }^{-}$Bowel activities should also be monitored.
- The child requires plenty of oral fluids or intravenous infusion to liquefy the respiratory secretion making it easier to expectorate.
- Suction may be used where the patient is unable to cough up the secretions. For oral drinks, warm milk or warm lemon and honey are enjoyable and very effective.
- A light but nourishing diet should be given to older children while the young may benefit from dilute milk feeds.
A fluid balance chart should always be maintained until the child is able to feed normally, pyrexia settles and general condition much improved.

\section*{Drug therapy}
- Antibiotics such as crystalline penicillin may be given four to six hours in the first two to three days.
- This is often changed to other types such as ampicillin, cloxacillin or amoxycillin syrup, which should be given together with vitamin B to prevent thrush and/or diarrhoea, which tend to occur when these drugs are used.
- Antipyretics such as paracetamol are also prescribed and given to help lower the temperature. They can also control chest pain, which the patient may complain of.

\section*{complications}
- Chronic Bronchitis
- Broncho-pneumonia.

\section*{Laryngo-tracheo bronchitis( LTB)}
- This is a combined inflammatory disease process, which affects the larynx, trachea and bronchi simultaneously.
- Infections of the respiratory tract are generally not limited to one anatomical area in small children, but affect other areas as well because of their close proximity.
- Acute infections of the larynx and trachea are more frequent in toddlers than in older children and are considered more serious because young children have relatively smaller airways, which become easily obstructed when the inflammation occurs.
- The inflammation of the larynx and trachea are collectively called croup syndrome, which involves acute epiglotitis, acute laryngitis, and acute laryngo-tracheobronchitis.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- In acute laryngo-tracheo bronchitis, the onset is gradual.
- It occurs more frequently in the course of a viral upper respiratory tract illness.
- When it occurs, it may increase in severity within a 24-hour period.
- Maximum airway obstruction occurs below the vocal cords.
- It is also worth noting that the smooth muscle in the lower respiratory tract still lacks cartilaginous support because this does not develop until adolescence.
- It follows, therefore, that, when infected, there is constriction of the lower airway prompting an increased volume of respiratory secretions.
- These are the sources of obstruction, which eventually interfere with exchange of gases.

\section*{Clinical features}
- He/she may have a harsh voice, barking or brassy cough;
- Inspiratory rate gradually increases but expiratory rate may sometimes increase as an alternative. This is referred to as stridor;
- The child is pyrexial with a temperature of 39 degrees to 40 degrees celsius;
- Tachycardia is present as the infection spreads downwards to the bronchi and bronchioles moderate.
- There is persistent airway obstruction (rarely complete) with dyspnoea where the patient uses accessory muscles of respiration;
- Cyanosis, restlessness and anxiety are always present. The patient gradually looks pale.

\section*{management}
- The child with laryngo-tracheo bronchitis should be hospitalised and placed in intensive nursing care in a separate room or cubicle.
He/she should be barrier nursed on bed rest until his/her condition improves. The main objectives of care should be to:
${ }^{-}$Promote rest during the acute stage;
- Maintain adequate airway for exchange of gases;
${ }^{-}$Provide high humidity and oxygen in the environment where the patient is being nursed;
- Ensure adequate and appropriate fluids and nutrition;
${ }^{-}$Provide support and health education to parents.
- Once the child has been admitted, care must be taken to ensure the cubicle or room is well ventilated, quiet and clean.
- Only a few visitors or carers should be allowed in the room. They should use all the facilities available for barrier nursing.
- be vigilant of the patient's condition by taking and recording his vital signs, particular emphasis being laid on his respiratory pattern.
- These complications may include actual or suspected epiglotitis, respiratory distress characterized by progressive stridor, restlessness, rapid pulse rate, hypoxia, cyanosis or pallor or hyperpyrexia in a child who appears toxic.
- While the child remains ill, a naso-gastric tube is passed for feeding purposes
- while intravenous infusion remains in progress. The fluid balance chart should be maintained, paying special attention to urinary output.
- The child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are recorded two to four hourly.
- Humidified oxygen therapy is given, while respiratory suction is carried out as necessary.
- The position is changed two hourly but try to allow the child to assume the position he/she is most comfortable with provided the airway is clear.
- Treat pressure areas four hourly.
- General hygiene, including frequent oral toileting, should be maintained on daily basis.
- The child may be prescribed antibiotics, which may have to be administered by injection initially. These may include ampicillin or chloramphenicol.
- Other broad-spectrum antibiotics may also be considered singly or in combination.
- Other drugs used are corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids is beneficial because their antiinflammatory effects decrease subglotic oedema.
- The child with this condition is distressed and to reduce this the family should be allowed and in fact encouraged to remain with the child as much as possible especially if this reduces the distress.

\section*{PNEUMONIA}
- This is an inflammation of the lung tissue. Although this inflammation commonly occurs in infants and young children, it may be diagnosed at any age.
- The infection can occur as a primary disease or as a complication of other medical problems or as a foreign substance entering the lungs.
- Causative organisms are commonly bacteria, for example, pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci, and/or viral, for example, haemophilus influenzae. Whatever, the causative microorganisms, the clinical features seem to be identical.
- Pneumonia can be further sub-classified into two categories: broncho-pneumonia and lobar pneumonia.

\section*{BRONCHO PNEUMONIA}
- This tends to affect babies and very weak young children.
- It is more severe than lobar pneumonia.
- It is also known to be one of the common complications of many diseases such as fibrocystic disease of the pancreas, whooping cough, measles and severe burns.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
- The mother gives a history of harmless cold about two to three days previously. Alternatively, the onset may be acute;
- Pyrexia and cough soon develop;
- Respiration is rapid and distressed with accessory muscles brought in action;
- The child becomes very restless and throws the arms towards the head in an attempt to facilitate air entry into the lungs;
- The child becomes increasingly cyanosed with dull eye appearance;
- The pulse rate becomes rapid, corresponding to the temperature and respiratory rate, which are all elevated above normal;
${ }^{-}$If an x-ray is taken, the film will show small widely scattered areas of consolidation over both lungs.

\section*{management}
- Acutely ill patients will require long periods of undisturbed bed rest.
- In the event of an oxygen tent being used, only a light covering should be permitted.
- The child should always be kept warm and well covered, ensuring fresh air in the surrounding environment.
- Tube feeds are recommended and only a small amount should be given at a time.
- In all cases of respiratory disease, warm lemon and honey are very soothing to the cough.

\section*{Remember:}

One or more complications may occur if the treatment has been delayed or inadequately administered. These may include pleurisy, heart failure, brochiectasis, lung collapse, convulsions, diarrhoea and vomiting.
- Antibiotics are prescribed and given as ordered, for example, ampicillin, pen.v, amoxyl or sulphonamides.
- Cough mixture and paracetomal syrup may be incorporated into the treatment.
- Ensure that the family understands that the child should not return to school immediately after leaving the hospital because he needs to have more rest.
${ }^{-}$high protein diet, which will thereby increase his/her weight.
- Medications prescribed should be completed and the child returned to hospital should his condition deteriorate

\section*{Lobar pneumonia}
- Lobar-pneumonia is an infection of the lungs involving not only the bronchi but also the alveoli.

\section*{Risk factors}
${ }^{-}$Pneumonia is very common among children between 6 months and 3 years,
- malnourished,
- measles or whooping cough or
- immunity has been compromised because of HIV infection.
- Pneumonia is most often caused by pneumococci, but in children unlike in adults.
- It is also caused by haemophilus influenza or staphylococci though it may also be viral.
- Treatment and the nursing care are the same.

\section*{Streptococcal sore throat}
- This condition is caused by a strain of beta haemolytic streptococci.
${ }^{-}$It is classified as a communicable disease of the respiratory tract.
- The infection can spread from one child to another either by droplets and direct or indirect contact.
- It has an incubation period of between two to five days.
- After the beta-haemolytic streptococci have invaded the throat, their toxins from the site of infection are absorbed into the bloodstream.
- Unless the treatment is effectively administered early enough, the said toxins cause complications, which may affect other body organs and structures.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
- The child presents with fever, rapid pulse rate and cough, following throat infection;
- There is cellulitis of the throat, which may include the pharynx;
- The older child may verbally complain of headache and dysphagia (painful swallowing);
- Vomiting and thirst may follow this;
- The tongue is a reddish strawberry-like colour and has a white coating on the surface;
- The cervical lymphatic nodes are swollen and painful (lymphadenitis);
- The patient gradually becomes delirious and restless, refusing to feed.

\section*{management}
${ }^{-}$isolated in a cubicle or a room, which is warm but well ventilated, with plenty of fresh air.
- He/she should be nursed on bed rest in any position he/she is comfortable in.
- The room should be humidified if the facilities for humidification are available.
- Humidified oxygen therapy is given.
- Plenty of oral fluids should be encouraged,
- should there be oedema of the throat, which makes swallowing rather difficult, an intravenous infusion of 5\% dextrose/ normal saline, should be administered.
- A fluid balance chart is maintained.
- Depending on the child's condition, he/she should be given unrestricted diet, which is light and well balanced.
- The vital signs observations of temperature, pulse and respiration should be monitored and recorded two hourly.
- Vomiting should be similarly observed and recorded.
- Cold or heat application to the painful cervical lymph nodes is recommended.
- The patient's personal hygiene, including mouth care, should be taken care of.

\section*{complication}
- Otitis media;
- Mastoiditis;
- Meningitis;
- Anaemia due to haemolysis;
- Rheumatic heart disease;
${ }^{-}$Renal problems (acute nephritis);
- Electrolyte imbalance;
- Pneumonia;
- Peripheral circulatory collapse;
- Central nervous system symptoms.

\section*{TONSILLITIS}
- Tonsillitis is normally classified as either acute or chronic.

\section*{Acute tonsillitis}
- Inflammation of tonsils is usually an acute infection, which is very common in children, occurring as a result of pharyngitis.
- It is most frequently caused by haemolytic streptococcus.
- Although it is a bacterial infection, the virus can also cause enlarged tonsils, which may meet in the midline and obstruct the food and air passages.
- If the adenoids are also involved, they block the posterior nares resulting in mouth breathing.
${ }^{-}$In addition to this, the eustachian tubes may be blocked resulting in otitis media.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- The patient looks very ill, especially those below school going age;
- The child frequently holds the neck stiffly. This is likely to be confused with meningitis;
- As the condition progresses, the lymphatic nodes enlarge, especially in the mesentery causing mesenteric adenitis and cervical adenitis;
- The patient becomes pyrexial with a flushed face. Temperature may rise to 39.4 degrees celsius;
- Headache may be frequent, forcing the child to turn his head from the light;
- The lips are dry and cracked, although in some cases the saliva may dribble from the mouth due to inability to swallow easily;
- Dysphagia may be experienced.

\section*{Chronic tonsillitis}
- As one becomes older, the rate of tonsillitis recurrence decreases.
- Repeated tonsillitis treated medically may require surgical removal due to the fear that peritonsillar abscesses may form (boat et al, 1983).

\section*{Adenoiditis}
- Frequently accompanies acute tonsillitis
- Commonly caused by GABHS
- Viral infections are due to epstein-barr virus and cytomegalovirus.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
${ }^{-}$Mouth-breathing
- Ear ache
- Draining ears
${ }^{-}$Frequent headcolds
- Bronchitis
- Foul-smelling breath
- Voice impairment
- Noisy respiration

\section*{Assessment and diagnostic findings}
${ }^{-}$History taking and physical examination
- Rapid streptococcal antigen test
- Throat swab

\section*{Management}
- The patient should be barrier nursed on bed rest in any comfortable position he chooses for the first 24 to 48 hours.
- A throat swab should be taken to the laboratory to confirm the causative organism before drugs are ordered.
- During the febrile stage, his temperature, pulse and respiration should be monitored and recorded two hourly.
- Bed clothing and personal wear should be reduced and a cradle used to keep off the weight on the patient.
- An electric fan and tepid sponge may be used to lower the fever.
${ }^{-}$Mouth care should be carried out four hourly using appropriate approved lotions, such as glycothymoline in saline.
- Oral fluid intake is encouraged and should be given slowly in small amounts at a time.
- Meals should be warm, in liquid form, so that the patient can swallow without discomfort.
${ }^{-}$Parents should continually be reassured and all attempts made to prevent convulsions.
- Crystalline penicillin is given intramuscularly or intravenously in the early stage and then changed to other oral antibiotics.
- Soluble aspirin syrup is given three times a day.
- The dose of medication should be calculated in relation to the weight of the child.
- You should note that a tonsillectomy is never performed for acute tonsillitis.
- The child should be isolated from those suffering from the following conditions: congenital heart disease; nephritis and acute rheumatism.
- This is because streptococcal infections can cause very serious infections to patients with these conditions.

\section*{Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy}
${ }^{-}$It is a common practice that when a decision to remove tonsils has been taken, adenoids must also be removed at the same time.
- The operation is rarely performed on children under the age of 3 years unless they have developed airway obstruction.

\section*{Indications}
- Enlarged tonsils or adenoids that block the upper airway and cause problems in swallowing or breathing, alter speech or affect normal growth of face or alignment of teeth.
- FAPA syndrome. (fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenopathy) it recurs every 4-6weeks with no known cause.
- Recurrent throat ear or sinus infection that causes the child to miss school frequently, require persistent antibiotic treatment, occur more than five times a year or occur more than 3 times per year for 2 years

\section*{Indications cont...}
- Swollen lymphnodes in lower jaw for at least 6 months inspite of antibiotic treatment
- Tonsillitis that occur more than 7 times in a year, or more than 5 times per year for 2 years.
- Tonsils that differ substantially in size. (asymmetrical)
- Peritonsillar abscess.

\section*{Contraindications}
- Cleft palate
${ }^{-}$Bleeding disorders
- Acute tonsilitis

\section*{Pre op care}
- The child and his/her mother are admitted a day before surgery so that they may get used to the ward environment and to the nurses and so that the child may be fully examined.
- The operation should be clearly explained to the parents.
- The baseline observations of temperature, pulse and respiration are recorded four hourly.
- A consent form should then be signed by the parents/guardians.
- A routine urinalysis should be carried out.
- Mouthwashes should continue to be given up until the morning of the operation.

\section*{Post op}
- The child should be placed in sims position, with the head slightly low to facilitate drainage of respiratory secretions until fully conscious.
- You should observe and report any bleeding from the tonsillar bed, which may be suspected should you see the child repeatedly swallowing.
- Any vomiting must also be reported to the surgeon.
- Vital signs should be recorded one hourly initially, but later every two to four hours, as the patient's condition improves.
- You should pay attention to the patient's breathing.
- Oral fluids should be given as soon as he/she is able to swallow but this should only be in small amounts at a time.
- Fluids may consist of cold drinks such as fruit juice. Ice cream is also recommended for its soothing and cooling properties!
- A mild analgesic, such as paracetamol for pain relief, may be given, especially before feeds.
- Antibiotics are also prescribed.
- The child may get out of bed the following day, and return home on the second day after operation.

\section*{Bronchial asthma}

A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways causing airway hyper-responsiveness, mucosal edema, and mucus production.
- This is a very common respiratory disease, which affects the tracheo-bronchial tree due to hyper-reactivity to various stimuli. It is reversible, episodic and results into obstruction of the airway.
- Although it affects all age groups, it is known to cause chronic respiratory disability in childhood.
- The onset of childhood asthma normally occurs during the first five years of life. It is more common in boys than girls, but later on, in adolescence, the ratio of boys to girls becomes almost equal.
- The exact cause of bronchial asthma is unknown but many factors are suspected.

\section*{Intrinsic factors}
- These refer to some clinical manifestations within the patient, especially those of the airway obstruction.
- The onset of a bronchial asthmatic attack is triggered by non-specific factors.
- There is no allergic response although a family history of asthma may be present.
- The triggers to broncho-spasm and wheezing may include one or more of the following:
- Viral respiratory infections;
- Emotional stress or excitement;
- Exercise;
- Drugs such as aspirin;
- Inhalation of irritating substances such as cigarette smoke, strong perfumes or air pollutants

\section*{Extrinsic factors}
- The patient may be allergic to certain substances found within the environment.
- These include inhalation of specific allergens, like house dust, feathers, animal hairs, pollen among others.
- Extrinsic allergies can be detected by performing skin tests using various reagents, which can help to identify the offending substance.
- A good personal history account may also enable the clinician to associate family allergy to the child's disease.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- There is oedema and swelling of the mucous membrane of the bronchi.
- This is accompanied by increased secretion and accumulation of tenacious (thick and sticky) mucus inside the bronchi and bronchioles.
- This state of affairs interferes with the normal exchange of gases within the lungs, resulting in clinical presentations.

\section*{Clinical features}
- The typical asthmatic attack starts gradually and the patient will notice wheezing and shortness of breath on exertion;
- As the condition progresses, the patient respiration worsens with the slightest effort, leading to difficulties in expelling the air from the lungs on expiration;
- Dry unproductive cough develops, as mucous secretions cannot drain properly, leading to blockage of the smaller bronchioles.
- When there is chest infection, there may be mucoid sputum;
- The patient becomes increasingly dyspnoeic and exhausted as he uses accessory muscles of respiration;
- There will be cyanosis and sweating;
- The patient becomes anxious, frightened and tense making the condition worse;
${ }^{-}$Pulse and respiratory rates are increased.

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
- There is no specific laboratory test for bronchial asthma. However, the following investigations may suffice to confirm the diagnosis.
family history, especially when wheezing is noted in the first instance.
History of allergy in the family predisposes asthma in the child.
Undertake a thorough physical examination.
During attacks of acute episode, cyanosis and use of accessory muscles of respiration must be noted.
Blood from a vein should be taken to the laboratory for a white blood cell count, with specific reference to eosinophil. This tends to be elevated in allergic conditions.

\section*{management}
- During the acute stage of an asthmatic attack, aim at assisting the child towards optimum respiratory functioning, growth and social development.
provide emotional support and education.
- ensure that the child is on complete bed rest correctly positioned, more significantly, sitting upright and well supported on the back with pillows.
One nurse or the parent/guardian should always stay by the bedside to provide psychological support.
- Oxygen should be administered continuously at low rate to counter cyanosis.
- The child may have to be put on intravenous infusion, with or without added medication
- Maintain a fluid balance chart to ensure that the child does not become dehydrated from excessive perspiration.
- A light, nourishing diet with high protein and vitamin content, and oral fluids should be introduced as soon as the condition improves.
- The child's personal hygiene should be considered at all times

\section*{Drug therapy}
- Broncho-dilators
- This category includes adrenaline (epinephrine) given as 1:1000 strength, in a dose of $0.01 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight, up to 0.3 ml subcutaneously, for three doses at 20 minutes interval during an acute attack.
- Aminophyllin (theophyllin) with caution may also be given $1-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight by intravenous route, but can alternatively be added into normal saline infusion and the child observed strictly $1 / 4$ hourly.
- Steroid group
- These may be prescribed and given to prevent broncho-spasms taking place.
- They include prednisolone or methyprednisolone in a dose of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight intravenously then $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$. Six hours later for status asthmaticus.
- Antibiotics
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be given when there is evidence of respiratory tract infections

\section*{Status asthmaticus}
- Status asthmaticus should be regarded as a medical emergency because it will quickly result in asphyxia.
${ }^{-}$The child should be admitted in the intensive care unit or a cubicle in a general ward, for proper care and continuous monitoring.
- This is a severe asthmatic attack, which is persistent and prolonged in duration where three to four injections of broncho-dilators have been administered with no relief of broncho spasms and wheezing.

\section*{Triggers}
${ }^{-}$Infection
- Anxiety
- Nebulizer abuse
- Dehydration
- Increased adrenergic blockage
- Non specific irritants

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- The clinical manifestations are the same as those seen in severe asthma:
${ }^{-}$labored breathing, prolonged exhalation,
- engorged neck veins, and wheezing. However, the extent of wheezing does not indicate the severity of the attack.
- As the obstruction worsens, the wheezing may disappear, and this is frequently a sign of impending respiratory failure.

\section*{management}
${ }^{-}$in the emergency setting, the patient is treated initially with a short-acting beta-adrenergic agonist and corticosteroids.
- The patient usually requires supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids for hydration.
- Oxygen therapy is initiated to treat dyspnea,central cyanosis, and hypoxemia.
${ }^{-}$Humidified oxygen by eitherVenturi mask or nasal catheter is administered.
- The flow is based on pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas values. The PaO is maintained at 65 to 85 mm Hg .
- Sedative medications are contraindicated.
- If there is no response to repeated treatments, hospitalization is required.
- Other criteria indicating the need for hospitalization include :
- poor pulmonary function test results and deteriorating blood gas levels (respiratory acidosis), which may indicate that the patient is tiring and will require mechanical ventilation.
- Although most patients do not need mechanical ventilation, it is used for patients in respiratory failure, for those who tire and are too fatigued by the attempt to breathe, or for those whose conditions do not respond to initial treatment.

\section*{nursing management}
- You should organize to have one nurse at the bedside to provide the care and reassure the parents.
- oxygen, an intravenous infusion with added continuous aminophyllin (theophyllin) and corticosteroids to relieve airway obstruction.
- The fluid balance chart should be strictly maintained to help in identifying the onset of dehydration.
- Blood gases analysis should be undertaken regularly and any deviations corrected to ensure acidosis does not occur.
- Any electrolyte imbalance should be corrected after the blood has been analyzed.
- Where there is respiratory distress, intermittent positive pressure respiration (ippr) is used following the insertion of endotracheal tube and oxygen therapy given.
- Suction of the respiratory secretions is carried out from time to time in addition to postural drainage.

\section*{Environmental control}
- The house and home environment should be kept clean and free from dust.
- Breathing and chest exercises should be encouraged at least three to four times in a day.
- The parents should ensure and encourage the child to participate in childhood activities with his peer group.

\section*{Drug administration}
- The parents should be advised to observe the child for any side effects of those drugs.

\section*{Health maintenance}
- You should stress to the parents the need to keep clinic appointments.
- if the condition of the child deteriorates or he/she is affected by any other illnesses, they should return to hospital as early as possible.

Digestive dysfunctions

\section*{CLEFT LIP AND CLEFT PALATE}
- Cleft lip and cleft palate are considered the most common congenital cranio-facial malformations within medical practice.
- They can occur individually or together.
- Cleft lip occurs with or without cleft palate in about 1 in 1000 births. Cleft lip is more common in males than females.
- Cleft palate, on the other hand, tends to occur alone in approximately 1 in 2500 births and occurs mostly in females.
${ }^{-}$Cleft lip occurs when the mouth cavity fuses partially or incompletely. Normal fusion occurs between the fifth and eighth intrauterine weeks. The cleft palate, on the other hand, fuses about a month later in normal circumstances.
- The abnormalities appear to run in families, and therefore, to be influenced by heredity in about twenty per cent of the cases. Some cases have shown a higher incidence with monozygotic twins than in a dizygotic twins
- Other associated pre-disposing factors are maternal age (too young or above 35 years),
- maternal diabetes mellitus, and
- excessive alcohol intake during pregnancy,
- drugs used in the treatment of cancers and the use of accutane (a drug used in some places in the treatment of acne).

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
- Cleft lip can easily be diagnosed just by observation, but care should be taken to determine whether it is simply confined to the lip or if it is more extensive. Cleft palate can rarely be confirmed by observation but by fingers into the mouth and palpate for any incomplete fusions in the roof of the infant's mouth.
- Occasionally, an x-ray may be ordered to visualize the affected area better.
- The major problem associated with cleft palates is the inability to suckle and swallow.
- Other complications or problems, which the baby will encounter, include improper drainage of the middle ear, which causes poor functioning of the eustachian tubes.
- This can lead to increased pressure in the middle ear, leading to ear infections. This increases the incidence of conductive hearing impairment.
- Upper respiratory infections are also a long-term problem for these children.
- Speech development may be affected as the baby grows, unless surgical intervention has been undertaken.

\section*{Management of cleft lip (harelip)}
- The baby and mother are admitted into a room in isolation to prevent alimentary and respiratory infections, which may follow surgery.
- Plastic surgery is usually performed under general anaesthesia when the infant is about three months old, provided it is thriving and weight gain has been satisfactory.
- Initial repair may be revised at four or five years of age.
- As soon as the baby recovers from anaesthesia, glucose drinks in small amounts are commenced followed by breast milk using a spoon or pipette four hourly.
- The child is nursed on lateral sides to prevent regurgitation and aspiration occurring.
${ }^{-}$The wound is kept clean by frequent swabbing with hydrogen peroxide.
${ }^{-}$The sutures are removed 5-7 days post operatively. The arms may have to be splinted most of the time to prevent the baby from rubbing on the lips.

\section*{Management of cleft palate}
- The palate can be surgically corrected by operation called palatoplasty, usually deferred until the child is about twelve months old.
- During that period, attempts must be made to prevent infections and maintain the child's good nutritional status.
- The cleft lip repair must heal before this second stage of surgery is undertaken.

\section*{Pre-operative care}
- The child and the mother are admitted one week before the day of the operation.
- Any infection must be contained before surgery. You should take blood samples from the child to test for haemoglobin, grouping and cross matching.
- Night splinting of the arms should be practiced so that the child may get used to the procedure in preparation for post-operative care.
- The child should not be allowed to consume any food for 6 hours before being sent to theatre but may be put on intravenous dextrose 5\% during that period.
- Pre-medications should be administered as ordered by the doctor.
- Ask the parents to sign a consent form, as the operation is usually performed under general anaesthesia.
- You will need to reassure the parents from time to time as they may be extremely anxious.
- Post- operative care following cleft lip and cleft palate repair
- After cleft repair an infant usually accumulates mucus in the nose and mouth. These should be sucked out to clear the airway.
- A laryngoscope, endotracheal tube and suction machine should always be kept within reach in case of need.
- The air in the environment should be humidified.
- Mild sedatives should be prescribed and given as necessary.
- The child's arms should be restrained in splints to prevent him/ her from rubbing the operated area, but he/she should be periodically released (every two hours).
- The parents should be involved in the child's care to provide some comfort. Feeding should be continued frequently as ordered. Additionally, continue to monitor for signs of bleeding.
- Observations of temperature, pulse and respiration are done 1-2 hourly to detect onset of infections.
- A clinical follow up is necessary to monitor the child's speech. Speech therapy may be necessary if difficulties exist.

\section*{Oesophageal fistula}
- This is an abnormal opening of the oesophageal wall.
- In some cases the fistula and atresia may occur together, involving the trachea.
- Fistulae tend to occur more often in low birth weight babies.
- A history of polyhdramnious (an excessive amount of amniotic fluid) during pregnancy is often a predeterminant.
- The commonest abnormalities met with in medical practice are a tracheo -oesophageal fistula without associated atresia of the oesophagus and a tracheooesophageal fistula with associated oesophageal atresia.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Gastric reflux into the trachea will occur, causing inhalation of secretions and hydrochloric acid, resulting into ulceration of the mucous membrane.
- The baby will persistently cough and choke due to aspiration of gastric content.
- This may lead to the development of pneumonia.
- Cyanosis is present and respiration disturbed.
- Management of the condition necessitates surgical repair.

\section*{management}

\section*{Pre-operative care}
- The infant should be nursed in the incubator, kept warm and given highly humidified oxygen to relieve respiratory distress and liquefy secretion.
- The infant's head should be slightly elevated and intermitted suction carried out both to the mouth, pharynx and proximal oesophageal pouch.
- The catheter may have to be changed daily by the doctor or irrigated with the normal saline.
- At intervals the infant's head may be lowered to facilitate free drainage of secretion.
- You should continue to take and record the vital signs and monitor respiration to analyse the effectiveness of these procedures.
- Antibiotics are administered prophylactically.

\section*{Surgical management}
- As soon as the diagnosis confirms the presence of fistula, a gastrostomy should be performed to decompress the stomach and also serves as a way of feeding after surgery.
- The gastrostomy tube may be left open to permit the escape of air from the stomach.
- The fistulae are then repaired. Attempts should be made to prevent the gastric content entering the lungs.
- This is achieved by modifying the infant's position.

\section*{Post-operative care}
- Any respiratory difficulties or distress should be reported immediately to the attending physician.
- The gastrostomy tube should be allowed to drain freely by gravity until the second or third post-operative day.
- It can be used to feed the infant, beginning first with glucose and then graduating to a milk formula.
- As the condition improves, oral feeds should be introduced at which point the gastrostomy tube may finally be removed.
- The nurse should ascertain that the baby can swallow without any problem.
- Once the gastrostomy tube has been removed and the baby is feeding well orally, his discharge may be planned.

\section*{Clinical follow up}
${ }^{-}$In three to six weeks post-operatively an oesophagoscopy should be performed to inspect the status of the anastomosis.
- Oesophageal dilatation may have to be performed if a stricture is suspect.
- Advise the parents to monitor the child's progress, especially where difficulties with feeding and swallowing are noted. The child must be returned to hospital immediately without delay.

\section*{Congenital pyloric stenosis}
- This is an obstruction at the pyloric sphincter caused by hypertrophy of the circular muscle fibres in the pylorus, resulting in gastric stasis and dilatation.
- The condition occurs soon after birth for unknown reasons.
- Pyloric stenosis is a common surgical condition of the gastro-intestinal tract occurring in approximately 1 in 150 male infants and 1 in 750 female infants (this denotes a ratio of 1 male to 5 female infants).
- It also tends to occur more frequently in the first-born children and in some families more than the others.
- The child is usually normal until three to four weeks old.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- In pyloric stenosis, there is a diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the smooth muscle of the gastric antrum and sphincter, which becomes twice its normal size and is almost cartilaginous in its consistence.
- This pathological change increases the size of the pyloric circulation muscle, which in turn, results in the narrowing of its orifice.
- This narrowing can be partial or absolute which leads to obstruction.
- The gastric contents cannot, therefore, flow freely through the constricted or blocked pylorus.
- Vigorous peristalsis results in hypertrophy and dilatation of the stomach muscle.

\section*{Clinical features}

As a result of pathological changes occurring, the infant usually presents with the following:
- Persistent vomiting which gradually increases in severity until it becomes projectile;
- The infant becomes dehydrated and develops hypochlorhydric alkalosis (blood becomes more alkaline than usual because of diminished level of hydrochloric acid);
- Gastritis with some bleeding from the gastric mucosa may also occur;
- Loss of weight and constipation may follow;
- On physical examination, visible peristaltic movement of the stomach is noticeable over the abdominal wall;
- On abdominal palpation a lump can be felt indicating thickened pylorus.

\section*{investigations}
- Any investigations should begin with history taking with reference to immediate projectile vomiting which follows feeds.
- Undertake a physical examination of the child.
- A radiological study, which may include barium meal, may also be required.
- Blood tests should be carried out to determine serum chloride concentration as well as the ph, sodium and potassium level.
${ }^{-}$Haemotocrit and haemoglobin level estimations, which are normally high because of haemo-concentration, should also be tested for.

\section*{management}
- If the operative measures are delayed for one reason or another, the baby should be managed in the interim.
- Due to persistent vomiting, the feeds should be reduced radically.
- Gastric lavage should be performed at regular intervals using normal saline.
- An intravenous infusion of 5\% dextrose normal saline should be put up and monitored.
- You should also maintain a fluid balance chart.
- Monitor the child's electrolyte balance monitored and any deficiencies identified should be replaced accordingly.
- Muscle relaxant (antispasmodic) drugs, for example, atropine methonitrate (eumydrin) $0.6 \%$ alcohol solution, administered by a dropper or pipette direct on the tongue at the back of the mouth, may be prescribed to be given fifteen to twenty minutes prior to each feed.

\section*{Surgical management}

The only curative treatment is surgical intervention, known as pyloromyotomy (rammstedt's operation), which should be undertaken as soon as possible, in order to relieve the obstruction.
- The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia or local anaesthesia and involves making an incision through the hypertrophied circular muscle without severing the mucous membrane, which then bulges between the longitudinally split muscle thus widening the passage.

\section*{Pre op care}
- isolate in a cubical, keep warm and the reverse barrier nursing method employed.
- Regularly take and record vital signs. The temperature should be taken rectally;
- Monitor the amount and characteristics of the vomitus and stool;
- Observe for signs of hunger such as the infant sucking the fingers or fist as well as for signs of hyperperistalsis;
- Collect specimens for laboratory analysis as requested by the surgeon;
- Assist with other diagnostic procedures as required;
- Withhold oral feeds, administer and monitor parenteral fluids as prescribed;

\section*{Pre op.....}
- Perform gastric lavage with normal saline if ordered. In cases where naso-gastric tube is passed and left in situ, the nurse must ensure it is intact and aspiration is performed regularly, recording the content on the fluid balance chart;
- If feeding is ordered pre-operatively, the infant's head should be lifted up a bit to prevent regurgitation.
- Intravenous infusion of 5\% dextrose alternating with normal saline, if ordered, must be given and monitored with a lot of care to prevent overloading the child's circulation;
- Maintain a strict intake/output chart.
- The addictive electrolytes such as oral potassium should be administered correctly according to the dosages prescribed.

\section*{Post op....}
- On return from the operating theatre, the care given before the child went in for surgery must be continued.
- More attention should be paid to the provision of adequate fluid and nutritional intake.
- Intravenous fluids are sustained until the infant is able to take oral glucose, electrolyte solution or breast milk or formula milk. This is usually approximately six hours post-operatively, especially when no further vomiting occurs.
${ }^{-}$The infant's head should be slightly elevated after feeding and he should be placed on right lateral position.
- His response to feeds must be recorded.

\section*{Post op....}
- You should observe for signs of complications, paying special attention to pulse, skin colour and abdominal distension.
- Before the baby is discharged to go home, the parents should be taught and encouraged to get involved in positioning, feeding, observing for vomiting and inflammation around the operation site. When the time comes for discharge, the parents should be informed about where to go for follow up and review procedure.
- Feeding the baby after surgery varies from one hospital to another and from one surgeon to another. The principles, however, remain the same

\section*{IMPERFORATE ANUS}
- This is one of the most common congenital defects in this region among the newborn.
- It is usually due to failure of the anal membrane to rupture.
- The imperforate anus can either be superficial (minor) or deep (severe).
- The imperforate anus encompasses several forms of malformation without an obvious anal opening, and may have a fistula from the distal rectum to the perineum or the genitourinary system.
- Whenever it occurs, no meconium is passed and the infant usually develops abdominal distension and vomiting at a very early stage.
- More serious abnormalities are the absence of anal canal and rectum.
- This type of abnormalities is noted in 1 in every 5000 live births.
- Alternatively, fistula may develop in the vagina in girls, urethra in boys and urinary bladder in both.
- The minor case of these abnormalities occurs in 1 in every 500 live births.

\section*{Diagnostic evaluation}
- Checking for patency of the anus and rectum is a routine part of the newborn assessment and includes observation regarding the passage of meconium.
- Inspection of the perineal area reveals absence of a normal anus.
- Digital and endoscopic examination identifies constriction or the blind pouch of rectal atresia.
- Stenosis may not become apparent until 1 year of age or older when the child has a history of difficult defecation, abdominal distension and ribbon-like stools.
- A rectourinary fistula is suspected on the basis of meconium in the urine and confirmed by radiographs of contrast media injected through a tiny catheter into the fistulas. Abdominal ultrasound may be performed to evaluate the infant's anatomic malformation

\section*{management}
- These cases must be treated surgically as a matter of urgency.
- In all cases, the infant is taken off food after the parent has signed the consent form.
- The infant is put on intravenous drip of 5\% dextrose alternating with normal saline before being taken to the operating theatre.
- The operation is usually performed under general anaesthesia.
- The operation for minor cases involves the incision of the anal membrane or the perforation of the membrane using a blunt instrument.
- This is followed by periodical anal dilation to prevent scar formation.
- When the imperforate anus is more severe, that is, situated 1.5 cm or over between the anus and blind end of the colon above, a colostomy is undertaken. Further intestinal repair and closure is planned about six to twelve months later.
- Post-operatively, the intravenous infusion is continued for a few more days, vital sign observations taken and recorded frequently and antibiotics in addition to analgesics are prescribed.
- You must constantly observe and report regularly the bowel action and the size of the infant's abdomen for any distension.

\section*{MEGACOLON (HIRSCHSPRUNG DISEASE)}
- This is a congenital condition in which a portion of the large intestine is grossly dilated.
- In addition, it is a congenital anomaly that results in mechanical obstruction from inadequate motility of part of the intestine.
- It was named after dr. Harald hirschsprung, a danish surgeon.
- The cause of hirschsprung's disease is unknown but occurs more commonly in male infants than in the females, with a ratio of 4 to 1 .
- It has been noted that one third of all intestinal obstructions are due to megacolon.
- In some cases, it is found in children who have down's syndrome (chromosomal abnormality) and those with congenital urological abnormalities. It tends to be hereditary.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- In congenital megacolon, there is an absence of autonomic parasympathetic ganglion cells in the sub-mucous layer and muscular coat of the large intestine, especially around the sigmoid-rectal area.
- As a result of this, there is failure of peristaltic function, leading to accumulation of gas and faeces in the proximal portion of the intestine.
- This leads to the occurrence of obstructions and the abdomen becomes distended.

\section*{Clinical features}
- The newborn may present with signs of acute intestinal obstruction having failed to pass meconium.
- The abdomen is distended within a day or so after birth.
- In older children, there may be constipation, which in some cases alternates with diarrhoea.
- Toxaemia and dehydration soon result.
- The infant may die within hours or days, if the problem is not rectified.
- If the baby lives longer, he may have anaemia and proteinaemia caused by malabsorption of nutrients.

\section*{Diagnostic investigation}
- Diagnostic investigation begins with the compilation of an accurate personal history.
- This is then followed by a physical examination whereby on rectal examination, the rectum is empty of faeces, the internal sphincter is tight and leakage of liquid stool and accumulated gas may occur if the affected segment is short.
- Occasionally, barium enema may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

\section*{management}
- The baby should be managed according to the severity of his condition, which may be mild, moderate or severe.
- The symptoms exhibited will be the guiding factor.
- It may be necessary to improve the child's general health since he might be severely malnourished and dehydrated.
- Usually surgical intervention is the only remedy.
- The operation is called recto-sigmoidectomy with temporary colostomy, which may be closed after several months postoperatively depending on the patient's recovery progress.
- If the child's general condition is poor, it may be necessary to delay operation to enable the medical team to improve the patient's general health.
- In this case, a temporary colostomy must be done first. You should constantly reassure and support the parents during this trying time.

Pre and post operative care
${ }^{-}$You should prepare and nurse the child as for any other patient who has undergone abdominal surgery including colostomy.

\section*{DIARRHOEAL DISEASES}
- This is one of the main paediatric emergencies you may have to deal with.
- In young children, passage of three or more watery stools, with or without blood, in twenty-four hours is referred to as diarrhoea, which is also known as gastro-enteritis.
- The latter technically means inflammation of the stomach and small intestine.
- There are two types of diarrhoea:
acute diarrhoea mostly caused by infectious agents such as viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens; and
chronic diarrhoea caused by chronic conditions such as malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, immune disease, food allergy, lactose intolerance and chronic non-specific diarrhoea or a result of inadequate management of acute infectious diarrhoea.
${ }^{-}$Diarrhoea in children, especially in developing countries, is still one of the causes of unnecessary deaths
- Diarrhoea is a very common disease, but cases can be quite easily reduced in simple ways, such as improving nutrition in young children and general standards of hygiene within the community.
- Additionally, providing adequate hydration early in diseases associated with the symptom is necessary. Lack of hydration is the main cause of death in young children if no urgent action is undertaken.

\section*{Predisposing factors to childhood diarrhoea}

The general health of the child is often a pre-disposing factor. Infants or children who lead a healthy life are less likely to develop diarrhoea than those who are ill and malnourished.
- The younger the child, the more likely he/she is to have diarrhoea.
- Environmental factors should also be taken into consideration.
- The socio-economic status tends to contribute to incidences of diarrhoea in situations where certain facilities such as, good sanitation, pure water supply, hygienic food storage, and similar domestic requirements are inadequate.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Abnormal loss of fluids and electrolytes from the intestines may occur as a result of gastrointestinal disturbance and this leads to diarrhoea. There are three main reasons for this loss.
- The first of these is increased fluid secretion from the intestine.
- Some microorganisms such as vibro-cholerae and e.coli produce toxins, which stimulate salt and water secretion from the absorptive villi cells of the intestine. The bacteria stick to the surface of villi cells without penetrating or destroying the cells.
- This secretory diarrhoea is very strong and accounts for the severe rise in watery stools and rapid dehydration that is seen in cholera and coli form diarrhoea in infants and children
- The intestinal walls are still able to absorb foods and water when the child is given orally.
- The second factor is poor absorption (malabsorption).
- Depending on the child's age about two to eight litres of fluid enter the intestine in twenty-four hours.
- Only 50-200 mls of this fluid is absorbed or reabsorbed into the blood stream.
- The remainder is passed in the faeces. The stimulation or irritation of the intestine results in rapid passage of the bowel contents.
- This rapidity results in lack of intestinal enzymes to split sugar, which in turn passes to the large intestine. Here it draws water from the surrounding tissues causing diarrhoea.
- The third factor is exudation from the intestine.
- Some pathogenic micro-organisms such as salmonella typhi normally cause diarrhoea by penetrating the intestinal mucosa, destroying the cells and sometimes gaining access to the bloodstream.
Here the mucosa becomes inflamed and exudation (leakage) of fluids containing serum, pus cells, and blood occurs. In some very serious cases, the ulcers bleed heavily and may perforate causing peritonitis as in typhoid fever.

\section*{CAUSES}

\section*{Enteral infections}
- This group encompasses several micro-organisms and parasites gaining access to the intestinal tract. Some of these are non-pathogenic and are usually present within that tract but may change with circumstances to cause diarrhoea. Some of the organisms and intestinal parasites in this category include escherichia coli (e.coli), schistosoma, crystosporidium associated with hiv, entamoeba histolytica, salmonella, vibrio cholerae, shigella.rotavirus and other types of viruses.

\section*{Parenteral infections}
- Any fever in children, and infections which are unconnected to the gastro-intestinal tract, can cause diarrhoea or diarrhoea and vomiting. The diseases which fall under the category of parenteral infections include urinary tract infection, pneumonia, otitis media, tonsillitis, malaria and measles.

\section*{Associated with}
- Diarrhoea may be associated with upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections and otitis media.

\section*{Dietary causes}
- These include overfeeding, introduction of new foods, reinstituting milk too soon after diarrhoeal episode, osmotic sugar from excess sugar in formula, excessive ingestion of sorbitol or fructose

\section*{Medications}
- Such as antibiotics and laxatives may also result in diarrhoea

\section*{Toxic causes}
${ }^{-}$Resulting from ingestion of heavy metals such as lead and mercury and organic phosphates

\section*{Functional causes}

Especially irritable bowel syndrome

\section*{Other factors}

Here the cause may be known or unknown.
psychological factors, for example, a child who is fearful, anxious and lives under a tense environment may develop diarrhoea due to increased gastro-intestinal activities.
- Acute abdominal problems such as intussusception may result in diarrhoea and/or bloodstained stool.
- The ingestion of poisonous substances, which include traditional herbal medicine, administered in the community, may also be contributing factors.
- Some children have diarrhoea of unknown origin. Physical and laboratory investigations do not reveal the cause though in treatment, attempts are made to control it just like any other form.
- Gastro-enteritis is associated with feeding defects and vitamin a deficiency.
${ }^{-}$Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe and the management will depend on the degree.

\section*{Clinical features}
- History of diarrhoea and vomiting with recent weight loss.
${ }^{-}$Dry mouth, lips, tongue, eyes and skin
- Thirst
- Sunken eyes and depression of fontanelle
${ }^{-}$Loss of skin elasticity (turgor). Lift up a skinfold over the abdomen or neck and see whether it sinks back slowly. (note that loss of skin elasticity also occurs in marasmus.)
- Restlessness, apathy (loss of interest in surroundings), coma
- Low urine output
- Rapid acidotic respiration
- Rapid weak pulse

\section*{management}

The major goals in the management of acute diarrhoea include
- assessment of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance,
${ }^{-}$rehydration,
- maintenance fluid therapy and
- reintroduction of adequate diet
- Any parenteral and enteral infections are effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics or drug preparation, whether these infections are either suspected or confirmed.
- The child should be kept warm,
- vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are monitored for positive improvement or deterioration of the child's condition.
- The parents should be constantly reassured.
- An accurate fluid balance chart should be maintained.
- Pay particular attention to the child's urinary output.
- The child's personal hygiene must be maintained

\section*{PREVENTION}
- Health education is the most important approach to prevention of diarrhoeal diseases in any community
- These are some of the issues, which should be included when giving health education on diarrhoeal diseases.
- All mothers should be encouraged to breast feed their babies for several months even after introducing them to other meals. As children grow, proper weaning procedures should be introduced to the mother, so that she is aware when and how it should be done.
- More emphasis should be placed on the importance of hand washing before and after meals and also after visiting the toilet
- To minimize further infections, feeding utensils should be clean and food handled in the most hygienic manner.
- Parents should avoid using bottles as a means of feeding children. Instead they should use cups and spoons.
- Similarly, fly-breeding environments should be eradicated by proper disposal of refuse.
- make use of latrine facilities.
- All drinking water should be collected from a safe source and should be boiled.
- Nutritional improvement should be considered for all, with a special emphasis on growing children. Children should be taken to health facilities for a comprehensive vaccination programme.
- Early treatment of diarrhoea should be enforced in all health facilities.
- giving of plenty of oral fluids when diarrhoea occurs, when mothers bring their children for clinic follow up, and in hospital wards before discharge.

Urinary tract

\section*{Acute glomerulonephritis}
- This is a disease that affects the glomeruli of both kidneys.
- It may follow exposure to a variety of foreign protein substances, the most common of which are bacterial (haemolytic streptococci) and viral infections.
- Note that it is not the streptococci that cause the problem directly but their toxin/poisonous products.
- However, in many cases, the antigen causing glomerulonephritis is unknown.
- The condition is as a result of an antigen-antibody complex reacting with the glomerular tissue to produce swelling and death of capillary cells. The organism causes sore throat or skin disease initially; then ten to fourteen days later, an allergic inflammation occurs in the kidneys. It tends to occur more commonly in children and young adults. Recovery is complete in over 95\% of cases.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- There is history of sore throat seven to ten days previously;
- The patient has fatigue (tiredness);
- Complaints of pyrexia and tachycardia present;
- Hypertension with mild, moderate, severe headache;
- Oedema, which may be generalized but more noticeable in the face. This is due to salt and water retention. In a few cases ascites/pleural effusion may be present;
- Oliguria;
- Haematuria;
- Proteinuria;
- Dyspnoea due to pulmonary oedema;
- Uraemia, that is, blood urea and creatinine raised above normal (normal blood urea is $15-40 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mls}$ );
- Anorexia is usually present.

\section*{management}
- The patient should be put on complete bed rest in a warm well-ventilated room until his/her temperature subsides, the blood pressure (bp) falls and no blood or protein is visible in the urine.
- Vital signs should be recorded regularly. Temperature, pulse and respiration (tpr) and blood pressure (bp) should be monitored every four hours and any abnormalities should be reported.
- Bp should be taken lying down and standing to exclude postural hypotension. You should maintain an input and output chart.

Note:
- Diseased kidneys do need rest, therefore, a low protein diet is recommended ( 40 G daily).
- Restrict the patient's fluid intake to $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day plus the amount of urine passed during that period until diuresis occurs.
- Aim to lessen kidney activity. As previously mentioned, all urine should be tested four hourly for protein and blood.
- 24 hour urine collection to estimate the amount of protein lost in the urine may be sent to the laboratory.
- Esbach's urine testing at the ward level may also be performed 24 hourly.
- More carbohydrates should be consumed, such as glucose and orange drinks.
- A normal diet is gradually resumed according to the urinary output.
- The patient should be weighed once daily as a means of determining whether the oedema is decreasing.
- Ensure that you pay special attention to the hygiene of the skin, mouth and pressure areas.
- paracetamol and brufen may be prescribed for pyrexia.
- Antibiotics, usually penicillin v or benzyl penicillin, are recommended for sore throat or any respiratory diseases.
- One or two doses of frusemide (a diuretic) will often help to reduce the oedema.
- Occupational therapy and psychological care are also important. The child should be occupied by playing or reading in bed as he will feel bored and needs reassurance. Parents should also be involved in the care for their child and should also be constantly reassured.
- While providing nursing care for the patient, you should be aware of the main complications that may present, which in this case are chronic nephritis and acute or chronic renal failure.

\section*{complications}
- Severe hypertension
- Cardiac failure due to increased blood volume
- Convulsions
- Acute venal failure with raised urea and creatinine levels.

\section*{NEPHROTIC SYNDROME}
- This term refers to a condition involving increased permeability of the glomeruli. It is associated with a variety of renal diseases generally characterized by oedema, proteinuria (albuminuria) and low serum albumin. It affects children and adults alike.
- When the kidney fails to perform its normal function of filtration, there is an excessive loss of protein in the urine.
- This loss of protein leads to low serum albumin.
- Low serum albumin causes a low osmotic pressure in the blood.
- This consequently results in generalized oedema.
- In 75\% of cases in childhood, the cause is unknown (idiosyncratic).the remaining 25\% cases occur as part of variety of disorders.

\section*{causes}
- Glomerulonephritis, which is an inflammation of the kidney glomeruli (filtrate);
- Amyloidosis, which is a condition leading to an accumulation of starch-like substances in various body tissues. Causes of this are unknown;
- Diabetic nephropathy, that is, a degenerative condition of the kidneys due to diabetes;
- Acute infections with septicaemia;
- Drug overdose, for example, of sulpha drugs;
- Allergy and poisons, for example, lead, mercury, gold;
- Renal vein thrombosis;
- Severe malaria;
- Bee stings.
- Lupus
- Hepatitis b

\section*{Clinical features}
${ }^{-}$Oedema, which results because of salt and water retention;
${ }^{-}$Puffy eyes in the morning. Swollen feet and ankles later in the day. The patient may also have swollen genitalia;
- Susceptibility to infection;
- Pyrexia and tachycardia whose degree depends on the extent of onset of infection;
${ }^{-}$Proteinuria (loss of protein in urine) usually confirmed by testing urine. To the naked eye urine appears dark;
- There may be blood in urine.
- Blood pressure is normal in idiosyncratic cases, but may be raised in other cases.

\section*{investigation}
- Medical investigations will include a daily esbach test, routine examination of urine,
- urine culture and sensitivity.
- You should also test for blood hb, haemogram, wbc, casts, culture and sensitivity, urea, electrolytes, esr and plasma protein levels.

\section*{management}
- The patient should be nursed in fowler's position and you should take precautions to prevent pressure sores.
- Bed rest should be prescribed if the oedema is severe. Otherwise, the child should be allowed to move around.
- Diuretics, for example, frusemide (lasix), are normally administered to reduce the oedema.
- Potassium chloride is given in order to prevent potassium loss due to the lasix.
- Cortico-steroids, for example, prednisone is given and continued until the urine is free from protein and remains normal for 10 days to 2 weeks.
- Immunosuppressant drugs, for example, cyclophosphamide is recommended if a relapse occurs after prednisone.

\section*{Mgt.....}
- A weekly wbc is also necessary, particularly if the patient is on cyclophosphamide.
- Give the patient meals that are high in protein and carbohydrates and low in salt.
- Restrict fluid intake and maintain fluid chart strictly.
- Weigh daily to assess degree of oedema.
- You should set esbach 24 hourly, or alternatively, send urine to laboratory for protein loss estimate.
- In addition, you should observe tpr and bp 4 hourly and ensure that good hygiene is maintained.
- Do your best to involve the parents in the care and share relevant health messages during all stages of the nursing process.

\section*{Urinary tract infection}
- This infection occurs in infancy affecting both girls and boys equally.
- In the first years of life, however, more girls than boys are infected because the former tend to have shorter urethra.
- Children tend to suffer more from lower urinary infections, that is, infections of the urethra and bladder.
- The micro-organisms commonly responsible for urinary tract infection are escherichia coli (e. Coli). They ascend from the vulva and urethra to the bladder. Occasionally, as the problem develops, the ureters and renal pelvis are involved resulting in pyelonephritis.

The pre-disposing factors include,
- These include congenital abnormalities of the renal tract, especially those that interfere with the flow of urine, for example, hypospadias and epispadias.
- Meningomyelocele and paralysis of the urinary bladder, especially those associated with spinal injuries (paraplegia) are also common causes.
- Unrecognized phimosis
- local infections due to injuries caused by children playing or inserting foreign bodies into their own genitalia may also be causal factors.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- The escherichia coli (e. Coli) is the most common causative micro organism but others may also be responsible.
- The infection begins from the lower portion of the urinary tract, causing inflammatory changes and involving the sphincter valve at the base of the bladder.
- This makes the valve incompetent and results in urinary reflux to the ureters.
- The reflux allows upper urinary tract infections to occur, causing a gradual dilatation of the renal pelvis.
- Recurrent bladder infections cause tissue irritation, which makes the patient have desire to frequently micturate.

\section*{Clinical features}
- There will be burning painful micturition (dysuria);
- Lower abdominal pain and desire to pass urine more frequently;
- The patient is pyrexial and irritable;
- An unexplained persistent fever;
- Diarrhoea and/or vomiting;
- The child is usually restless and unable to sleep at night. He/she may cry frequently;
- Urine passed may have foul smell and be bloodstained;
${ }^{-}$Loss of appetite.

\section*{Diagnostic investigation}
- Commence by taking a concise personal history from the parents, guardians or older siblings.
- Carry out a physical examination and order a laboratory urinalysis for microscopy culture and sensitivity, blood and albumen.

\section*{management}

\section*{Nursing management}
- Unless the child looks very ill with high temperature, he/she should be managed at home as an out patient.
- If in hospital, the child should be nursed on bed rest until he/she is apyrexial. Temperature, pulse and respiration are taken and recorded four hourly.
- The child should be given plenty of oral fluids to flush the urinary system.
- A fluid balance chart should be maintained.
- General skin hygiene, especially in the genital area should be emphasised.
- A high protein diet should be encouraged.
- Oral toilet on a four hourly basis is also maintained.
- In case there are indications of chronic urinary tract infections, an xray investigation of the renal system must be performed.

\section*{Medical treatment}

The following medication may be prescribed:
- Septrin (co-trimoxazole) syrup

Dosage: 6 weeks to 5 months - 120 mg bd x 14 days.
6 months to 5 years - 240 mg bd $\times 14$ days.
- Sulphadimidine mixture/tablets

Dosage: $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day 6 hourly x14 days.
- Nitrofurantoin(furadantin)

Dosage: $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ tds up to 400 mg per day x 7 days.
Other antibiotics
- Amoxycillin $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day (in divided dose given tds).
- Or ampicillin $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day (in divided dose given qid).

\section*{WILM'S TUMOUR(NEPHROBLASTOMA)}
- This is one of the most common childhood tumours.
- The tumour is usually unilateral but may occasionally be bilateral.
- It is often malignant and spreads very rapidly.
- Metastasis tends to occur early in the lungs and prognosis is grave.
- However, if diagnosed early, about 4\% are cured by surgical intervention, chemotherapy and deep x-ray therapy.

\section*{Clinical features}

When diagnosing a patient with nephroblastoma, the following characteristics should be kept in mind:
In early stages it is symptomatic;
The condition occurs in the first three years of life;
The child is usually brought to hospital because of gross abdominal enlargement and pain;
Renal colic and haematuria;
Urinary suppression and urinary infection;
Anaemia and growth failure;
Later there may be urethral obstruction.

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
${ }^{-}$Proper diagnostic investigations should always begin with accurate history taking.
- This should be followed by a careful physical examination,
- which should include an intravenous pyelogram
- cystoscopy to exclude ureteric involvement,
- abdominal and chest x-ray to assess the extent of metastasis and
- blood tests for full blood count, haemoglobin, grouping and cross-matching.

\section*{management}

The condition is best managed by a nephrectomy or nephrouterectomy.

\section*{Pre operative care}
${ }^{-}$This should be commenced as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.
- The patient should be nursed on bed rest while the investigations and management are being organized.
- An intravenous pyelogram is aimed at detecting whether the renal pelvis is distorted and the kidney displaced.
- Abdominal palpation should be carried out carefully and kept to a minimum to prevent the systemic spread of cancer cells to the renal veins.
- The patient is prepared for nephrectomy or nephro-uterectomy the later being very extensive.
${ }^{-}$A blood transfusion should be given to correct anaemia before surgery and during the operation.

\section*{Post operative management}

The nurse must make every effort to prevent infections, to accurately observe and record fluid intake and output and to selectively manage the patient's dietary intake.
On return from the theatre, the child is nursed in semi-prone position and the airway cleared to ensure adequate ventilation.
- After recovery, he/she should be nursed in recumbent and finally upright position to facilitate drainage from the nephrectomy bed.
- Clinical observations of tpr/bp and general appearance should be recorded every one to four hours as the condition improves.
- Specific observations include drainage from redivac, corrugated tube and wound.
- Strict urinary output is observed, recorded and reported to the doctor. A fluid balance chart should be accurately maintained.
- If oedema or oliguria is found to be present, you should restrict fluid intake.
- If stones have formed in the renal system, or there is an onset of infection, you should increase the fluid intake.
- This, however, must be done in consultation with the doctor.
- The patient should be given low salt and low protein diet for oedematous and uraemic patients, while the carbohydrate intake should be increased.
- Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor electrolyte levels, haemoglobin, blood urea and creatinine.
- Naso-gastric tube aspiration in the early stages is necessary, especially when the patient feels nauseated.
- Oxygen therapy is recommended but only when necessary. Strict oral toilet should be maintained four hourly throughout.
- Physiotherapy and early ambulation should be encouraged to prevent complications.

\section*{Cardiovascular disorders}

\section*{CONGENITAL HEART FAILURE}
- Congenital heart failure is the major cause of death (other than prematurity)in the first year of life.
- The most common is the ventricular septal defect.
- Congenital heart defects lead to heart failure.
- In foetal life, much of the pulmonary arterial blood is passed through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta (carrying blood of mixed gases).
- This is because the pressure on the right side of the heart is higher than the pressure within the aorta.
- At birth, the wall muscles of the ductus arteriosus constrict in readiness to close.
- Complete closure may not occur sometimes until the second or third month of life.
- Soon after birth, the pressure on the left chambers of the heart becomes higher than that on the right side.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- The foetal heart is completely developed in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.
- At this stage, one of several anomalies may occur from mal-development of the heart or the great blood vessels, leading to heart disease.

\section*{causes}
- Such defects may be hereditary, caused by inherent genetic defects.
- They may also be caused by a vitamin deficiency or viral infection such as rubella (german measles) occurring in the first three months of pregnancy.
- Foetal intra-cardiac disease is possible.

After birth, there may be failure of closure of the ductus arteriosus.
- Other factors known to contribute to these abnormalities are the effects of radiation and drugs such as thalidomide, phenytoin sodium and alcohol.
Cardio-vascular malformation is known to occur in about 8 per 1000 births. It causes about half of the deaths due to congenital defects in the first year of life.

\section*{Types of heart defects}
- Patent ductus arteriosus;
- Coarctation of the aorta;
- Ventricular septic defect;
- Atrial septic defect;
- Aortic stenosis;
- Transposition of the great blood vessels

\section*{Patent ductus arteriosus}
- The collateral circulation in infants is normal when blood flows from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the descending thoracic aorta.
- At birth, due to constriction and change of pressures on both sides, the ductus degenerate to what is called ligamentum arteriosum within 24-72 hours.
- When this ductus arteriosus does not close, oxygenated blood from the aorta flows to the pulmonary artery, mixing with the deoxygenated blood there.
- A large pda will result in heart failure with all its complications.
- It is twice as common in female babies as in males (ratio 2:1).
- Reasons for its occurrence are unclear.
- In most cases, the diagnosis may not be made until the child is 3-4 years old, when the heart murmur may be detected on a routine medical check up.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Patients may be asymptomatic or show signs of congestive heart failure.
- There is a characteristic machinery-like murmur.
- A widened pulse pressure and bounding pulses result from runoff of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery.
- Patients are at risk for bacterial endocarditis and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease in later life from chronic excessive pulmonary blood flow.

\section*{management}
- Administration of indomethacin (prostaglandin inhibitor) has proved successful in closing a patent ductus in premature infants and some newborns.
- Surgical intervention is also possible in correcting this condition.
- Closure with placement of an occluder device during cardiac catheterization is done in some places.

\section*{Coarction of the aorta}
- This is a localized narrowing near the insertion of the ductus arteriosus, resulting in increased pressure proximal to the defect (head and upper extremities) and decreased pressure distal to the obstruction (body and lower extremities).
- It is also a localized malformation caused by deformity of the aorta resulting in the narrowing of the lumen of that vessel.
Types:
the infantile or pre-ductal type, where constriction occurs between the sub-clavian artery and the ductus arteriosus
post-ductal type, where constriction occurs at or distal to the ductus arteriosus.

\section*{Clinical manifestation}
- Since there is increased pressure proximal to the defect and decreased pressure distal to the defect, the patient becomes hypertensive;
- Headache, dizziness and fainting;
- Epistaxis and later cerebral vascular accident (stroke);
${ }^{-}$Pulse rate in the lower limbs is very low. The legs are colder than the arms. Any active exercise results in cramps of the lower limbs due to tissue anoxia;
${ }^{-}$Heart murmur may or may not be present.

\section*{management}
- The condition is managed through surgical repair (corctectomy) before adulthood.
- It involves removal of narrow areas followed by anastomosis. Prognosis is usually good.

\section*{Atrial septal defect}
- This is a defect whereby the blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium under pressure from the left side of the heart or an abnormal opening between the atria, allowing blood from the higher-pressure left atrium to flow into the lower pressure right atrium.
- This results in increased right ventricular output and pulmonary engorgement.
- This condition is also usually discovered on routine medical examination when systolic pressure is found to have a blowing murmur in the area of pulmonary artery.
- Children suffering from atrial septal defects tend to be susceptible to pneumonia and rheumatic fever

They are of three types:
${ }^{-}$Asd 1 - opening at lower end of septum; may be associated with mitral valve abnormalities
- Asd 2 - opening near centre of septum
- Sinus venosus defect - opening near junction of superior vena cava and right atrium; may be associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
- Management of this condition involves surgical repair either through close- or open-heart surgery.

\section*{Ventricular septal defect}
- This is an abnormal opening between the right and the left ventricles.
- If the defect is large enough, the blood flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle resulting in right ventricular overload and hypertrophy.
- The small openings tend to close spontaneously.
clinical presentation
${ }^{-}$Dyspnoea tachypnea;
- Frequent upper respiratory infections;
- Growth developmental failure;
${ }^{-}$Mild cyanosis when the child cries.
${ }^{-}$Congestive heart failure is common.
investigations
${ }^{-}$Diagnostic investigation is mainly done through cardiac catheterisation
${ }^{-}$chest x-ray, which will show cardiomegally.
Management
- open-heart surgical repair with the aid of heartlung machine (cardiac-pulmonary bypass).
- Hypothermia is used before and during operation.
${ }^{-}$Post-operative care is carried out in the intensive care unit.

\section*{Tetralogy of Fallot}
- This is the most common type of congenital heart disease.
- It varies in severity but is characterized by a combination of four defects presenting themselves at the same time.
These defects are:
- Pulmonary artery stenosis;
- Ventricular septal defect;
- Over-riding aorta (dextroposition);
${ }^{-}$Hypertrophy of the right ventricle.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- In this condition, the blood from the systemic circulation returning to the right atrium and right ventricle is restricted by the pulmonary stenosis so that it flows through the ventricular septal defect into the left ventricle and then to the aorta (right to left shunt). The pressure exerted against the pulmonary stenosis leads to right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Since the blood from the right ventricle is deoxygenated, the child becomes cyanosed.
- Although the blood cannot leave the right ventricle the normal way, the pulmonary blood flow may be increased by pulmonary collateral circulation and sometimes by ductus arteriosus.
- The body will attempt to compensate for the un-oxygenated blood by producing more red blood cells which will result in an increase of red blood cells (polycythaemia).
- This will lead to an increased blood viscosity, hence thrombophlebitis, emboli or stroke (cerebral vascular accident).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Cyanosis, which may be mild or severe and occur depending on the degree of the defect. If blood shunts from the right side to the left side of the heart, the cyanosis will be more marked and noticeable on the mucous membranes of the lips, mouth, pharynx and fingernails;
- Dyspnoea, due to pulmonary oedema and increased carbondioxide level in the blood (systemic anoxia);
- Polycythaemia (excessive rise of red blood cells in the circulation). This increases blood viscosity resulting into arterial thrombosis, which may block the vessels supplying the brain with blood and result in growth failure;
- Clubbing of fingers and toes may be present after the first year of life;
- Cardiac murmur is recognized during medical examination, especially when stenosis is present.

\section*{management}
- Depending on the child's condition the management can be divided into two categories.

\section*{Palliative surgery}
- This is a temporary approach used when the patient's condition does not allow for corrective surgery. There are several methods involved.
- The first is the waterston shunt-side-to-side anastomosis of the ascending thoracic aorta and right pulmonary artery.
- The blalock -taussig procedure is commonly used for older infants and children. In this procedure, the sub-clavian artery is joined to the pulmonary artery.
- Finally, pott's procedure involves joining the upper descending aorta to the left pulmonary artery.

\section*{Corrective surgery}
${ }^{-}$This operation requires the use of deep hypothermia and cardio-pulmonary by-pass approach for young children and heart-lung bypass for the older children.
- Transposition of the great vessels is performed.
- These activities are undertaken in special health facilities with intensive care units.

\section*{assignment}

Read and make notes on:
- Aortic stenosis
- Mitral stenosis
- Gastroschiasis
- Cardiac surgery
- Anaemia
- Leukaemia
- Burkitt's lymphoma
- Malnutrition

\section*{Rheumatic heart disease}
- Acute rheumatic heart disease (rhd) is an acute inflammatory reaction.
- It may involve the endocardium, including the valves, resulting in scarring, distortion and stenosis of the valves.
- It may also involve the myocardium where necrosis occurs and on healing, leaves scars, or the pericardium where it may cause adhesions to surrounding tissues.
- The development of symptoms of chronic rhd in later life depends on the location and severity of the damage and other factors.
- This type of heart disease, which usually occurs in children, has its origin in rheumatic fever.
- The fever is associated with haemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat, mainly tonsillitis and pharyngitis, experienced two to three weeks before the onset of the fever.
- About $90 \%$ of first fever attacks occur among persons aged five to fifteen years of age.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- All the three layers of the heart gradually become affected, especially the endocardium.
- This is known as endocarditis of the left side of the heart.
- The infection may also progress to affect the mitral valve or other valves in the heart.
- The flaps, which form the valve, become swollen and oedematous with small and firmly attached vegetable-like deposits.
- In the acute stage, the valve becomes incompetent, resulting in subsequent fibrosis and thickening.
- The tendonous cords (cordae tendineae) become shortened. This causes stenosis, with or without incompetence.

\section*{Clinical features}
- The child complains of headache, vomiting, moderate fever of $37^{20} \mathrm{C}$ to $37^{\circ \circ} \mathrm{c}$ but can be higher, fur tongue, sweating and occasionally constipation. These are signs of emerging toxaemia;
- Pulse rate is elevated, corresponding to temperature;
- On examination, the patient has a severely painful movable joint, which begins with one and gradually spreading to others. Normally the knees, elbows, wrists, ankles are affected;
- Occasionally these joints are reddened, swollen and warm to the touch. There may be nodules over these joints;
- When the child has been ill for a prolonged period of time, anaemia will develop, indicating danger of permanent heart damage;
- Some patients may occasionally faint and develop slightly pinkish rash appearing on the chest. This may occur intermittently for several months.

\section*{management}
- Nurse the child in recumbent position in a wellventilated room, with minimal disturbances;
- Vital signs observations of temperature, pulse and respiration should be taken and recorded every two hours, and any abnormalities immediately reported to the doctor;
- Take particular interest in the painful joints. Small soft pillows should be used to support the affected limb providing comfort. You should ensure that bed cradle is in place to keep beddings off the lower limbs;
The child should be on complete bed rest with all activities carried out by the nurses. You should explain to older children and their parents why such steps are being taken;
- The child should be given light, well-balanced meals and you should assign one nurse to feed him/her, if he is too ill to do so himself or whenever he/she is in pain;
- Slowly progressive passive exercise in bed and occupational therapy is advised. As the child's condition improves, he/she will be mobilized within the ward;
${ }^{-}$Involve the family in the child's care, as this care will have to continue at home.
- Reassure the parents that the child with rheumatic heart disease should be encouraged to continue with normal activities as far as possible and emphasise that over-protection will not facilitate recovery.

\section*{Medical treatment}
- Good nursing care is the most significant remedy for this patient.
- However, several drugs may be given, mainly to control pain and for prophylaxis.
- Antibiotics, such as penicillin v, or amoxil as prophylactic, are commonly used.
- Analgesics, such as aspirin or brufen, may be the alternative choice.
- The doses depend on the age and individual patient's needs.

\section*{Complications}
- One or more complications may occur.
- These include heart failure, mitral stenosis, aortic valve incompetence and pericarditis.
- You should be on the lookout for the onset of these.

\section*{Support and locomotion}

\section*{TALIPES}

This is a term used to describe a group of foot deformities.
Any foot deformity involving the ankle is called talipes, derived from talus meaning ankle and pes meaning foot.
it is one of the most common congenital orthopaedic deformities, which occurs in approximately 1 in 700 to 1 in 1000 live births.
For unknown reasons, it is more common in boys than in girls.
Causes are unknown, but there are several theories. It is believed to be hereditary and may be a developmental defect in utero as a result of malpresentation.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Talipes, or clubfoot as it is sometimes called, is characterized by an abnormal twist or position in utero, which remains fixed.
- The pathology varies from slight changes in the structure of the foot to abnormalities in the metatarsals and tarsals (bones of the foot and ankle).

\section*{TYPES OF TALIPES}

\section*{Talipes equinovarus}
- In this condition, the foot is fixed in plantar flexion and deviates medially, that is, the heel is elevated off the ground.
- It occurs in 95\% of those children who have talipes.
- If not corrected early, the child will walk on the toes and outer border of the foot.
- These types of talipes may occur unilaterally or bilaterally.

\section*{Talipes calcaneovalgus}
- The foot is dorsiflexed and deviates laterally resulting in the heel turning outwards from the midline of the body and the anterior part of the foot is elevated on the outer border.
- If not corrected, the child will walk on an outwardly turned heel and the inner border of the foot.
- It tends to occur unilaterally.

Talipes cavovarus
- The heel is turned inwards (inverted) from the midline of the leg but only the outer portion of the sole rests on the ground.
Talipes equinovalgus
- The heel is elevated and turned outwards (averted) from the midline of the body.

Talipes calcaneovarus
- The heel is turned towards the midline of the body and anterior part of the foot is elevated.
- Only the heel rests on the floor.

Differential diagnosis
- At birth, you should be able to differentiate the structural abnormalities from paralytic deformity, which may occur in conjunction with meningomyelocele, that is, the protrusion of meninges, and possibly nerve structures through congenital opening in the lower spinal column.
- Radiographic investigation by a doctor may be helpful if there is doubt.

\section*{management}
- Success in management will depend on how soon the treatment is commenced.
${ }^{-}$In most cases, it is recommended that it be commenced soon after birth preferably within 36 to 48 hours.
- The short-term goal is to correct deformity and to maintain the affected area in the normal position as much as possible.
- The long-term goal is to prevent recurrence of deformity.
- Any delay in treatment makes the corrective measures more difficult because the bones and the muscles of the foot and leg tend to develop abnormally while the tendons become shorter.

\section*{Conservative management}

Manipulation of the foot is carried out manually together with an exercise programme several times a day.
- These should be done very gently to avoid pain and swelling which may occur if the management is not properly carried out.
The mother may also be taught to participate in the care of this child under supervision.
- After some months, a strapping should be applied to the foot.
- Plaster of paris or a splint may be applied to maintain the position after the manipulation has been performed and the correct position achieved.
- Where a splint (denis browne splint) or p.o.p. is used, the mother should be instructed to inform the nurses should any skin redness occur in the area.
- Special boots may also be used, especially for the older children who may come to the hospital later for talipes correction.
- Parents should be given health education in preparation for their child's discharge from hospital.
- The need for follow up with the clinic should be emphasized as the condition mav recur.

\section*{Surgical management}
- Where conservative treatment has failed, or where the older child is brought to hospital rather late, surgical corrective measures may be undertaken.
- The operation is called tenotomy.
- This is cutting and realigning the achilles tendon.
- The division of contracted soft tissues may be necessary, especially among those children who are about ten years or more.

Nervous system

\section*{hydrocephalus}
- This is an abnormal condition of fluid around the brain or inside the ventricles.
- The incidence varies according to the geographical location where it occurs.
- It is usually a result of an interference with the circulation or absorption of cerebral spinal fluid.
- The production of csf is dependent largely on active ion transportation across the epithelial membrane of the choroid plexus.
- The ion mostly transported into the cavities of the ventricles is sodium.
- The amount of cerebral spinal fluid produced is normally equivalent to the amount reabsorbed.

\section*{Communicating(extra ventricular) hydrocephalus}
- In this type of hydrocephalus, the obstruction is outside the ventricular system.
- The problem is caused by blockage or occlusion of the sub-arachnoid cisterns around the brain stem.
- The fluid, which is not being absorbed, compresses the brain and distends the cranial cavity.

Causes
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage;
- Bacterial meningitis, for example, tuberculosis;
- Toxoplasmosis;
- Diseases of the connective tissues;
- Sardocoidosis;
- Head injury;
${ }^{-}$Idiopathic causes.

\section*{Non communicating hydrocephalus}
- The obstruction here is within the ventricular systems, leading to interference with the flow of the cerebral spinal fluid to the sub-arachnoid space.

\section*{Causes include:}
- Congenital defect-developmental, for example, arnod chiari malformation and aqueduct stenosis;
- Acquired defects, for example, cerebral abscess, compression of the aqueduct by either aneurysm or haematoma, brain tumour of either cerebellar haematoma, brain stem haematoma and/or colloid cyst.

\section*{management}
- A physical assessment should be undertaken to ascertain the extent and seriousness of the condition, taking into account the infant's age and period of onset.
- The head circumference (occipo-frontal circumference) should be regularly measured.
- Medical treatment with acetazolamide (diamox) should be commenced to reduce the production of cerebral spinal fluid in mild cases of hydrocephalus.
- Repeated lumbar punctures may be performed to maintain normal celebral spinal fluid pressure.
- Surgical intervention may also be undertaken, depending on the severity of the condition.

- This consists of the removal of obstructions such as tumours, cysts and haemorrhage (haematoma).
- Another procedure that may be performed is a ventriculostomy, which involves the destruction of the third and fourth ventricle or the choroid plexus.
- A radio opaque ventricular catheter is inserted to shunt cerebro-spinal fluid (csf) from the ventricle to another area outside the central nervous system, for example, the abdominal cavity.
- These catheters have valves to prevent flow back of blood or any other secretion into the ventricles.
- Types of valves in use are the spitz -holter valve system, hakim shunting system and heyer-schulte-pudenz catheter.

\section*{Pre op nursing care}
- The nurse monitors signs of increased intracranial pressure and reports to the surgeon any changes.
- You should continue to frequently measure the head circumference.
- You should palpate the fontanelles gently for possible separation of sutures and tension.
- Vital signs should be taken and recorded (tpr/bp) every one or two hours. Any deviations should be reported immediately.
- The child's behavioural changes, including persistent cries should be recorded and reported.
- Regularly change the child's position in bed to prevent bed sores, that is, two hourly.
- The neck should be supported when being moved.
- The parents are encouraged to participate in their child's care during his stay in hospital in preparation for discharge.

\section*{Post op nursing care}
- The pre-operative care provided should continue after surgery, in addition to routine post-operative care.
- Immediately after surgery, vital signs should be monitored and recorded in one-hour intervals, paying particular attention to increasing intracranial pressure (blood pressure/pulse rate, temperature and respiratory rate carefully noted).
- Other neurological observations, for example, the assessment of the level of consciousness should also be continued.
- The dressings on the operation site should be checked regularly.
- You should always ensure that the child lies on the good side to prevent pressure on the shunt valve.
- Alternatively, he/she should lie flat on his back.
- Careful regular feeds should be given. Parental education should be continued from admission till discharge.
- Analgesics and antibiotics are also given.
- Be vigilant of possible post-operative complications and inform parents or guardians of this risk. These include infection, vomiting and meningitis.

\section*{microcephaly}
- This is a relatively uncommon congenital condition where there is a defect in the growth of the brain.
- The size of the brain becomes three times smaller than normal.
- There are several predisposing factors which include:
- Foetal radiation;
- Maternal phenylketonuria, which is an inherited metabolic amino acid-phenylalanine because the liver has failed to release an enzyme called phenylalaninase;
- Congenital infections may also contribute to this condition, for example, syphilis, neonatal herpes, rubella;
- Intrauterine or neonatal anoxia.
- The condition presents in several ways. The ears are relatively large, the forehead slopes backwards and the head appears smaller.

\section*{Nursing management}
- There is no treatment available for this condition.
${ }^{-}$Parents should be supported and made to understand that.

\section*{Spina bifida}
- This is a congenital abnormality, which results from a defect in the formation of the skeletal arch enclosing the spinal cord.
- Although it may occur in any part of the spinal column and on the skull, it is more common in the lumbar region.

There are three degrees of abnormality.
mild, which affects only the defective bone;
${ }^{-}$Naevus (or hairy patch), which is a depression covered by hair over the spinal defect and can easily be missed;
${ }^{-}$Severe abnormality, which is further sub-divided into two categories.
- The first is meningocele, which is a condition where the meninges are herniated (protrude) and the sac contains csf.
- The second is meningomyelocele, which is the protrusion of the meninges, nerve tissue and cerebral spinal fluid.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Spina bifida is a common developmental defect of the central nervous system occurring in 1-2 of every 1000 newborn infants.
- The posterior portion of the lamina of one or more vertebrae fails to fuse with or without defective development of the spinal cord, and tends to occur mostly in the lumbar or lumbo-sacral region.
- In the milder type (spina bifida oculta), there may be no need for any medical intervention while in the meningocele and meningomyelocele surgical intervention is called for.

\section*{management}
- Since meningomyelocele occurs more commonly than the other two forms, and is more severe in its clinical presentation,
- surgery is indicated and should be performed at the earliest opportunity to prevent possible neurological damage.

\section*{Pre and post op nursing}
- The objectives of care should be to prevent infection and injury to the sac, skin damage and urinary tract infection, which is likely to occur.
- These are achieved by performing aseptic technique dressing using warm normal saline until the operation is performed.
- The dressing should be changed at least four hourly.
- The nurse should continue with her assessment of the child's general condition, paying particular attention to the musculoskeletal functions, which may occur due to exposure of the nerve fibres.
- The vital signs, that is, observation of temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure should be taken and recorded every two to four hours and any deviation from norms reported to the surgeon.

\section*{Juvenile diabetes mellitus}
- Diabetes mellitus is a clinical symptom characterised by hyperglycaemia due to relative deficiencies of insulin action caused by either a diminished excretion by the islets of langerhans of the pancreas or due to the presence of insulin antagonists which render any insulin produced ineffective for carbohydrate metabolism resulting in glycosuria, ketosis and eventually coma.
- Although diabetes mellitus can occur in childhood, it is very rare in those under the age of 2 years and where it occurs, there is a family history of diabetes.

\section*{causes}
- The real cause of this failure to function of the pancreatic islet of langerhans is unknown.
However, several possible pre-disposing factors have been identified:
- Infection, particularly viral, has been blamed for precipitating the problem;
- Genetic factors account for a third of the cases;
- Environmental factors promote clinical presentation;
- Diet may play a role, for example, children on cow's milk early in their infancy are more likely to get the condition;
- Stress stimulates the secretion of counter-regulatory hormones and also modulates immune activity.

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Diabetes mellitus occurs from a relatively deficient or complete absence of insulin. This changes the metabolism of the body.
- In order to maintain life, the use of insulin may be necessary especially in insulin dependent diabetes.
- When insulin is deficient, or its action is hindered, glucose uptake and the storage of glycogen and fat are decreased.
- These events lead to the starvation of body cells and the accumulation of glucose (hyperglycaemia) and fat in the blood in the form of free fatty acids and ketone bodies.
- The failure of glucose to enter the cells leads to increased blood glucose level.
- The increased concentration causes fluid movement from the intracellular to the extra-cellular spaces and into the kidneys.
- Once the renal threshold is exceeded, glycosuria (glucose in urine) follows and this is accompanied by polyuria.
- Polyuria leads to electrolyte depletion and dehydration, which increases thirst (polydipsia), while cellular starvation results in hunger.
- Fat breakdown causes increased free fatty acids in the blood, which the liver converts to ketone bodies betahydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic and acetone. These, being acidic, lower blood ph.

\section*{Clinical features}

Although there is always some similarity of clinical presentation in diabetic children to that of adults, some differences tend to exist;
- In children the onset is usually very sudden;
${ }^{-}$It appears as though emotional stress and infections such as measles and tonsillitis tend to trigger its onset;
${ }^{-}$Excessive thirst and polyuria with high specific gravity;
- The child who never wets the bed at night changes to bed-wetting. The child gradually becomes lethargic, weak and irritable;
- As dehydration occurs, the skin and tongue become dry;

\section*{Clinical......}
${ }^{-}$Rapid weight loss and developmental deterioration;
- The child may complain of abdominal pain;
- The penis or vulva is often red and irritated due to high sugar content in the urine
- The urine contains sugar and acetone;
- Vomiting may be present as ketosis increases;
- This tends to speed up the occurrence of diabetic coma.

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
- Diabetes mellitus is more often overlooked or missed because other childhood illnesses overshadow the symptoms.
- Certain investigations are essential in confirming the diagnosis.
- A personal history should be taken from the parents.
- A physical examination should then be undertaken, which includes blood specimen for sugar level estimation, a glucose tolerance test and urine testing for sugar and acetone.

\section*{Nursing management}
- The child with diabetes mellitus should be admitted to the paediatric ward.
- Depending on his/her age, the parents should be requested to stay so as to participate in his care. This is important because when the child finally returns home, the parents will be able to continue with his home care.
- You should continue to reassure the patients and parents periodically.
- You are responsible for monitoring his vital signs of temperature, pulse, respiration, blood sugar level 4 hourly and fluid intake and output. These must be recorded on the available charts.
- An intravenous infusion of normal saline and dextrose $5 \%$, calculated on drops per minute on a volume-controlled pump to maintain continuous flow rate without overloading the circulation should be administered.
- The doctor and nurses should aim at stabilization of the child's diabetes as soon as he/she is admitted in hospital.

\section*{Mgt.....}
- The child's own appetite should be allowed to regulate his blood sugar level. A very energetic child will become hungry from time to time and all this needs to be taken into account when planning his/her dietary requirement and insulin needs.
- In order to maintain normal development, a diabetic child should normally be allowed to eat a less restrictive diet with the exception of large amounts of foods high in carbohydrate.
- Plenty of oral fluids should be encouraged as well as good general body hygiene.
- The child and parents should be taught how to manage diabetes. This includes insulin administration, urinalysis, diet control and any other essential health care pertaining to this condition.
- They should be helped to learn how to calculate insulin dosages, vary sites of injections and how to maintain the diabetic chart at home. Above all, they should be assisted to come to terms with the incurable medical condition as a disability.

\section*{complications}
- The main complications to be highlighted are susceptibility to infection
- Coma is also a possibility.
- Unconsciousness may result due to insulin given without food (hypoglycaemic coma).
- Hyperglycaemic coma may also occur, especially if the child on insulin skips his dosages and does not adhere to the prescribed diet.

\section*{Conditions of the ear}

\section*{Otitis media}
- The ear, nose and throat are anatomically closely related.
- This means that infections can quite easily spread from one to the other.
- The inflammation of the middle ear is a common condition in children, which emerges as a secondary infection following a sore throat, common cold tonsillitis, dental problems, mouth infections and ascending infections from the upper respiratory tract through the eustachian tube.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- The function of the eustachian tubes is to clear secretions produced by the middle ear into the nasopharynx in order to equalize the external air pressure with the pressure in the middle ear.
- Disease in the middle ear is usually common in infancy and early childhood for several reasons:
- The eustachian tubes in very young children are wider, shorter and lie in a more horizontal position than those of adults and older children;
- Young children's eustachian tubes open more easily than those of adults and older children because the supportive cartilage is stiff;
- Children, have numerous tymphoid tissues plus adenoids in the pharynx, which can easily obstruct the openings of the tube;

\section*{Predisposing......}
${ }^{-}$Infections easily occur in young children because they have an immature humeral defence mechanism;
- Children have frequent incidences of the upper respiratory tract infections, thereby permitting micro-organisms to ascend through the eustachian tubes to the middle ears;
- The drainage from the eustachian tubes is reduced by frequent accumulation of liquids and milk in the pharyngeal cavity because infants and the young children usually assume supine position.

\section*{Clinical features}
- A history of insidious onset with one of the first signs being the child rolling his head on the pillow and pulling his ear because of severe irritation;
- Pain becomes increasingly severe as the body temperature rises to about 39-40 degree celsius;
- The child is very irritable, resents being touched and looks toxic;
${ }^{-}$Diarrhoea, vomiting and convulsions are common features of otitis media;
- The blood vessels of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) look dilated and congested on examination;
- The eardrum may be opaque due to the presence of pus;
- Mobility of the eardrum is lost and bulges outwards;
- Hearing may be temporarily impaired.

\section*{Diagnostic investigations}
${ }^{-}$Begin with a personal history from the parents or guardians of the child.
- A physical examination, to include the ears, throat and cervical lymph nodes, should be undertaken.
- Additionally, take pus swabs for culture and sensitivity from the discharging ears.

\section*{Nursing mgt}
${ }^{-}$Due to severe pain, pyrexia and discomfort, the child is best nursed on bed rest with the affected side downwards to facilitate drainage of pus if any. This is done until the temperature settles.
- Pain is best controlled by use of mild analgesics such as paracetamol given three times a day. This will also help to lower the temperature.
- The child's vital signs including observations of temperature, pulse and respiration are best taken and recorded four hourly.

\section*{Medical treatment}
- Antibiotics such as ampicillin or amoxyl syrup to be administered orally or by intramuscular injection.
- Alternatively, septrin syrup may be prescribed.
- When the eardrum is grossly bulging, surgical measures may have to be undertaken. This procedure is known as a myringotomy (incision of the eardrum) to facilitate pus drainage from the middle ear.
- Daily or bd aural toilet should be performed using normal saline.
- A pad is held over the ear with a strapping (no packing of ear should be carried out in such cases).
- Pain usually abates after pus has been drained out.

Complications of otitis media
${ }^{-}$Meningitis,
- chronic otitis media,
- mastoiditis and
- otitis intima leading to deafness.
