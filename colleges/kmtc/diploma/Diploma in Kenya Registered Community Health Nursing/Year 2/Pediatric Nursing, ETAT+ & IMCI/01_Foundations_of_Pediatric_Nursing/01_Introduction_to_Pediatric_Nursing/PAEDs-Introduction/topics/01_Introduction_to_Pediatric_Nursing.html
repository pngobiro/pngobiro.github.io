                            <li><strong>Development:</strong> - increase in function</li>

                            <li>Development also involves the changing from a lower to a more advanced stage of complexity</li>
                            <li>Development is achieved through growth, maturation and learning</li>
                            <li>It is qualitative in nature</li>
                            <li><strong>Maturation:</strong> is the process of the unfolding of the genetic inherited tendencies within the child</li>
                            <li>Some children are "late" matures while others are "rapid" matures</li>
                            <li>All children mature at their own rate</li>

                            <li>There is a "qualitative" change</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> is a "change of behavior"</li>
                            <li>It is the result of experience, experimentation, and training</li>
                            <li>The ability to learn is dependent upon the inborn capacity for mental development</li>
                            <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Maturation and Learning are interrelated. No learning can take place unless the child is mature enough to understand and the behavior is changed. The learning process can be hindered if the child is not given the opportunity learning by experience and from others when the time is optimum.</li>

                        <p>Ashley borrowed her father's car. She and her friend Kayla were very late coming home that evening. They were further delayed at a stop light on a quiet street. After what seemed to be an unnecessary long wait, Kayla reminded Ashley that they were late. Ashley continued to wait, insisting that if everyone ignored stop lights when it was personally convenient to do so, no street would be safe.</p>

                        <p>Jordan was not prepared for a difficult chem. Exam, so he wrote some important formulas on a slip of paper which he put in his pocket before the test. Just before the test began, the teacher informed the class that any student caught cheating would automatically fail the test. Even though Jordan needed the information he wrote, he didn't use it because the teacher stood too close to his desk during the entire exam.</p>

                        <p>Early in the school year, DeShawn who started at varsity basketball, asked Caitlin for a date. Caitlin was not attracted to DeShawn and politely declined. A few weeks later Caitlin tried out for cheerleading and made it. Several of the other cheerleaders were dating boys on the team. When DeShawn asked Caitlin to go with him to a party that the team was having after an important game, she accepted.</p>

                        <p>Kyle asked his older sister, Gabby, if he could borrow her car so that he and his friend could go to the beach. Gabby reminded her brother that she never wanted him to drive her car. She suggested, however, that if it was all right with him, they could all go together. Soon after they got to the beach, Kyle's friend got ill. Kyle asked Gabby if she could drive his friend home. Gabby refused, saying that she had just come all that way and she was not going to turn around and go right back. Kyle tried unsuccessfully to find a way to get his friend home. Finally, while Gabby was swimming, he wrote her a note telling her he would be back soon as possible, took her car keys, and drove his friend back home.</p>

                        <p>As Jason's father was leaving for work in the morning, he asked Jason to clean out the garage sometime during the day. Jason responded, saying he already had plans to play tennis that day. Around noon, Jason and two friends made plans that required Jason to borrow his father's car that evening. Jason decided to skip playing tennis and clean the garage.</p>

                            <li>Some of these deaths can be prevented if very sick children are quickly identified on their arrival and treatment is started without delay.</li>
                            <li>In many hospitals around the world, children are not checked before a senior health worker examines them; as a result, some seriously ill patients have to wait a very long time before they are seen and treated.</li>

                            <li>Triaging should not take much time. For a child who does not have emergency signs, it takes on average 20 seconds.</li>
                            <li>The health worker should learn to assess several signs at the same time.</li>

                            <li>A child who is smiling or crying does not have severe respiratory distress, shock or coma. The health worker looks at the child, observes the chest for breathing and priority signs such as severe malnutrition and listens to abnormal sounds such as stridor or grunting.</li>

                            <li>Several methods are available to facilitate the triaging process.</li>
                            <li>One example is a stamp being used in Malawi consisting of the "ABCD" signs in which the health worker circles the correct step and initiates emergency treatment "E" or puts them in priority groups "P" or "Q" for children who can wait in the queue.</li>
                            <li>Colours can also be used for differentiating the three groups, giving a red sticker to emergency cases, a yellow for priority and green for the queue.</li>
