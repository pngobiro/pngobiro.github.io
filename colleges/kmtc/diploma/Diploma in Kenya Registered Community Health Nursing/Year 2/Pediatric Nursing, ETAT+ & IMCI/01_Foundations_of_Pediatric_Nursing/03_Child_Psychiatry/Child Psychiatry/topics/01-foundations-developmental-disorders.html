                            <li>Children are less able to express themselves in words</li>
                            <li>The child who suffers by psychiatric problems in childhood can be an emotionally stable person in adulthood, but some of the psychic disturbances can change a whole life of the child and his family</li>

                        <p>A specific developmental disorder in which the child's use of speech sounds is below the appropriate level for its mental age, but in which there is a normal level of language skills.</p>
                        <p>The articulation abnormalities are not caused by a neurological abnormality and nonverbal intelligence is within normal range.</p>
                        <p>Developmental:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>phonological disorder</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Expressive Language Disorder</h3>
                        <p>A specific developmental disorder in which the child's ability to use expressive spoken language is markedly below the appropriate level for its mental age, but in which language comprehension is within normal limits.</p>
                        <p>There may or may not be abnormalities in articulation.</p>
                        <p>Developmental dysphasia or aphasia, expressive type</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Receptive Language Disorder</h3>
                        <p>A specific developmental disorder in which the child's understanding of language is below the appropriate level for its mental age, particularly in more subtle aspects of language - grammatical structures, tone of voice.</p>
                        <p>The social reciprocity and make- believe play is normal and severe hearing disturbances are not present.</p>
                        <p>Developmental:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>dysphasia or aphasia, receptive type</li>

                            <li>Word deafness</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acquired Aphasia with Epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner)</h3>
                        <p>The child loses receptive and expressive language skills after previous period of normal language development. The paroxysmal abnormalities on the EEG are present and in the majority of cases epileptic seizures occur as well.</p>
                        <p>Some children become mute in a period of few months.</p>
                        <p>Usually the onset is between the ages of three and seven years, with skills being lost over days or weeks.</p>
                        <p>An inflammatory encephalitic process has been suggested as a possible cause of this disorder.</p>
                        <p>About two-thirds of patients are left with a more or less severe receptive language deficit.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cooperation of neurologist and speech therapist is very important.</li>
                            <li>Psychiatric treatment is necessary if the child has secondary psychic problems, for example in relationship with other children or family.</li>
                            <li>Nootropic drugs, psychotherapy and special education are useful.</li>
