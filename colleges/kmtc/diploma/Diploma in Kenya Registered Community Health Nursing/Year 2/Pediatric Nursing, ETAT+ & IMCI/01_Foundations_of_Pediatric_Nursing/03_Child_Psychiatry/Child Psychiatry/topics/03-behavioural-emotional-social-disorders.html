                        <p>Hyperkinetic disorders occur mostly in first five years of life, and they are several times more frequent in boys than in girls</p>
                        <p>The main marks of the syndrome are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>inattention</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>ADHD: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (formerly MBD: minimal brain dysfunction).</p>
                        <p>Prevalence is from 3% to 10% of elementary-school children</p>
                        <p>Etiology: genetic predisposition, maternal deprivation, environmental toxins or intrauterine or postnatal brain damage</p>
                        <p>About 50% of children with hyperkinetic syndrome have so called "soft signs" and minor abnormalities in EEG</p>
                        <p>IQ: from subnormal to high intelligence</p>
                        <p>Specific learning disabilities often coexist with hyperkinetic syndrome</p>

                        <p>Conduct disorders are diagnosed when the child is showing persistent and serious dissocial or aggressive behaviour patterns, such as excessive fighting or bullying, cruelty to animals or other people, destructiveness to property, stealing, lying, and truancy from school and running away from home.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conduct Disorder Confined to the Family Context</h3>
                        <p>The dissocial or aggressive behaviour is intent on family members and occurs mostly at home or immediate household. Stealing from home and destruction of beloved property of particular family members is typical. Social relationships outside the family are within the normal range.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Unsocialized Conduct Disorder</h3>
                        <p>Aggressive and dissocial behaviour is connected with the child's poor relationships with other children and peers groups.</p>
                        <p>There is a lack of close friends, rejection by other children, unpopularity in the school and hostile feelings toward adults.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Socialized Conduct Disorder</h3>
                        <p>The diagnosis is applied when the child is showing aggressive and dissocial behaviour, but relationship with children of the same age is adequate.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</h3>
                        <p>Children under age of 9 to 10 years, showing persistently negativistic, provocative and disruptive behaviour.</p>
                        <p>The more aggressive conduct disorders are not present, general law and rights of other people are respected.</p>
                        <p>This type of behaviour is often directed towards a new member of the family - i.e. step father.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Family situation should be consider and its relation to the child's disorder. The family therapy is necessary to enhance emotional support and understanding.</li>
                            <li>In the cases of dysfunctional families, abused or neglected children, an adoptive homes, foster care or supervised residence is recommended.</li>
                            <li>Court intervention is required for the placement.</li>

                        <p>The child is showing anxiety when being separated from persons who are for him emotionally important parents, family members. Developmental stage should be considered</p>
                        <p>School refusal is often a symptom of separation anxiety disorders</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>in the case of school refusal the child should be returned to school immediately and strict limits should be established</li>
                            <li>the treatment is focused on family structure and recommendation in the ways of upbringing.</li>
                            <li>in severe cases use of antidepressants is necessary</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phobic Anxiety Disorder of Childhood</h3>
                        <p>The phobic states most commonly encountered in children involve fear of animals, insects, dark and school. Animal and insect phobias usually start at the age of 5 years and almost none start in adult life. Some phobias start in the late adolescence - i.e. agoraphobia</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>psychotherapy and a sensible parental handling is recommended</li>
                            <li>the anxiety reducing techniques are useful, i.e. desensitization</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social Anxiety Disorder of Childhood</h3>
                        <p>There is a wariness of strangers and social apprehension or anxiety when encountering new, strange, or socially threatening situations. This category should be used only where such fears arise during the early years, and are both unusual in degree and accompanied by problems in social functioning.</p>
                        <p>A fear of social encounters is associated with avoidance behaviour, which produces problems in functioning in a peers group and in the school performance as well.</p>
                        <p>The social acceptance of the child can be very difficult and can have impact on his or hers further personal development.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>psychotherapy</li>

                        <p>Some degree of emotional disturbance usually following the birth of an immediately younger sibling is shown by a majority of young children.</p>
                        <p>Sibling rivalry disorder should be diagnosed only if the degree or persistence of the disturbance is both statistically unusual and associated with abnormalities of social interaction.</p>
                        <p>The children with sibling rivalry disorder are acting with serious hatred to the new born, in severe cases they are showing physical harming behaviour and persistent competition to gain parents attention.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Elective Mutism</h3>
                        <p>Characterized by a marked, emotionally determined selectivity in speaking, such that the child demonstrates a language competence in some situations but fails to speak in other (definable) situations</p>
                        <p>These children show specific personality features as social anxiety and oversensitivity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reactive Attachment Disorder of Childhood</h3>
                        <p>Characterized by abnormal responses of the child to the care givers that develop before age of 5 years.</p>
                        <p>The disorder is often an outcome of a parental neglect, abuse or mishandling and deprivation in institutional care.</p>
                        <p>The child shows fearfulness, poor social interaction with peers, aggressive responses and self injurious behaviour.</p>
                        <p>The language development could also be delayed and impaired physical growth can occur.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disinhibited Attachment Disorder of Childhood</h3>
                        <p>Abnormal social functioning develops during first 5 years in children who have no opportunity of emotionally stable relationship with care givers.</p>
                        <p>The disturbance can be recognized in children growing from infancy in institutions or experiencing extremely frequent changes in care givers.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this developmental disturbance good adoption policy is necessary.</p>
                        <p>Non - attachment institutional care should be excluded from praxis.</p>

                        <p>A tic is an involuntary, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement (usually involving circumscribed muscle groups) or vocal production that is of sudden onset and that serves no apparent purpose</p>
                        <p>Tics are experienced as irresistible, but can be suppressed for shorter periods of time</p>
                        <p>Conditions of diagnosis are also a lack of neurological disorder, repetitiveness, disappearance during sleep, lack of rhythmicity, and lack of purpose</p>
