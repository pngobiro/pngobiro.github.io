                        <p>The child is not able of voluntary bladder control during the day (enuresis diurnal) or during the night (enuresis nocturnal)</p>
                        <p>The enuresis may be present from birth (enuresis primaria), or it may occur after a period of time of acquired bladder control (enuresis secundaria)</p>
                        <p>There is no neurological disorder or structural abnormality of urinary system, or lack of bladder control is not due to epileptic attacks or cystitis or diabetic polyuria</p>
                        <p>Enuresis is not diagnosed in a child less than 4 years of mental age</p>
                        <p>Emotional problems may arise as a secondary consequence of enuresis</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Mild restriction of fluids before bedtime</li>

                            <li>Rewarding success and not to focus attention on failure</li>

                        <p>The diagnosis involves repeated intended or unintended passage of faeces in places not appropriate for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>The etiology:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>result of inappropriate toilet training</li>
                            <li>the child is able of bowel control, but because of different reasons is refusing to defecate in appropriate places</li>
                            <li>physiological problems or emotional problems</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Encopresis can be accompanied by smearing of faeces over the body or environment or is a part of anal masturbation. It occurs in children with emotional or behavioural disturbances or mentally retarded persons.</p>

                            <li>to reward success</li>
                            <li>the child is taught to establish more normal bowel habit, for example by sitting on the toilet regularly after the meals</li>
                            <li>Anxiolytics or antidepressants</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In mentally retarded children, or in some children with visual impairment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stuttering (Stammering)</h3>
                        <p>Frequent repetition of prolongation of sounds or syllables or words</p>

                        <p>A rapid rate of speech with breakdown in fluency, but no repetitions or hesitations, of a severity to give rise to diminished speech intelligibility.</p>

                            <li>Consider the developmental or functional age and not the chronological age</li>
                            <li>Teach parents that they should:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Protect the child from danger</li>

                                    <li>Teach the child to refrain from holding their mouths open as this gives them a dull appearance</li>
                                    <li>Select attractive, well-fitted clothing, hair style and good hygiene practices</li>
                                    <li>Eliminate the child's undesirable social traits, such as touching their noses and ears, scratching, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Teach the child only one thing at a time</li>
                                    <li>Demonstrate what they teach, whenever possible</li>
                                    <li>Use pictures, since these are valuable visual aids</li>

                                    <li>Not show fear themselves as this emotion will be transferred to the child</li>
