                            <li>Normal early development is followed by partial or complete loss of speech and of skills in locomotion and use of hands, together with deceleration in head growth.</li>

                            <li>Motor functioning is more affected in middle childhood, muscles are hypotonic, kyphoscoliosis and rigid spasticity in the lower limbs occurs in majority of cases</li>
