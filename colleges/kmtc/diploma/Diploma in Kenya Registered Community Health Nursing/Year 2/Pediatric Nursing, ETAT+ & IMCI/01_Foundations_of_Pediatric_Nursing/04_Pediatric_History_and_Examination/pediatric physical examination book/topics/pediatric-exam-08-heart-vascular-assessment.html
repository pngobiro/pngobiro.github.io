                        <p>The heart begins to form in the fetus by the end of the third week after conception. A crescent-shaped structure is formed that fuses at the midline to create a single linear heart tube (Fig. 8.1). As the primitive heart tube elongates, it differentiates into the atria, ventricles, bulbus cordis, and truncus arteriosus. The conduction system also begins to form at this time. Valve formation begins around the fourth to fifth week after conception, and the formation of the heart is complete by the eighth week after conception. Any early changes in this process caused by genetic, maternal, or external environmental factors can lead to structural malformations of the heart.</p>

                        <p>During fetal life, the lung sacs are collapsed and blood is oxygenated through the placenta. Oxygenated blood travels from the placenta to the heart via the umbilical veins and ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and into the right atrium (RA). Blood then streams to the left atrium (LA) through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and into the left ventricle (LV), which pumps it out the aorta (Fig. 8.2). The less saturated venous blood traveling from the superior vena cava (SVC) and coronary sinus also flows to the RA, but is directed toward the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA). High pulmonary vascular resistance limits blood flow into the lungs, which are not yet involved in ventilation, and redirects it through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to the descending aorta and lower body.</p>

                        <p>With a baby's first breaths, pulmonary vascular resistance falls, causing a dramatic increase in pulmonary blood flow. The ensuing increase in pulmonary venous return to the heart raises LA pressure, causing closure of the PFO. Arterial oxygen saturation increases as a result of improved oxygenation by the lungs. This higher saturation promotes functional closure of the PDA by 48 to 72 hours after birth, with complete anatomical closure occurring by 2 to 3 weeks of age. [1]</p>

                        <p>The heart is composed of four chambers. The upper chambers (atria) are low-pressure receiving chambers, and the lower chambers (ventricles) are high-pressure pumping chambers. The heart is further divided into right and left sides. The RA receives deoxygenated blood from the body, and the RV pumps it out the pulmonary artery to the lungs to become oxygenated. The LA receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, and the LV pumps it out the aorta to the body (Fig. 8.3). The LV operates at a higher pressure than the RV. This normal circulation occurs in series, and there is no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood.</p>
                        <p>There are four valves in the heart that regulate blood flow between the atria and ventricles. The atrioventricular (AV) valves regulate blood flow between the atria and ventricles, and the semilunar valves regulate blood flow between the ventricles and great vessels. The tricuspid valve on the right and the mitral valve on the left are the AV valves (see Fig. 8.3). The pulmonic valve, located at the base of the pulmonary artery between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve, located at the base of the aorta between the aorta and LV, are the semilunar valves. Closure of these valves produces the heart sounds commonly referred to as "lub-dub" (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>).</p>

                        <p>The cardiac examination must be systematic and tailored to the child's developmental level (Fig. 8.4). A complete assessment of the cardiac system must be done in order to make conclusions about the significance of any single abnormality. Cardiac findings should not be taken in isolation.</p>

                        <p>It is important to consistently plot height, weight, and head circumference in infants and children up to 2 years of age to evaluate whether the growth rate is proportional and to monitor for failure to thrive (FTT). For infants, any drop-off in weight percentiles as compared with length and head circumference values should raise the suspicion of CHD. [1] Temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate should be measured and assessed. Fever and respiratory distress both can elevate heart rate.</p>
                        <p>Blood pressure should be measured whenever possible during physical examinations, but definitely once in infancy and then routinely after 3 years of age. [2] Coarctation of the aorta and systemic hypertension can go undetected if blood pressure measurements are omitted during well-child visits. If measured, blood pressure in infants should be taken in all four extremities or at a minimum in the right arm and in one leg to detect a coarctation of the aorta. In children, simultaneous palpation of the radial and femoral pulses is also important in assessing whether a coarctation may be present.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inspection</h3>
                        <p>Note general appearance and activity level and whether the child is alert, lethargic, or appears ill. Note nutritional status and the proportion of weight to height and head circumference. Also, note whether any unusual facial or other external features are present that may indicate the presence of a chromosomal syndrome or congenital anomaly. Examine for any surgical scars on the sternum and chest area that would indicate a previous surgical procedure. Note shape of chest and any presence of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum (see Chapter 9).</p>
                        <h4>Color</h4>
                        <p>Note whether the child is pale or cyanotic, and assess color under natural light if possible. Pallor can occur in infants who are anemic, who have vasoconstriction due to congestive heart failure (CHF), or who are in shock. Children with cyanotic heart disease will appear blue or ruddy, especially around the perioral area-tongue and mucous membranes-because of right-to-left shunting of blood at the arterial level.</p>
                        <h4>Clubbing</h4>
                        <p>Clubbing occurs when arterial desaturation has been present for at least 6 months or longer. The fingers and toes become red and shiny, and progress to wide, thick digits with eventual loss of the normal angle between the nails and the nail beds (Fig. 8.5). [2] With early surgical treatment of cyanotic heart defects in infancy, severe clubbing is an unusual finding.</p>

                        <p>Pulses need to be evaluated for their presence or absence, intensity, timing, symmetry, and whether the pulse is regular or irregular, weak or bounding. A comparison also should be made as to right and left symmetry and quality of pulses in the upper and lower extremities. A pulse that is absent or weaker in the lower extremities compared with the upper extremities is diagnostic of coarctation of the aorta. A strong pedal pulse is a good indication that there is no coarctation. Irregular pulses may be due to an arrhythmia. Weak and thready pulses may indicate poor perfusion or shock, whereas bounding pulses are usually noted with aortic runoff lesions such as a PDA, AV malformation, or aortic insufficiency. [2] Peripheral perfusion is also important to assess, especially in infants. Normally, extremities should be warm to the touch and have a brisk capillary refill time (CRT) of less than 3 seconds-a quick measure of cardiac output. Older children with cardiac conditions may have weak distal pulses on one side or the other because of previous cardiac catheterizations or cardiac surgeries.</p>
                        <p>Normal liver size is usually 1 to 2 cm below the right costal margin. In conditions of abnormal cardiac position, or situs (positional abnormalities), the liver edge is midline or on the left side of the abdomen. Hepatomegaly, or liver engorgement, is a consistent indicator of right heart failure when noted in conjunction with other cardiac findings.</p>
                        <p>The precordium should be palpated to determine the location of the point of maximal impulse, or PMI. The PMI is important in determining ventricular overload, cardiomegaly, and the presence or absence of thrills. Normally, the PMI is felt at the apex in the left midclavicular line, indicating LV dominance. However, it is normal for newborns and infants to have a greater RV impulse, with the PMI felt at the left lower sternal border (LLSB). A PMI that is diffuse and rises slowly is called a heave, and a PMI that is sharp and well localized is known as a tap. [2]</p>
                        <p>A thrill indicates turbulent blood flow and is never normal. It is felt as a vibratory sensation on palpation and should be examined not only on the precordium but also in the suprasternal notch and over the carotid arteries. Precordial thrills are best felt with the palm of the hand, whereas thrills in the suprasternal notch and over the carotid arteries are best felt with the fingertips. [2]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Auscultation</h3>
                        <p>Auscultation of heart sounds in children should be done in a stepwise fashion, and with both the diaphragm and the bell of a stethoscope to elicit both high (diaphragm) and low (bell) frequency sounds (Fig. 8.6). Children with a thin chest wall have heart sounds that are louder than in adults. However, the faster heart rate can make it difficult to accurately distinguish the heart sounds from other adventitious sounds, particularly in early infancy. In children who are overweight or obese, heart sounds are softer due to the increase in adipose tissue. Thus it is recommended that the individual heart sounds be identified first and then analyzed before identifying murmurs.</p>

                        <h4>Heart sounds</h4>
                        <p>The first heart sound is called S<sub>1</sub> and is created by the closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves. It is usually heard best at the LLSB or at the apex. A split S<sub>1</sub> can be a normal but uncommon finding in children. [2]</p>
                        <p>The second heart sound is called S<sub>2</sub> and is created by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. It is usually heard best at the left upper sternal border (LUSB). Evaluation of S<sub>2</sub> is critical in children because it provides important clues as to the presence of structural defects and to the pressures in the heart. S<sub>2</sub> normally varies with respiration-split with inspiration and single or narrowly split in expiration. A fixed split, single S<sub>2</sub>, or loud S<sub>2</sub> warrants referral and further evaluation by a cardiologist. Abnormal splitting of the S<sub>2</sub> may indicate increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary valve abnormality, or a cyanotic heart condition. A loud single S<sub>2</sub> may indicate pulmonary hypertension or malposition of the great arteries. [2]</p>
                        <p>A third heart sound (S<sub>3</sub>) can be a common finding in children and young adults. S<sub>3</sub> can be heard at the apex and is caused by vibrations in the ventricle as it fills rapidly during diastole.</p>
                        <p>A fourth heart sound (S<sub>4</sub> or gallop rhythm) is rare in infants and children. An S<sub>4</sub> is an abnormal finding and suggests decreased ventricular compliance in conditions such as CHF. [2]</p>
                        <p>Ejection clicks are extra heart sounds that occur between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>. They are heard best at the upper sternal border and are usually associated with stenotic semilunar valves or dilated great arteries. [2] </p>
                        <h4>Murmurs</h4>
                        <p>Murmurs are produced when blood flows across an area that has a pressure difference and causes turbulence or disturbed flow. Murmurs should be assessed and evaluated according to their timing in the cardiac cycle, location, transmission, intensity, frequency, and quality. [2] It is always important to note whether a murmur radiates to the lung fields, axillae, clavicles, or neck. A normal grading scale is used to describe a murmur's intensity (Table 8.1).</p>

                        <p>Murmurs are described in relation to their timing during the cardiac cycle-systolic, diastolic, or continuous. Systolic murmurs occur between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, and diastolic murmurs are heard after S<sub>2</sub>. Systolic murmurs are further described as ejection crescendodecrescendo, or regurgitant long systolic-decrescendo. Fig. 8.7 illustrates the difference between ejection and regurgitant murmurs in relation to when they occur in the cardiac cycle.</p>

The ejection murmur has a crescendo-decrescendo (diamond) shape starting after S1 and ending before S2. The regurgitant murmur is a pansystolic (holosystolic) murmur that begins with S1 and continues to S2." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Systolic ejection murmurs begin shortly after the first heart sound, are due to semilunar valve or great vessel stenosis, usually vary in intensity, and are diamond-shaped. They can be short or long in duration but usually end before S<sub>2</sub>. Regurgitant murmurs typically begin with S<sub>1</sub>, although they usually do not obscure it; are the result of mitral or tricuspid valve insufficiency; and can be long or short in duration. Holosystolic murmurs obscure S<sub>1</sub> at their maximal or loudest point and are usually caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD). [2]</p>
                        <p>Diastolic murmurs occur between S<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> and are described as early, mid, or late. Diastolic murmurs are usually caused by aortic or pulmonic regurgitation or mitral stenosis and are never normal. [2]</p>
                        <p>Continuous murmurs begin in systole and continue without interruption through S<sub>2</sub> and into diastole. They are usually caused by conditions in which vascular shunting occurs throughout the cardiac cycle, such as in PDA or a surgical aorta-to-pulmonary shunt. A continuous murmur from a PDA has a machinery-like quality, is best heard in the left clavicular area or back, and has a crescendo-decrescendo shape. [2]</p>
                        <p>The origin of a murmur is usually found at the point where the murmur is heard the loudest. The location of the murmur provides valuable information regarding the cardiac malformation. If a murmur is heard throughout the chest, the area of highest frequency will define its origin. For example, a systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the axillae and back is usually pulmonary in origin, and one that radiates to the neck and carotid arteries is typically aortic in origin. The frequency or pitch of a murmur is a good indicator of the pressure gradient across a valve or septal defect. The higher the pressure gradient, the higher the frequency of the murmur.</p>
