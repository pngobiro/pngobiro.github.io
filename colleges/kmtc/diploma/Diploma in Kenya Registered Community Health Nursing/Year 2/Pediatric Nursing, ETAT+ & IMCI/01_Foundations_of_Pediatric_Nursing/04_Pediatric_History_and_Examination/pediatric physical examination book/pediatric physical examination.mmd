\section*{Preface}

Pediatric Physical Examination: An Illustrated Handbook, third edition, is written for students, educators, and pediatric health care providers dedicated to mastering the art and technique of the comprehensive physical examination of infants, children, and adolescents. Facing increasing pressures, primary health care providers need astute assessment skills combined with quick references to assist them in caring for children and families. This third edition of Pediatric Physical Examination: An Illustrated Handbook will provide the novice or experienced provider with pediatric content from experts in the field, useful examination techniques from birth to adolescence, and pediatric clinical pearls not covered in other texts on health assessment across the life span. In response to suggestions by students and experienced clinicians who have used the text as a resource across pediatric clinical settings, the third edition includes a red flag feature in many of the chapters to alert readers to key findings across systems. Also included in some chapters of the third edition is a note on interprofessional collaboration to highlight important collaborations with pediatric specialists, physicians, behavioral health, nutritionist, and therapists to provide comprehensive care to children and families. There are also many new photos and illustrations of important assessment findings.

The initial chapters of this handbook begin with an overview of the developmental approach to information gathering and assessment of children from birth to adolescence. Chapter 3 focuses on development surveillance and presents evidence on reliable and valid developmental and behavioral screening tools. Chapter 4 presents comprehensive information on history taking in infants,
children, and adolescents, including expanded coverage of pediatric mental health assessment. Chapter 5 reviews the unique vulnerability of children to environmental hazards and focuses on the importance of the environmental health history in identifying and reducing environmental risk factors that have an impact on child health.

The most exciting addition to the text is Chapter 6, Newborn Assessment. This chapter features a head-to-toe assessment of the term newborn and reviews pertinent health history and common newborn conditions. Chapter 7 presents assessment of the skin and common pediatric findings. The chapters that follow are organized in the pediatric-oriented "quiet-to-active" approach to physical examination. Pediatric experts consider this to be the most effective approach to assessing young children. This format begins with the quieter parts of the exam-cardiac and respiratory-which require astute listening skills and less active participation of the young child. Then, Chapters 10 through 14, which cover assessment of the head and neck, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, require more active participation from the child and are better performed after the quiet parts of the physical examination. Chapter 15 reviews abdominal assessment from birth to adolescence.

A unique feature of the text remains the developmental approach to examination of the male and female genitalia and the developing breast in males and females, presented in Chapters 16 through 18. Chapter 19 includes a comprehensive assessment of the child and adolescent athlete for sports participation, as well as the recent guidelines on assessment for concussion. Finally, Chapter 20 presents neurological assessment from a pediatric developmental perspective.

Working with children and families is a hopeful endeavor, and health in childhood builds the foundation for health promotion and health protection throughout life. Pediatric primary care providers have a key role in protecting and improving the health of the next generation. Through astute physical assessment, providers build trust with children and families and preserve the provider/patient relationship, ultimately improving health outcomes and decreasing health care costs. This handbook assists the pediatric health care provider with this most important undertaking: promoting the
health of the next generation.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The publication of the third edition would not have occurred without encouragement from my students, pediatric colleagues, family members, and the "very patient" editors at Elsevier. I would like to first acknowledge Melissa Rawe, Content Developmental Specialist, who has patiently and pleasantly mentored me through the publication of the third edition. Her attention to detail and willingness to accept my numerous edits has made this edition a wonderful resource for students and educators. Lee Henderson, Executive Content Strategist, has loyally carried my vision through to publication for the text and eBook! Marquita Parker was the Senior Project Manager for the text during the final stages of publication.

I am pleased to have some new contributors in the third edition Annette Carley and Julianne Kristyne. I am very thankful to them and my UCSF faculty colleagues for bringing new pediatric and adolescent specialty expertise to this edition of the text. Their contributions were invaluable at a very busy time during the academic year. Pat Jackson Allen, my longtime mentor and friend, was willing to again support the text as a distinguished contributor. Naomi Schapiro was willing to return as a key contributor during a very busy time for her research work and grant duties. All of these pediatric colleagues were instrumental to the third edition with their excellent contributions. Tina Chang PNP and Julia Chang PNP were my devoted research assistants on the third edition and contributed to the searches yielding many of the excellent references and resources used in updating the text.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge my dear husband and life companion, Chris. Without his constant patience, love, and support,
this third edition would not have happened. My hope is that the knowledge in this text will help to shape the next generation of pediatric health care providers who advocate for and promote optimum health for children and families

\section*{Unique role of the pediatric provider}

Pediatric health care providers have a unique role in the development of a child's health over a lifetime. Health is an interactive, dynamic process shaped by genetics, exposures, human experiences, and individual choice. ${ }^{1}$ From a life course perspective, early experiences can "program" a child's health and development. Protective factors, such as a nurturing family and safe neighborhood, improve health and contribute to healthy development, whereas risk factors, such as limited access to quality health care and social services, have a negative effect on a child's development and ability to reach his or her full developmental potential. ${ }^{1}$

A significant body of literature indicates that many chronic conditions in adulthood and disparities in adult health have their origins during childhood and increase over time. ${ }^{2}$ Physical,
cognitive, and social-emotional health are established in the early years of life. Pediatric health care providers are now charged with identifying developmental concerns early and focusing on interventions that promote the health and well-being of children and families and limit the adverse effects of toxic stress on brain development. ${ }^{2}$ Toxic stress, in contrast to tolerable stressors during childhood, is defined as prolonged activation of the physiologic stress response system that is not buffered by environmental protections or by stable, responsive parent and caregiver relationships. ${ }^{2}$ Early investments in health promotion can empower healthy choices for both child and family, greatly improve child health outcomes, alter the life course, and decrease the cost of health care services.

\section*{Establishing a caring relationship}

Children have unique needs because of their long period of dependency and development, which presents a unique challenge to the pediatric health care provider. Children's health and wellbeing depend greatly on the care received from their family units and the environment in which they live. Addressing the needs of the parent or caregiver while caring for the child and fostering a healthy relationship in the family unit are among the most important and challenging tasks in pediatrics.

Care is best provided in a patient-centered medical or health care home, which promotes holistic care of the child and family by partnering with a primary pediatric health care provider. The patient-centered health care home allows the provider to create a trusting partnership, to limit the effects of psychosocial adversity in childhood, and to improve the quality of care through empowering and supporting the family unit. ${ }^{3}$ Children, adolescents, and families benefit from motivational and anticipatory guidance in health promotion, and care provided over time by the same provider is associated with higher odds of receiving multiple preventive services, particularly for adolescents. ${ }^{4}$ The caring relationship established by the primary care provider reinforces positive parenting and provides behavioral consultation to the child, adolescent, and family at critical periods of development.

A caring relationship includes a patient-provider relationship without bias in regard to racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic difference. The attitudes and behaviors of health care providers has been identified among many factors contributing to health disparities. ${ }^{5}$ Implicit attitudes are those thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious awareness and are difficult to acknowledge and control. ${ }^{5}$ Implicit biases can influence behavior and clinical decision making without the provider's awareness. ${ }^{5,6}$ The perception of bias in clinical encounters undermines the caring relationship. Health care providers must make conscious efforts to overcome bias in their actions. Educating providers on racial, cultural, and socioeconomic biases, self-regulating behavior, and helping them to develop new mental habits can ensure the highest quality of care for all children and families. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Parent and child interaction}

One of the most important aspects of the health interview is observing and eliciting interactions between the parent and child or adolescent. Analyzing verbal responses and interactions during the encounter gives the health care provider an idea of how the parental relationship fosters child development and child selfesteem. It also gives the health care provider a window into the child's world. Interactions between the parent or caregiver, the family members, and the health care provider reveal family dynamics, family connectedness, family authority, and the approach to problem solving.

Nonverbal cues provide the most revealing picture of the child's demeanor and of the parent-child relationship and give the health care provider additional understanding of the context in which the child lives. Stop and observe these cues, and verbalize your concerns to the parent and child: "You look sad today. Can you tell me what that is about?" Ask yourself the following: Is the parent or caregiver disengaged with the child or infant during the encounter? Does the parent appear depressed or angry? Does the data from the health interview fit with the demeanor of the child during the encounter?

A child who is withdrawn, refuses to make eye contact, or is
consistently stressed when communicating with a parent is exhibiting signs of strain in her or his environment. This should alert the health care provider to communicate her or his concern to the family and provide support, counseling, and referral when indicated. Children often mirror the emotions of the adults around them. Families involved in conflict, who have experienced violence, or who are under stress often cannot see their own interactions clearly or the effect that their interactions have on the child. Pediatric health care providers should assess parenting behaviors by asking open-ended questions, such as "How do you handle negative child behaviors in the home?" or "How do you negotiate limiting screen time?" ${ }^{8}$ By fostering and supporting effective parenting in early childhood and providing problem-based counseling, the pediatric health care provider offers a service that is critical to the healthy psychosocial development of the child. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Children and the media}

A large part of the social and emotional development of children and adolescents is now occurring while they are using mobile devices. Children's virtual lives constitute a larger part of their social interactions daily. It is important for parents and caregivers to monitor children's social media, gaming, web, and cell phone activities for their potential impact on the child's emotional health. Population-based studies have shown associations between excessive screen time and cognitive, language, and social-emotional developmental delay. ${ }^{9}$ Infants with more handheld screen time are at increased risk for expressive speech delay. ${ }^{10}$ Excessive screen time in middle childhood and adolescence may involve bullying or peer-to-peer communications that pose potential risks to their privacy and safety.

Heavy parental use of mobile devices is associated with fewer verbal and nonverbal interactions between parents and children; therefore, reducing parental media use and enhancing parent-child interactions may be an important area of family behavioral change. ${ }^{9}$ The quality of parenting can modify the associations between media use and the child's speech and language development. Introducing high-quality programming and viewing programs
together with children is the recommended approach, along with limiting daily screen time. ${ }^{9}$ Temperament may also influence how much media children consume. Excessive media use is often more likely in young children with self-regulation problems, and these children will present greater challenges with parental limit setting. ${ }^{9}$

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has a Media and Children Communication Toolkit that provides parent with resources to help them manage screen time. Further information about the tool kit and a Family Media Use Plan in English and Spanish is available at https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/Pages/Media-and-Children.aspx

\section*{A child's perspective}

The view of the parent or caregiver and the view of the child may differ quite remarkably, and this difference can often affect health care decisions and treatment outcomes. Promoting opportunities for children and adolescents to contribute to health care decisions creates a child-centered approach to care that empowers and enables the child or adolescent within the family unit.

A model to facilitate children's participation in the health history provides a framework for communication that is attentive, sensitive, and values the child's perspective while capturing the shared responsibility of families, health care professionals, and health care organizations. ${ }^{11}$ The model proposes the following:
- Irrespective of age the child is listened to.
- The child is supported in expressing his or her views.
- The child's views are taken into account.
- The child is involved in the decision-making process.
- The child can share power and responsibility in decision making.
This framework provides a child-centered approach to health care while considering the needs and views of the family unit. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

It is essential that health care professionals attend to the increasing
diversity within a globally connected society. ${ }^{12}$ The increasing global immigration of populations will continue to pose challenges to health care professionals working with diverse populations. Providers will be required to assess the extent to which culture plays a role in health care decisions in the family and how it impacts treatment plans and adherence to these plans. An understanding of diversity must include not only knowledge of the culture but also respect and the tailoring of communications to embrace and value diversity. ${ }^{12}$

Cultural beliefs also affect care-seeking behavior and the delivery of clinical care by health care providers. Effective models of care incorporate sensitivity to cultural differences and enhance the protective factors of cultural practices within families. Studies demonstrate that differences within ethnic groups are as great as the cultural differences between groups; therefore no valid assumptions can be made in health care on the basis of physical appearance or surname. It is important for providers to acknowledge cultural differences, understand their own background and culture, and understand how that influences the care they deliver. They also must engage in self-assessment, acquire cultural knowledge and skills consistent with the practice setting, and value diversity within the health care team. Cultural humility involves a change in overall perspective around diversity and increasing awareness of power imbalances in the provider-patient relationship. ${ }^{12}$

Ideally, delivery of health care services should occur in the first language of the client. When this is not possible, a model framework for the encounter between the health care provider, child, and family should include the following:
- Recognizing language barriers and effectively using interpreters
- Exploring parental beliefs and their impact on the child
- Building on family strengths
- Recognizing and exploring the use of cultural beliefs and alternative therapies, how they influence child health, and the effect on clinical care
- Understanding, as the health care provider, how your personal values and beliefs influence care delivery and affect health outcomes
- Altering care practices to eliminate disparities in health care delivery related to race/ethnicity and economic status Cultural humility is an essential component of responsible health care services for multicultural populations. Embracing and valuing cultural diversity in the health care encounter will build honesty and trust in the caring relationship. Throughout this text, attention is given to how culture and ethnicity influence the assessment process in child health.

\section*{Effective communication}

Children are accepting of many different styles of interaction and will adapt to the health care provider who is at ease and competently engages the child. The skilled pediatric health care provider learns to make eye contact when a child is interested and to avoid eye contact when a child is fearful. Initially directing attention to the parent or caretaker allows the infant or young child time to adjust to the environment.

Children are comfortable when they know what to expect in an environment. Explaining clearly to the young child or adolescent exactly what you are going to assess during the physical exam will decrease anxiety and build trust. With each part of the exam, explain or "talk through" the assessment and the findings. Reassure the child or adolescent of your findings when normal and explain abnormal findings as appropriate for the child's age. Talking through every step of the encounter decreases anxiety in the child and adolescent. Even busy practitioners in time-pressured environments will find the child or adolescent to be a more willing participant when this talk-through format is added to the health care encounter.

\section*{Interviewing children}

Engaging children in the interview process can reveal their understanding of health, allow their participation in the health care encounter, and provide insight into their social-emotional world. Eye-level encounters are the most effective with young children and make the health care provider appear more approachable.

Many young children are effective communicators and can
respond to questions about their dietary habits, daily activities, school, or child care and relationships with school friends. It is important to engage children early in gathering health information. Health education can easily follow when this interview technique is used, and the child's responses create a dialogue that establishes a supportive provider-patient relationship.

Children 6 to 11 years old can be directly interviewed and can be participants in their health care. Health care providers can be role models for parents as they engage the child in the health interview and teach aspects of health and safety education. This approach teaches children from a young age to understand and care about their health and establishes the importance of building healthy habits for life.

Adolescents should always be interviewed separately from the parent. It is important to prepare the parent for this transition to a more independent role for the adolescent during the health care encounter. Allowing time to engage the adolescent independently will provide the best opening for discussion of personal or sensitive concerns that need to be voiced and for discussion of any conflicts in the home or school environment that are affecting the adolescent's well-being.

Use of the following clear communication techniques when interviewing will build a caring, trusting relationship with children/adolescents and their families.
- Question indirectly to encourage children and adolescents who are reluctant to discuss feelings. Engage the young child with, "I am going to tell you a story about a 5 -year-old who lost his favorite pet. How do you think he feels?" or the adolescent with, "Some 15-year-olds have tried vaping or smoke marijuana. Do you have any friends who smoke?"
- Pose scenarios to the child or adolescent. "What would you do if . . . ?" is appropriate for the young child, in contrast to, "How would you feel if . . . ?" which is appropriate for the older school-age child and adolescent.
- Begin with less threatening topics and move slowly to more sensitive topics for the child or adolescent. "Tell me how things are going at school this year," in contrast to, "Has anyone ever hurt you?" or directed to the adolescent, "Has anyone forced
you to have sex against your will?"
- State your expectations clearly. Say to the child, "I need you to be very quiet now so I can listen to . . . " Or to the adolescent, "To take care of you, I need you to tell me . . ."
- Do not offer a choice to the child or adolescent when in reality there is no choice.
- Use "I" when speaking to the child or adolescent. "I need to ask you this question because I want to help you . . ." in contrast to, "You must tell me what is going on." Avoid using the word you, which creates a defensive atmosphere when interviewing children or adolescents. This will provide positive role modeling for parents and also build the caring relationship between the health care provider, the child, and the parent.
- Ask the young child to draw a picture or draw his or her family. This captures the child's attention and establishes your interest in the child's abilities. Children often reveal feelings or communicate important family issues through their art. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{The importance of physical examination}

As health care providers increasingly rely on imaging and technology, the practice of diagnosing a health condition or disease from a physical examination has taken a back seat. The physical exam may be a ritual, but it is an important diagnostic tool when applied by skilled hands and can yield important diagnostic information and decrease the cost of health care. ${ }^{14}$ The physical exam helps providers to ask better questions of the diagnostic tests they order. ${ }^{15}$ Further, performing the physical examination provides important psychosocial benefits to the patient and can relieve stress and provide reassurance. Diagnostic evidence is important, but it is most valuable when decisions about diagnostic testing are made after completing a thorough health history and performing a thorough physical examination.

Besides the importance of focusing the diagnostic testing, what is also lost in eliminating the physical examination is the meaningful encounter between the patient and provider. ${ }^{15}$ Recent studies have indicated that the trusting relationship between the provider and the family is the most influential factor in assisting families in
making sound decisions about the care of their child. This providerpatient relationship is an important part of the therapeutic effect when working with families. It is crucial for pediatric health care providers to master the skills of history taking and physical examination in order to decrease or prevent medical errors and to increase the efficiency in ordering diagnostic testing and treating patients and families to decrease health care costs.

\section*{"Quiet to active" approach to the physical examination}
"Quiet to active" is an important mantra that should be adopted by the health care provider who will be caring for infants and young children. It refers to the approach of beginning with the parts of the physical examination that require the child to be quiet or silent in order for the health care provider to differentiate physical findings. The "quiet" parts of the physical examination in infants and young children include pulse and respiratory rate, auscultation of cardiac sounds and respiratory sounds, and auscultation and assessment of the abdomen. Respiratory and cardiac sounds are subtle, and accurate assessment requires a relatively cooperative child. Therefore, approaching these areas first during the physical examination produces the best results. Assessment of the genitalia and cranial nerves in the infant and young child can also be completed before the more invasive examination of the ears and mouth and before measuring height, weight, temperature, and blood pressure when indicated. Varying the sequence of the physical examination to fit the temperament and activity level of the child is an essential part of pediatrics, but omitting an aspect of the physical examination does not serve the health care needs of the child and risks a diagnosis made on the basis of an incomplete assessment.

\section*{Developmental approach to assessment}

\section*{Preterm infants and newborns}

In the clinical setting, it is important to begin the physical
assessment with the infant initially swaddled on the examining table or in the parent's arms to maintain body temperature. In this manner, auscultation of the cardiac and respiratory sounds can be accomplished before disturbing a sleeping infant or cooling the infant significantly. After the "quiet" parts of the examination are completed, transfer the infant to the examining table if in the parent's arms and begin a complete assessment with the infant wearing only a diaper. Observing the movements of the newborn for symmetry, strength, and coordination must be accomplished with the infant undressed. Assessment of overall appearance, skin color, breathing pattern, and degree of alertness or responsiveness should be noted. The health care provider should remain flexible in regard to the order of the exam throughout the encounter, because often the physical examination is performed between the eating and sleep cycles of the newborn.

\section*{Infants up to 6 months of age}

Until 6 months of age, infants are most effectively assessed on the examination table. It provides a firm surface to support the infant's head during the physical exam and also provides a stable surface for the examination techniques required during a complete physical assessment. A calm, gentle approach works well and avoids possibly frightening the infant. The "quiet" parts of the exam may be accomplished with the infant in the parent's arms, but other parts are difficult to accomplish effectively in that position. Remember never to leave the examining table while you are evaluating a young infant.

\section*{Children 6 months to 2 years of age}

The inspection of infants and young children necessitates using a completely different social approach than with any other age groups. In establishing a therapeutic relationship with an adult, etiquette requires immediate eye contact. With infants 7 to 9 months of age, a progressive approach to eye contact is required because of the developmental phenomenon of stranger anxiety. First, observe the infant or young child covertly while speaking with the parent or caretaker, so as to allow the child to adjust to your presence in the environment. If the young child is looking at
you and listening, then make glancing eye contact. If you are not rejected, then speak to the young child and, finally, reach out to touch the child. This approach will produce the best results in establishing the caring relationship. By offering puppets or small, washable toys to the child or using dolls to demonstrate parts of the physical examination, you will also often provide a calming effect at the beginning of the encounter.

Once the infant is able to sit stably, normally around 6 to 8 months of age, the examination can proceed with the child in the parent's lap, so as to decrease fear and stranger anxiety. Clothing should be removed gradually as the physical examination progresses from "quiet" to "active." Optimal examination of the abdomen and genitalia occurs with the child on the examining table, but in the fearful child, the exam may proceed with the child still in the parent's lap and with the examiner seated at the same level as the parent in a knee-to-knee position to create a surface for the child to lie on. With the young child's head and shoulder on the parent or caretaker's lap, the examiner proceeds with assessment of the abdomen, genitalia, and hips, thereby avoiding the need to place the child on the examination table and thus eliciting anxiety. When the infant is old enough to begin walking, it is important to observe the infant toddling in only a diaper to evaluate gait and musculoskeletal coordination.

\section*{Young children}

By 3 years of age, most children, though still apprehensive, are able to make eye contact and separate briefly from the parent. Observe their ability to be comforted, evaluate their response to the environment, their level of social interaction, and their relationships with parents or caretakers and siblings if present. How appropriate is their behavior in the setting? What is the quality and variety of their verbal responses? What is their level of activity and attention span? Young children generally respond best to a slow, even, steady voice. Give the young child time to warm to the situation before undressing him or her. The confident young child should be able to be examined sitting on the examining table. The "quiet" to "active" approach is advisable with this age group also; that is, beginning with the cardiac and respiratory examination and then
proceeding head to toe. Give children 3 to 5 years of age clear directions, allow them to respond, and recognize success. Young children particularly enjoy games, drawing, and role playing the physical examination with dolls or stuffed animals (Fig. 1.1). Modesty sets in during the preschool years, and health care providers need to be respectful and mindful of this developmental stage.

\end{figure}

\section*{Children 6 to 11 years of age}

Children 6 to 11 years old benefit most from the talk-through approach to the physical exam. They are interested in learning
about their bodies and are forming a body image of themselves. They are becoming more independent from their parents. Schoolage children gain the most from education about good health habits. Learning more about their bodies helps them connect their health with their health habits. Allow the child to participate in all aspects of the physical exam and respect his or her modesty. A "head-to-toe" assessment with the child on the examining table is most effective during middle childhood.

\section*{Adolescents}

The approach used with the adolescent during the health care encounter should be based on the child's developmental stage rather than his or her age. This is true for all children but particularly those in adolescence. Development during early, middle, and late adolescence proceeds unevenly and can vary widely among 11- to 18 -year-olds. Respect and confidentiality are essential components of developing a trusting relationship with the adolescent. Parental input is important during the health encounter, but adolescents should be interviewed and examined separately from the parent or peers. Avoid power struggles and give the adolescent control whenever possible. Involve adolescents in planning their health care and in establishing realistic goals and health habits. Chapter 4 further discusses evidence-based practice for the adolescent health visit.

\section*{Normal growth}

Growth is the most dynamic aspect of childhood. In the early years, height and weight measurements are key indicators of health. Abnormal progression of weight gain and/or height parameters is often the first indicator to the health care provider of abnormalities in growth and maturation patterns. Growth normally proceeds in a predictable pattern during childhood, from cephalocaudal (head to tail) and proximodistal (near to far). Plotting serial measurements regularly on a standardized growth curve for age and gender is a reliable method of monitoring growth and is an essential component of comprehensive well-child care. Gender- and agespecific standardized growth charts are available at https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm

Accurate assessment of growth begins in the newborn period by evaluating progress on the growth curve and continues throughout childhood and adolescence by evaluating growth in relation to age. An accurate assessment of gestational age in the newborn begins with the prenatal and birth history; it can help the provider anticipate conditions associated with preterm birth. Infants can be classified by gestational age as term infant, preterm infant, or postterm infant. See Chapter 6 for a review of newborn assessment
parameters. It is important to use the correct technique when gathering measurements of infants, children, and adolescents; doing this is one of the significant challenges in pediatrics. Table 2.1 presents average weight, height, and head circumference gains from infancy through middle childhood and adolescence growth patterns.

\section*{Measurement}

\section*{Head circumference}

Measurement of head circumference is a routine part of growth assessment in the first 2 years of life. An accurate measurement of the head is taken with the measuring tape placed around the head at the point of greatest circumference from the occipital protuberance above the base of the skull to the midforehead or point of greatest bossing of the frontal bone (Fig. 2.1). The head
circumference measurement is then plotted on the growth curve specific for sex and age at each well-child visit to determine if the growth pattern is normal. If the initial head measurement is plotted on the growth chart and indicates a concerning pattern of growth, it is important to remeasure the head to ensure accuracy of head size. A head circumference that plots 1 to 2 SD above height and weight on the growth curve or $>95$ th percentile or $<5$ th percentile for age should be evaluated. Microcephaly may be indicative of a small-forgestational (SGA) infant, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), or premature closure of the cranial sutures, termed craniosynostosis, which requires immediate referral. Macrocephaly, a large head in proportion to the body size, may indicate increased intracranial pressure or may be a familial variant. Consistent and accurate assessment of the head circumference is a critical part of the evaluation of normal growth and development in the first year of life.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 2.1 Accurate measurement of head circumference.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Chest circumference}

Chest circumference is smaller at birth than head circumference. Chest circumference is measured at the nipple line. The head circumference is normally 2 cm greater than the chest circumference in the first 6
months of life. Molding of the head in the term newborn may make it appear as though the measurements are equal. By 1 year of age, the chest circumference should closely equal the head circumference. With the progression of growth, the chest circumference becomes larger than the head circumference at about 2 years of age and continues to grow more rapidly during childhood. Chest measurements are not routinely taken unless an infant has abnormal physical findings at birth or demonstrates abnormal growth.

\section*{Height}

Height is the most stable measurement of growth and maturation in childhood. Linear growth is genetically predetermined, and therefore adult height generally occurs within a predictable range if accurate family history is available. Linear growth often occurs in spurts followed by long quiescent periods in which no growth occurs. Infants and young children may demonstrate an increase in appetite before a growth spurt, followed by an increased need for sleep.

For the infant or toddler, recumbent height is required for accurate measurement of linear growth. Place the infant supine on a flat surface or examination table equipped with a measuring device or length board (Box 2.1). Accurate measurement requires the infant's legs to be flat against the measuring device with the foot in the level position and head held erect against the measuring device (Fig. 2.2). Term newborns vary in height between 45 to 55 cm (18 and 22 inches) at birth, and height increases by approximately 2.54 cm ( 1 inch) per month over the first few months of life. Although infant measurement is often taken on the examination table by marking the position of the top of the head and the bottom of the foot on table paper and then determining length with a measuring tape, this method can result in inaccurate measurements. Always compare linear measurements with previous growth trends to assure accuracy. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{BOX 2.1}

\section*{Accurate Measurement of Height and Weight}

\section*{Height}

\section*{Birth-24 months}
- Infant's head must be held firm on flat surface against top of measuring device.
- Push knees, with legs extended, gently toward table. Bottom of foot is placed directly against footboard of measuring device.

\section*{24-36 months}
- Transitioning to a stadiometer at 24 months of age is most accurate to assess linear growth; use of a measuring device for fearful children from 24 to 30 months can be used with child
lying on a flat surface or examination table.

\section*{36 months through school age}
- Child should be standing erect with buttocks and back against stadiometer or wall.
- For accurate height measurement in the young child, maintain the head erect by placing slight upward pressure under the chin.

\section*{Weight}

\section*{Birth-12 months}
- Infant should be undressed and weighed consistently with clean, dry diaper or without diaper when placed on infant balance scale.
- Safety is of primary concern. Examiner cannot leave infant unattended at any time.

\section*{12-24 months}
- Before 2 years of age, weight is measured most accurately on infant balance scale with dry diaper. Exceptions: when child is very large or more cooperative/stable, a standing scale may be used.

\section*{2-6 years}
- At 2 years, when child is cooperative, weight can be measured accurately on a standing balance scale.
- Weight, until 3 years of age, should be measured with child in underwear consistently when using a standing balance scale.
- From 3 to 6 years, children can be weighed in clothing without shoes.

Term infants generally increase in length by $50 \%$ in the first year. The increase is primarily in truncal growth. Doubling the height at 2 years of age can give an estimate of adult height (see Table 2.1). After 2 years of age transition to standing height is most accurate and appropriate, however, recumbent height with a measuring device is often easier to obtain in the first part of the second year if the child is fearful. The increase in height averages 3 inches ( 7.5 cm ) over the second and third years. Measurement is recorded without
shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm or 0.25 inches. Standing height should be taken using a wall-mounted or portable stadiometer for accuracy. Accurate measurement requires a cooperative child to stand erect with head level, feet flat, and heels against the measuring surface (Fig. 2.3). From the end of the third year until the onset of puberty, the increase in height averages 3 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches) per year. In adolescence, girls' height potential is generally realized by 16 years of age, and boys' growth potential continues until 18 years of age. Linear growth ceases when the maturation of the skeleton is complete (see Chapters 16 and 18 for discussions of growth and sexual maturity rating).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-045.jpg?height=1315&width=903&top_left_y=1076&top_left_x=571}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 2.3 Measuring standing height.}
\end{figure}

In familial short stature, growth follows a curve below the normal growth curves, and both parents and infant are small. Familial short
stature is often not recognized as the most likely assessment for slow linear growth when parents are anxious about their child's height. Poor nutritional status is less often the cause of short stature. Linear growth deficiency (stunting) or short stature may be a key indicator in children with chronic conditions including cardiac and renal disease, fetal alcohol syndrome, methadone exposure, metabolic abnormalities, growth hormone deficiency, or chromosomal abnormalities. ${ }^{1,2}$

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Height at 2 years of age is approximately $50 \%$ of adult height. To estimate adult height, double the height at 2 years of age. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Arm span}

An adolescent male or female of tall stature with a disproportionate arm length should be evaluated for arm span measurement. This should be taken with the arms outstretched. Measure the distance from the tip of the middle finger across the crest of the shoulders to the other middle fingertip. The arm span should equal the height. In Marfan syndrome, the arm span exceeds the height and is associated with a disproportionate appearance.

\section*{Weight}

The average birth weight in term infants is 3175 to 3400 g ( 7 to 7.5 $\mathrm{lb})$. The average range of weight in a healthy term newborn is from 2500 to 4000 g ( 5 lb 8 oz to 8 lb 13 oz ). Infants may lose up to $10 \%$ of their birth weight in the first week of life and normally regain it by the end of the second week. ${ }^{1}$ Poor weight gain in early infancy is indicative of failure to thrive and may be caused by poor feeding patterns, malnutrition, neglect, cardiac or renal disease, chronic infection, or chromosomal and congenital anomalies.

Infants can be accurately weighed lying on an infant balance scale while wearing a dry diaper. Infants should be weighed in the sitting position only with extreme caution and only after they are able to sit without support. Weight is recorded to the nearest 0.5 oz or 0.01 kg ( 10 g ). After 2 years of age, standing weight should be recorded
to the nearest 0.25 lb or 0.1 kg ( 100 g ; see Box 2.1). If a young child is very fearful or irritable, parent and child can be weighed together on standing scale; then parental weight is subtracted from total weight to obtain an estimate of child's weight. For children with special health care needs or disabilities, accommodations for wheelchair scales or special purpose scales should be made available in the clinical setting.

\section*{Adiposity}

Adipose tissue is a unique form of connective tissue with cells that maintain a large intracellular space. These adipocytes, or fat cells, store large quantities of triglycerides and are a repository of energy in the body. More than $90 \%$ of the body's energy is stored in the adipose tissue, and lipids are the main source for stored fuel in the body. ${ }^{2}$ Although adipocytes do not reproduce, they do have a long life span, and infants born with a large numbers of fat cells are at risk for obesity in childhood. In a typical pattern of growth and development in children, adipose tissue typically declines in later infancy, with the lowest point in early childhood; it then rebounds in middle childhood through the adolescent growth spurt, as shown by the upturn in the age- and sex-specific child growth charts and the body mass index (BMI) curve. This upturn in the growth curve is known as adiposity rebound and is normally expected at about 5 to 7 years of age. ${ }^{3}$ Large weight gains in infancy and early childhood alter the normal pattern of growth and adiposity rebound. Thus, early adiposity rebound is associated with increased depositions of fat in middle childhood, and risks associated with early adiposity rebound persist at least until early adulthood. ${ }^{3}$ Gestation, early infancy, middle childhood, and adolescence are critical periods for the development of adiposity; the focus for pediatric health care providers is to closely monitor the pattern of the growth curve and BMI to help parents and families maintain healthy weights throughout childhood. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Body mass index for age in children}

BMI provides a guideline for health care providers to determine the healthy weight of a child beginning at 2 years of age based on height. The formula for determining BMI is weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared (BMI $=$ weight $[\mathrm{kg}] /$ height squared $\left[\mathrm{m}^{2}\right]$ ). Calculating and plotting BMI during the routine health visit and discussing this information with parents and families is an important part of providing comprehensive well-child care. BMI is used to determine whether a child or adolescent is underweight, overweight, or obese, and interpretation of the BMI growth chart in children depends on age and sex. The BMI growth curve is easier to use than the standard weight-for-height on the age-and-sex growth charts to point out weight trends to parents. Children with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex or a BMI greater than or equal to 30 are considered obese, and children with a BMI between the 85th and 94th percentiles for age and sex are considered overweight (Table 2.2). Electronic health records (EHRs) include growth charts and calculate and plot BMIs, making it easily available to review with parents and families. There are no BMI parameters for children under 2 years of age. However, children younger than 2 years of age who have a weight-to-height ratio on the standard growth curve of $\geq 95$ th percentile for age and sex are considered overweight.

\begin{table}

\end{table}

BMI, Body mass index.
Data from Barlow SE: Expert Committee: Expert Committee recommendations regarding the prevention, assessment, and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, Pediatrics 120(Supp14):S164-S192, 2007.

The overall prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents between 2 and 19 years old in the United States is $17 \%$. For children 6 to 11 years of age, the overall prevalence of obesity is $17.5 \%$; in adolescence, it is $20.5 \%$. There are significant differences by race and ethnicity for the prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly among non-Hispanic black children (19.5\%) and Hispanic ( $21.9 \%$ ) children 2 to 19 years of age. ${ }^{4}$ Overweight is
defined as a BMI $\geq 85 \%$ and obesity is defined as a BMI $\geq 95 \%$ for age-sex-specific growth charts. ${ }^{4}{ }^{4}$

The prevalence of childhood overweight has remained stable over the past decade, and presents a serious pediatric health concern. Increased BMI in childhood is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease in adulthood and the early onset of type 2 diabetes. ${ }^{5}{ }^{-7}$ Obesity has its origins in early life, and routine serial measurements of height and weight in the growing infant and child are most important in evaluating trends in weight gain early and communicating this information to parents and families. Rapid weight gain in early infancy, early adiposity rebound in childhood, and early pubertal development all influence the risk of becoming overweight and have been implicated in the development of childhood obesity.

The categories of BMI percentiles may not adequately define risk of obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia, in children. ${ }^{8}$ Overweight children have different levels of body fatness and degrees of risk factors. Obese children are taller than children of average weight, often 1 standard deviation above their counterparts for age. Abdominal obesity is identified as an important factor in the adverse health effects of childhood obesity. A high ratio of waist circumference to height has been associated with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes in adolescents. Among overweight children, a high ratio of waist circumference to height is more strongly associated with adverse risk factors than a high BMI for age or skinfold thickness. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations in height and weight}

Asian children may be at risk for comorbidities due to obesity at lower BMI thresholds than other ethnic groups. The risk of comorbidity is modified by actual body composition, family history of comorbidity, birth weight, and other variables, including race/ethnicity. ${ }^{9}$ A recent study of South Asian children has shown BMI cutoffs at $\geq 95 \%$ for obesity and $\geq 85 \%$ for overweight on the age-and-sex growth charts may not approximate risks, indicating a need for additional anthropometric measures and/or ethnic-specific
criteria. Waist circumference-to-height ratio has been identified as a more accurate predictor for ethnic-specific BMI identifiers for overweight and obesity, but further research is needed. ${ }^{9}$ South Asian and East Asian children have a higher percentage of body fat than other racial and ethnic groups of the same age, sex, and BMI and may experience greater obesity-related comorbidities at lower BMI cutoffs on the age-and-sex growth charts. ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Developmental considerations}

\section*{Temperament}

Assessment of temperament is a key part of comprehensive health assessment in infants, children, and adolescents. Temperament is the inborn tendency to react to one's environment in certain ways and is thought to be generally constant and at least partially genetically determined. The personality of an individual child reflects the interaction between the child's temperament and environment. Temperament can be assessed by report, clinical observation, or by a formal assessment tool. The term goodness of fit describes the concept of how well the child's temperament meets the expectations of his or her parents and caregivers. Goodness of fit promotes healthy development in the family unit through adaptation to the infant's personality, and it has a critical influence on a child's emotional well-being and behavior. Table 2.3 identifies the nine characteristics of temperament. Certain temperamental characteristics may be associated with resiliency in children, whereas other characteristics may signal emotional difficulties. Characteristics of frustration tolerance and intensity may be specific indicators of emotional dysregulation in some children and may indicate an underlying dysfunction in affective processes that significantly increases risk for mood disorders in later childhood or in adulthood. ${ }^{11}$ An easy temperament with strong characteristics of regularity and adaptability acts as a protective factor for socialemotional development and could be related to resilience in children living in an adverse social environment. ${ }^{12}$

\section*{TABLE 2.3}

\section*{Temperament Characteristics}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Characteristics & Description \\
\hline Activity & Amount of motor activity and proportion of active to inactive periods \\
\hline Intensity & Amount of emotional energy released with responses \\
\hline Sensitivity & Amount of sensory stimuli required to produce response \\
\hline Approach/withdrawal & Nature of initial response to new stimuli \\
\hline Adaptability & Ease of accepting new situation after initial response \\
\hline Frustration tolerance & Length of time activity is pursued \\
\hline Mood & Amount of pleasant versus unpleasant behavior child exhibits \\
\hline Distractibility & Effectiveness of extraneous stimuli in altering direction of ongoing behavior \\
\hline Regularity & Predictability of physiological functions such as hunger, sleep, elimination \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

An understanding of temperamental characteristics removes judgment and blame and helps parents to recognize that all rules do not work equally well with all children. Setting limits and time out is more difficult with some children, and some children are more difficult to discipline and require more parental ingenuity. Temperament theory objectifies these differences. A comprehensive approach to assessing development includes assessing and understanding temperament and sharing this information with parents and caregivers. A temperament assessment tool for parents may be accessed online at http://www.preventiveoz.org.

\section*{Vital signs}

\section*{Temperature}

Measurement of temperature continues to be a dynamic process in the infant and young child. Much discussion has occurred on the accuracy of temperature measurement and the ideal instrument to use. Currently there is a range of methods for measuring temperature in the infant and young child.

Axillary temperature measurement is the recommended method for the healthy newborn. Place the electronic digital thermometer under the arm at the base of the axilla for 3 to 5 minutes and hold the arm firmly against the side of the body with swaddling.

Research has shown parental report of axillary temperature measurement can be considered reliable and has shown a high correlation with measurement by trained, experienced staff. ${ }^{13}$

Rectal temperature remains the standard and most reliable method for detecting core body temperature in infants and young children. Rectal temperature aligns more closely with the core body temperature than axillary, temporal, or tympanic measurements. In early infancy to 8 to 9 months of age, rectal temperature is most accurately measured with the infant placed in the supine position on the examining table with knees flexed toward the abdomen. The infant can see the practitioner and be secured more easily in this position. Proper positioning prevents injury. In males, stimulation often elicits urination, so the penis should be covered. A child from 9 months to 2 years of age can be placed in the parent's arms or laid supine on the parent's lap. Insert the lubricated tip of thermometer into the anal opening of the rectum a distance of 0.5 to 1 inch. Rectal measurement of temperature remains the recommended standard in clinical practice for infants under 1 month of age to determine fever and when considering further diagnostic evaluation. Oral measurement is the preferred method for cooperative children over 4 years of age. Oral temperature is typically $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(1.0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ lower than rectal temperature. Oral temperature readings can vary by thermometer position and in children with mouth breathing, tachypnea, or respiratory distress.

Tympanic membrane thermometer readings can vary depending on proper positioning in the ear, impacted cerumen, and/or otitis media. Recent studies comparing tympanic membrane and rectal temperatures in children have had contradictory results; it has been concluded that tympanic membrane thermometry shows insufficient agreement with established methods of core body temperature measurement to be used in infants and children where detection of fever has clinical implications and requires diagnostic workup. ${ }^{14,15}$

Noncontact infrared thermometers are often used by parents and in some clinical settings as a noninvasive method for measuring temperature for infants and young children. Temperature is measured by pointing the infrared beams of light approximately 3 cm from the forehead or naval. Research comparing the accuracy of
the noncontact infrared thermometers with rectal temperatures has been inconclusive. Infrared thermometry has tended to overestimate the temperature of afebrile children and underestimate the temperature of febrile patients ( $P<.01$ ). ${ }^{16}$ Temperatures measured with noncontact infrared thermometers in comparison with rectal temperatures varied significantly and did not reliably predict fever in infants and young children. ${ }^{17}$ The digital thermometer provides the best agreement with the traditional mercury-in-glass thermometer in detecting fever in infants and young children. ${ }^{18}$

For smart phones, apps are now available for measuring temperature in the pediatric population. An external sensor is required and the accuracy of the temperature depends on the quality of the sensor. Currently there is no standardization and no studies are available on the specificity and sensitivity of the external sensors.

\section*{Pulse}

Although pulse is most often monitored electronically, pulses should be assessed for the quality of rate, rhythm, and volume or strength, and it is important to detect any differences in pulse between the upper and lower extremities. Children under 2 years of age require apical pulse (AP) measurements. Readings should be taken when the child is quiet. AP measurements are taken with the stethoscope placed over the heart below the nipple at the apex. For children over 2 years of age, the radial pulse is a satisfactory measurement. In infants and young children, the pulse should be counted for a full minute to account for irregularities in rhythm. Fig. 2.4 illustrates the location of the pulses. The radial and femoral pulses should be evaluated and compared for strength and quality. Detecting the femoral pulse in newborn and young infants requires focus and concentration by the examiner. The femoral pulse is located in the midinguinal area over the head of the femur. In children who are overweight or obese, locating the femoral pulse is challenging and requires palpating through adipose tissue to determine the presence and strength of the pulse. An absent or weak pulse in the lower extremities compared with the upper extremities is diagnostic of coarctation of the aorta. Table 2.4 presents
the grading of pulses used to evaluate strength and quality.

\hline 3+ & Palpable, normal strength \\
\hline 4+ & Strong, bounding, not affected by pressure \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Respirations}

Respirations should be assessed for rate and pattern. They should be taken when the child is quiet to accurately assess the rate and quality of breathing. In infants and young children, observe the abdominal movements when you are evaluating respiratory rate. An infant's breathing is primarily diaphragmatic. Also evaluate the use of any accessory muscles in the upper chest or any difficulty breathing. Respirations should be assessed for a full minute, because the typical respiratory rate is irregular in the newborn and very young infant. Table 2.5 shows the normal range of vital signs in children.

\section*{Oxygen saturation}

Measurement of oxygen saturation has become a standard in most clinical settings for respiratory assessment in the pediatric patient. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of determining oxygen saturation ( $\mathrm{Spo}_{2}$ ) and should be part of the criteria for evaluating any infant for respiratory distress or cardiovascular defects or any child presenting with wheezing, respiratory distress, respiratory compromise, or for preoperative evaluation. A normal $\mathrm{Spo}_{2}$ of $95 \%$ to $96 \%$ is adequate, and $97 \%$ is generally considered to be normal. A $\mathrm{Spo}_{2} \leq 92 \%$ is considered hypoxemic. $\mathrm{Spo}_{2}$ assists the practitioner in clinical decision making when the need for prolonged observation or hospital admission is being determined. Pulse oximetry alone may detect cyanotic heart disease in the asymptomatic newborn, preventing morbidity and delayed diagnosis of cardiac disease. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Blood pressure}

Blood pressure should be assessed at all routine well-child visits beginning at 3 years of age. In infants and children younger than 3 years of age, blood pressure should be evaluated in children who are at risk for cardiac defects or who experience trauma or have chronic conditions. The size of the blood pressure cuff is critical to obtaining an accurate measurement. The blood pressure cuff should cover about two thirds of the upper arm and should encircle the arm once. A cuff that is too large will result in a low blood pressure reading. If the cuff is too small, the blood pressure reading may be too high. For obese children and adolescents, an extra-large adult cuff may be needed to obtain an accurate measurement. Blood pressure readings can increase in children who are crying and in children and adolescents who are feeling anxious. Table 2.5 reviews the normal range of blood pressure at different ages. For healthy children and adolescents with a blood pressure reading at or above the 90th percentile for age, three independent readings should be taken to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.

\section*{Pain}

An accurate assessment of pain response in infants and young children requires strategies specific to the developmental level of the child. The use of the pain scale in children 3 years of age and
older has greatly improved the ability of the health care practitioner to accurately assess and treat pain in the pediatric patient. Fig. 2.5 presents the FACES pain rating scale used across most pediatric clinical settings. ${ }^{19}$ For nonverbal children, cognitively impaired children, or children with special health care needs, the revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Scale has been validated for evaluating postoperative pain in the acute care setting and for pain secondary to trauma or other chronic conditions. ${ }^{20}$ Zero to two points is assigned to each of the five categories on the scale, and total score from 0 to 10 reflects no pain to severe pain. Table 2.6 presents the FLACC Behavioral Scale.

Ask the child to choose the face that best describes its own pain, and record the appropriate number. Note: Use of these instructions is recommended. A rating scale can be used with children 3 years of age and older.
Original instructions: Explain to the child that each face is for a person who feels happy because he has no pain (hurt) or sad because he has some or a lot of pain. FACE 0 is very happy because he doesn't hurt at all. FACE 1 hurts just a little bit. FACE 2 hurts a little more. FACE 3 hurts even more. FACE 4 hurts a whole lot. FACE 5 hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying to feel this bad. Ask the child to choose face that best describes how much hurt he has. Record the number under the chosen face on the pain assessment record. Source: (From Hockenberry MJ, Wilson D: Wong's Nursing of Infants and Children, ed 9, St. Louis, 2011, Copyrighted by Mosby.

\section*{Physical assessment techniques}

\section*{Inspection}

Inspection is about looking. Inspection is a skill acquired by developing detailed and meticulous observation of children and learning to see the whole as well as the parts. It involves not only the sense of sight but also the senses of hearing and smell. Inspection requires good room lighting and complete visibility of the body part to be examined to accurately assess symmetry, shape, color, and odor. It is an essential skill for the pediatric health care provider, particularly when interacting with the nonverbal child, the young pediatric patient, or a child who is ill.

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation is about touching and feeling, a skill used to detect temperature, vibration, position, and mobility of body organs and glands. Palpation appreciates shape, pulsation, texture, and hydration of the skin and tenderness. It detects masses and differences in size and shape of glands, organs, muscles, and bones in all parts of the body. The fingertips are most sensitive to tactile differences, the backs of the fingers are most sensitive to temperature, and flattened fingers and palm on the chest detect
vibrations. The examiner's hands should move smoothly over the body without hesitation, first using light palpation, then followed by deep, firm pressure with palpation. It is important to know the distinction between palpation and massage. Massage incorporates rubbing, in contrast to the technique of palpation, which is the movement of the fingers over an area using light to firm pressure for the purpose of identifying size, location, mobility, sensitivity, and temperature of lymph nodes, muscles, tissues, and body organs.

\section*{Percussion}

Percussion is a helpful skill for mapping out the borders of the organs or sternum and for determining the presence of solid tumors. Percussion requires using the examiner's fingers and hands to produce sounds on the area of the body being examined. The density of the body parts is determined by the sounds emitted when the examiner's finger strikes the middle finger of the opposite hand. The fingers produce sounds ranging from the least dense sound, tympany or resonance, as heard over the stomach or intestines, to the most dense sound, dullness or flatness, produced by striking over bone. This technique can be useful when examining the abdomen to detect the size of an organ prior to diagnostic imaging.

\section*{Auscultation}

Auscultation is listening to body sounds transmitted through the stethoscope. With infants and small children, low-pitched cardiac sounds are heard best with the bell-shaped side of the stethoscope, and high-pitched lung and bowel sounds are best heard with the diaphragm, or flat portion, of the stethoscope. The bell shape is effective in isolating cardiac sounds from stomach sounds in the young infant. For best results during the physical examination of a child, it is essential to match the size of the stethoscope head to the size of the child proportionately, or the pressure on the head of a dynamic stethoscope. In listening to the lungs and heart, it is important to develop the skill to screen out adventitious sounds that occur in infants and children. The close proximity of the organs requires the examiner to screen out stomach and abdominal sounds
in listening to the heart and the respirations in the lung.
The techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation are among the most important tools available to the examiner for accurate diagnosis. When applied correctly, they can limit unnecessary and expensive diagnostic testing for the child or adolescent and family.

Developmental surveillance and screening

Children achieve developmental milestones at their own pace, yet the sequence of developmental milestones is expected to be incremental and stepwise for all children. Screening children for developmental delay and emotional and behavioral difficulties is one of the most important components of preventive health care. Screening is an important step toward referral for evaluation and diagnosis of developmental delay and emotional and behavioral problems, and health care professionals are mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Title V of the Social Security Act to provide screening, early identification, and intervention for children with developmental delays and disabilities. ${ }^{1}$ Early treatment of developmental delays leads to improved outcomes, enhanced function, and reduced prevalence of secondary behavior problems later in life. ${ }^{2}$

In the United States, $12 \%$ to $16 \%$ of children have at least one developmental delay. ${ }^{3}$ The most common childhood developmental and behavioral problems are speech and language delay, hearing loss, emotional and behavioral concerns, learning disabilities, and delay in other developmental milestones. ${ }^{4}$ Pediatric primary care
providers can identify young children with these developmental and mental health problems early in life by providing surveillance at every well-child visit and implementing standardized developmental screening tests at the 9 -month, 18 -month, and 24 - or 30-month well-child visit. ${ }^{1}$ Timely identification of developmental and behavioral problems and prompt referral for early intervention can resolve or lessen the impact of a delay or disability on the functioning of the child and family, and promote their growth and readiness to progress toward the next developmental milestone. Effective interventions in early childhood increase a child's readiness for school entry and for optimum learning in the classroom.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

The stability and quality of the child's home and child care environment vastly impact the development of a child's full potential.

\section*{Developmental surveillance in early childhood}

The first component of a developmental screening program is developmental surveillance. Developmental surveillance includes eliciting parental concerns, collecting and documenting a developmental history, and identifying risks and protective factors for developmental delay or emotional and behavioral problems in the child's environment. Observations of the child's development include speech and language skills, social skills, activity level, communication, and parent/child relationship. It is important to identify strengths in the parent and caregiver that are protective factors in the child's developmental progress. The primary care provider must include input from parents, other caregivers, and teachers in child care and school settings to make informed observations of the child's developmental progress and accurately document the ongoing developmental surveillance in the health record.

Surveillance for vision and hearing development includes asking parents about any concerns they may have about their infant or young child's developing vision or response to voices or sounds in the environment. Observable normal visual behaviors include fixing on and following near faces at 6 to 8 weeks of age; visually tracking at 4 months of age, including seeing the parent or caregiver at a distance of 5 feet; and visually fixating at 5 months on a 1 -inch cube or small object at a distance of 12 inches. ${ }^{5}$ Pediatric primary care providers should ask parents about their child's ability to hear quiet sounds and turn and locate voices. All children referred for behavioral concerns should have formal hearing and vision screening tests conducted to rule out deficits or delays. Reviews of vision and hearing screening practices are in Chapters 12 and 13, respectively.

Speech refers to the mechanics of oral communication, and language encompasses the understanding, processing, and production of communication during the early developmental years and throughout childhood. Surveillance of speech and language skills in childhood includes eliciting any parental concerns about communication problems, dysfluency, stuttering, articulation disorders, or an unusual voice quality. ${ }^{6}$ Approximately $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of 2 year olds have language delays, and $4 \%$ to $5 \%$ remain language delayed after 3 years of age. ${ }^{7}$ Early referral and intervention is the key to optimizing speech and language development in early childhood. Pediatric primary care providers need to conduct ongoing surveillance at each health encounter and screen children whose parents have concerns about their speech and language development. Table 3.1 presents normal developmental speech and language patterns in infancy and early childhood.

The acquisition of language is a critical developmental skill, and pediatric primary care providers can promote literacy as a component of developmental surveillance for language deficits. The Reach Out and Read (ROR) program, available at www.reachoutandread.org, was designed to target children in early childhood at risk for poor early school performance and provide families with books and anticipatory guidance about the importance of reading to infants and young children. Several studies have shown that ROR can significantly enhance a young child's early literacy environment by increasing the frequency of parent-child book-sharing activities and facilitating language development. ${ }^{8,}{ }^{9}$ Pediatric health care settings interested in establishing a pediatric literacy promotion program may contact the national ROR program.

The clinical assessment or surveillance of development without using standardized screening testing identifies less than $50 \%$ of children with developmental delays. ${ }^{10}$ The ultimate goal of
developmental surveillance and screening is to improve outcomes for children with developmental delays and disorders. Table 3.2 presents normal developmental milestones of communication, and fine and gross motor, problem-solving, and social/emotional skills from 6 months to 5 years of age in accordance with Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). ${ }^{11}$ Guidelines for surveillance and screening during primary care visits are available at the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision for Infants, Children and Adolescents, available at http://brightfutures.aap.org. ${ }^{12}$

Surveillance also includes "close and considerable observation," where the primary care provider compares a child's growth or development from one point to another. While a 3 -year-old who has been in speech therapy may not meet all of the speech milestones expected of a 3 -year-old, it would be critical to note the progress they have made since the last screen or assessment.

\section*{INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION}

Close collaboration with speech therapists, occupational therapists, behavioral health and other developmental specialists provides optimum team based care for children with developmental delay.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Children who participate in Reach Out and Read demonstrate increased receptive and expressive language in preschool and are less likely to suffer school failure. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Parental concern regarding delays in fine and gross motor skills, language skills, and social/emotional development are often highly accurate and should always warrant further evaluation.

\section*{Developmental screening}

Over $25 \%$ of children under 5 years of age are at risk for developmental, emotional, and behavioral problems, but fewer than one in five children receive the recommended developmental
screening. ${ }^{14}$ Many parents with children under 6 years of age are concerned about their child's development or behavior, yet only $20 \%$ of parents report that developmental screening was conducted at their child's primary care visits prior to entering kindergarten. ${ }^{15}$ The AAP's recommendations for developmental testing are based on evidence that indicates standardized screening tools capture up to $80 \%$ of children with early developmental delays. ${ }^{1}$

Developmental screening focuses on positive development and also identifies children with delays or problems early in life. It assists the health care provider with anticipatory guidance for parents and caregivers by identifying the developmental milestones expected and met at each age as the infant grows and develops (Fig. 3.1). Identification of a deficit or delay on a developmental screening test does not provide a diagnosis, but it identifies children who need further evaluation, referral, and intervention services. Table 3.3 presents standardized developmental screening tools used in infancy and early childhood, and Table 3.4 presents standardized tools used to screen for emotional, behavioral, and mental health problems during early and middle childhood and adolescence.

\section*{Standardized developmental screening tools}

\section*{Psychometrics}

The psychometric properties of developmental screening tools are important considerations when deciding which screening tool to use in the pediatric health care setting. ${ }^{16}$ Psychometric properties include test-retest reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity. ${ }^{17}$ Test-retest reliability is the ability of a measure to produce consistent results. The validity of a screening test is its ability to discriminate between a child with a problem and a child without such a problem. Sensitivity is the accuracy of the test in identifying a problem, and specificity is the accuracy of the test in identifying individuals who do not have a problem. Tables 3.3 and 3.4 list the
sensitivity and specificity, developmental domains, number of items, available languages, and time to complete and score the developmental, behavioral, and emotional screening tools. Other important considerations are the costs to administer the screening tools.

The AAP endorses the use of standardized, reliable ( $\geq 80 \%$ ), wellvalidated, and accurate screening tools with a sensitivity and specificity of $\geq 70 \%$ for the early identification of developmental and behavioral problems. ${ }^{16}$ Screening tools should be directly administered by providers or trained staff, or be parent-report questionnaires. Use of developmental screening tests with lower sensitivity and specificity may identify children without significant delays and may result in unnecessary referrals. Emotional and behavioral screening tests with low specificity may identify mental health symptoms that are below the level of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis (DSM-V). ${ }^{18}$ However, these children may benefit from early interventions in the home or improved developmental learning opportunities to address developing behavioral problems. Continual tracking of a child's developmental status and follow-up on referrals is critical to optimize child health outcomes.

\section*{Developmental screening tools for early and middle childhood}

The Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) ${ }^{19}$ and the ASQ-3 ${ }^{11}$ use parental report for identifying children with possible developmental delays. Parent-completed developmental screening tools are found to be efficient, feasible, and cost-effective compared with provider-completed screening tools.

The Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS) is a tool designed specifically for high-risk infants and assesses cognitive, social, language, and gross and fine motor skills (Fig. 3.2). It has a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying delays in premature and low birth weight infants and is reliable as an indicator for referral for developmental delays in preterm infants at 6 months that remain delayed at 12 months of age; thus it is reliable as an indicator for referral. ${ }^{20}$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-072.jpg?height=686&width=932&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=559}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 3.2 Scribbling to assess handedness.}
\end{figure}

The Denver-II Developmental Screening Test (DDST-II) was a widely used developmental screening tool by primary care providers, but it was found to have lower sensitivity ( $56 \%$ to $83 \%$ ) and specificity ( $43 \%$ to $80 \%$ ) than other developmental screening tools, which may result in overreferral of those infants and children who do not have a developmental delay and underidentification of those children who have developmental deficits. It is no longer recommended for routine use for developmental surveillance.

A new comprehensive parent-completed screening tool is the Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children (SWYC) that is composed of several scales: the Developmental Milestones, Baby Pediatric Symptom Checklist (BPSC), Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC), Parent's Observations of Social Interactions (POSI), and Family Risk Factors. Together these scales cover cognitive, motor, language, social-emotional-behavioral functioning, autism, and family risk factors. The tools are available at https://www.floatinghospital.org/The-Survey-of-Wellbeing-of-Young-Children/Overview.aspx.

\section*{Mental health, emotional and behavioral screening tools for early and middle childhood and adolescence}

The Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Social/Emotional (ASQ-SE) is a parent-completed questionnaire designed to monitor the social and emotional development of infants and young children and to screen for adaptive behaviors, communication, autonomy, affect, and
interaction with adults. The Brief Infant/Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) is a parent-report screening tool of children's social emotional and behavioral development. ${ }^{21}$ The ASQ-SE and BITSEA both identify children with developing social and emotional disorders who may benefit from a more in-depth evaluation.

The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers-Revised With Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F) is a two-stage screening tool to identify children at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ${ }^{22}$ The initial stage is a parent-completed 20-item pass/fail survey followed by a second stage for positive screens with a 5 - to 10 -minute interview by a professional. It has a high sensitivity and specificity for identifying children with possible ASD, and assists primary care providers in assessing the need for referral for early intervention services.

The M-CHAT parent-completed survey includes the following items: Does your child play pretend or make-believe? Does your child point with one finger to ask for something or to get help? Does your child like climbing on things? Does your child respond when you call his or her name? Does your child try to copy what you do? Does your child get upset by everyday noises? If a child fails three items, the follow-up questions are administered. If a child has more than seven fails, referral for a diagnostic evaluation is indicated. Children at risk for other developmental disorders or delays may be identified with the M-CHAT screening tool.

The Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) is the most commonly used mental health screening tool for children in middle childhood and adolescents in pediatric primary care practices. ${ }^{23}$ The PSC has 35 items and screens children and adolescents from 4 years to 16 years of age. Beginning at 11 years of age, the PSC can be completed by the child or adolescent.

Approximately one in every four to five adolescents have one or more mental, emotional, and behavioral problem, including depression, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. ${ }^{24}$ Routine screening for mental health and emotional and behavioral disorders is a primary focus for primary care providers caring for adolescents. The Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI 2) is used to screen children and adolescents from 7 years to 17 years of age for
cognitive, affective, and behavioral signs of depression. It is administered as a parental report, teacher report, and/or self-report screening tool.

Comprehensive health history screening for anxiety and depression in adolescence is presented in Chapter 4.

\section*{Developmental and behavioral health conditions}

\section*{Developmental risk factors}

Certain biological, family, and social risk factors increase the likelihood that a child will exhibit developmental delays. Biological risk factors that influence a child's development include prenatal conditions, such as maternal substance abuse, infection, chronic health conditions, medications, and severe toxemia. Neonatal risk factors include a history of prematurity, gestational age less than 33 weeks, birth weight less than 1500 g , Apgar score less than 3 at 5 minutes, neonatal infections (sepsis or meningitis), and severe hyperbilirubinemia. Social risk factors include a family history of maternal depression, low maternal education, poverty, lack of maternal bonding, child abuse and neglect, and lack of developmentally appropriate opportunities for learning. Environmental risk factors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, high lead levels, exposure to environmental toxins, and limited access to health care, may also contribute to developmental delays. ${ }^{5}$

Children at risk require especially diligent developmental surveillance, including implementing the recommended use of developmental screening tools in the first 3 years of life, genetic testing, and prompt referral for early intervention services, including a pediatric neurologist or pediatric developmental specialist when indicated. Table 3.5 presents developmental red flags in infancy and early childhood that indicate developmental deficit and the need for referral and early intervention. Box 3-1 provides further resources for the pediatric primary care provider.

\section*{Autism spectrum disorders}

ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, repetitive patterns of speech or motor behavior,
and delays in communication and language skills and social and behavioral development that limit and impair everyday functioning. ${ }^{25}$ Some of the concerning behaviors identified by 18 months of age are not smiling in response to your face, not responding to his/her name, not using the index finger to point to objects, not taking an interest in other children, not playing peek-aboo or hide-and-seek, making unusual finger movements near his/her face, and wandering or staring without a purpose.

ASDs include autism; pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS); and Asperger syndrome. The onset of ASD is before 3 years of age. ASD is at least partially genetically linked, though no single gene abnormality or mode of inheritance has yet been identified. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the prevalence of ASD is currently 1 in 68 children, and the ratio of ASD in children is $5: 1$ male to female. ${ }^{26}$ According to the AAP, autism screening is recommended for all children before 24 months of age, and the M-CHAT parentcompleted survey should be completed at the 18 and/or 24 -month well-child visit. ${ }^{27,}{ }^{28}$ Early identification and intervention has been shown to be highly effective in helping children with ASD gain social and emotional skills. ${ }^{29,30}$

\section*{Learning \& neurodevelopmental disorders}

Learning disorders may result from neurodevelopmental or genetic causes, or occur as comorbidities with other physical or mental disabilities (Fig. 3.3). Learning disability refers to difficulty in acquiring and using basic reading skills, reading comprehension, oral expression, listening comprehension, mathematical reasoning, and mathematical comprehension that occurs without an environmental precipitant in otherwise normally intelligent children. Learning disorders are neurologically based and persist into adulthood. The definition requires at least a 2-year discrepancy between the child's expected level of achievement and his or her performance.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

The incidence of learning disorders is $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the population, with twice as many boys affected compared with girls. ${ }^{31}$ Pediatric primary care providers assist with the diagnosis of learning disabilities by performing an initial thorough history and physical examination, including a complete neurological examination and an evaluation of school performance. The confirmation of learning disabilities includes referral for neuropsychometric testing and evaluation by a licensed psychologist.

\section*{Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a cluster of behaviors that appear early in a child's life and persist throughout childhood and adolescence. ADHD occurs in $4 \%$ to $12 \%$ of the pediatric population in the community, with males outnumbering females $3: 1$ to $6: 1 .^{32}$ The diagnosis of ADHD is based on a characteristic clinical presentation and observable behaviors. The
problematic behaviors include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The practitioner must rule out the possibility that such behaviors merely represent variations in normal development or temperament, and that they are not attributable to environmental factors such as a poor fit with the teacher and/or classroom. Furthermore, ADHD may coexist with other disorders or conditions that must be addressed before an appropriate diagnosis can be given. Between $10 \%$ and $40 \%$ of children with ADHD have learning disabilities. Schools are federally mandated to perform learning evaluations if a child is suspected of having a disability, such as ADHD. Pediatric primary care providers should initiate an evaluation for ADHD by gathering a comprehensive history, with careful attention given to developmental level; performing a complete physical examination, including neurological exam; vision and hearing screening; lead and hematocrit levels in preschool children; and obtaining input from teachers regarding behavior and classroom performance. Parents should be assisted in initiating an individual education plan (IEP) coordinated with the child's school. Follow-up and referral to a developmental-behavioral specialist, mental health professional, and pediatric neurologist, when indicated, initiate the further evaluation and treatment of children with ADHD.

\section*{Summary of developmental evaluation}
- The most common childhood developmental and behavioral problems are speech and language delay, hearing loss, emotional and behavioral concerns, learning disabilities, and delays in other developmental milestones.
- Developmental surveillance is an important component of all pediatric primary care visits, and developmental psychometric testing should be performed routinely at the 9 -month, 18 -month, and $24-$ or $30-$ month well-child visit.
- Timely identification of developmental delay and behavioral problems and prompt referral for early intervention can resolve or lessen the impact of a deficit or disability on the long-term
functioning of the child and family.

Despite the many technologic advances in health care, the most important diagnostic tool is obtaining a comprehensive, holistic health history. Accurate diagnosis is most influenced by observing, listening, and thinking critically in a clinical setting. Recognizing patterns of health and illness in infants, children, and adolescents requires obtaining relevant data from the health history, thinking about their meaning, and explaining them logically. Taking a comprehensive history with families not only develops a profile to guide physical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment, but also contributes to the development of a trusting, continuity relationship between the family and the pediatric health care provider.

Information gathered from the family history is also key to identifying genetic patterns of inheritance in health conditions and is a guide to anticipatory guidance and promoting responsible health behaviors in the child and adolescent. Identifying and counseling children and adolescents at risk for chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver, and cardiovascular disease begins with gathering a comprehensive family history.

Identifying and counseling for childhood overweight and obesity remain a top priority in pediatrics. Identifying early childhood factors in the comprehensive history that are significant predictors of obesity in adulthood is an important role for providers in prevention and anticipatory guidance. Probable early markers of obesity include maternal body mass index (BMI); childhood growth patterns, particularly early rapid growth and early adiposity rebound; childhood obesity; and socioeconomic status of the family. ${ }^{1}$ In taking the health history, it is important to gather information from children and adolescents about any regular physical activity and their dietary routines in order to counsel them and foster development of positive health habits.

Another important component of comprehensive information gathering is assessing oral health. Tooth decay or caries is the single most common chronic health condition in childhood. ${ }^{2}$ Tooth decay affects almost one fourth of US children from 2 to 5 years of age and half of adolescents 12 to 19 years of age. ${ }^{2,3}$ Children living in lowincome families have a higher incidence of dental caries and unmet dental needs, particularly Hispanic and African American children. ${ }^{4}$ Assessing children's oral health and access to dental health services is key to establishing positive dental health behaviors early in life and improving oral health outcomes in children and adolescents.

The comprehensive health history in children and adolescents incorporates screening for psychosocial conditions. The top five chronic health conditions in pediatrics currently are speech and language delays, learning disabilities, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorders, developmental disabilities, and emotional, behavioral, and mental health problems. ${ }^{5}$ These findings indicate the importance of screening during every well-child and adolescent encounter for learning and attention problems, mental health, and emotional/behavioral problems to assess need for further evaluation and referral.

Health equity, attaining optimum health for all, is linked to social, economic, and environmental factors, which affect the life course of the child and family. ${ }^{6,7}$ Trauma exposure or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) including physical or emotional abuse or neglect, sexual abuse, domestic violence, parental substance abuse, and parental separation and divorce result in toxic
stress, which negatively affect the life course. ${ }^{8,9}$ Further, inclusion of an assessment of the social determinants of health for families at risk (e.g., food insecurity, unstable housing, family or neighborhood violence, family substance abuse) has become a priority in the comprehensive health history and an important part of the familycentered encounter, along with assessment of family strengths and protective factors. ${ }^{7,10}$

\section*{The genetic family history}

The genetic family history remains the most important tool in the comprehensive health history to identify a child's risk for developing diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, and a wide range of chronic health conditions. ${ }^{11}$ Family patterns of behavioral and environmental factors that influence the occurrence of health conditions also often emerge in the course of developing a family pedigree. ${ }^{11}$ The genetic family history establishes a family pedigree or genogram as a visual way to enhance recognition of patterns of inheritance. This approach leads to insights in patterns of inheritance across generations; it gives pediatric health care providers an opportunity to counsel families on prevention and offer referrals for further genetic testing. Knowledge of the genetic family history can aid in the diagnosis of rare single-gene disorders such as cystic fibrosis, fragile $X$ syndrome, Huntington disease, and familial hypercholesterolemia.

It is important to be aware of the emotional and ethical issues that may arise when taking a genetic family history, such as the hereditary link between breast cancer in female relatives and familial gene testing. Pediatric health care providers can provide support to individuals and families when they are making decisions about seeking genetic testing. Also, pediatric providers are well positioned to counsel families as they provide primary care and anticipatory guidance for children from birth to young adulthood, the period during which many genetically linked disorders emerge.

Table 4.1 presents the SCREEN mnemonic for an initial genetic family history. ${ }^{12}$ This mnemonic represents an initial series of questions used to quickly identify potential genetically influenced health conditions in the family that require further intervention,
counseling, referral, or screening by a geneticist. Fig. 4.1 is an example of a family pedigree with a multigenerational inheritance of cardiovascular disease.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

The genetic family history remains the most important tool in the comprehensive health history to identify a child's risk for developing diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, and a wide range of chronic health conditions. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Family-centered history}

The following key strategies are involved in developing a successful family-centered relationship with children and families in the pediatric setting:
- Listen actively to the concerns of the family. A caring relationship is established by developing an understanding of the feelings and values within the family context.
- Understand the family's expectations for the encounter. To successfully establish a caring relationship, the parent's agenda must be identified and addressed during the encounter.
- Ask open-ended questions, thereby allowing relevant data to unfold.
- Personalize your care. Ask about the health and well-being of other family members and extended family members to personalize your care and demonstrate your connectedness with the family unit and to assist in building the family profile and family-centered relationship.
- Learn and understand the role and importance of cultural influences in the family and the primary language spoken in the home. The health interview should be conducted in the family's primary language, if possible, to promote family engagement.
- Identify protective factors in the family that create a positive environment and focus on the child's strengths. Identify social or family supports for the parent and shared family interest in activities such as sports, cultural events, or religious services. These often assist in forming a supportive and protective community for children and adolescents.
- Build a sense of confidence in parents by confirming and complimenting their strengths in caring for their child. This approach also builds a trusting relationship between the family and health care provider.
With the increased workload in health care settings and the implementation of electronic health records, the process of speaking with children and families becomes more challenging. Remember to sit rather than stand while gathering the health history, maintain eye contact with the child and family in between screen time, and share screen health information such as growth charts and laboratory results as you engage with families. Families trust the pediatric provider; their relationship is based on the knowledge, understanding, respect, and care that the pediatric provider demonstrates during the encounter with their child.

Box 4.1 approaches the family-centered interview from three levels to assess family strengths, stressors, and threats to the family unit. By integrating the social context in the family-centered interview, you may identify unmet needs such as food insecurity or parental unemployment, which are important child health determinants and may be addressed by referral to community services. ${ }^{10}$

\section*{BOX 4.1}

\section*{The Three Levels of Family-Centered Assessment}

\section*{Level 1: Micro level}

The child, parent or parents, partner, caregiver, other adults or children in household
- Consider intersecting characteristics and temperament of the individuals in the family unit, style of parenting, relationship between parents, and impact of family dynamics on physical, developmental, behavioral, and emotional health of child.

\section*{Level 2: Mezzo level}

The extended family, family supports and resources, communitybased systems
- Consider housing, school, childcare, parental work and income, health care access, church and religious community, safety of community, immigration status, and impact on child wellbeing.

\section*{Level 3: Macro level}

The social context of child and family
- Consider impact of the community, cultural influences, economic status, environmental health, political climate, and impact on physical and mental health of child.

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

The family cultural assessment should include the family's beliefs about the origins of wellness or illness and their perceptions of the child's health. Cultural values and beliefs strongly influence a family's perception of cause and effect of common and chronic health conditions. Establishing positive health behaviors within the family may be influenced by a family's understanding of the cause of an illness and their beliefs about the impact of medications or therapies on the illness. Integrating respect for culture is a continual process in the provider/family relationship. Understanding cultural diversity includes not only knowledge of the culture but also respect, supportive interaction, and tailoring communication, which embraces and values diversity. ${ }^{13}$

The following questions should be included in a family cultural assessment with the goal of developing an understanding of the importance of culture within the context of the family:
- Where was the child born? If an immigrant: How long has the
child lived in this country? What is the family's cultural identity?
- Has the child always lived with the parent/current caregiver?
- If multiracial family: What culture(s)/race(s) does the family identify with most closely? If interviewing an adolescent: What culture(s)/race(s) do you identify with most closely?
- What are the child's primary and secondary languages? What is the family's speaking and reading ability of the primary language (languages) in the home?
- What is the family's religion, and do they practice their religion daily or weekly?
- Are the family's food preferences linked to cultural or religious preferences?
- Are there beliefs about health or illness related to the family's culture?
- If interviewing an adolescent: Are there conflicts with parents or peers concerning expected cultural norms or customs? Have you experienced racial discrimination?

\section*{Components of information gathering}

The information gathered during a health history reflects the parent's or caretaker's opinions and experience and, therefore, needs to be viewed as subjective information. The subjective information guides the objective findings of the physical examination and assists the health care provider in evaluating the family functioning, the family's approach to health and illness, and the reliability of the historian-parent, partner of the biologic parent, guardian, or grandparent. Children beginning at 3 years of age can effectively participate in the health interview. Involving children at this age establishes the health care provider as an advocate for the child and gives voice to the concerns of the child. It also allows the provider to observe the parent/child relationship during the interview process.

The type of health history gathered during an encounter depends on whether the child and family are presenting for a comprehensive well-child visit, acute care visit, symptom-focused visit, or for a preparticipation sports physical examination (see Chapter 19).

\section*{Information gathering of subjective data}

\section*{Child profile}

The demographic and biographical information for a child and family should be gathered at the initial health visit and verified at each health encounter. In an initial visit, the child's profile should include information on the previous health care provider, date of the child's or adolescent's last health care visit, and contact information on parents or stepparent, partner of biologic parent, caregiver, guardian, or grandparent. Family units change and this information should be updated at each health encounter.

\section*{The open-ended question}

Begin the encounter with an open-ended question such as, "What brings you here today?" This allows the family to tell their story in their own words and centers the health visit around the family concerns and establishes the basis of the family-centered interview. Although the child or adolescent may have presented for a well visit or with a primary complaint, it is important to be open to other health issues that may arise during the encounter. Clarifying the expectations for the child or adolescent and family for the health visit and negotiating a time frame and plan for care are important to establishing trust in a provider/parent relationship.

\section*{Present concern}

After summarizing the family concerns gathered in the initial interview, transition to the provider-centered interview to complete gathering information on the present health history and past medical history. For a symptom-focused or acute care visit, begin gathering information in the following areas to clarify information the family has not already addressed:
- When did you first notice the symptoms? Or date/time child was last well?
- Character of symptoms (time of day, location, intensity, duration, quality)?
- Progression of symptoms (How is child doing now? Symptoms getting better or worse?)
- Associated symptoms (vomiting, fever, rash, cough etc.)? Anything else bothering child?
- Exposure to household member, classmates, or others who have been ill? Pets in home?
- Any recent travel?
- Changes in appetite or activity level (eating regularly, school/day care attendance, sleeping pattern)?
- Medications taken (dosage, time, date)? Did the medication help or relieve the symptoms?
- Home management (What has the family tried? What has helped?) Use of alternative therapies or healing practices? Family belief about the illness?
- Pertinent family medical history? (Is anyone in the family immunosuppressed or does anyone have a chronic illness?)
- What changes have occurred in the family as a result of this illness (effects or secondary gain)?
- Has the family seen other health care providers for the concern? For a symptom-focused or acute care visit, the health care provider should include only pertinent parts of the comprehensive history presented in the following sections.

\section*{Components of comprehensive health history}

\section*{Prenatal and birth history}

The prenatal and birth history is important in relation to the first 2 years of life and particularly relevant for preterm infants, and term infants and children with developmental delays, abnormal neurologic findings, or congenital syndromes.

The following are components of the past medical history:
- Childhood conditions: Frequent upper respiratory infections (URIs) or viral infections, history of ear infections? Frequent sore
throats; streptococcal or bacterial infections? Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)? Eczema or frequent skin rashes? Dental caries?

- Maternal history: Any feelings of depressed mood, feeling down, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities? Feeling anxious or unable to control worrying?
Family history should include a family cultural assessment (see earlier section titled "Family, Cultural, Racial, and Ethnic Considerations").

\section*{Review of systems}

The review of systems is often included in the comprehensive health history for children and adolescents, particularly those with chronic health conditions affecting multiple systems in the body. Table 4.2 presents a guide for the information gathered in a review of systems. Experienced providers will incorporate the review of systems questions into the physical examination to prompt families to remember areas of past medical history that may have been overlooked in the initial interview. Interview questions for the review of systems are also found in the system-specific chapters that follow.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Activities of daily living}

\section*{Age-specific nutritional information gathering}

\section*{Infancy}

Adequate nutrition in the first 2 years of life is critical for the period of rapid growth and brain development. A thorough dietary history in the infant recognizes problems early and allows the health care
provider to counsel families for developing issues of overweight, underweight, or failure to thrive. Review gender and age-specific growth charts and height-to-weight ratios at every health encounter during infancy. Dietary history for the first year of life includes the following:
- Breastfeeding: Frequency and duration of infant feeds; use of supplemental formula feedings or water; difficulties with latching or feeding patterns? Concern about infant weight gain? Any vomiting after feeds? Mother's diet or dietary restrictions? Father's participation in feeding routines? Mother receiving adequate rest? Experiencing nipple soreness? Plans for return to work? Plan for expression of breast milk or weaning?
- Formula feeding: Type of infant formula, how is formula stored? How is powdered formula prepared? Amount and frequency of feeds? Concern about infant weight gain? Bottlefeeding at night? How often? Difficulty feeding or slow feeder? Plans for bottle weaning and transition to cup?
- Formula and breastfeeding: Feeding both breast milk and formula? How often and quantity of formula daily? Frequency and length of breastfeeding? Number of nighttime feedings with breast or bottle?
- Fluids: Drinking juice? Amount and type of juice? Drinking juice in cup or bottle? Amount of water daily?
- Solid foods: Age at introduction of solid foods? Portion size/amount of baby foods? Introduction of table foods and finger foods? Regular meal pattern? Infant interested in table foods? Family members frequently feeding infant table foods? Introduction of cup?

\section*{Early childhood (1 to 4 years of age)}

During early childhood, it is particularly important to establish weaning from the bottle. Persistent bottle-feeding may be associated with childhood overweight or obesity, iron-deficiency anemia, and persistent bottle-feeding and breastfeeding are associated with early childhood caries. Therefore, reducing milk intake during this period is key to supporting overall healthy nutrition patterns and protecting oral health. Eating habits are established during the early years, and a balanced diet is important
to maintain a healthy weight and for optimal growth and development. Review gender and age-specific growth charts at every health encounter during early childhood and BMI after 2 years of age. Dietary history for early childhood includes the following:
- Obtain a 24-hour dietary history.
- Document servings of fruits and vegetables, sources of protein, iron, vitamin C, vitamin D and calcium ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ).
- Food likes and dislikes?
- Snacking and meal pattern? Frequency of juice and soda?
- Any parental concerns about the child's appetite or overeating? Any food struggles developing around mealtime or portion size?
Identify any parental concerns and challenges around the child's eating and review the importance of introducing a variety of foods often. New foods must be introduced repeatedly to gain acceptance. Portion size should be reviewed. If food is used for discipline or reward, caution the parent that this may establish an early unhealthy relationship with food. It is also important to discuss avoidance of foods commonly associated with choking or inhalation-round slices of hot dogs/sausage, popcorn, peanuts, chips, grapes, chewing gum, hardy candy, gummy candies, and carrot sticks. It is best to avoid feeding a child while driving so as to prevent choking incidents. In early childhood, only $100 \%$ juice is recommended, and this should be limited to 4 to 6 ounces daily. Soda, sugar-sweetened beverages, and carbonated beverages should be avoided. Caffeinated drinks should not be consumed in early childhood.

\section*{Middle childhood (5 to 10 years of age)}

In middle childhood, the prevalence of obesity is $17.5 \%$ in children 6 to 11 years of age, with the same pattern of obesity in males and females. ${ }^{14}$ There are significant differences by race and ethnicity for youth 6 to 19 years of age, with the prevalence of obesity for nonHispanic black males at $18.4 \%$ and $22.4 \%$ for Hispanic males. ${ }^{14}$ Overweight children and adolescents have a $70 \%$ chance of becoming overweight or obese adults. Therefore, during the health history interview with the school-age child and parent, it is
important to obtain a comprehensive history of eating choices and snacking habits. Determine the use of food as a reward or punishment and what the parental and family attitude is toward the weight of the child. Review gender and age-specific growth charts and BMI at every health encounter during middle childhood. Dietary history for middle childhood should include the following:
- Obtain a 24-hour dietary history. Begin with the child's recall of dietary intake and then elicit dietary information from parent or caregiver.
- Document servings of fruits and vegetables, sources of protein, iron, vitamin C, vitamin D, and calcium ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ).
- Review daily meal pattern and snacking habits, amount of fast foods and carry-out foods weekly, daily quantity of juice and water, amount of sugar-sweetened beverages, soda and carbonated beverages daily or weekly, consumption of sports drinks or caffeinated drinks daily or weekly.
- Review amount of high-fat, salty, and sugary foods in the diet.
- How many meals does child eat away from home daily or weekly? Does child contribute to preparation or planning of family meals at home? Does the child have any interest in cooking?
- Any parental concerns about appetite overeating, or portion size at meals? Any parental struggles around food and weight gain or weight loss?

\section*{Adolescence (11 years of age to young adulthood)}
"Disordered eating" is unfortunately the norm for many adolescents who do not necessarily have an eating disorder. According to the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, $6.7 \%$ of adolescents reported no vegetable intake, $13.8 \%$ reported no breakfast intake in the 7 days before the survey, only $10.2 \%$ reported drinking the recommended amount of milk daily, and $20.4 \%$ drank one or more cans or bottles of soda daily. ${ }^{15}$ Teens may skip breakfast, either because of lack of time, lack of available food, or the misconception that skipping breakfast will aid in weight loss. Although a vegetarian diet is often a healthy choice for adults or for children who have been raised as vegetarians, in teens a sudden switch to a vegetarian diet may actually be a red flag for a
developing eating disorder. ${ }^{16}$ Even though eating disorders are more common among adolescent girls, boys are also at risk. A 24or 48 -hour diet recall can be helpful in evaluating nutrition status. While an assessment of the context of nutrition and activity can take longer than a traditional diet recall (e.g., "Tell me how eating and activity fit into your day yesterday"), this contextual information can be very useful in client-centered counseling techniques, such as motivational interviewing, for improved nutritional and dietary habits.

In asking adolescents about body image, the provider should avoid the assumptions that an adolescent with a low BMI for age is satisfied with his or her weight or that an adolescent with a high BMI wants to lose weight (Box 4.2). See Table 4.3 for a screening tool for evaluating adolescents for eating disorders.

\section*{Developmental history}

Normal developmental progress and achieving developmental milestones on time is a critical marker of health during infancy and early childhood. Parental concerns about delayed physical growth or delayed psychomotor or cognitive development are of primary importance in the health history interview. Parental expectations of developmental markers vary widely in families, so it is important to elicit in the history not only what the infant or child is doing but also what the parent or family expects and allows. ${ }^{7}$ Always note in the electronic health record the ages at which key developmental milestones were attained.

\section*{Infancy}
- Gross motor skills: Holds head up while prone; supervised tummy time? Rolls over; sits without support? Crawling or cruising? Pulls to standing? Starting to stand and walk?
- Fine motor skills: Hand-eye coordination; reaching and grasping? Beginning to feed self? Pincer grasp for finger foods? Scribbling by 1 year of age?
- Communication: Is infant responding to sounds/hearing? First word? How many words by 1 year of age? Pointing?
- Social/emotional: Smiles? Eye contact and socially engaged with family? Points? Stranger anxiety?
-Sexual development: Normal genital exploration in infant? Terms used by parent for genitalia?

\section*{Early childhood (1 to 4 years of age)}

Explore parental concerns about the child's temperament and behavior and about temper tantrums and parental reactions during the health care encounter. Discussions about establishing ageappropriate disciplinary methods and parental response to child's increasing demands are important during this developmental period. Breath-holding spells can occur during early childhood, and habits such as thumb sucking are common and should be reviewed.
- Gross and fine motor skills: Manual dexterity, handedness, uses utensils/self-feeding, drawing and writing? Coordination when walking and running? Learning to dress independently and tie shoes?
- Communication: Concerns about the child's speech or language skills? Primary language in home and number of languages spoken? Do others understand the child's speech? Do others? Does child follow directions? Does child combine words? Does child get confused, stutter, or often repeat words?
- Social/emotional: Dresses without help, separates from mother or parent? Names friend, peer interaction?
- Temperament/personality: Activity level, attention span, consolability?
- Discipline: What type of discipline is used when the child misbehaves? When is it used? Is the discipline effective?
- Sexual development: Normal self-pleasure exploration, masturbation, and sexual play in preschooler, parental attitudes,
toward normal self-pleasure exploration? Parental comfort or concerns with child's gender expression and fantasy play? ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Middle childhood (5 to 10 years of age)}

Middle childhood provides an opportunity to foster positive health habits, particularly in the areas of nutrition and physical activity. ${ }^{7}$ The health care provider should explore developing interests with the school-age child and parent and encourage participation in recreational and a variety of competitive sports. Exploring the quality of the child's friendships and the school performance and experience (current grades, relationship with teacher, responsibility for homework) gives a view into the child's world. Children who are bullying, being bullied, or both should be counseled and considered for possible referral. Habits such as nail biting and tics should be explored.
- Gross and fine motors skills: Physical balance and coordination appropriate for age? Participating in sports? Handwriting ability?
- Communication: Readiness to learn? Speech or language delays? Communication patterns with peers and adults? Problem-solving skills?
- Social/emotional: Increasing independence? Self-esteem? Relationships with parents, siblings? Peer relationships and best friend? Experienced bullying in school or from family members? Mood or symptoms of depression? History of suicidal ideation?
- Temperament/personality: Congenial with peers? Positive selfimage? Able to name best friend? Ability to adapt to change?
- Discipline: What type of discipline is used when your child misbehaves? When is it used? Is it effective? Are parenting styles consistent? Does child live at more than one home? Are there behavior issues at home or at school?
- Sexual development: Gender and sexual identity, comfort with biologic sex, child or family concerns about gender expression; sex education provided in the home and/or at school? Signs of breast development or pubic hair noted?

\section*{Adolescence (11 years to young adulthood)}

See adolescent-specific content later in this chapter.

\section*{Children with special health care needs}

Children with special health care needs (CSHCNs) are those who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally. ${ }^{19}$ In gathering information on health history, CSHCNs require special consideration. Assessing the level of impact on family functioning, family cohesion, sibling relationships, and care management required for a child with special health care needs is an important part of the health history. The role of the pediatric health care provider is to assist families in optimizing the daily functioning of the child in the home and school environment; in focusing on the strengths of the child and family; in coordinating pediatric specialty referral as indicated; and in providing support and a framework for continuity of care in a medical home or health care home setting. ${ }^{7}$ The CSHCN screener is a five-item survey-based tool completed by the parent; it is an efficient and flexible standardized method of identifying children across the range and diversity of chronic health conditions and special needs. ${ }^{20}$ Implementing the CSHCN screener can be an effective part of the comprehensive health history and child and family assessment. The CSHCN screener is available at http://www.ndcpd.org/ndis/pdf/tools/CAHMIScreener.pdf/

\section*{Adolescent psychosocial history and confidentiality}

The most important caveat of the adolescent psychosocial history is that it should be conducted without the parent or guardian in the room. A review of studies on adolescent access to health care services shows that a perceived lack of confidentiality is a barrier to care and discussing sensitive topics improves the adolescent's satisfaction with care, yet only a minority of adolescents have ever discussed the importance of the confidentiality of the health visit with a health care provider. ${ }^{21}$

All 50 states have laws allowing adolescents to consent to testing for STIs and to treatment; however, confidential access to contraception, prenatal care, abortion, adoption, medical care of the
minor's child, and mental health services vary from state to state, as do laws restricting or requiring disclosure of confidential care to a parent. ${ }^{22}$ In all 50 states, there are some limitations to confidentiality. Providers are generally required to notify parents and/or police or child protective services if an adolescent under 18 years of age expresses a desire to harm himself or herself or others or if an adolescent has been abused or neglected. In addition, some states have mandatory reporting laws about consensual sexual activity, depending on the teen's age and the age discrepancy between the teen and the sexual partner; other states encourage reporting but give the provider some discretion. It is crucial for the provider to become familiar with the specific state laws pertaining to adolescent consent, confidentiality, privacy, child abuse reporting, and the amount of control the adolescent has over the release of medical records related to confidential services. Federal regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as the adoption of electronic health records, affect the control and privacy of medical records for services the adolescent may have accessed confidentially. ${ }^{23}$

\section*{Adolescent psychosocial screen: From headsss to sshadess}

The SSHADESS psychosocial history (Box 4.3) is a key part of a comprehensive adolescent health history and assessment. ${ }^{24}$ The SSHADESS psychosocial history is preferred by many adolescent providers to the more familiar HEADSSS mnemonic, which covers a similar health history. ${ }^{25}$ The SSHADESS offers the advantages of a strength-based approach and a more holistic exploration of the adolescent's emotional states. ${ }^{24}$ The order of questioning, in general, proceeds from less private and sensitive questions to more sensitive ones, giving the provider and adolescent an opportunity to establish rapport. The SSHADESS can be tailored to early, middle, or late adolescents by modifying the questions. Remember that early adolescents and occasionally middle adolescents can have concrete thinking ${ }^{26}$ and may wonder why the provider is asking such unusual questions. It is important to explain to early adolescents that you ask all teens the same questions; it is also important that you start the health history interview by asking
questions about the activities of peers before asking about the teen directly. Avoid medical jargon and try to use the teen's own terminology without sounding as though you are trying to talk like a teen. Remember that adolescents tend to be oriented in the here and now. A "long time ago" may refer to years or months ago or as little as a few weeks ago.

\section*{BOX 4.3}

\section*{Sshadess-Review of Adolescent History}

\section*{Strengths}
- What are some of your strengths that help you cope with stress?
- How would your friends describe you?
- If you were applying for a job, how would you describe yourself to encourage someone to hire you?

\section*{School}
- Are you in school? (Regular or continuation? English learner/bilingual? Special education/504 plan?) Attend regularly? Suspensions?
- Favorite/most difficult subjects?
- What are your grades/GPA?
- Low: Recent if changes in GPA? Is work too difficult? Not doing homework?
- High: Any stress about college goals or grades?
- Plans after high school graduation? (Realistic? Is teen taking right courses/activities? Taking SATs, sending college applications on time? Taking vocational training?)
- If no specific plans, end of high school can be a difficult, vulnerable time.

\section*{Home}
- Who lives with you? (One or both parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, adult siblings, group home, foster care?) Do you
live with boyfriend/girlfriend and family?
- Immigrant teens may live with adult siblings/extended family while parents live in home country.
- Have you lived with ...your whole life? Changes because of divorce or death of parent? Separation/reunification with parents resulting from immigration? Conflict with parents/guardians? Illness, incarceration, homelessness of family members?
- How do you get along with... ? How are conflicts handled at home?

\section*{Activities}
- How do you spend free time? What do you do for fun? Sports/other extracurricular activities? Exercise? Hobbies? Church or community activities?
- Responses reflect a measure of connection to school, extra motivation for attendance/grades
- Jobs? (Number of hours/week, schedule, location, hazards)
- Names of friends, best friend?

\section*{Drugs/alcohol/tobacco}

Introduce the subject gently, especially with young teens; can be more direct with older teens
- Does anyone at your school... ? Do any of your friends... ? Then, have you...?
- If yes, use CRAFFT questions (see Box 4.4).
- Attempts to quit?
- Family members using drugs/alcohol/tobacco?

\section*{Emotions}
- How would you describe your moods? (Elicits rich information if teen is given time to elaborate)
- Depression/anger: Changes in energy, appetite, weight? Sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating? Irritability is hallmark of depression in teens. Difficulty with homework, school? How teen copes with anger?

self-cutting without suicidal intent?
- Suicidal gestures/attempts may be impulsive acts after disagreement with parents, peers; teen may not selfidentify as depressed.
- Warn parent/guardian if teen contemplating suicide, even if not at immediate risk.

\section*{Sexuality and sexual abuse}

Warn the teen of limits of confidentiality in your setting or state.
- "Have you ever had sex or ever come close to having sex?"
- "Come close to" covers a broad range, includes oral/anal sex, which teens often do not define as sex. For teens with the intention to initiate sexual activity, it is important to explore choice and decisions about sex in relationship. It is important to elicit history before discussing safer sex, contraception, and need for pelvic exam.
- "Are your partners girls, boys, or both?" or "Are you attracted to girls, boys, or both?"
- Ask of everyone. Be sensitive to teens engaging in same-sex activities.
- Condom/barrier (if appropriate): "At what point in the sexual encounter do you use condoms?" ("late use" problem). Condom education in school? Knowledge of other barriers (gloves, dental dams)? Difficulties in negotiating condom use with partner?
- Teens with less formal education may lack awareness of anatomy/physiology of genitals and reproductive organs.
- Are you doing anything to prevent pregnancy (if indicated)? Are you experiencing any pressure from partners or family to not use birth control or interference with condom or birth control use?
- "Has anyone ever touched you sexually without permission or tried to force you to have sex?" If yes, history of childhood sexual abuse? Acquaintance or date rape? Stranger assault?
- "Has anyone you were seeing ever put you down or made you feel ashamed? Pressured you to go the next step when you are not ready? Grabbed your arm, yelled at you, or pushed you
when they were angry or frustrated? Treated you badly when you were alone but acted differently in front of friends and family? Pushed you to have sex or do sexual things when you didn't want to?"

\section*{Safety issues}
- Do you have to do anything special to be safe in your home, at school, or in your neighborhood (e.g., positive climates, presence of gangs, etc.)?
- Guns or other weapons in home or school?
- Physical fighting/abuse in home (between siblings, parents, parent-child)?
- Teen involved in physical fights at home, neighborhood, school?
- Adolescent relationship abuse? (See previous questions under Sexuality.)
- Friends in gangs? Have you ever been a gang member or do you wear a color/insignia? Teen, peers, siblings/cousins involved in gangs?
- Be sensitive to potential reluctance to disclose.

Begin the interview with an opening such as "I'm going to ask you questions that I ask all teens about sex, drugs, and feelings. What you tell me is private, unless you tell me that you have been hurt by someone else, you are thinking of hurting someone else, or you are thinking of hurting yourself." Questions are asked in as neutral and nonjudgmental manner as possible to avoid making assumptions about the family structure, kinds of sexual activity, or sexual orientation of the adolescent. Asking open-ended questions such as, "How are things at home?" sets a neutral tone.

\section*{Adolescent depression and anxiety}

Anxiety and depression place affected adolescents at greater risk for poor developmental and health outcomes, such as lifelong anxiety and depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorders, and substance abuse. ${ }^{27}$ Adolescents who suffer from anxiety and depression also have difficulty forming important peer relationships, tend to suffer from low selfesteem, and lack self-advocacy skills due to their developmental stage. ${ }^{28}$ Anxiety and depression can lead to school absenteeism, poor performance, and underachievement. ${ }^{27}$ Screening for these conditions in primary care has become an important part of routine adolescent health care. Table 4.5 provides information on the Patient Health Questionnaire Screening for Depression-9 (PHQ-9), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7). These are frequently used screening tools for adolescent psychosocial screening for anxiety and depression across clinical settings. ${ }^{16,29}$

Environmental health history

Environment is a key determinant of health, and children are uniquely vulnerable to environmental hazards. Children's genetic predisposition, social milieu, and nutrition play an important role in their susceptibility to environmental hazards. ${ }^{1}$ The burden of disease and cost of environmental hazards stems primarily from exposure to toxic chemicals and air pollutants, and the related health conditions affecting children include lead poisoning, exposure to mercury pollution, childhood cancers, asthma, autism, intellectual and learning disabilities, and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder. ${ }^{2}$

Toxic substances are those chemicals in the environment capable of causing harm. Toxicants are environmental hazards from chemical pollutants, and toxins are environmental hazards from biologic sources. Children have a larger ratio of surface area to body mass than adults which increases their susceptibility to pesticides and other environmental toxicants. Therefore, children absorb larger amounts of environmental toxins, kilogram for kilogram, than adults. Infants have three times as large a surface area and children have twice the surface area to body mass compared with an adult. ${ }^{1}$ Young children breathe more air and drink more water per pound of body weight than adults. They have greater exposure to toxic chemicals and air pollutants for their body
weight than adults, and they absorb toxic substances at a higher rate than adults. ${ }^{3}$ The skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract in the child are particularly vulnerable to toxic substances and absorb them more readily and efficiently than those in the adult. The high gastric pH in children facilitates absorption of environmental toxins. The developing fetus and the young child are particularly vulnerable to the neurodevelopmental effects of environmental toxins because of their rapid periods of brain growth and development in the first 2 years of life.

Children also live and play closer to environmental hazards on the ground, which increases their concentration of inhaled toxic substances. The breathing zone of a child is lower than adults, and chemical pollutants such as lead or mercury and chemicals vaporizing from carpets, flooring, or nap mats affect children at a greater rate than adults. ${ }^{1}$ Children's metabolic pathways are immature, and they metabolize toxic chemicals differently than adults because they lack the enzymes to break down and remove toxic chemicals from the body. ${ }^{3}$ Their higher metabolic rate increases their oxygen consumption and production of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ requires higher minute ventilation in infants and children and increases their exposure to particulate matter in the air. ${ }^{1}$ The dose-response rate for exposure in children is far more rapid than in adults.

Environmental health is defined broadly; the long-term goal is to safeguard the children's health and improve the environments where children live, learn, and play. ${ }^{3}$ It is critically important for pediatric health care providers to understand the impact of environmental hazards and exposures on the healthy growth and development of infants, children, and adolescents. Health care providers have a professional responsibility to identify and understand the environmental health risks present in the communities in which they work, to access available health risk data from community surveillance programs, and to report exposures to appropriate local and state authorities. Furthermore, providers are mandated to conduct appropriate screening tests and to educate children and families about toxic environmental health risks.

\section*{Environmental risk factors}

Children can encounter environmental hazards and be exposed to many different toxic substances in the home, car, school, child care setting, play environments, and community. Young children spend $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of their time indoors, so environmental hazards in the home and child care environments are the primary sources of exposures. ${ }^{1}$ Environmental health hazards include physical agents; chemical agents; outdoor and indoor air contaminants; water, soil, or dust contaminants; biologic irritants; allergens; toxins; and infectious agents. Box 5.1 presents common indoor and outdoor air pollutants, contaminants in water and soil, food contaminants, and hazardous substances that children may be exposed to through parental or family employment or hobbies.

\section*{Developmental vulnerabilities}

Different developmental stages put children at risk for different types of exposures to environmental hazards. Prenatal exposure of the fetus to maternal smoking, substance use, and chemical or biologic agents increases the risk of absorption of toxicants and toxins. Toxicants such as illicit drugs, alcohol, cotinine from environmental tobacco smoke, mercury, and lead, all of which cross the placental barrier, contribute to low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, cognitive and developmental delays, and congenital birth defects. ${ }^{4}$ In the newborn, particular attention should be given to toxicants in breast milk or infant formula, dermal contacts, and parental occupations.

Infants and toddlers have expanded mobility, giving them increased exposure to their environment. They are particularly vulnerable to oral exposures because of their hand-to-mouth activity and inhaled substances within the physical zone they occupy near the ground. Children in early and middle childhood become susceptible to toxicants in the school, child care settings, and playground environments. Occupational hazards are of particular concern in adolescents and young adults, as are harmful exposures that occur through experimentation with illicit drugs, alcohol, and intentional inhalation of other substances.

In addition to traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and hookahs are increasing in popularity among youth. E-cigarettes are batterypowered devices that deliver a nicotine-containing aerosol or vapor by heating a solution of nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerol used as a preservative, and a flavoring agent. ${ }^{5}$ Exogenous nicotine exposure and cigarette use in adolescence has been associated with long-term structural and functional changes in the brain as cognitive maturation occurs throughout adolescence. Lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments, disrupted memory, selective attention, and reduced executive function and activity of the prefrontal cortex have been associated with early uptake of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. ${ }^{6}$ Smoke from water pipes or hookahs appears to contribute to significantly more particulate matter than traditional cigarettes. There is as much as a 73 -fold increase in nicotine in the urine following water pipe smoking and a significant increase in exposure to lung carcinogens. ${ }^{7,8}$

\section*{Sources of environmental toxins}

Children are at risk for environmental toxins from dust in homes containing lead-contaminated soil, paint chips or peeling paint; industrial toxicants in or near neighborhoods, landfill sites, or waste treatment sites; pre-1989 plumbing with presence of lead pipes or lead solder; well water or contaminated tap water; and drinking water contaminated with lead. Children that play near high-traffic areas risk exposure to soil contaminated with old deposits from leaded gasoline. Children are also at increased risk for pesticide and organophosphate exposure, as they consume more fruits and vegetables per pound of body weight than adults. Children of farm workers are particularly vulnerable to pesticide and organophosphate exposure.

Children are at risk for indoor air pollutants such as environmental tobacco smoke, mold, pesticides in the home or school, products containing lead including pottery with lead glaze and imported pottery, and food products containing lead. Children's exposure to toxins may also occur through contact with a parent's workplace or work clothes and hobbies of family members and household contacts such as soldering or refinishing old cars and painted furniture can also put children at risk.

Children with asthma are at higher risk from exposure to outdoor air pollutants. Particulate matter in the air consists of extremely small particles and liquid droplets that can have adverse effects on developing lungs and respiratory function. Increased levels of particulate matter created by air pollution from gasoline and diesel engines and wood-burning stoves, release of known environmental toxins from industrial sources, and increased allergens due to extreme weather events can trigger and exacerbate childhood asthma. Children living in low-income communities are at highest risk for exposure to outdoor air pollutants and environmental toxins. Children living in low-income families with food insecurity are at risk for poor nutrition, resulting in iron or calcium deficiency, which may enhance the uptake of lead and lead toxicity in the body.

\section*{Environmental health screening history}

Environmental exposures in early childhood may influence health and disease across the adult life span. ${ }^{3}$ All children and adolescents should have an environmental health screening history taken during routine primary care visits to establish the risk of exposures. ${ }^{9}$ An environmental health screening history establishes known home, school, and/or community environmental health risks, and a family history of parental or sibling exposure in the workplace. Table 5.1 presents an environmental health screening history for use in establishing a risk profile for exposure to pesticides, poor indoor or outdoor air quality, contaminated drinking water, or chemical toxicants. A Pediatric Environmental History form for children from birth to 18 years of age with categories of environmental exposures and questions for parents and children with a positive screen for environmental risks and a Pediatric Asthma Environmental Health History form are available at https://www.neefusa.org/resource/pediatric-environmentalhistory

The concept of health risk communication is particularly important to assessing environmental health in children and is part of a holistic approach to working with families in the clinical setting. Health risk communication requires active listening to identify parental concern and the public health risks of exposure to indoor and outdoor hazardous substances in the surrounding community. It requires determining the presence of an environmental hazard, assessment of the health risk, the severity of the exposure or dose, acceptability of the health risk, the impact on the health of the child or adolescent, and communicating the health risk effectively to the family. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Lead exposure}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently supported ending the use of the term level of concern in discussing blood lead levels (BLLs) in children because evidence indicates that no level of lead is safe; therefore all elevated levels of lead are of concern. ${ }^{10}$ Health care providers should take the primary role in educating individual families and screening for risk of environmental exposure to lead. Lead screening in children is routinely performed in most pediatric health care settings at 1 year and 2 years of age. Health care providers should monitor the health status of children and infants with BLLs above the 97.5th percentile or greater than $2.0 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ until environmental investigation and mitigation have been implemented. ${ }^{10}$ The risk of lead exposure must be reviewed with families at routine well-child health visits and in culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials.

Immigrant and refugee children in the United States are at higher risk for elevate BLLs. Recent evidence indicates that the median age of immigrant and refugee children with elevated BLLs was 4.9 years, with an age range from 14 months to 13 years. ${ }^{11}$ Since this age
range is considerably older than the ages of recommended screening for most children in the United States, it is particularly important for health care providers to screen the pediatric immigrant population for lead toxicity. Malnutrition and food insecurity are a known risk factors for increased BLL, and immigrant children have an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia which predisposes them to the increased intestinal adsorption of lead. ${ }^{11}$

Infants and children can be exposed to lead contaminants from a variety of substances including household dust, household products, candies, and medications. Children living in immigrant families are particularly vulnerable to household and medicinal exposures to lead. Box 5.2 provides questions for assessing health risks for lead exposure in children and families. Table 5.2 presents common substances associated with elevated BLLs in immigrant and refugee children.

\section*{BOX 5.2}

\section*{Quick Lead Screening Questionnaire For Children}
1. Within the last 6 months, has your child lived in or regularly visited a house, apartment, or school built before 1978 or before 1950? Are there paint surfaces that are peeling or chipped in the home or school?
2. Does your child live in or regularly visit a house or school built before 1978 or before 1950 that is undergoing renovation or has recently been renovated?
3. Have you ever seen your child eating paint chips or other nonfood substances such as paper?
4. Has your child ever taken home remedies such as azarcon, pay-loo-ah, carol, ghasard, kohl, greta, bala goli, shurma, or rueda (see Table 5.2)?
5. Do you use ceramic pottery from Mexico, Central America, South America, or Asia for cooking, serving, or storing food or beverages?

\section*{6. Have you ever been told that your child has an elevated blood lead level?}

Children with excess lead levels usually show no unique features on physical examination. Environmental exposures are often insidious and affect the internal organs and brain. Untreated elevated BLLs in early and middle childhood are associated with reduced intelligence quotient (IQ). ${ }^{4}$ Children with lead toxicity may present with one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue, malaise, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, constipation, irritability, headache, weakness, or clumsiness. Any signs of developmental
delay, neurobehavioral disorders such as tics, persistent hand-tomouth activity such as pica, unexplained seizures, anemia, chronic abdominal pain, learning difficulties, or attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder warrant an in-depth environmental health history to relate positive exposure to environmental toxins and hazards. Fig. 5.1 illustrates the primary organs and body systems affected by exposure to environmental hazards.

\section*{Endocrine-disrupting chemicals}

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are chemically manufactured or naturally occurring substances that alter the hormonal system through environmental or developmental exposures resulting in
adverse health effects. ${ }^{2}$ They can mimic naturally occurring hormones such as estrogens (female sex hormones), androgens (male sex hormones), and thyroid hormones, producing overstimulation of the endocrine system; they affect the normal function of tissues and organs, which can result in abnormal gonadal development. ${ }^{2}$ Low-dose exposure over time and extremely high-dose exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals have significant effects on the fetus and growing and developing child, including a decline in the age of the onset of puberty, decreased sperm counts, infertility, testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and some childhood cancers. ${ }^{2,4,12}$

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are present in the environment in food, water, soil, plastics, personal care products, and drugs. Exposure can be through ingestion, topically, and transplacentally to the fetus. Phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are three of the high-volume chemicals present in the environment and are known endocrine disruptors. Phthalates and BPA are chemicals used in the production of soft plastics, polycarbonated plastics, and epoxy resins. Epoxy resins are used as coatings for liners in food and beverage cans. Phthalates are also found in personal care products, plastic toys, food packaging, car seats, floor coverings, medical tubing, and many other products. BPA is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that can cause hormonal abnormalities and adverse effects on neurodevelopment. It is found in plastic water bottles, baby bottles, water main filters, dental sealants, and paint products. ${ }^{4}$ PCBs are synthetic organic chemicals associated with harmful effects in humans. Although PCBs are no longer manufactured in the United States, they are resistant to degradation and remain in the environment, where they are hazardous to human and animal health. Phytoestrogens, which are naturally occurring substances found in some food and soy products, also can have hormone-like activity.

\footnotetext{
EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP
Breast milk and polycarbonate feeding bottles are the primary sources of BPA exposure among infants, and canned foods are
}
the primary source of BPA exposure in children. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{Diagnostics}

For most environmental toxins, valid and reliable laboratory tests have not been developed. ${ }^{4}$ Testing for toxins is not performed at all laboratories. Further, there may be a lapse between exposure and testing, and the levels may not reflect the total burden of the environmental contaminant on the developing child. See Table 5.3 for available laboratory tests for environmental hazards. Exposure to significant levels of toxicants should be reported to local and state authorities and the regional Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PESHUs) at http://www.aoec.org/pehsu.htm.

\section*{Resources}

Resources on environmental health and the impact on children and families are available to pediatric health care providers through governmental, public health, and environmental health agencies and are important in assisting with comprehensive screening for
environmental hazards (Box 5.3). Having access to evidence-based research and resources on environmental health is key to responsible health-risk screening and health-risk communication to parents, caregivers, and families.

\section*{Fetal transition}

The transition to extrauterine life marks a critical event for the newborn and requires readily adapting from a dependent state to one capable of newly expected independence. Important physiologic adjustments occur in pulmonary, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and immunologic adaptation to the external environment. ${ }^{1}$ During fetal life with development of the respiratory system, pulmonary fluid occupies the evolving alveoli due to secretions from pulmonary epithelial cells necessary to ensure alveolar growth. Although production of this fluid normally decreases close to the time of delivery, residual fluid must be cleared to allow the lungs to expand with gas postnatally. Chemical stimuli such as decreased oxygen concentration and pH prompt respiratory center receptors to facilitate initiation of respirations. Paralleling these pulmonary changes are adaptations in circulatory patterns to redirect blood flow postnatally. In utero pulmonary blood vessels are constricted to facilitate flow away from unventilated lungs not yet meant to participate in oxygenation. A series of circulatory shunts, the ductus arteriosus, ductus venosus, and foramen ovale, facilitate optimized delivery of highly oxygenated blood from the placenta to the systemic circulation while bypassing the fetal lung (Fig. 6.1). ${ }^{1}$

Postnatally, the newborn must transition to sustained pulmonary ventilation by establishing adequate respirations for the exchange of gases. Postnatal changes in pulmonary and systemic pressure dynamics include closure of the fetal circulatory shunts to allow establishment of an adult circulatory pattern and may result in transient murmurs in some newborns. ${ }^{2}$ The Apgar score reflects the transition of the newborn postnatally and is performed at 1 minute and 5 minutes of life. The score provides a summative assessment of reliable indicators of successful transition, including heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). Although not predictive of long-term perinatal or neurologic outcome, it remains the standard for assessing the newborn immediately after birth. ${ }^{3}$

\end{table}

Most often postnatally, the intricate transition to extrauterine life occurs rapidly and effectively. However, infants with system immaturity or other prenatal/birth complications or anomalies may not achieve adequate or complete transition. Approximately $10 \%$ of newborns will need some assistance to achieve successful pulmonary transition, although only $1 \%$ will require extensive respiratory support measures. ${ }^{1,3}$ Although tachypnea may be present during the first postnatal hours, from efforts to reabsorb alveolar fluid, persistence of this symptom may indicate poor transition. Clinical findings such as nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, or chest wall retractions may indicate respiratory distress needing intervention. ${ }^{1}$

Although most systems are anatomically complete by approximately 24 weeks gestation, many systems including the pulmonary system are functionally immature until closer to term. The pediatric health care provider must acknowledge the influences
of gestational age, as well as circumstances of ongoing fetal environment, labor and/or delivery, and early postnatal life in assessing the newborn to determine the need for intervention to support adequate transition.

\section*{Information gathering of prenatal and birth history}

The Information Gathering table presents pertinent questions to ask about the maternal and prenatal history, neonatal history, and birth history. In addition, see prenatal and birth history in Information Gathering in Chapter 4.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Assessment of gestational age}

An important component of newborn assessment is establishing gestational age. Obtaining an accurate assessment of gestational age begins with the prenatal and birth history, and can assist the provider in anticipating conditions associated with preterm birth. Infants can be classified by gestational age as term infant, preterm infant, or postterm infant depending on the number of completed
postmenstrual weeks. Gestational growth can be affected by maternal, placental, and fetal factors. ${ }^{4}$ Term infants are born between the start of the 38th and completion of the 41st gestational week, whereas preterm infants are born prior to completing the 37th week and postterm infants are born following completion of the 41st week (Fig. 6.2). Infants born preterm and postterm are at increased risk for postnatal complications. Preterm infants are at risk for system immaturity, notably the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems. Especially at lower gestational ages, preterm infants may develop complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage that can substantially impact survival. Postterm infants are at risk for birth complications, such as shoulder dystocia, if they are also macrosomic, in addition to being at added risk for poor tolerance of labor, pulmonary complications such as meconium aspiration, and hypoglycemia. Accuracy in assessment of gestational age is thus essential for developing effective management plans. ${ }^{2,5-7}$

FIGURE 6.2 Preterm and postterm infant.

Gestational age can be estimated based on prenatal assessments with calculated dates based on last menstrual period, or postnatally using a standardized assessment tool that considers neuromuscular and physical criteria. ${ }^{6}$ The New Ballard Score (NBS) is the tool most commonly used to evaluate gestational age postnatally (Fig. 6.3 and Box 6.1). The NBS, consisting of six neuromuscular and six physical criteria, is validated to accurately estimate gestational age within 2 weeks when performed within the first 48 hours following birth. ${ }^{2,6}$ An increasing population to be aware of is the late preterm infant, defined as the infant whose postmenstrual age is 34 weeks $0 / 7$ days to 36 weeks $6 / 7$ days. These infants are not expected to be as physiologically competent as term infants and may have issues that prolong hospitalization, including jaundice, poor feeding, hypoglycemia, apnea, and thermal instability. ${ }^{1,6}$

\section*{Tests for Assessing Neuromuscular Maturity in the Newborn}

Posture. With infant quiet and in supine position, observe degree of flexion in arms, legs. Muscle tone and degree of flexion
increase with maturity. Full flexion of the arms, legs $=4$.
Square window. With thumb supporting back of arm below wrist, apply gentle pressure with index and third fingers on dorsum of hand without rotating infant's wrist. Measure angle between base of thumb and forearm. Full flexion (hand lies flat on ventral surface of forearm) $=4$.

Arm recoil. With infant supine, fully flex forearms on upper arms, hold for 5 s ; pull down on hands to fully extend and rapidly release arms. Observe rapidity and intensity of recoil to state of flexion. A brisk return to full flexion $=4$.

Popliteal angle. With infant supine and pelvis flat on firm surface, flex lower leg on thigh, then flex thigh on abdomen. While holding knee with thumb and index finger, extend lower leg with index finger of other hand. Measure degree of angle behind knee (popliteal angle). Angle of $<90$ degrees $=5$.

Scarf sign. With infant supine, support head in midline with one hand; use other hand to pull infant's arm across shoulder so that infant's hand touches shoulder. Determine location of elbow in relation to midline. Elbow does not reach midline $=4$.

Heel to ear. With infant supine and pelvis flat on firm surface, pull foot as far as possible toward ear on same side. Measure distance of foot from ear and degree of knee flexion (same as popliteal angle). Knees flexed with popliteal angle of $<90$ degrees $=4$.

Congruence between growth measures and maturity is an important consideration in newborn assessment. When a newborn demonstrates expected growth at a given gestational age (if within 2 standard deviations [SDs] from the mean), ${ }^{5}$ the infant is classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Infants whose growth exceeds standards for a given gestational age are considered large for gestational age (LGA), and conversely those whose growth is less than the standard for a given gestational age are classified as small for gestational age (SGA). ${ }^{5,6}$

Newborns are also classified by birth weight, and the terms normal birth weight, macrosomic, low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are applied. Tables 6.3 and 6.4 present newborn weight and gestational age classifications. The etiologies of gestational age at birth and birth weight vary and may include maternal, placental, or fetal influences that can impact successful transition. Each of the gestational age and birth weight subgroups, especially at extremes, carries potential for neonatal complications.

\section*{Low birth weight infants}

LBW infants are those infants born weighing less than 2500 g . VLBW infants are those infants born weighing less than 1500 g . at birth, and infants weighing $\leq 1000 \mathrm{~g}$ are considered ELBW. ${ }^{6}$ Factors that contribute to the risk for LBW include race and ethnicity, maternal age, maternal health and nutrition, substance abuse during pregnancy, environmental toxins, and access to prenatal care. ${ }^{8}$ Box 6.2 presents maternal risk factors for LBW and VLBW infants.

\section*{BOX 6.2}

\section*{Maternal Risk Factors for Low Birth Weight and Very Low Birth Weight Infants}

\section*{Maternal risks}
- Maternal age less than 16 or greater than 35 years of age
- Race and ethnicity
- Maternal chronic health conditions
- Maternal medications
- Nutritional status
- Environmental toxins or occupational chemical toxins
- Access to prenatal care

\section*{Maternal substance abuse}
- Alcoholism
- Tobacco use

- Over-the-counter drug use

Data from LaBronte KH: Recording and evaluating the neonatal history. In Tappero EP, Honeyfield ME, editors: Physical Assessment of the Newborn: A Comprehensive Approach to the Art of Physical Examination. Petaluma, 2015, NICU INC.

\section*{Small for gestational age}

Infants with birth weight below the 10th percentile for age are considered SGA. ${ }^{6}$ The head may be microcephalic, or small in proportion to the body, and head circumference may be below the fifth percentile for age. Fetal growth restriction may be symmetrical with all growth parameters smaller than expected, or asymmetrical with head sparing. The etiology of fetal growth abnormalities varies. Symmetric growth restriction may be due to intrinsic fetal conditions such as chromosomal abnormalities, whereas asymmetric growth restriction is often due to impaired placental perfusion or nutrient deprivation during fetal development. ${ }^{6}$ With adequate nutrition, SGA infants experience overall catch-up growth. Head circumference is normally the first growth parameter to show catch-up growth, followed by weight and then length.

Newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have restricted fetal weight, length, or head circumference (occipitofrontal head circumference [OFC]) due to a pathophysiologic process in utero (Box 6.3). ${ }^{6}$ IUGR infants are not necessarily SGA because an IUGR infant may be below expected weight but not below the 10th percentile for age.

\section*{Maternal factors}
- Maternal hypertension
- Maternal diabetes-poorly controlled
- Autoimmune disease
- Cardiac or respiratory disease

- Multiple gestations
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Fetal infection

Data from Gabbe, S: Intrauterine growth restriction. In Gabbe S, editor: Obstetrics: Normal and Problem Pregnancies, ed 6, Philadelphia, 2012, Saunders.

\section*{Large for gestational age}

LGA is defined as birth weight greater than the 90th percentile for age. ${ }^{6}$ The increased weight may result from fetal factors, which include genetic and chromosomal disorders, or from maternal factors, such as obesity or diabetes. Maternal hyperglycemia exposes the fetus to increased levels of glucose, which increases fetal insulin secretion. Increased insulin levels increase fat deposits in the fetus and often result in macrosomia, birth weight greater than $4000 \mathrm{~g} .^{4}$ Diabetic mothers who are insulin dependent and in poor control during the early trimesters of pregnancy have characteristically large infants (Fig. 6.4). LGA infants are at risk for birth trauma, neonatal asphyxia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. ${ }^{4}$

\section*{Assessment of growth parameters}

The assessment of the newborn begins with an evaluation of the stage of maturity and growth parameters. Measures normally included in the newborn assessment are weight, length, and the OFC. Table 6.5 shows the reference values for common growth measures in term infants. The abdominal and chest circumference are not typically included in the regular newborn examination in the absence of suspected clinical concerns.

OFC, Occipitofrontal head circumference.
For most accurate assessment of these measurements and subsequent plotting on a reference growth chart, the following is recommended:
- Length: measured as heel to crown with infant lying on flat surface ${ }^{2}$
- Head circumference: measured with tape just above the brow line to the occipital prominence. Note that transient head molding or overlapping of the cranial bones may affect this measurement. ${ }^{9}$
- Weight: obtained using a standardized scale; with infant unclothed or standardized measurement of diaper. Note that the newborn can lose up to $10 \%$ of birth weight during the first 72 hours following birth, due to contraction of the extracellular space. ${ }^{9}$
The current recommendation in the United States is to use the WHO growth record for infants up to 2 years of age. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Preparation for the examination}

Preparation and examination of the infant should ideally be in a well-lit room, while the infant is calm, and ensure that you are
applying warm hands and warmed equipment. ${ }^{10,11}$ The infant should be weighed on an appropriately calibrated weight scale, height measurement should be obtained on a firm surface, and flexible tape measure used for head circumference. See Chapter 2 for further discussion on accurate measurement. It is best to use a pediatric or neonatal stethoscope for auscultation, and an otoscope and ophthalmoscope is needed for the inspection of the ears and eyes.

The newborn assessment uses multiple examination techniques, most commonly inspection, auscultation, and palpation. ${ }^{9}$ Percussion and transillumination may be helpful in assessing certain organ systems (e.g., percussion with liver assessment) or to better evaluate some findings (e.g., transillumination for suspected hydrocele). ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Approach to physical examination}

The best approach to physical examination of the newborn is to approach the infant in the least disruptive manner and consider the infant's behavioral state to obtain the best results. Newborn behavioral states include: two sleep states, deep/quiet sleep, light/active sleep, as well as four awake states: drowsy, quiet alert, active alert, and crying. The examination should be conducted in a systematic manner because a consistent approach ensures that all aspects are evaluated. The provider also acknowledges that components of the exam itself (e.g., eye or kidney exam) may disturb the infant, and the unclothed infant can easily become cold stressed. Prior to touching the infant, much can be learned by observing the appearance of the undressed infant in the resting, nonstimulated state. General inspection should include determination of gender, identification of any deformities, determination of fetal nutrition, assessment of color, and position and movement.

The sequence of the physical assessment begins with the quiet parts of the examination-the cardiac and respiratory systems. The overall sequence of the exam may vary with the infant's behavioral state but may then proceed systematically from head to toe and may integrate inspection of multiple systems to take best advantage of infant's behavior and tolerance of the examination. Each body
system has relevant embryology, development, anatomic, and physiologic variations, and the pediatric health care provider is directed to the relevant system chapters in the text.

\section*{Skin}

The term newborn's skin is structurally similar to the adult. However, the immature infant's skin is thinner, friable and permeable, and more easily disrupted. The skin is assessed with the techniques of inspection and palpation. ${ }^{9}$ Although most skin findings are evident with inspection, palpation will allow additional characteristics, such as skin thickness and turgor, to be determined. ${ }^{12}$ Be sure to assess the entire skin surface including skin folds and scalp for subtle findings. ${ }^{9}$ The newborn's skin is typically covered with vernix, a cheesy-white odorless protective sebaceous secretion that may collect in the skin folds. Skin pigmentation varies with ethnic origin and is highly variable.

One essential skin assessment to make in the newborn is color, and the most reliable color indicator in the newborn is the mucous membranes and tongue. Newborn infants commonly exhibit acrocyanosis, cool and cyanotic hands and feet due to vasomotor instability of peripheral circulation; this is a normal finding in the otherwise healthy infant. ${ }^{9}$ Persistence of this finding beyond the first 24 to 48 hours may indicate poor perfusion due to cold stress, hypovolemia, or polycythemia. Central cyanosis is always considered abnormal and is evident when less than 5 g percent of desaturated hemoglobin is present. There may be associated etiologies such as cardiac or pulmonary disease, infection, metabolic and neurologic conditions, and hematologic issues such as anemia or polycythemia. Pallor, a pale or ashen appearance, can be due to poor perfusion, acidosis, or anemia. Plethora, a ruddy appearance, may indicate polycythemia. Both anemia and polycythemia may be associated with hypoxemia, although the appearance of cyanosis may be misleading. Because cyanosis becomes evident when there is 3 to 5 g of desaturated hemoglobin, cyanosis may present readily in polycythemic infants with otherwise normal oxygenation, whereas its presence with anemia requires substantial hypoxemia and low oxygen content of the blood.

Jaundice, a yellow discoloration of the skin, may occur from deposition of bilirubin. Clinical jaundice is a common newborn finding, occurring in up to $60 \%$ of healthy term infants during the first week of life. Jaundice typically follows a cephalocaudal distribution and is initially seen in the face and upper trunk. However, exaggerated clinical jaundice with associated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn may also result from hemolysis, and jaundice occurring in the first 24 hours of life is considered pathologic and warrants investigation. ${ }^{9,11-13}$

The newborn skin assessment may reveal lesions or rashes, most benign in nature and requiring no intervention (Table 6.6). Ecchymoses may be evident over presenting parts, such as the head or buttocks, or occur related to use of assistive devices such as forceps for delivery. Milia are pearly white papules typically found on the nose, brows, and cheeks. These epidermal cystic lesions are the result of accumulated sebaceous gland secretions and resolve spontaneously. Erythema toxicum occurs in nearly three-quarters of newborns and presents at approximately 24 to 48 hours as small yellowish-white papular lesions with erythematous bases on the face and trunk. The papules may persist intermittently until 2 weeks of age. Neither of these transient skin lesions requires intervention.

From Cohen B: Pediatric dermatology, ed 3, Philadelphia, 2005, Mosby, p 49.

Nevi and other hyperpigmented macular lesions may be common findings on the newborn skin. Blue-black spots, formerly termed mongolian spots, are hyperpigmented macules seen in $90 \%$ of Hispanic, Asian, and African American infants, and approximately $10 \%$ of white infants. These large lesions are found most commonly over the buttocks but may extend to the back and shoulders. These lesions represent infiltration of the dermis with melanocytes, generally fade over time, but may persist to adulthood. ${ }^{12}$ Nevus simplex is a common vascular lesion seen in up to $40 \%$ of newborns. It is commonly referred to as stork bite or salmon patch, is an irregularly edged macular lesion caused by dilated capillaries, and is most often found at the nape of the neck (stork bite), eyelid, bridge of nose, or lip. Due to the distended underlying capillaries, these lesions blanch with pressure and may increase in size over the first 1 to 2 years of life. Nevus flammeus, also known as port-wine nevus, is a flat pink to purple lesion of dilated capillaries with a regular edge. This lesion does not typically increase in size but also does not regress in size spontaneously and may require treatment with laser for elimination or reduction. Most of these lesions are isolated; however, an important variant is the lesion that follows the branches of the trigeminal nerve in the forehead and upper eyelid. This lesion may be associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a condition that may result in seizures and other system complications. ${ }^{9,11 \_13}$

In addition to hyperpigmented macules, the skin assessment may reveal strawberry or cavernous hemangiomas that consist of dilated capillaries and associated endothelial proliferation of dermis and subdermal skin layers. These lesions grow rapidly for the first 6 months and then typically begin to regress spontaneously. Important complications due to their dense capillary network are bleeding, ulceration, and infection. Depending on the location, hemangiomas may also grow in size to the point of obstructing the airway, necessitating treatment. As with port-wine nevi, there is an
association of cavernous hemangiomas with syndromes. ${ }^{12}$

\section*{Head}

Using the techniques of inspection and palpation, the infant's head is initially assessed for size, shape, presence of abnormal hair patterns, scalp defects, unusual lesions or protuberances, lacerations, and abrasions or contusions. Measurement of head circumference is performed and contrasted with anticipated norms (see Chapter 2, Fig. 2.2). The head size is considered normal, microcephalic (<2 SD or less than the 10th percentile), or macrocephalic ( $>2$ SD or greater than the 90th percentile) compared with established norms. Note that macrocephaly or microcephaly can be associated with other pediatric chromosomal and developmental conditions. ${ }^{14}$ The scalp is examined for bruising or other disruptions, such as lacerations, that might have occurred during delivery. Due to the influences of the birth process, there may be transient deformation in head shape and size. Table 6.7 and Fig. 6.5 presents some transient deformations of the head in newborns. (See Chapter 10 for further assessment of the head.)

One important cause of external cranial swelling is a subgaleal hemorrhage. ${ }^{5,14-16}$ This uncommon complication, estimated at 1.5 to 30 per 10,000 births, ${ }^{16}$ represents venous bleeding between the aponeurosis and the periosteum and can increase considerably in size over the first hours to days of life (Fig. 6.6). Subgaleal hemorrhage has an association with mechanically assisted deliveries, due to external shearing forces. ${ }^{15,}{ }^{16}$ The clinical presentation of subgaleal hemorrhage is a large boggy, shifting collection of fluid over the cranial surface unrestricted by the suture lines. The swelling may extend to the neck and behind the ears, lifting the ears forward. Because this subaponeurotic space is large, infants may quickly develop hypovolemia as a complication and must be vigilantly watched for this, as well as development of hyperbilirubinemia after red blood cell breakdown occurs. ${ }^{5,16}$

However, infants may remain asymptomatic, and the stable infant with a subgaleal hemorrhage may be observed clinically for 24 to 48 hours. Outcomes for infants who remain hemodynamically stable are good. ${ }^{16}$

The cranial bones are typically approximated but not fully fused until adolescence. This allows for some overlapping to occur during vaginal delivery or expansion to occur in the case of elevated intracranial pressure. There should be some slight movement appreciated at the level of the suture lines. Overlapping sutures can occur during vaginal birth in the term infant (Fig. 6.7). Craniotabes, a softening of the cranial bones, may be evident as a ping-pong ball sensation when pressure is exerted along the parietal or occipital margins. This is often a finding in preterm infants related to incomplete ossification and also in breech deliveries in term infants due to pressure during delivery. In term infants, it generally disappears within a few weeks. ${ }^{9}$

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 6.7 Newborn with overlapping sutures.}
\end{figure}

The fontanels are evaluated for size, shape, and fullness. The diamond-shaped anterior fontanelle, at the juncture of the frontal and parietal bone, varies in size from 1 to 4 cm and typically closes by 18 months of age. The triangular-shaped posterior fontanelle, at the juncture of the single occipital and parietal bones, may be dimple sized at birth, typically closes by 4 months, and is no longer appreciable by 1 year of age (see Chapter 10, Fig. 10.2). ${ }^{9}$ The hair is assessed for distribution, texture, amount and presence of whorls, or hypopigmentation. ${ }^{9}$

\section*{Face}

The facies are inspected for symmetry, gross presence of anomalies or deformation, and movement during the transition between infant behavioral states. Transient distortions can occur due to compression during delivery, prolonged delivery, and the use of forceps; these will typically resolve in a few days without intervention. Asymmetry of facies during crying, or inability to close the eye may be an indication of nerve injury occurring during delivery or from absence of musculature controlling facial movements. Typically the infant will have decreased movement on the ipsilateral side. ${ }^{5,7}$

\section*{Eyes}

Assessment of the eyes in the newborn is achieved by inspection, palpation, and selected use of the ophthalmoscope. Determine eye spacing and the intracanthal distance between the eyes. A narrower than normal distance between the eyes is known as hypotelorism, and wide-set eyes, hypertelorism, may be associated with other facial and systemic anomalies. The eyes are also assessed for slanting, determined by the relationship of the outer canthus with the helix of the ear. Upward or downward slanting of the eyes may be associated with congenital anomalies or syndromes. ${ }^{9,14}$

The color of the newborn's iris varies, from gray to brown to dark blue; actual eye color becomes permanent at approximately 6 months of age. ${ }^{9}$ The sclera is blue-white but may commonly have associated subconjunctival hemorrhages resulting from ruptured capillaries during delivery. Yellow sclera suggests hyperbilirubinemia and should be evaluated further. Tears are typically absent in the newborn due to incomplete lacrimal duct patency for the first few months of life.

The initial examination of the newborn's eyes may be difficult to perform because the eyelids often are edematous after delivery. Most infants will open their eyes spontaneously when held vertically in an environment with low ambient light. Pupillary reactivity can be evaluated in a dark room using a penlight; pupils are expectedly equal in size and reactive to light. The red light reflex or retinal light reflex should be present, indicating an intact cornea and lens. Note that in the infant, the retinal light reflex may vary from pale to slightly yellow depending on the racial/ethnic variability. Unequal or white reflexes are abnormal and may indicate cataracts or other opacity. ${ }^{9}$ Chapter 12 provides additional detail about the eye examination in the infant.

\section*{Ears}

The newborn ear exam applies the techniques of inspection and palpation. ${ }^{9}$ The term newborn demonstrates ready recoil when the pinna is folded inward. The ears are assessed for positioning, presence of deformities, swelling, bruising, pits, dimples, and tags. Malformed ears may be associated with other abnormalities, including chromosomal anomalies and congenital syndromes.

Uncommonly, preauricular or postauricular pits and tags may be associated with deafness or renal defects, although more often are inconsequential unless another anomaly is detected. ${ }^{9}$ The external auditory canals are grossly inspected for patency. The pinna is typically situated at or above an imaginary line from the inner to outer canthus of the eye; those ears situated below this line are considered low set. The tympanic membranes are not typically examined in the newborn due to difficulty visualizing as a consequence of short, collapsible canals and canals obscured with vernix. ${ }^{9,10}$ However, patency of the external canal should be determined during the newborn assessment. Hearing acuity can be determined by evaluation of cochlear response to or transmission of sound (Table 6.8). ${ }^{5}$

Common Newborn Diagnostic Screening Tests}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Screening & Diagnostic Test \\
\hline Hearing screening & Universal screening recommended (but not mandated) prior to hospital discharge; testing done by either automated auditory brainstem response (ABR) or otoacoustic emission (OAE); ABR tests cochlear response to sound and auditory pathways; OAE tests cochlear transmission of sound ${ }^{4,7}$ \\
\hline Screening for critical congenital heart disease & Universal screening recommended prior to discharge and after 24 h of age; testing done by pulse oximetry determination of oxygen saturation simultaneously in upper and lower extremity.

\section*{Nose}

The nares are inspected grossly for patency and symmetry. Patency can be assessed noninvasively by listening with a stethoscope at the level of the nares or suspending a thin cotton wisp under the nare and looking for rhythmic movement of the wisp. Attention is paid to not allowing the stethoscope or wisp to touch the nare directly, and the other nare should be occluded at the time of assessment. If the results of either of these tests is inconclusive, but discontinuity of the passage suspected, a small catheter can be introduced into the nares to the nasopharynx. ${ }^{9,14}$

\section*{Mouth}

The mouth, lips, gums, and palate are inspected and palpated. Assessment of the interior of the mouth includes examination of the gingiva, tongue, palate, and uvula. Cleft lip may be observed unilaterally or bilaterally; unilateral cleft lip primarily occurs left sided. A bilateral cleft lip is most commonly associated with cleft palate as well. ${ }^{5,14}$ Natal teeth that erupt prior to the first month of life may be present, typically as central incisors. These are similar to normal teeth but typically lack a developed root system and may fall out. Unless there is concern for aspiration or interference with feeding, there is no indication for removal. ${ }^{5}$ The sublingual frenulum should be inspected when the infant cries to determine position of attachment. If the sublingual frenulum is attached to the anterior portion or tip of the tongue, ankyloglossia or tongue-tied, this may interfere with infant feeding and require treatment. ${ }^{14}$

\section*{Neck}

The techniques of inspection and palpation are used to determine suppleness, symmetry, and range of motion and to detect any extraneous tissue or masses. The examiner assesses for the presence of cysts, clefts, dimples, masses, and redundant skin that may suggest a syndrome. The neck is manipulated side to side; limitations of full range of motion or head tilt may indicate congenital torticollis. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Chest}

The chest is inspected and palpated for size, shape, symmetry, and
contour. If measured, the chest circumference at the nipple line is approximately 2 to 3 cm less than the head circumference. ${ }^{9,13}$ There should be symmetric movement with respiratory effort. Due to the compliant newborn chest (an advantage during delivery), the sternum is drawn inward during inspiration. The clavicles are inspected and palpated to detect any swelling, tenderness, or crepitus. Any decreased movement or asymmetry of the Moro reflex on the affected side may suggest clavicular fracture. Clavicular fractures, for example, are a common birth injury, occurring in $0.2 \%-3.5 \%$ of births. These bony disruptions are evident as crepitus palpable in the clavicular region and may be confirmed by radiographic imaging. No treatment is indicated. ${ }^{5}$

The xyphoid process may be evident protruding at the distal end of the sternum. The measured spacing between the nipples is typically one-half of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest. The chest is inspected for presence of supernumerary nipples. Use of accessory muscles, evident as retractions, may indicate inability to sustain adequate inflation and may be a finding of pulmonary disease that needs further evaluation. The soft nature of the newborn's bony structures increases risks for disruptions. ${ }^{3}$ Chest deviations may include pectus excavatum, an inverted sternum that is usually not medically significant, and pectus carinatum, a protruding sternum that occurs predominantly in males $4: 1$ and can be associated with other abnormalities, including scoliosis, Marfan syndrome, and congenital heart disease. ${ }^{2,3}$

\section*{Lungs}

The lungs are auscultated for presence of bilateral, equal breath sounds. During the first postnatal hours, due to residual presence of alveolar fluid, the breath sounds may be moist. Respirations are typically "regularly irregular," with short periods of rapid rate followed by short pauses. However, pauses longer than 20 seconds are abnormal and warrant additional evaluation to rule out pulmonary disease or other disorders of transition. ${ }^{2,3}$ Normal respiratory rate is presented in Table 6.9.

\section*{Heart}

The cardiac examination commences with an inspection of the chest and palpation to determine the point of maximum impulse (PMI) that will shift following the first hours after birth as elevated fetal right-sided heart forces diminish once pulmonary ventilation is established. Heart sounds are auscultated, and determination of S1 and S2 and any adventitious sounds. Murmurs are common in the early newborn period due to changing cardiopulmonary dynamics postnatally. For example, a patent ductus arteriosus may be evident as a murmur best heard along the left lower sternal border. This sound typically decreases by 48 hours of age and is not associated with any other evidence of cardiac instability. ${ }^{9,13}$ Normal cardiac rates are presented in Table 6.10. Chapter 8 reviews innocent or physiologic murmurs that may be present during infancy.

Common Newborn Symptoms and Conditions}

\hline Presentation & Signs and Symptoms \\
\hline Transient tachypnea of newborn & Excessively rapid respirations usually due to retained fetal lung fluid; tachypnea subsides with absorption of fluid \\
\hline Acrocyanosis and circumoral cyanosis & Bluish discoloration of the surrounding the lips and of the hands and feet due to changes in newborn temperature \\
\hline Transient jitteriness & Rapid movements of newborn's arms and legs often with vigorous crying generally in response to stimuli; does not persist after early neonatal period and does not involve eye movements \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The cardiac exam also includes an assessment of pulses, including brachial and radial in the upper extremities and femoral
and pedal in the lower extremities. Perfusion is determined by blanching the skin over the abdomen or chest and allowing for return of color; a capillary filling time less than 3 seconds is considered within normal limits. ${ }^{9,13}$ Although norms exist for newborn blood pressure, it is not a typical component of the routine newborn exam. ${ }^{9}$

\begin{abstract}
Abdomen
The abdomen is inspected for contour and palpated for normal presence of internal organs and abnormal presence of masses. The abdominal circumference is measured just superior to the umbilicus at the largest diameter; it is approximately equal to head circumference by term. ${ }^{17}$ The newborn abdomen is rounded and soft. Use light and deep palpation in a circular area examining the four regions in sequence. Bowel sounds are evident within several hours postnatally, as swallowed air progresses distally. Diastasis recti, a separation of the abdominal musculature, may be evident as a midline bulge extending from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. This is due to failed fusion of the muscle and will resolve without intervention. The umbilicus is inspected for color and state of healing, as well as the presence of vessels. Typically, the cord remnant is opaque, blue-white, and odorless with evidence of two thick-walled arteries and one thin-walled vein. The presence of swelling or masses is noted because this may represent a herniation of abdominal contents. ${ }^{9,13}$

The liver is palpated as an upper right to midline region organ; the newborn liver may extend down 1 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. ${ }^{9}$ An alternative technique to direct palpation is to use the "scratch" technique and listen indirectly with a stethoscope to detect a change in percussion note. The spleen is also palpated, although typically not appreciated on the normal exam. Kidneys in the newborn are palpated; they are expectedly smooth, round, and approximately 4 to 5 cm in size. A bimanual technique is the easiest method for assessing the kidneys, approached with deep palpation at a 45-degree angle just below and lateral to the umbilicus. ${ }^{9,17}$
\end{abstract}

\section*{Genital and rectal}

The perianal area is assessed for the presence of a patent anus. Most
newborns will spontaneously pass stool within the first 48 hours of life and void within the first 24 hours of life. ${ }^{9}$ Failure to stool beyond this time may indicate obstruction and is an indication for further assessment. The femoral area is inspected and palpated. Bruising and swelling of the genitalia may be a common finding following delivery. However, an inguinal hernia that represents incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis may be evident as a compressible mass or swelling and may contain abdominal viscera. When examining the female genitalia, note the clitoris and labia minora are normally covered by the labia majora at term, and the urinary meatus is situated just below the clitoris. Hymenal tags are common, and pseudomenses may occur transiently due to the residual effects of maternal hormones. For the male, the average penile length measures 2.5 to 3.5 cm at term, and the urinary meatus is situated just ventral to the tip. Deviations of placement of the meatus include hypospadias, a ventral urethral opening, and epispadias, a dorsal urethral opening that occurs less commonly are indications for referral. The scrotum is inspected, and rugae as well as color and symmetry of the scrotal sac are assessed. The testes are palpated bilaterally for size, firmness, and tenderness. A hydrocele may be evident as a fluid-filled scrotal mass that transilluminates; this will resolve spontaneously (see Chapter 16 for review of male genitourinary conditions). ${ }^{2,9}$

\section*{Musculoskeletal, extremities, and spine}

Normal resting position of the term newborn is inward flexion of upper and lower extremities, although postnatal positioning is affected by the lie in utero. The extremities should be assessed for size, shape, range of motion, alignment and symmetry of movement, and presence/number of digits. ${ }^{9}$ The skin overlying the spine is inspected for lesions, pits, tags, and hair tufts; the dermis should be continuous without breaks. Abnormal curvature of the spine should be noted. The hips are assessed for stability and an evaluation for developmental dysplasia of the hips. The Barlow maneuver provokes an unstable hip to dislocate by adducting the hip and applying pressure posteriorly to force the femoral head over the posterior rim of the acetabulum. Conversely, the Ortolani maneuver reduces the dislocated hip by abducting the hip and
allowing the femoral head to slip back toward the acetabulum, creating an audible click and palpable sensation to the examiner (see Chapter 19, Fig. 19.15). ${ }^{2,5,18}$

\section*{Neurologic}

The neurologic assessment can be integrated throughout the physical assessment and takes notes of changes in posture, activity, state, or muscle tone during handling. Infants should exhibit changes, especially in response to stimuli. The infant who does not increase alertness when handled or exhibits tremors, clonus, or poorly coordinated activity, such as suck/swallow, deserves careful watching. ${ }^{2}$ Observing an infant successfully feeding, at breast or bottle, provides information about intactness of the cranial nerves. See Chapter 20, Table 20.5 for cranial nerve testing in newborn. Assessment of primitive reflexes is included in the newborn exam. Most primitive reflexes generate symmetric responses, and this provides important information about brainstem function. Common reflexes include the Moro (startle) reflex, stepping and placing, rooting and sucking, and plantar and palmar grasping (see Chapter 20, Table 20.3). These reflexes generally disappear by 3 to 4 months postnatally. ${ }^{15}$

\section*{Summary of examination}

A comprehensive neonatal assessment helps the pediatric provider to anticipate potential problems, detect subtle findings in the newborn that may be meaningful, and intervene readily to prevent or minimize further problems. The assessment should be generally performed within first 24 hours of life to identify any abnormality that would alter the normal newborn course or identify a medical condition that should be addressed.

Consistency in technique and organizational skill, as well as integration of infant behavioral state into the physical exam can help to ensure completeness in the comprehensive assessment. The comprehensive assessment of the newborn integrates components of the prenatal, perinatal, birth and early neonatal history with a thorough physical examination.

\section*{Skin assessment}

\section*{Renee P. McLeod}

It is easy to underestimate the importance of a thorough examination of the skin. Careful inspection of the skin gives the examiner clear insight into the overall health of the child. Along with inspection and a thorough health history, examination of the skin, hair, and nails provides clues to oxygenation, tissue perfusion, nutritional and hydration status of the child, and any underlying disease pathology or injury. ${ }^{1}$ The skin of an infant, child, and adult share similarities in structure and function, but a child's skin reacts differently to environmental demands because of the unique skin properties of each age group. All skin, regardless of age, is affected by seasonal factors such as the heat and humidity of summer or the dryness and low humidity of winter, but the differences in an infant's skin and ability to sweat compared with an adult's skin can create many more problems associated with these seasonal changes. Therefore, the manifestations of a skin disorder observed in an infant or child may vary widely from what may be seen in an adult. ${ }^{2}$

The skin is the largest organ in the body and has five distinct functions. The skin controls fluids, regulates temperature, protects against invasion from microbial and foreign bodies, and protects against damage from the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Finally, the skin is an organ of communication. Touch and skin-to-skin contact is one of the ways we bond with our mothers and families at birth and later bond with our sexual partners. Research conducted over the past 50 years has proven that touch is more
important to humans than food in regard to optimal development. ${ }^{3}$ ${ }^{5}$ Having a disease of the skin, hair, or nails that prevents or decreases human touch can be devastating to a child's self-esteem.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

The skin consists of three layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the subcutaneous layer (Fig. 7.1). The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and consists of two main layers: the stratum corneum and the cellular stratum. The stratum corneum is the very top layer of the skin and is composed of stacked, overlapping nonnucleated keratinized cells called corneocytes. The thickness of this layer depends on the region of the body, being thinnest on the face and thickest over the soles of the feet. ${ }^{2}$ This layer forms the protective barrier of the skin and contains the waterproofing protein keratin, which restricts water loss and penetration of a variety of substances through the skin. The innermost layer of the epidermis consists of a single row of columnar cells called basal cells, which reside in the stratum basale. These cells divide to form the keratinocytes that move to the surface through the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum lucidum to replace the cells that are sloughed off every day in the stratum corneum. ${ }^{2,}{ }^{6}$ The stratum basale also contains melanocytes, which synthesize melanin to provide color and protect the skin from damage by the UV rays of the sun. The dermalepidermal junction lies beneath the stratum basale and is an important site of attachment in the skin. This junction allows nutrients to pass through the dermis to the avascular epidermis. Langerhans cells lie in the suprabasal layer of the dermis and are the immunologic cells responsible for recognizing harmful antigens to the body. They process the antigen and enter into the blood stream residing in the regional lymph nodes and stimulate the production of T lymphocytes. ${ }^{2,6}$

\end{figure}

The dermis is a richly vascular layer consisting largely of fibroblasts and collagen. The collagen matrix of the dermis supports and separates the epidermis from the subcutaneous fat layer. Papillae project up into the epidermis to provide nourishment to the living epidermal cells. In addition, the dermis contains a large network of sensory nerve fibers. These fibers provide sensations of pain, itch, and temperature. Meissner corpuscles are encapsulated end organs of touch found in the dermal papillae close to the epidermis. They are most numerous in hairless portions of the skin such as the volar surfaces of the hands, fingers, feet, toes, lips, eyelids, nipples, and tip of the tongue. The dermis also contains autonomic nerve fibers that innervate blood vessels, the arrectores pilorum muscles, the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair, and nails.

The sweat glands in the dermis control thermoregulation by
releasing water through the skin. The eccrine sweat glands are distributed throughout the body except for the lip margins, eardrums, nail beds, inner surface of the prepuce, and the glans penis. ${ }^{7}$ They are most abundant on the palms and soles of the feet. The apocrine sweat glands are larger and deeper than the eccrine glands and secrete an odorless white fluid (sweat) in response to emotional or physical stimuli. They are located in the axillae, around the nipples or areolae, anogenital area, eyelids, and external ears. Body odor in adolescence comes from bacterial decomposition of the sweat produced by these glands; activation of these glands earlier than adolescence should be investigated. Neonates have the ability to respond to thermal stress by sweating, though it requires a greater thermal stimulus. This response is less developed in premature infants and increases with postnatal age. ${ }^{8}$ Full-term infants are also able to respond to emotional stress by sweating, though this is not developed in the premature infant. This has clinical implications related to increased insensible water loss and thermoregulation in infants at risk. ${ }^{9}$

The sebaceous glands arise from the hair follicles deep within the dermis. The oil produced by these glands is called sebum, a lipidrich substance that helps lubricate the skin and hair. Sebaceous glands depend on hormonal stimulation and are activated by androgens at puberty. The level of oil produced varies throughout the life span. In the newborn, the production of sebum is accelerated while still under the influence of maternal hormones, and the glands themselves become hyperplastic until maternal hormones wane in the infant's body. This stimulated activity results in skin conditions in the newborn such as neonatal acne. Overactive sebaceous glands appear again in adolescence and contribute to the common skin conditions acne vulgaris and tinea versicolor. ${ }^{2}$

The nail bed starts to keratinize to form a hard, protective plate around 8 to 10 weeks of gestation. It sits on a highly vascular bed that gives each nail its color. The cuticle, or eponychium, the white crescent-shaped area at the end of the nail matrix, is the root and site of nail growth (Fig. 7.2A and B). It is covered by a layer of stratum corneum that pushes up and over the lower part of the nail body. The perionychium is the soft tissue that surrounds the nail border on each digit. Nail health can be affected by several factors,
including nutrition, hydration, local infection/irritation, and systemic disease.

\caption{FIGURE 7.2 (A and B) Anatomy of nail.}
\end{figure}

The subcutaneous layer of the skin is composed of adipose tissue. This layer connects the dermis to underlying organs, provides insulation and shock absorption, and generates heat for the body. It also provides a reserve of calories for use by the body. ${ }^{9}$ Premature and small for gestational age infants often lack this critical layer of insulation, which causes difficulty with thermoregulation.

Hair, eyebrows, and nails are part of the anatomical structure of the skin. Hair is formed by epidermal cells that go deep into the dermal layer of the skin and consists of a root, a shaft, and a follicle (Fig. 7.3). The papilla is the structure at the base of the hair follicle and is made of connective tissue and loop of capillaries, which supply and nourish the hair to promote growth. Melanocytes, which lie in the hair shaft, supply color to the hair.

\end{figure}

\section*{Developmental variations}

In the newborn, all the hair on the body consists of fine lanugo hair -all of the hair is in the same phase of growth. Within the first 4 months after birth, infants undergo a period of physiologic hair shedding to convert actively growing hairs to the resting phase and start the process of nonsynchronized growth phases. This normal process may already be complete at birth for infants with light hair who often appear completely bald at birth. This process may be
delayed for up to 4 months in dark-haired individuals. ${ }^{9}$ As the lanugo is shed, it is replaced by hair that is increased in diameter and coarseness; the first to form are vellus hairs, which are short, fine, soft, and nonpigmented hairs on the body. Then adult-type terminal hairs, which are coarse, thick, longer, pigmented, and grow on the scalp and eyebrows. During adolescence, vellus hairs located in androgen-sensitive areas, pubic area, axillae, and the face in males undergo a similar transition to terminal hairs.

Hair follicles grow in a nonsynchronized fashion, with $85 \%$ to $95 \%$ in the growth phase lasting 2 to 6 years, $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ in the resting phase lasting 2 to 3 months, and less than $1 \%$ in the involution phase which lasts 2 to 3 weeks. There are approximately 100,000 to 150,000 hairs on the scalp. Daily hair loss varies between shampoo days and nonshampoo days, with adults losing 40 to 100 hairs on a nonshampoo day and 200 to 300 hairs on a shampoo day. Hair density has to decrease by half before there is noticeable hair thinning. ${ }^{10,11}$

\section*{Physiological variations}

The stratum corneum does not develop until between 23 and 25 weeks of gestation. Extremely premature infants are born without this critical top layer of skin and therefore have no protective barrier and are not able to control water loss. They need protection from the environment and can tolerate only the least amount of touching. The term newborn has a fully functional stratum corneum, but it is only about $60 \%$ of the thickness of adult skin depending on the location. A thin stratum corneum with the larger body surface area/weight ratio of the newborn may allow substances placed on the skin to pass more easily through to the bloodstream. ${ }^{912}$ The blood vessels continue to mature into a more adult pattern until 3 months after birth. The nerves in the skin are small and poorly myelinated at birth. The growth and myelination of the nerve fibers continue on into puberty (Table 7.1).

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

Recent research has shown skin pigmentation or melanin should be considered as a factor for understanding some underlying skin properties and characteristics, particularly in children of multiracial ancestry. Understanding how underlying skin color and pigmentation may affect the examination and diagnosis of skin conditions allows the clinician to adjust assessment techniques and interventions using the child or adolescent's physiological characteristics rather than racial or ethnic categorization to guide care. ${ }^{1}$

Assessing skin pigmentation allows the health care provider to make clinical decisions based on tissue perfusion, jaundice, pallor, cyanosis, and blanch response. The blanch test differs widely based on underlying skin color. The blanch test differentiates healthy skin
from erythematous skin that is nonblanchable when gentle pressure from fingertips is exerted on the skin, blood is temporarily forced out of the region, causing the skin to appear lighter than the normal skin color. In individuals with lighter skin pigmentation, the skin color returns swiftly as the blood refills the dermal capillaries. It may be difficult to determine this response in a darker pigmented or darker skinned individual. Individuals with darker skin often have a purplish tinge rather than a reddish tinge when erythema is present and often have a more follicular pattern (Fig. 7.4).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-184.jpg?height=1286&width=1295&top_left_y=965&top_left_x=379}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 7.4 Insect bites on lower leg of pigmented and nonpigmented skin.}
\end{figure}

Postinflammatory hypopigmentation, absence of normal melanin, and hyperpigmentation, increased melanin, occur more frequently in darker skinned individuals, and conditions such as
acne or eczema can produce significant skin color changes from postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. African American, Asian, and Hispanic children are also at higher risk of keloid scarring. A keloid is a type of scar at the site of a healed skin injury resulting from an overgrowth of granular tissue composed of collagen (see Table 7.3). Lighter skinned individuals may have more recognizable signs of skin breakdown, sun exposure, and tissue perfusion than darker skinned individuals. Looking at the sclerae, conjunctivae, buccal mucosa, lips, tongue, and nail beds will assist the health care provider in assessing children and adolescents with significant clinical variations in pigmentation and skin color. Variations of skin pigmentation with darker skinned individuals normally occur on the palms, soles of feet, nail beds, and the genital area. Freckling of the buccal cavity, gums, and tongue is also common. Areas that get regular exposure to the sun may have much darker pigmentation.

Other variations related to skin pigmentation or melanin may exist in the barrier properties of the skin and in the distribution of hair follicles. Variations in barrier properties and hair follicle distribution are significant because skin in darker pigmented individuals may provide more of a barrier against absorption of topically applied drugs and cosmetics. The barrier function may also prevent the penetration of some toxins. ${ }^{12-14}$ The variation in barrier properties of the skin contributes to darker skinned individuals having an increased incidence of xerosis, abnormal dryness of the skin with a loss of natural skin shine, which presents as a whitish visual appearance in darkly pigmented skin. ${ }^{13,14}$

Hair follicle distribution and hair quality differ greatly with racial and ethnic background. African Americans have hair that is often coated in natural oils, and the frequent use of hair oils and braiding may make it difficult to accurately assess lesions on the scalp. African American children and adolescents have a higher incidence of tinea capitis, which may be due to the increased coiling of the hair shaft, and require more prolonged medical management. Some of these hair qualities are present in multiracial children, and it may be confusing to a mother or parent who does not have similar hair qualities. Hair, skin, and nail care practices vary widely among cultures and within cultures. Timing of a child's first haircut is one such cultural variation. In many Asian and Latino cultures, it is
common to shave the infant's head between 3 and 9 months of age in the belief the hair will grow in thick and long. In some cultures, shaving of the head is part of a religious ceremony. Some African American communities believe an infant's hair should not be cut until he or she begins walking.

Health care providers should be sensitive and attentive to the differences in skin quality and skin integrity when caring for children, adolescents, and families from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, and should encourage and support cultural practices that preserve the family culture except when a skin care practice or treatment is harmful and impacts the healthy development of the skin.

\section*{System-specific history}

A careful age-appropriate history is critical to making an accurate assessment of the skin (see the Information Gathering table). The health care provider needs to gather information related to current skin conditions, any significant past medical history, and family history of chronic skin conditions. Skin care routines and any recent changes in skin, hair, or nail care habits should be assessed. Sun exposure habits and application of sunscreen are also important considerations in the assessment of the skin. Box 7.1 presents symptom-focused information gathering for skin conditions in children.

\section*{Physical assessment}

The skin is one of the most accessible and easily examined organs of the body and is often the organ of most concern to children, adolescents, and parents. A complete examination of the skin using a consistent, systematic approach will increase the likelihood that important findings critical to making a diagnosis will not be missed. Always avoid making a quick diagnosis after only a brief inspection of an area of exposed skin or examining only the lesion of concern. A deliberate and methodical assessment of the skin will lead to a correct diagnosis and prevent missing important clues. During inspection, any changes in the skin should be palpated, inspected, and classified by morphology, size, color, texture, firmness, configuration, location, and distribution. The color, turgor, texture, temperature, and moisture of the skin and the growth, and texture of the hair and nails should also be noted.

Dermatology has its own language. Using the correct terminology facilitates accurate description of skin lesions. A skin lesion refers to any variations or skin changes. If the inspection and palpation of the skin reveal a lesion, more examination is necessary. Skin lesions may be primary or secondary (Tables 7.2 and 7.3). A primary lesion is the initial lesion of a skin condition, and identifying the primary lesion is the most important step in assessing skin conditions in children and assists clinicians in diagnosis. A secondary lesion often develops as a skin condition progresses such as infection, trauma or with skin therapy.

A rash cannot be diagnosed by listening to a description over the phone, and pediatric health care providers should avoid this type of assessment. It is important to conduct a complete skin examination before making a diagnosis. It is usually very easy to do a complete skin assessment on a newborn, but there may be a great deal of resistance from many adolescents to the idea of a complete skin exam. When the child or adolescent is uncomfortable being completely undressed because of developmental stage or cultural belief, then the assessment of the skin must be conducted using a systematic approach that divides the skin into areas that are sequentially uncovered, examined, and then re-covered before going on to the next area. In infants and young children, this may also prevent unnecessary cooling of the skin.

Telemedicine, as a method to deliver healthcare, may allow a complete assessment of the skin using a computer and peripheral devices. Patients that are not able to physically come to the clinical or office may now have an option that allows both initial assessment and diagnosis and follow-up of skin diseases. Patients are often more comfortable showing their skin, hair, and nails in the home setting using a computer. The high-resolution cameras that are available today on personal computers and tablets and the magnifier peripheral devices (dermascopes) available provide excellent visualization of the skin with proper instructions to the patient for lighting and technique. The "store and forward" feature of most telemedicine software allows the practitioner to easily forward pictures for consultation with a pediatric dermatologist when a diagnosis is uncertain. ${ }^{15,16}$

\section*{Inspection}

Inspection of the skin is best conducted using natural light. If that is
not available, a well-lit room with fluorescent or incandescent lighting may be satisfactory. A magnifying glass and a measuring tool such as paper tape measure will be helpful for examining small skin lesions and moles. It may be necessary to follow the progress of lesions over time to determine an accurate diagnosis. A light for transillumination of lesions or for closer inspection may also be helpful. A photo inserted in the medical chart or electronic medical record may be useful when following a skin condition or using Telederm to consult with dermatology. In addition, a photo showing a ruler next to the skin lesion can assist in evaluating changes in lesions over time.

Hair should be examined carefully by sitting the child in a chair rather than on the examination table so the hair can be viewed from above. Use a magnified light source whenever possible as overhead lighting or natural light is often not sufficient for examination of the scalp and hair. Be sure to assess terminal and vellus hairs for changes. Note distribution, color, and quantity. Check for any lesions, dryness, oiliness, scaling, or infestation on the scalp.

A tool that is very important in examining the hair is a hair card, which is a $3 \times 5$ inch $^{2}$ card, white on one side and black on the other, with a centimeter ruler down one side to demonstrate new hair growth. The hair card allows the provider to assess new hair growth, temporal recession, and the dimensions of hair loss in both dark hair and light hair (Fig. 7.5). To assess hair density, part the hair starting at the frontal hairline and repeat the parts at 1 -inch intervals, noting the spacing between the hairs. While noting color, scale, papules, pustules, and crusting on the scalp, note hair density from front to back of the scalp.

Some hair loss is common in older infants and children. In infants, hair loss after the neonatal period may be due to birthmarks, birth trauma, inflammation such as seborrheic dermatitis, or infections such as tinea capitis. The majority of hair loss in infants and children is nonscarring, and the hair grows back once the underlying condition is corrected. ${ }^{11,}{ }^{15}$ Excessive hair shedding can be measured by the hair pull test. Grasp 30 to 40 closely grouped hairs at the scalp using the thumb and index finger and gently but firmly pulling the hair away from the scalp. For the hair tug test, gather a cluster of hair at the scalp and use the other hand to tug the distal ends of the hair. This assesses hair fragility, and fragile hair will break off in small clusters. ${ }^{10,11}$ Excessive hair loss or excessively fragile hair requires further diagnostics; refer as indicated.

Nails should be examined for shape, color, and texture. Nail
changes may be an early sign of systemic disease (Table 7.4). Artificial nails or nail polish can interfere with the assessment. Inspect the curvature of the nail for clubbing (see Chapter 8, Fig. 8.5) or spooning and feel the surface for ridges. Changes in coloration or splinter hemorrhages in the nail should be noted. Finally, check the periungual tissue of the nail and note any redness, edema, induration, or tenderness. Absence or atrophy of the nails in the newborn period may indicate a congenital syndrome and requires consultation and referral for further diagnostics. ${ }^{17,18}$

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation of the skin should be done with warm hands using gloves if you think the child or adolescent may have an infectious lesion. Palpate skin temperature using the back of your hand, and compare the temperature of one area of skin to another area of skin using both hands. Temperature cannot be assessed accurately through gloves, and the presence of a fever should always be checked using a thermometer. Check for skin turgor, resiliency, or elasticity of the skin, by gently pinching a fold of the child's skin over the abdomen between your thumb and forefinger and then releasing it. Skin turgor can give important clues to the hydration and nutritional status of a child. How long the skin remains tented after it is released will provide clues to the degree of dehydration (Table 7.5).

\section*{Skin conditions}

\section*{Skin lesions}

The morphology or characteristic form and structure of skin lesions should be identified when any condition is noted during the assessment of the skin. Attention should be made to the distribution
and pattern of lesions. Becoming familiar with four or five distinct morphologic patterns such as acneiform, annular, or linear eruptions and the associated findings will assist in making a diagnosis. The distribution refers to the location of skin findings, whereas pattern refers to the specific anatomical or physiological arrangement of the lesions. Note the shape of skin lesions and whether they are clustered together or scattered. The border or margin, any associated findings such as central clearing, and the pigmentation of the lesion also should be identified. Find and study the primary lesion and examine the distribution of any other skin lesions or skin variations. Skin lesions should be classified as primary or secondary (see Tables 7.2 and 7.3). Box 7.2 illustrates the color, borders, configuration, and distribution of lesions. Common newborn and infant skin conditions are presented in Chapter 6, Table 6.6.

\section*{Documentation}

Avoid the use of a specific diagnosis when describing a lesion in the objective physical findings, such as diaper rash or candidiasis, a
common fungal infection in infants. Accurate charting using the correct terminology and photos allows other health care providers to visualize the skin lesions and provide the necessary follow-up to evaluate a change or improvement in skin lesions. The wide use of smartphones with high-resolution digital cameras by individuals and families from all economic and social backgrounds makes the tracking of skin lesions and skin conditions at home a possibility for health care providers. The ability to digitally visualize lesions over time may prevent the child and family from returning to the clinical setting for frequent follow-up visits. In electronic medical record (EMR) systems, customizing a charting template for assessment of the skin with dermatological terms and adding a glossary of dermatological definitions provides accurate, consistent descriptions of skin lesions by different providers, and saves time when charting. Many EMR systems allow photos to be inserted into the medical record. These photos may be taken by the provider or by the family and submitted by text message or e-mail to the provider to enhance accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow up.

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Skin disorders may vary widely when observed in an infant or child, as compared with the same skin disorder when seen in an adult.
- Extremely premature infants are born without the stratum corneum, have limited ability to control water loss, and can tolerate a limited amount of touch.
- Term newborns have a fully functional stratum corneum, which is about $60 \%$ the thickness of adult skin.

\section*{Embryological development}

The heart begins to form in the fetus by the end of the third week after conception. A crescent-shaped structure is formed that fuses at the midline to create a single linear heart tube (Fig. 8.1). As the primitive heart tube elongates, it differentiates into the atria, ventricles, bulbus cordis, and truncus arteriosus. The conduction system also begins to form at this time. Valve formation begins around the fourth to fifth week after conception, and the formation of the heart is complete by the eighth week after conception. Any early changes in this process caused by genetic, maternal, or external environmental factors can lead to structural malformations of the heart.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 8.1 Fetal development of the heart.}
\end{figure}

During fetal life, the lung sacs are collapsed and blood is oxygenated through the placenta. Oxygenated blood travels from the placenta to the heart via the umbilical veins and ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava (IVC) and into the right atrium (RA). Blood then streams to the left atrium (LA) through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and into the left ventricle (LV), which pumps it out the aorta (Fig. 8.2). The less saturated venous blood traveling from the superior vena cava (SVC) and coronary sinus also flows to the RA, but is directed toward the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA). High pulmonary vascular resistance limits blood flow into the lungs, which are not yet involved in ventilation, and redirects it through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to the descending aorta and lower body.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 8.2 Fetal cardiac circulation.}
\end{figure}

With a baby's first breaths, pulmonary vascular resistance falls, causing a dramatic increase in pulmonary blood flow. The ensuing increase in pulmonary venous return to the heart raises LA pressure, causing closure of the PFO. Arterial oxygen saturation increases as a result of improved oxygenation by the lungs. This higher saturation promotes functional closure of the PDA by 48 to 72 hours after birth, with complete anatomical closure occurring by 2 to 3 weeks of age. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Anatomy of the postnatal heart}

The heart is composed of four chambers. The upper chambers (atria) are low-pressure receiving chambers, and the lower
chambers (ventricles) are high-pressure pumping chambers. The heart is further divided into right and left sides. The $R A$ receives deoxygenated blood from the body, and the $R V$ pumps it out the pulmonary artery to the lungs to become oxygenated. The $L A$ receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, and the $L V$ pumps it out the aorta to the body (Fig. 8.3). The LV operates at a higher pressure than the RV. This normal circulation occurs in series, and there is no mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood.

There are four valves in the heart that regulate blood flow between the atria and ventricles. The atrioventricular (AV) valves regulate blood flow between the atria and ventricles, and the semilunar valves regulate blood flow between the ventricles and great vessels. The tricuspid valve on the right and the mitral valve on the left are the AV valves (see Fig. 8.3). The pulmonic valve, located at the base of the pulmonary artery between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve, located at the base of the aorta between the aorta and LV, are the semilunar valves. Closure of these valves produces the heart sounds commonly referred to as "lub-dub" ( $\mathrm{S}_{1}, \mathrm{~S}_{2}$ ).

\section*{Physiological variations}

In preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus may remain open for several weeks after birth, causing hemodynamic instability. Medical intervention with a prostaglandin inhibitor, such as the drug indomethacin, or surgical ligation of the ductus is required to stabilize the infant.

\section*{System-specific history}

A careful and systematic history needs to be performed at each developmental stage to monitor the overall health status of infants and children, to identify those with cardiac symptoms, and to recognize signs of cardiac disease. The Information Gathering table presents the relevant age-related questions to ask about the
cardiovascular system and questions related to maternal infections and maternal medical conditions that place infants at high risk for congenital heart disease (CHD).

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Infants with CHD may have tachypnea (rapid, shallow breathing) and tachycardia, but typically do not present in respiratory distress (i.e., retractions, grunting, nasal flaring) unless there is a significant increase in pulmonary blood flow or poor systemic output with acidosis.

\section*{Information Gathering for Assessing the Cardiovascular System at Key Developmental Stages}

Some dysrhythmias are genetic in origin and run in families. \\

\section*{Physical assessment}

The cardiac examination must be systematic and tailored to the child's developmental level (Fig. 8.4). A complete assessment of the cardiac system must be done in order to make conclusions about the significance of any single abnormality. Cardiac findings should not be taken in isolation.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-213.jpg?height=734&width=926&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=562}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 8.4 Cardiac examination of the toddler.}
\end{figure}

It is important to consistently plot height, weight, and head circumference in infants and children up to 2 years of age to evaluate whether the growth rate is proportional and to monitor for failure to thrive (FTT). For infants, any drop-off in weight percentiles as compared with length and head circumference values should raise the suspicion of CHD. ${ }^{1}$ Temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate should be measured and assessed. Fever and respiratory distress both can elevate heart rate.

Blood pressure should be measured whenever possible during physical examinations, but definitely once in infancy and then routinely after 3 years of age. ${ }^{2}$ Coarctation of the aorta and systemic hypertension can go undetected if blood pressure measurements are omitted during well-child visits. If measured, blood pressure in infants should be taken in all four extremities or at a minimum in the right arm and in one leg to detect a coarctation of the aorta. In children, simultaneous palpation of the radial and femoral pulses is also important in assessing whether a coarctation may be present.

\section*{Inspection}

Note general appearance and activity level and whether the child is alert, lethargic, or appears ill. Note nutritional status and the proportion of weight to height and head circumference. Also, note whether any unusual facial or other external features are present that may indicate the presence of a chromosomal syndrome or
congenital anomaly. Examine for any surgical scars on the sternum and chest area that would indicate a previous surgical procedure. Note shape of chest and any presence of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum (see Chapter 9).

\section*{Color}

Note whether the child is pale or cyanotic, and assess color under natural light if possible. Pallor can occur in infants who are anemic, who have vasoconstriction due to congestive heart failure (CHF), or who are in shock. Children with cyanotic heart disease will appear blue or ruddy, especially around the perioral area-tongue and mucous membranes-because of right-to-left shunting of blood at the arterial level.

\section*{Clubbing}

Clubbing occurs when arterial desaturation has been present for at least 6 months or longer. The fingers and toes become red and shiny, and progress to wide, thick digits with eventual loss of the normal angle between the nails and the nail beds (Fig. 8.5). ${ }^{2}$ With early surgical treatment of cyanotic heart defects in infancy, severe clubbing is an unusual finding.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\end{figure}

\section*{Palpation}

Pulses need to be evaluated for their presence or absence, intensity, timing, symmetry, and whether the pulse is regular or irregular, weak or bounding. A comparison also should be made as to right and left symmetry and quality of pulses in the upper and lower extremities. A pulse that is absent or weaker in the lower extremities compared with the upper extremities is diagnostic of coarctation of the aorta. A strong pedal pulse is a good indication that there is no coarctation. Irregular pulses may be due to an arrhythmia. Weak and thready pulses may indicate poor perfusion or shock, whereas bounding pulses are usually noted with aortic runoff lesions such as a PDA, AV malformation, or aortic insufficiency. ${ }^{2}$ Peripheral perfusion is also important to assess, especially in infants. Normally, extremities should be warm to the touch and have a brisk capillary refill time (CRT) of less than 3 seconds-a quick measure of cardiac output. Older children with cardiac conditions may have weak distal pulses on one side or the other because of previous cardiac catheterizations or cardiac surgeries.

Normal liver size is usually 1 to 2 cm below the right costal margin. In conditions of abnormal cardiac position, or situs (positional abnormalities), the liver edge is midline or on the left side of the abdomen. Hepatomegaly, or liver engorgement, is a consistent indicator of right heart failure when noted in conjunction with other cardiac findings.

The precordium should be palpated to determine the location of the point of maximal impulse, or PMI. The PMI is important in determining ventricular overload, cardiomegaly, and the presence or absence of thrills. Normally, the PMI is felt at the apex in the left midclavicular line, indicating LV dominance. However, it is normal for newborns and infants to have a greater RV impulse, with the PMI felt at the left lower sternal border (LLSB). A PMI that is diffuse and rises slowly is called a heave, and a PMI that is sharp and well localized is known as a tap. ${ }^{2}$

A thrill indicates turbulent blood flow and is never normal. It is
felt as a vibratory sensation on palpation and should be examined not only on the precordium but also in the suprasternal notch and over the carotid arteries. Precordial thrills are best felt with the palm of the hand, whereas thrills in the suprasternal notch and over the carotid arteries are best felt with the fingertips. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Palpation of the liver for enlargement is a critical indicator of overall fluid status in infants and children with CHF.

\section*{Auscultation}

Auscultation of heart sounds in children should be done in a stepwise fashion, and with both the diaphragm and the bell of a stethoscope to elicit both high (diaphragm) and low (bell) frequency sounds (Fig. 8.6). Children with a thin chest wall have heart sounds that are louder than in adults. However, the faster heart rate can make it difficult to accurately distinguish the heart sounds from other adventitious sounds, particularly in early infancy. In children who are overweight or obese, heart sounds are softer due to the increase in adipose tissue. Thus it is recommended that the individual heart sounds be identified first and then analyzed before identifying murmurs.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 8.6 Auscultation of the heart sounds.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Heart sounds}

The first heart sound is called $S_{1}$ and is created by the closure of the tricuspid and mitral valves. It is usually heard best at the LLSB or at the apex. A split $S_{1}$ can be a normal but uncommon finding in children. ${ }^{2}$

The second heart sound is called $S_{2}$ and is created by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. It is usually heard best at the left upper sternal border (LUSB). Evaluation of $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ is critical in children because it provides important clues as to the presence of structural defects and to the pressures in the heart. $S_{2}$ normally varies with respiration-split with inspiration and single or narrowly split in expiration. A fixed split, single $S_{2}$, or loud $S_{2}$ warrants referral and further evaluation by a cardiologist. Abnormal splitting of the $S_{2}$
may indicate increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary valve abnormality, or a cyanotic heart condition. A loud single $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ may indicate pulmonary hypertension or malposition of the great arteries. ${ }^{2}$

A third heart sound ( $S_{3}$ ) can be a common finding in children and young adults. $S_{3}$ can be heard at the apex and is caused by vibrations in the ventricle as it fills rapidly during diastole.

A fourth heart sound ( $S_{4}$ or gallop rhythm) is rare in infants and children. An $S_{4}$ is an abnormal finding and suggests decreased ventricular compliance in conditions such as CHF. ${ }^{2}$

Ejection clicks are extra heart sounds that occur between $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{S}_{2}$. They are heard best at the upper sternal border and are usually associated with stenotic semilunar valves or dilated great arteries. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Murmurs}

Murmurs are produced when blood flows across an area that has a pressure difference and causes turbulence or disturbed flow. Murmurs should be assessed and evaluated according to their timing in the cardiac cycle, location, transmission, intensity, frequency, and quality. ${ }^{2}$ It is always important to note whether a murmur radiates to the lung fields, axillae, clavicles, or neck. A normal grading scale is used to describe a murmur's intensity (Table 8.1).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{TABLE 8.1
Grading Scale for Cardiac Murmurs}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Grade Sound} \\
\hline 1 & Barely audible and softer than usual heart sounds \\
\hline 2 & Still soft, but about as loud as usual heart sounds \\
\hline 3 & Louder than usual heart sounds, but without a thrill \\
\hline 4 & Louder than usual heart sounds, and with a thrill \\
\hline 5 & Can be heard with stethoscope barely on chest (rare) \\
\hline 6 & Can be heard with stethoscope off chest, or with naked ear (extremely rare) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Data from Park M: Pediatric Cardiology for Practitioners, ed 6, St. Louis, 2014, Mosby/Elsevier.

Murmurs are described in relation to their timing during the cardiac cycle-systolic, diastolic, or continuous. Systolic murmurs occur between $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, and diastolic murmurs are heard after $S_{2}$. Systolic murmurs are further described as ejection crescendodecrescendo, or regurgitant long systolic-decrescendo. Fig. 8.7 illustrates the difference between ejection and regurgitant murmurs in relation to when they occur in the cardiac cycle.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-219.jpg?height=1326&width=855&top_left_y=833&top_left_x=593}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 8.7 Systolic ejection and regurgitant
murmurs. Source: (Modified from Park M: Pediatric Cardiology for Practitioners, ed 6, St. Louis, 2014, Mosby/Elsevier, p. 28.)}
\end{figure}

Systolic ejection murmurs begin shortly after the first heart sound, are due to semilunar valve or great vessel stenosis, usually vary in intensity, and are diamond-shaped. They can be short or long in duration but usually end before $S_{2}$. Regurgitant murmurs
typically begin with $\mathrm{S}_{1}$, although they usually do not obscure it; are the result of mitral or tricuspid valve insufficiency; and can be long or short in duration. Holosystolic murmurs obscure $S_{1}$ at their maximal or loudest point and are usually caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD). ${ }^{2}$

Diastolic murmurs occur between $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ and are described as early, mid, or late. Diastolic murmurs are usually caused by aortic or pulmonic regurgitation or mitral stenosis and are never normal. ${ }^{2}$

Continuous murmurs begin in systole and continue without interruption through $\mathrm{S}_{2}$ and into diastole. They are usually caused by conditions in which vascular shunting occurs throughout the cardiac cycle, such as in PDA or a surgical aorta-to-pulmonary shunt. A continuous murmur from a PDA has a machinery-like quality, is best heard in the left clavicular area or back, and has a crescendo-decrescendo shape. ${ }^{2}$

The origin of a murmur is usually found at the point where the murmur is heard the loudest. The location of the murmur provides valuable information regarding the cardiac malformation. If a murmur is heard throughout the chest, the area of highest frequency will define its origin. For example, a systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the axillae and back is usually pulmonary in origin, and one that radiates to the neck and carotid arteries is typically aortic in origin. The frequency or pitch of a murmur is a good indicator of the pressure gradient across a valve or septal defect. The higher the pressure gradient, the higher the frequency of the murmur.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Innocent murmurs occur in up to $50 \%$ of normal children. ${ }^{1}$ They are a common finding in infants and children, and do not always signify heart disease.

\section*{Physiologic versus pathologic murmurs}

It is important to distinguish physiologic, or innocent, murmurs from pathologic murmurs (Table 8.2). Innocent murmurs occur in
up to $50 \%$ of normal children. ${ }^{1}$ They are systolic ejection murmurs that are usually heard best at the LLSB and have a vibratory or musical quality (Fig. 8.8). They tend to be short and well located. They are usually no louder than grade 2 to 3 in intensity and are often accentuated during high output states such as exercise, stress, anemia, or febrile illness. Innocent murmurs are never purely diastolic except in the case of a venous hum, which is a continuous diastolic physiologic murmur. Innocent murmurs are usually not associated with a diastolic murmur, a thrill, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) or chest x-ray, cyanosis, or other symptoms of heart disease. Although innocent murmurs usually occur between 2 to 6 years of age, they also may be heard from infancy to early adolescence.

\section*{Common diagnostic tests}

\section*{Pulse oximetry}

Pulse oximetry is used to verify and document the degree of central cyanosis and is an accurate way to assess arterial oxygen saturation, especially in infants. Using pulse oximetry to screen newborns in the well infant and intermediate care nurseries for critical CHD was
added to the US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in 2011 and has been adopted by 46 states. ${ }^{3}$ In addition to screening for 12 or more congenital heart defects, the identification of infants with other causes of hypoxia, such as infections, lung disease, or hemoglobinopathies, has been documented as an added benefit of pulse oximetry screening. ${ }^{4}$

Pulse oximetry readings from the right hand and one foot (together or in sequence), taken on the second day of life before discharge, and using a motion tolerant pulse oximeter approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are recommended. ${ }^{5}$ Box 8.1 presents the criteria for a positive result for pulse oximetry screening. A positive screening result is defined as any identified low oxygen level, and requires follow-up with a comprehensive history and physical examination to determine the cause of hypoxia. Critical CHD is excluded using a diagnostic echocardiogram, and it should be read and interpreted by a pediatric cardiologist. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{BOX 8.1}

\section*{Criteria for a Positive Pulse Oximetry Screening Result}
- Any oxygen saturation measure <90\%
- Any oxygen saturation $<95 \%$ in both extremities on three measures taken 1 hour apart
- Greater than $3 \%$ absolute difference between readings in the upper extremity (right hand) and lower extremity (foot) on three measures taken 1 hour apart (e.g., $96 \%$ right hand and $93 \%$ foot, or $88 \%$ right hand and $92 \%$ foot)

Data from Kemper AR, Mahle WT, Martin GR, et al: Strategies for implementing screening for critical congenital heart disease, Pediatrics 128(5):e1259-e1267, 2011.

Pulse oximetry is also commonly used to monitor oxygen saturations in children with known cardiac disease. Infants and
children who have complex cyanotic heart defects in which blood mixes in a common ventricle, or who are dependent on a surgically placed aorta-to-pulmonary artery shunt to supply pulmonary blood flow, normally have oxygen saturation levels between $75 \%$ and $85 \%$. It is important to know an infant's baseline oxygen saturation to accurately assess their oxygen status. Increasingly, pulse oximeters are used at home to monitor changes in oxygen saturation in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and other single-ventricle (SV) heart defects as part of home surveillance programs. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Chest x-ray}

Chest x-rays have been the standard to assess heart size, pulmonary congestion, position of the great vessels, and abdominal situs. Although this diagnostic tool is frequently used in the inpatient or ICU setting, it is becoming less practical and valuable in the outpatient setting with the advanced echocardiography, which gives more precise information of the cardiac structure and function without radiation exposure.

Heart size is determined by comparing the width of the cardiac silhouette at its widest diameter to the width of the chest at its maximal internal dimension (Fig. 8.9). This is referred to as the cardiothoracic (CT) ratio. A CT ratio greater than 0.65 is considered cardiomegaly. ${ }^{2}$ It is important to have a good inspiratory x-ray for diagnosis, as an expiratory film may make the heart appear larger than it is. Also, prominent thymic tissue in newborns is often falsely interpreted as cardiomegaly.

The position of the cardiac apex provides information about ventricular enlargement. Normally the apex points down and to the left. An upward turned apex is indicative of right ventricular enlargement, whereas an apex that is pushed more downward and leftward than normal is caused by left ventricular enlargement. The main pulmonary artery (MPA) is normally seen as a small knob at the LUSB (see Fig. 8.9). The prominence or absence of this shadow provides clues about the size, position, and presence of the MPA. ${ }^{2}$ Pulmonary vascular markings provide important information about the degree of pulmonary blood flow and should be noted as normal, increased, or decreased.

\end{figure}

Chest x-rays can also determine abdominal situs. The location of the cardiac apex is normally on the left and should be on the same side as the stomach bubble and opposite the liver shadow. When these structures are misaligned (with the stomach bubble on the right and the apex on the left), or the liver is midline, then heterotaxy or situs abnormality is present, which is often associated with serious heart defects.

\section*{Electrocardiogram}

An ECG is a screening tool that provides information about heart rate, heart rhythm, conduction, and forces of contraction in the
heart. It is particularly useful in the diagnosis of arrhythmias and ventricular hypertrophy. However, ECG patterns can vary within diagnostic groups. ECGs can be a sensitive test they do not always identify or rule out cardiac disease. Therefore, except for arrhythmias, ECGs are used most often to confirm a diagnosis of structural CHD as opposed to establishing one.

\section*{Echocardiogram}

Cardiac ultrasound, or echocardiogram, has become the primary diagnostic tool for patients suspected of having CHD. An echocardiogram can be done safely and noninvasively in the outpatient setting or at the bedside and provides accurate information for all age groups including premature infants. The addition of Doppler ultrasound and three-dimensional (3D) images makes it possible to evaluate valve anatomy, function, and flow patterns throughout the heart and proximal vessels. This is particularly useful in quantifying degrees of shunting and obstruction. Advanced fetal cardiac echocardiography has become a standard prenatal evaluation tool for parents with a family history of CHD or other risk factors. Echocardiograms are expensive, however, and should only be ordered by a cardiologist after a thorough evaluation has been done to determine whether one is warranted. Referral to a cardiologist should be as complete as possible and include data about the history, physical examination, chest x-ray, ECG, and oxygen saturation that have raised suspicion of CHD. Table 8.3 presents the common tests used to diagnose CHD.

\section*{Cardiac symptoms}

\section*{Arrhythmias and palpitations}

It is not unusual for children to complain of skipped heartbeats, a fast heart rate, or extra heartbeats. Most complaints are benign in origin, but a history of chest pain, light-headedness, or syncope can be indicative of a serious arrhythmia. ${ }^{2}$ Family history should be directed toward any structural heart disease or history of sudden death, and the patient history should include any association of symptoms with exercise, food intake (especially caffeine), medications (especially cough preparations, and stimulants), or specific positioning. Physical findings, except the arrhythmia, are usually not present. Evaluation begins with an ECG. Documentation of the cardiac rhythm on an ECG is essential for determining diagnosis and treatment; however, obtaining this documentation can be challenging, especially if the symptoms are infrequent. For a complete evaluation, referral to a pediatric cardiologist or electrophysiologist is essential, and if the symptoms persist or worsen, additional testing with continuous Holter monitoring or event recording is recommended.

Smartphones are another way to monitor heart rhythms. There are several smartphone applications that can be used to document subjective complaints of palpitations. Depending on the application, the information can be programmed to forward the data to a pediatric health care provider or become a personal ECG monitor. In 2013 the AliveCor application was Food and Drug Administration approved for detection of atrial arrhythmias. The device accurately detects an irregular pulse by analyzing data signals recorded with an iPhone. ${ }^{8}$ Additionally, even personal fitness trackers, like Fit Bit, Garmin, and Fuelband, are helpful in monitoring objective heart rates in older children and adolescents.

\section*{Syncope}

Syncope is a common complaint in older children and adolescents (especially adolescent females). ${ }^{2}$ Vasovagal syncope, also called simple syncope or simple faint or neurocardiogenic syncope or vasodepressor syncope, is the most common cause of syncope in children and
adolescents. It is usually characterized by a loss of consciousness, falling, and then a quick recovery once the child or adolescent is lying down. The episodes are usually preceded by dizziness, lightheadedness, pallor, weakness, blurred vision, or cold sweats. The majority of syncopal events are benign, but a careful evaluation is always warranted, because it may be the first symptom of serious cardiac, neurologic, or metabolic disease. Syncope is unusual in children less than 6 years of age unless it is related to seizures, breath-holding, or cardiac arrhythmias. ${ }^{2}$ The most common neurological cause is a seizure disorder, and possible metabolic causes include hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, or profound anemia. In toddlers, the causes include breath-holding, and in adolescents, hyperventilation techniques.

Arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are other potential cardiac causes of syncope. Information gathering should include careful details of the event and a family history of similar events or sudden cardiac death. Medication history and past medical history are important to elicit. Often the only evidence of HCM on physical examination may be the increased intensity of a cardiac murmur from supine to standing. If the neurological examination is negative, an ECG should be obtained. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted if a murmur is heard on physical exam, if there is an abnormal ECG, a family history of sudden death, or cardiomyopathy. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Chest pain}

Chest pain in children is a common complaint, causing anxiety in both patients and their parents. However, chest pain due to a cardiac cause is rare, occurring in less than $4 \%$ of cases. ${ }^{9}$ The most common cause of chest pain is musculoskeletal in origin, including muscle strain, trauma, and costochondritis, which accounts for close to $70 \%$ of cases of chest pain in children. ${ }^{10}$ Costochondritis is an inflammation of the chest wall, causing sharp, short, and welllocalized pain that can be reproduced with pressure on palpation. Other causes of chest pain in children are pulmonary (especially asthma or illnesses associated with coughing), gastrointestinal (esophagitis or gastroesophageal reflux), or psychogenic (less often in children less than 12 years of age but more frequent in adolescent
females). ${ }^{2}$
A careful history is important in assessing the cause of chest pain in children (Box 8.2). It is important to elicit the onset and duration of the pain, and how long the child has been experiencing pain, if the chest pain occurs at rest or only with exercise and sports participation. Document the severity, location, and radiation of the chest pain. A family history of sudden death, CHD, cardiomyopathy, or a hypercoagulable state is concerning for cardiac disease. Chest pain associated with fever may have an infectious cause. Illicit drug use, particularly cocaine, can cause myocardial ischemia with chest pain as a presenting symptom.

\section*{BOX 8.2}

\section*{Information Gathering for Presenting Chest Pain in Children}

Questions to ask:
- Has the child had a fever or recent illness?
- Is the pain related to breathing or activity, does it occur with exercise or at rest?
- Any sports activities or injuries that may have preceded the onset of chest pain?
- Is the chest pain accompanied by palpitations, dizziness, or fainting?
- Anything improve the pain? Anything make the pain worse?
- Any illicit drug use or use of caffeine supplements or drinks?

The physical exam should note the child or adolescent's color, perfusion, pulses, respiratory effort, and degree of acute pain. Auscultation includes the evaluation of breath sounds and their symmetry, as well as the identification of abnormal heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, gallops, or muffled heart sounds.

Cardiac origins of chest pain include ischemic causes (coronary artery abnormalities or cardiomyopathies), inflammatory
conditions such as pericarditis or myocarditis, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, or pulmonary embolus. ${ }^{10}$ Pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, is characterized by chest pain that is worse lying down and improves with sitting and leaning forward. ${ }^{2}$ Careful cardiac history, family history, physical examination, and selected use of the ECG can identify potentially life-threatening or other nonemergent causes of cardiac chest pain, which require further evaluation. ${ }^{10}$ If acute chest pain of cardiac origin is suspected, an ECG should be obtained, with immediate referral to a pediatric cardiologist.

> PEDIATRIC PEARLS
> Chest pain with exertion, associated with dizziness, fainting, or palpitations, and chest pain that radiates to the back, jaw, or left arm could be indicative of cardiac disease and requires prompt evaluation by a cardiologist. ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Cardiovascular disease}

Cardiovascular disease in children is normally divided into two categories: congenital or acquired. CHD comprises the majority of cardiovascular disorders in the pediatric population. CHD is not a singular entity, but rather a myriad of structural anomalies in the heart that develop during fetal life and thus present at birth. Acquired heart disease (Kawasaki disease, HCM, myocardial infections, rheumatic fever, hypertension) occurs after birth and develops during an individual's lifetime.

\section*{Congenital heart disease}

CHD is prevalent in at least 10 per 1000 live births, close to $1 \%$ of all births in the United States. ${ }^{11,12}$ Forty percent of CHD malformations are diagnosed during a child's first year of life. Adults now account for two-thirds of patients with severe and other chronic forms of CHD in the general population. ${ }^{12}$ Maternal infections such as rubella, coxsackievirus, and other viruses contracted during pregnancy can be associated with CHD or myocarditis.

Medications, alcohol, and other drugs may act as teratogens on the developing fetus. Maternal medical conditions associated with an increased risk of the fetus developing CHD include diabetes mellitus (cardiomyopathy, transposition of the great vessels) and systemic lupus erythematosus (congenital heart block). ${ }^{2}$ See Table 8.4 for common presentations of CHD in children.

CHD, Congenital heart disease; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; $P A$, pulmonary atresia; PDA, patent ductus arteriosus; TOF, tetralogy of Fallot; VSD, ventricular septal defect.

CHD is caused by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, with single gene mutations accounting for $3 \%$ of CHD, gross chromosomal anomalies accounting for $5 \%$, environmental factors (rubella, fetal alcohol syndrome, other maternal illness/infections) accounting for $3 \%$, and multifactorial genetic random event mediation for the remainder. ${ }^{1}$ Genetic etiologies include genetic syndromes, deletion/duplication syndromes, and both syndromic and nonsyndromic single gene
disorders (i.e., NKX2.5). At least one or more additional congenital malformations can be found in $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ of infants with CHD. ${ }^{1}$ Although knowledge and understanding of the role of genetics in CHD has advanced significantly, it is still an evolving science, and current data can change or become quickly outdated. Table 8.5 presents some examples of the more common syndromes associated with CHD diagnoses.

\section*{Common presentations of congenital heart disease}

\section*{Cyanosis in infants}

Cyanosis indicative of CHD is due to arterial desaturation and may not be visible unless the oxygen saturation is $85 \%$ or less. ${ }^{1,2}$ Arterial desaturation or central cyanosis is best detected in the perioral area, the mucous membranes of the mouth, lips, and gums. Central cyanosis should be distinguished from peripheral cyanosis, which can
occur in a cold environment, and acrocyanosis, which in newborns is due to sluggish circulation in the fingers and toes. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

The intensity of cyanosis is dependent on the concentration of desaturated hemoglobin and not on the actual arterial oxygen saturation.

An infant who has polycythemia, an abnormal increase in circulating erythrocytes, will appear more cyanotic than an infant who is anemic in the presence of the same degree of arterial desaturation. Therefore, it is important to follow a cyanotic infant's hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, particularly at 2 to 3 months of age, the time of normal physiological anemia.

\section*{Congestive heart failure}

CHF is the inability of the heart to adequately meet the metabolic demands of the body. It occurs in $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ of children with CHD, and about $40 \%$ of patients with cardiomyopathy can have CHF so severe that it results in the need for heart transplantation or results in death. ${ }^{13}$ The causes of CHF can be related to both cardiac disease (VSD, AV septal defect, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and Kawasaki disease) and noncardiac disease (anemia, sepsis, hypoglycemia, and renal failure). The multiple causations of CHF manifest in a variety of clinical presentations that are usually age specific. Infants most commonly present with pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, poor feeding, FTT, and hepatomegaly. Older children are often unable to keep up with their peers, and may exhibit peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, anorexia, and respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and rales. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{Acquired heart disease}

\section*{Hypertension}

The incidence of hypertension (HTN) is increasing in children and
adolescents in the United States-in large part related to the increase in childhood obesity. ${ }^{14}$ HTN is more prevalent in nonHispanic blacks and Mexican-American youth, and it occurs more often in males than females. ${ }^{14}$ There is now evidence that blood pressure in childhood tracks into adulthood, so children who are hypertensive in their younger years are frequently hypertensive as adults. ${ }^{15}$ Screening for HTN in childhood and effective management is aimed at decreasing the risk of cardiac disease in adulthood. The definition of HTN is derived from blood pressure percentiles based on gender, age, and height (Table 8.6). ${ }^{16}$ Chapter 2 reviews the proper method for obtaining blood pressure measurements, and both the systolic and diastolic values are of equal importance.

Data from Flynn JT, Kaelber DC, Baker-Smith CM, et al, Subcommittee on Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children. Clinical practice guidelines for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents. Pediatrics 140:1-72, 2017.
$B P$, Blood pressure. HTN, Hypertension.
HTN can be classified as primary or essential (without a clear cause) or secondary to an underlying disorder (often related to renal or vascular disease). In secondary HTN, treatment of the underlying cause can cure the HTN. Secondary HTN has a higher incidence in prepubertal children and likely underlies the more severe or stage 2 HTN. Primary or essential HTN is more often seen in older school-age children and adolescents and is often associated
with excess weight gain, obesity, and/or a positive family history of HTN. ${ }^{14}$

The goal of HTN screening is to identify children and adolescents with HTN and distinguish between primary and secondary causes. Evaluation of HTN includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, as well as baseline laboratory studies including complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lipids, glucose, and urinalysis. Renal and cardiac ultrasounds are performed to assess for secondary causes or to document end-organ involvement such as increased left ventricular mass. An additional diagnostic tool is a 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. The device automatically measures blood pressures every 20 to 30 minutes over a 24 -hour period while patients undergo normal daily activities. The portable device uses an oscillometric technique to document mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements. The device is very helpful in identifying "white coat hypertension" or masked hypertension versus essential hypertension.

It is also important to identify those with other risk factors for premature atherosclerosis such as HTN, smoking, overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic renal disease. The target blood pressure for children with other cardiovascular risk factors is a systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than $90 \%$ (see Table 8.6). ${ }^{16}$

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Both blood pressure and lipid levels track from childhood to adulthood. Elevated blood pressure and elevated lipid levels in childhood frequently remain elevated in adulthood. ${ }^{14,15}$

\section*{Dyslipidemia}

Recent evidence supports the correlation between lipid disorders in childhood and the onset and severity of atherosclerosis in children and young adults. ${ }^{14}$ The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that $7.8 \%$ of children aged

8 to 17 years have elevated levels of total cholesterol ( $\geq 200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), and $7.4 \%$ of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years have elevated lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ( $\geq 130 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). ${ }^{17}$ Like HTN, elevated lipid levels track from childhood to adulthood. In the past, children with a strong family history of lipid disorders or premature cardiovascular disease were screened for lipid disorders, but the increase in childhood obesity has contributed to a larger population of children at risk for dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia, genetic factors, and childhood obesity are contributing factors to coronary artery atherosclerosis along with diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal disease, postcardiac transplant, history of Kawasaki disease with aneurysms, and chronic inflammatory disease.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recent recommendation concluded there was insufficient evidence for routine lipid screening in children and adolescents; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) continues to recommend routine screening between 9 to 11 years of age and at 17 to 20 years of age, with the initial screen either a fasting or nonfasting lipid profile measuring total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. ${ }^{14,}{ }^{17,}{ }^{18}$ Non-HDL cholesterol level is then calculated from these two values (non-HDL cholesterol $=$ total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol). ${ }^{14}$ Normal values are a non-HDL cholesterol value less than $145 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, with an HDL cholesterol above $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. If the non-HDL cholesterol is abnormal, children should have a fasting lipid profile and further evaluation and follow-up.

\section*{Metabolic syndrome}

Metabolic syndrome, a combination of dyslipidemia, abnormal glucose regulation, obesity, and hypertension, has been described in obese adults and is known to significantly increase the risk for coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. ${ }^{18}$ Research suggests a strong interaction between obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers which contribute to metabolic syndrome and later heart disease and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome in adults is often defined as the presence of three or more of the following risk factors: elevations in waist circumference, triglyceride levels, blood
pressure, reduced levels of HDL cholesterol, and/or fasting glucose levels. ${ }^{14}$

With the increased incidence of obesity in children and adolescents, a similar constellation of conditions is being described as metabolic syndrome in children. There is not universal agreement on the diagnostic criteria for pediatric metabolic syndrome, but the International Diabetes Federation has proposed a pediatric definition (Table 8.7). ${ }^{19}$ Some of the risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome in childhood include a family history of a parent with metabolic syndrome, Hispanic background, inactivity and sedentary lifestyle, and smoking. ${ }^{18}$ The presence of obesity should prompt a comprehensive evaluation for other cardiovascular risk factors, including family history of premature cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco exposure. ${ }^{15}$ Longitudinal studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease when elements of metabolic syndrome are present in childhood. ${ }^{20}$ The International Diabetic Foundation (IDF) consensus group recognizes that there are ethnic, gender, and age differences, and more research is needed to establish outcomes in high risk populations. ${ }^{18}$ Preventive treatment for pediatric metabolic syndrome includes weight loss, diet, and exercise.

There are several clinical features of metabolic syndrome in the pediatric population. Obesity is a crucial component and defined as a body mass index (BMI) above the $95 \%$ for age and gender. Body fat distribution, most commonly assessed by waist circumference, is often associated with increased insulin resistance. ${ }^{18}$ Dyslipidemias, defined as an increase in triglycerides or a decrease in HDL cholesterol, can be detected on cholesterol screening. Blood pressure measurements should be done at least yearly to screen for hypertension. Insulin resistance is often found in obese children, and some may progress to glucose intolerance and diabetes. Inflammatory markers such as CRP may be elevated, but the relationship between increased CRP and metabolic syndrome has not been well defined in children. ${ }^{16}$ Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (characterized by intrahepatic fat accumulation) and polycystic ovary syndrome (characterized by hyperandrogenism) are both associated with insulin resistance and are more prevalent in obese children and adolescents. ${ }^{16}$ Physical examination includes pulse, blood pressure, calculation of BMI, assessment for obesity, increased waist size, hepatomegaly, and acanthosis nigricans (see Chapter 7).

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Obtain a thorough history, including gestational history, birth history, family history, and any presenting symptoms.
- Routine cardiac assessment begins with evaluation of weight, height, BMI, and head circumference infants.
- Assess temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, color, activity level, and oxygen saturation when indicated.
- Accurately assess blood pressure in all children whenever possible, and definitely once in infancy, and routinely beginning at 3 years of age (see Table 8.6).
- Approach the inspection systematically, starting from the periphery and moving inward and upward toward examination of the chest assessing perfusion, and pulses in upper and lower extremities.
- Palpate cardiac area for any heaves and presence of a thrill.
- Palpate liver edge for enlargement and position. Note: 1 to 2 cm below the right costal margin is normal in infants.
- Inspect for head and neck for signs of any syndromes; inspect the chest for scars, signs of respiratory distress, and pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum.
- Auscultate lungs for quality of breath sounds, any wheezing, grunting, or rales.
- Auscultate systematically through the four precordial areas moving from LLSB to apex listening for first heard sound to the LUSB listening for second heart sound, noting variation with respiration and any third or fourth heart sounds or ejection clicks.
- Findings of tachypnea, respiratory distress, tachycardia, bradycardia, low oxygen saturation with pallor or hypoperfusion, hepatomegaly, and syncope require immediate further evaluation and consultation.
- Diagnostic chest x-ray and ECG are performed as indicated.
- Refer to cardiology for further evaluation as indicated by examination findings, diagnostic results, or parental anxiety/concern and before echocardiogram.

\section*{Embryological development}

Knowledge of lung development is critical when performing a respiratory assessment in early childhood, especially in a newborn infant who is born preterm. This information, along with an understanding of respiratory anatomy and physiology, will provide you with a foundation for interpreting pulmonary symptoms.

Lung development begins in utero at approximately 4 weeks' gestation. It occurs in five stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. During the embryonic phase, the lungs form from a sac on the ventral wall of the alimentary canal. Right and left branches form through budding and dividing. This is also the time when the vascular system begins to develop. During the pseudoglandular stage, branching of the lung bud occurs, as the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles are formed by 16 to 17 weeks' gestation. In addition, the intrapulmonary arterial system begins to branch, and cilia and cartilage begin to form. During the canalicular stage, branching of the bronchioles continues and alveoli begin to form. By approximately 25 weeks, the number of bronchial generations with cartilage is the same as the adult lung. This is also the period of capillary bed expansion. Growth of the pulmonary parenchyma and surfactant system occurs during the saccular
phase. By 24 weeks the alveolocapillary membrane is ready to begin gas exchange. Maturation and expansion of the alveoli occur during the alveolar period and persist through early childhood. This is when the alveolocapillary membrane matures and the gas exchange surface area increases. Alveolization is complete by about 8 years of age. ${ }^{1-3}$

Breathing movements occur in utero. The movements are irregular and do not open the alveoli. Fetal gas exchange occurs via the placenta. At birth, the lungs fill with air for the first time and take on the role of ventilation and oxygenation. The fluid in the lungs moves into the tissues surrounding the alveoli and is absorbed into the lymphatic system. At this point, gas exchange occurs via diffusion across the alveolar-pulmonary capillary membranes. ${ }^{1,3}$

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Thorax}

The thorax is the bony cage that surrounds the heart, great vessels, lungs, major airways, and esophagus. ${ }^{3}$ It is composed of the sternum and ribs (Fig. 9.1). The sternum is a flat, narrow bone made up of three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. ${ }^{4}$ The manubrium is somewhat triangular and attaches to the body of the sternum; the angle at which the manubrium and body meet is termed the manubriosternal angle or the angle of Louis. This angle is in line with the second rib and therefore serves as an important landmark. The xiphoid process is the small, thin, cartilaginous end of the sternum, which varies greatly in shape and prominence in infants and children because of the influence of heredity, intrauterine environment, and nutrition. It sits at the level of T9. ${ }^{3-5}$ Pectus carinatum, pigeon breast, is the abnormal protrusion of the xiphoid process and sternum, and pectus excavatum, funnel chest, is the abnormal depression of the sternum (Fig. 9.2; Fig. 9.1). ${ }^{3,4,6,7}$ The chest cavity is divided, with the middle portion known as the mediastinum.

\end{figure}

There are 12 pairs of ribs; the first 7 pairs attach anteriorly via their corresponding costal cartilages to the sternum. Ribs 8, 9, and 10 are attached to the costal cartilage on the rib above them; ribs 11 and 12 do not attach anteriorly and are known as floating ribs. All 12 pairs of ribs attach posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. The diaphragm sits at the bottom of the rib cage and is the major muscle of respiration. There are 11 intercostal muscles anteriorly and posteriorly and 8 thoracic muscles, all of which help to increase the volume of the rib cage with inspiration and decrease the thoracic volume with expiration (Fig. 9.3). ${ }^{3,5}$

\end{figure}

The following landmarks are often used in describing the location of physical findings of the chest: the midsternal line (MSL), which runs down the middle of the sternum; the midclavicular line (MCL), located on the right and left sides of the chest, runs parallel to the MSL and through the middle of the clavicles (midway between the jugular notch and acromion) bilaterally. Laterally there are three lines on each side, the anterior axillary line (AAL), the midaxillary line (MAL), and the posterior axillary line (PAL). The AAL begins at the anterior axillary folds, the MAL begins at the
middle of the axilla, and the PAL begins at the posterior axillary folds. Posteriorly is the vertebral line that runs down the middle of the spine and the scapular line, which runs down the inferior angle of each scapula (Fig. 9.4). ${ }^{3-5,7}$

\end{figure}

\section*{Lower respiratory tract}

The respiratory system is divided into two parts: the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx and is reviewed in Chapter 14. The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar ducts and sacs, and alveoli (Fig. 9.5). The trachea is a tube that lies anterior to the esophagus. The distal end of the trachea splits into the right and left mainstem/primary bronchi. This bifurcation occurs at the level of T3 during infancy and childhood. By the time the child is an adult, this bifurcation occurs at T4 or T5. The right mainstem bronchus is shorter and more vertical than the left and, therefore, more susceptible to aspiration of foreign bodies in the young child. Beyond the bifurcation, the bronchi continue to branch into lobar/secondary bronchi. There are three branches on the right and two on the left; each branch supplies one of the lung lobes. These
branches further divide into segmental/tertiary smaller bronchi to supply each segment of the lungs and finally the terminal bronchioles. Ultimately, the respiratory tract terminates with the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. The bronchial arteries branch from the aorta and supply blood to the lung parenchyma. The blood supply is returned primarily by the pulmonary veins. ${ }^{1,3,5}$

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 9.5 Lower respiratory tract.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Lungs}

The lungs are positioned in the lateral aspects of the thorax, separated by the heart and the mediastinal structures. The right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, and lower), and the left lung has two lobes (upper and lower). The apex is the top portion of the upper lobes, which extends above the clavicles. On the right side, the minor or horizontal fissure, located at the fourth rib, divides the right upper lobe (RUL) from the right middle lobe (RML). On the left side, there is a tongue-shaped projection that extends from the left upper lobe (LUL), called the lingula. Laterally, the right lower lobe (RLL) and the left lower lobe (LLL) occupy most of the lower lateral chest area. Only a small portion of the RML extends to the MAL, and it does not go beyond that point. Posteriorly, the vertebral column helps in identifying the underlying lung lobes. T4
marks the inferior portion of the upper lobes and the superior portion of the lower lobes. The base is the bottom portion of the lower lobes and is marked by T10 or T12, depending on the phase of respiration. ${ }^{3}$ The principal function of the lungs is gas exchange between the atmosphere and the blood. Oxygen is carried into the lungs, and carbon dioxide is eliminated. The lungs play a significant role in acid-base balance.

\section*{Physiological variations}

Table 9.1 presents variations in growth and development that impact the function of the respiratory system in the infant and young child.

\section*{System-specific history}

Complete and accurate information gathering is essential when assessing an infant, child, or adolescent with respiratory symptoms. The Information Gathering table presents respiratory focused questions based on developmental stages. Questions should be open-ended and age-specific to allow the parent or caregiver the opportunity to give a full explanation of past and present concerns. In addition, always obtain information directly from the older child or adolescent when possible. Table 9.2 presents a symptom-focused assessment of respiratory conditions for children and adolescents.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

The Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) for children less than 5 years of age is a five-item questionnaire that has been validated to assess respiratory and asthma control in children. It is intended for children in this age group who have a history of two or more episodes of wheezing, coughing, or
shortness of breath lasting more than 24 hours, and have been treated with a quick relief medication for respiratory symptoms or have a diagnosis of asthma. The first three questions pertain to asthma symptoms over the last 4 weeks. The fourth question asks about the use of quick relief medications over the past 3 months, and the last question asks about the use of oral steroids over the past year. Each question has five response levels. A score of less than 80 indicates that respiratory problems are not well controlled, and a score of 80 or more indicates good control. ${ }^{8,9}$ The TRACK is available at http://imaging.ubmmedica.com/consultantlive/pdfs/TRACKbroc Compliance.pdf.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

The Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) for children 4 to 11 years of age is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses asthma control over the previous 4 weeks. The first four questions are completed by the child and the last three by the parent/guardian. Each question has four response levels. The Asthma Control Test (ACT) for children 12 years of age and older is a five-item questionnaire that assesses asthma control over the previous 4 weeks. Each question has five response levels. Questions for both pertain to daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitations, use of short-acting beta agonists, and perception of asthma control. Both questionnaires have been validated to measure asthma control. ${ }^{10}$ A score of 19 or less indicates the asthma is not well controlled. The questionnaires are available in print and web format (http://www.asthma.com/additional-resources/childhood-asthma-control-test.html) in a number of languages.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Equipment}

When auscultating breath sounds, use the diaphragm of the
stethoscope. The size of the stethoscope being used is extremely important when evaluating respiratory sounds. Stethoscopes with a smaller diaphragm should be used on infants and toddlers. Isolating cardiac and respiratory sounds is difficult in small children with too large a diaphragm, and using a diaphragm that is too small on adolescents or on children who are overweight or obese causes practitioners to miss findings of cardiac and respiratory sounds on auscultation due to increased adipose tissue, which obscures respiratory sounds.

\section*{Positioning}

If possible, the child should sit upright for the respiratory assessment. Young children, especially toddlers, may be more relaxed sitting on their parent's lap during the examination of the chest. Children should be allowed to help as much as possible during the exam. Have them hold the stethoscope in place once you position it in the appropriate location. Other techniques include letting children role-play by allowing them to listen to their parent, a doll, or a stuffed animal. School-age children are very curious. Therefore, explain what you will be doing during the exam and why, using developmentally appropriate vocabulary. Taking a few extra minutes to incorporate the child's developmental level into your exam will result in more thorough and reliable findings. In addition, pictures of lungs in the exam room can be helpful with older children when you are explaining what you are looking for and listening to during the examination.

\section*{Physical examination}

Astute physical examination skills are important when making a diagnosis. Medical oversights have been associated with failure to perform a physical examination, misinterpretation of physical examination findings, and missing or not eliciting a physical examination sign. ${ }^{11}$

Pediatric health care providers should begin the physical examination by assessing the chest. The "quieter" parts of the exam, the cardiac and respiratory exam, require astute listening skills and less active participation of the child. Therefore, they are best
performed first-an effective approach to assessing children among pediatric experts. The pediatric provider must take a systematic approach to examining the chest and use all the components of physical assessment. This includes inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. Examination of the chest should always include both the anterior and the posterior chest.

A thorough assessment of the chest and lungs is not complete without examination of the upper airway and the extremities. Examine the nasal passages to determine the size of the airway passage and the appearance of the nasal turbinates, as well as the presence of rhinitis, nasal secretions, nasal polyps, or a foreign body. When looking at the oropharynx, note the presence of postnasal drip and tonsillar size. Tonsillar size is often graded on a scale of 0 to $4+$, where 0 indicates tonsils that fit in the tonsillar fossa and $4+$ indicates tonsils that occupy greater than $75 \%$ of the oropharyngeal width. ${ }^{12}$ An abnormal finding in any of these areas can be a cause of respiratory symptoms. Finally, you need to examine the extremities for signs of digital clubbing. Clubbing is the bulbous-shaped enlargement of the soft tissue of the distal phalanges (Fig. 9.6). To assess for clubbing in a simple way, ask the child to place the first phalange of each thumb together (nails facing each other). Normally this position results in a diamond shape between the two thumbs. With clubbing, the diamond shape disappears and the space between the two thumbs is decreased or absent, depending on the degree of clubbing. This is termed the Schamroth sign. Other methods for measuring clubbing include the phalangeal depth ratio and they hyponychial angle. A distal phalangeal diameter (DPD) to interphalangeal diameter (IPD) ratio of less than 1 is normal. A ratio greater than 1 is seen with clubbing. A hyponychial angle of less than 180 degrees is normal, while an angle of greater than 195 degrees is indicative of clubbing. ${ }^{13}$ Clubbing can be hereditary or can be the result of cardiac disease, respiratory disease, or severe malnutrition.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Diagnosing asthma during the infant and preschool years is difficult because many children wheeze during their first year of life. The Asthma Predictive Index (API) is a useful tool to help rule out the likelihood of asthma during the school age years in young children with wheezing. Recurrent episodes of wheezing during the first 3 years of life, plus one of two major criteria (provider diagnosed eczema or parental asthma) or two of three minor criteria (provider diagnosed allergic rhinitis, wheezing without colds, or peripheral eosinophilia $\geq 4 \%$ ) constitute a positive API and increase the likelihood of asthma. ${ }^{14}$

\section*{Inspection}

Ideally, start the exam by visually inspecting the infant or child undressed from the waist up. This allows you to make general observations about the child's respiratory rate, breathing pattern, respiratory effort, accessory muscle use, inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E ratio), skin color, presence of noisy breathing, chest symmetry, and chest shape. In an irritable, ill, or fearful child, observation of respiratory pattern and rate may be the most helpful part of the examination if the child exhibits resistance to auscultation.

Assess the shape of the chest and note any abnormalities. The normal anterior-posterior (AP) to transverse ratio is $1: 2$. In the infant, the chest is round with a diameter roughly equal to the head circumference until 2 years of age and has a $1: 1 \mathrm{AP} /$ transverse ratio, giving a barrel chest appearance. As the child grows, the chest takes on the shape of the adult chest. ${ }^{3,6}$ A barrel chest shape also can be seen when chronic air trapping is present, such as in advanced stages of cystic fibrosis. Other deformities of the chest that can have an impact on the child's respiratory status and decrease expansion of the lungs include pectus carinatum, pectus excavatum, or scoliosis.

\section*{Assessment of respirations}

Resting respiratory rates vary with the age of the child: the younger the child, the higher the respiratory rate (Table 9.3). The child's rhythm of breathing should be regular. Many factors can increase or decrease the respiratory rate, such as fever, pain, exercise, and medications.

\section*{TABLE 9.3}

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Assess respiratory rate before the physical exam portion of the visit when the child is calm; this is best accomplished when the child is sitting in the parent's/guardian's lap.

Periodic breathing is characterized by rapid breathing followed by periods of apnea, cessation of breathing. This is normal in the first few hours of life in healthy full-term newborns. Periodic breathing is more likely to persist in preterm infants, but the episodes of apnea should improve as infants approach term age. ${ }^{3,15}$ Apnea is considered clinically significant if it lasts greater than 20 seconds or is characterized by shorter pauses associated with bradycardia (heart rate $<100$ beats per minute), cyanosis, or pallor. ${ }^{16}$ Paradoxical breathing, or seesaw breathing, is often seen in newborns and infants because they use abdominal muscles more than intercostal muscles. ${ }^{3,15}$ Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by cycles of increasing and decreasing tidal volume separated by apnea. It occurs in children with congestive heart failure and increased intracranial pressure. ${ }^{3,7,15}$

Noisy breathing includes stridor, grunting, and snoring. Stridor is a high-pitched, loud, inspiratory sound produced by upper airway obstruction. Causes of upper airway obstruction include edema status post intubation, subglottic stenosis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and foreign body aspiration. ${ }^{17}$ Grunting is a low-pitched expiratory sound present with respiratory distress and is the result of a partial closure of the glottis. ${ }^{13}$ Snoring is a rough, snorting sound during
sleep, usually on inspiration, but can also be present on expiration. It may be present during sleep in healthy children who have an upper respiratory infection. Snoring is often heard in the presence of adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy or congenital anomalies that involve the upper airway or facies. ${ }^{6}$

Inspect for nasal flaring and use of accessory muscles in the infant and toddler. Mild nasal flaring can be seen in newborns because they are obligate nose breathers in the first month of life. However, increased nasal flaring should be investigated because it is a sign of labored breathing. Other signs of increased effort and respiratory distress include retractions, bulging of the intercostal muscles, and head bobbing. ${ }^{18}$ Although mild retractions may be seen in some healthy young children, increased retractions can be a sign of airway obstruction. The chest wall of newborns and infants is more compliant than that of older children, making them more prone to retractions. Bulging of the intercostal spaces also may be seen with airway obstruction as a consequence of increased expiratory effort. ${ }^{3,}{ }^{6}$ Head bobbing, the forward movement of the infant's head, is a sign of respiratory distress due to the contraction of the scalene and sternocleidomastoid muscles.

An abnormal inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio is an additional sign of respiratory distress. A normal I:E ratio in the infant is $1: 2$ seconds, except in the newborn, when it is variable. The inspiratory phase is greater than the expiratory phase when there is an extrathoracic (from the nose to the mid-trachea) obstruction. When there is an intrathoracic obstruction, the expiratory phase is more prolonged and accessory muscles are often used. ${ }^{13}$ This is seen in obstructive diseases that cause air trapping, such as cystic fibrosis, or an acute asthma exacerbation can increase the expiratory time.

Assess for cyanosis, a bluish color to the skin or mucous membranes. Acrocyanosis, cyanosis of the hands and feet, is normal in the newborn and can persist for days if the infant is in a cool environment. Central cyanosis, which occurs in the conjunctiva, lips, mucous membranes, and nail beds, is an abnormal finding at any age and warrants immediate further evaluation. In the anemic child, it may be difficult to detect cyanosis early on because the arterial oxygen saturation at which cyanosis becomes apparent varies with the total hemoglobin level. ${ }^{6}$ In addition, in a dark-
skinned child, cyanosis is best assessed by looking at the mucous membranes and/or nail beds.

\section*{Auscultation}

Auscultation is best performed at the beginning of the examination when the infant/child is more cooperative and attentive. Auscultation is performed with the diaphragm of the stethoscope placed firmly and directly on the chest. The child's chest should be bare because clothing can change the quality of the breath sounds. Remember to start at the apex which sits slightly above the clavicles (Fig. 9.7) then work down to the base. You want to auscultate moving from side to side across the chest so that you can compare one side to the other. Be sure to listen at each location for one full breath. Breath sounds are identified by their intensity, pitch, and duration. In children, breath sounds tend to be louder because of the thinness of the chest wall. ${ }^{6}$ There has been much confusion about the terminology used to describe breath sounds. Table 9.4 presents the most common description of normal breath sounds in the respiratory cycle.

Transmitted voice sounds or an infant's cry vocal fremitus also can be assessed with a stethoscope. Voice sounds are typically muffled on auscultation. If you hear the voice sound or cry loud and clear, it is termed bronchophony. This technique can be used to examine an infant or uncooperative child even while he or she is crying. If the verbal child speaks the sound "ee" and it sounds like "ay," it is called egophony. If the child whispers a word and it is heard loud and clear, it is called whispered pectoriloquy. If any of these signs are positive, it is evidence of a consolidation indicated by fluid or exudate in the alveolar spaces. ${ }^{4,7}$

\section*{Abnormal lung sounds}

In addition to normal lung sounds, you may hear adventitious or abnormal breath sounds (Table 9.5). Adventitious lung sounds are sounds that are superimposed on normal breath sounds.

\section*{Abnormal Breath Sounds}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Sound Description} \\

\hline & - Coarse crackles-loud and lower in pitch, usually signify fluid in larger airways \\
\hline Wheezes & Continuous, high-pitched musical sounds heard primarily on expiration; associated with foreign body aspiration, bronchiolitis, asthma \\
\hline Rhonchi & Continuous low-pitched sounds; clears with coughing; caused by secretions/mucus in larger airways as in bronchitis and lower respiratory tract infections \\
\hline Stridor & High-pitched, harsh sounds; heard primarily with inspiration but can be biphasic; associated with laryngotracheobronchitis, laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and vocal cord dysfunction \\
\hline Stertor & Noisy breathing heard on inspiration and expiration. Caused by the echoing of soft structures at the level of the nasopharynx and pharynx. Can occur with stridor, especially when there is external compression of the larynx and supraglottis. \\

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation is performed to identify anatomical landmarks, respiratory symmetry, and areas of tenderness or abnormalities. Begin by counting the ribs, locate the angle of Louis, and move your fingers laterally to feel the second rib and corresponding costal cartilage. Directly below this rib is the second intercostal space. From there, count downward to the other ribs and their respective intercostal spaces. ${ }^{3,4,7}$

To assess chest excursion, place your hands along the lateral rib cage and squeeze the thumbs toward each other so that you gather a small amount of skin in between your thumbs. As the child inhales, note the symmetry of the chest excursion. Again, this should be done both anteriorly and posteriorly. Asymmetry is an abnormal finding. In the newborn period, asymmetrical chest excursion may be a sign of a diaphragmatic hernia. Other possible abnormalities associated with asymmetrical chest excursion during the newborn period or later include diaphragmatic dysfunction, pneumothorax, mass, foreign body, or abnormal chest wall shape. An important part of the exam that should not be ignored is palpation of the trachea to assess for a mediastinal shift. To perform this exam, place fingers in the suprasternal notch on both sides of the trachea (Fig. 9.8). The distance between the trachea and the sternocleidomastoid tendons should be equal on both sides. A shift in the trachea occurs when there is a difference in volume or pressure between the two sides of the chest, as is seen in a pneumothorax or pleural effusion. ${ }^{3,5,7}$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-263.jpg?height=1315&width=1066&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=491}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 9.8 Palpation of trachea.}
\end{figure}

To complete the palpation portion of the exam, assess for tactile fremitus. To do this, place your palms, the ulnar surface of your hands, or your fingers, depending on the size of the chest wall, on the child's back (right and left side), and ask the verbal child to say "1-2-3." With an infant or uncooperative child, this technique can be performed while the child is crying. Perform this exam both anteriorly and posteriorly. Vibrations or fremitus should be of equal intensity bilaterally. A pneumothorax or hyperinflation can decrease fremitus; a mass or pneumonia can increase fremitus. ${ }^{4,7}$

\section*{Percussion}

Percussion is used to determine the sounds of the underlying organs and tissues. It helps distinguish whether the tissue is air filled, fluid filled, or solid. There are five sounds that are produced with percussion: resonance, hyperresonance, dull, flat, and tympany.

The sounds are distinguished by their intensity, pitch, and duration. In infants and toddlers, the sound produced is more resonant because the chest wall is thinner than in older children and adolescents (Table 9.6). To perform percussion, hyperextend the middle finger of your nondominant hand and press the distal interphalangeal joint firmly on the chest. With the middle finger of your dominant hand, strike down on the hyperextended interphalangeal joint. The movement must be sharp and quick, and the only portion of the nondominant finger that should be touching the chest should be the hyperextended joint. Strike each area two or three times and then move to the opposite side for comparison (Fig. 9.9). Lastly, it may be necessary to repeat auscultation to confirm findings that were revealed during palpation and percussion. Percussion is often deferred in infants and young children because the examiner often cannot discriminate between sounds that originate from organs that are proximate to each other. ${ }^{4,7,16}$

\section*{Diagnostics}

\section*{Pulse oximetry}

For a discussion on pulse oximetry, see Chapter 8.

\section*{Chest radiograph}

Chest radiography is often used to identify pulmonary pathology in the presence of pulmonary symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. A comparison of inspiratory to expiratory radiographs may be useful when evaluating a child with a suspected foreign body. If a localized area of the lung does not empty on the expiratory view, it is indicative of a bronchial obstruction. ${ }^{13}$ A finding of hyperinflation is indicative of air trapping and is frequently seen in children with bronchiolitis or an acute asthma exacerbation. Atelectasis or collapse may indicate mucus retention and can be present in children with bronchiolitis, asthma, or bronchomalacia. Consolidation can be caused by pneumonia, and an area of hyperlucency without normal lung markings is indicative of a pneumothorax or other air-containing pathology such as a cyst.

\section*{Pulmonary function testing}

Pulmonary function testing is performed to evaluate pulmonary symptoms and assess for obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease.

It is also used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. Although infant pulmonary function testing is available at specialized pediatric respiratory medicine centers, pulmonary function tests are generally reserved for children $\geq 5$ years of age. Predicted values are based on a reference population and are dependent upon age, height, sex, and ethnicity. There are specific guidelines for the performance of lung function testing; an experienced technician is of paramount importance in the testing process. An assessment of patient technique and effort is necessary when interpreting results; in addition, acceptability criteria must be met before a test can be considered interpretable. ${ }^{19}$ Severity of lung dysfunction is categorized as normal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe, and very severe. ${ }^{20}$ While there are many types of pulmonary function tests available, this chapter will focus on the most common tests performed in the pediatric population.

\section*{Spirometry}

The most common pulmonary function test is spirometry. Portable spirometers are available for office use. Spirometry is defined as "a physiological test that measures how an individual inhales or exhales volumes of air as a function of time." ${ }^{21}$ Measures include (1) forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the maximum volume of air forcefully exhaled after a maximal inhalation; (2) forced exhaled volume ( $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ ) in the first second, which is the maximum volume of air exhaled in the first second of FVC; (3) FEV ${ }_{1}$ FVC, which is the ratio of air exhaled in the first second to the total volume of air exhaled; and (4) forced expiratory flow 25-75 (FEF 25-75), which is the forced expiratory flow between $25 \%$ and $75 \%$ of FVC. ${ }^{21}$ The $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is a measure of large airways and is effort dependent, while the FEF 25-75 is a measure of small airways and is effort independent. A reduced $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{FEV}_{1} / \mathrm{FVC}$ is indicative of an obstructive pattern, as seen in asthma. A reduced FVC and FEV ${ }_{1}$ and a normal $\mathrm{FEV}_{1} / \mathrm{FVC}$ is indicative of a restrictive pattern as seen in chest wall abnormalities. A mixed pattern may be seen in someone with advanced cystic fibrosis. The Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma recommends performing spirometry at the initial assessment after treatments
have been initiated and symptoms have stabilized, during periods of loss of asthma control, and at least every 1 to 2 years. ${ }^{22}$

Evaluation of the spirogram is as important as the evaluation of the spirometry values. The spirogram is a graphic depiction of the spirometry values. The flow-volume curve and the time volume curve provide the expiratory phase of the maneuver. The flow volume loop provides both the inspiratory and the expiratory phases of the maneuver (Fig. 9.10). An evaluation of the curve shapes can provide you with a sense of the quality of the test, as well as whether an obstructive or restrictive pattern is present. ${ }^{23}$ If the expiratory curve has a concave shape, it is indicative of an obstructive pattern. If the expiratory curve has a steep slope, it is indicative of a restrictive pattern (Fig. 9.11). If the inspiratory loop is blunted, it is indicative of vocal cord dysfunction.

\end{figure}

\section*{Lung volumes}

A restrictive pattern on spirometry must be confirmed with lung volume testing. Common lung volume measures include (1) total lung capacity (TLC), which is the volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration; (2) functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of expiration during tidal breathing; and (3) residual volume (RV), which is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of a maximal expiration. A decreased TLC is indicative of a restrictive pattern. An increased RV is indicative of an obstructive pattern. ${ }^{24}$

\section*{Bronchodilator response testing}

Bronchodilator response testing is used to assess for the presence of
reversible airflow limitation. To perform the test, the patient should first undergo baseline spirometry. This is followed by the administration of a short-acting beta agonist and repeat spirometry 15 minutes after medication administration. The American Thoracic Society considers a change in the $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ and/or FVC of greater than $12 \%$ and 200 mL from baseline as a significant response. ${ }^{21}$ The Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma considers an increase in $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ of $\geq 12 \%$ from the baseline or an increase of $\geq 10 \%$ of predicted after the bronchodilator as significant reversibility. ${ }^{22}$

\section*{Quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride testing}

The sweat test is the gold standard for diagnosing cystic fibrosis. The test measures the concentration of chloride in sweat after stimulation with pilocarpine. Specific guidelines for collection and analysis have been established by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and must be adhered to in order to ensure accuracy of results. A test is considered negative if the concentration of chloride is less than $40 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, borderline if it is 40 to $60 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, and consistent with cystic fibrosis if it is greater than $60 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. In infants, values greater than $30 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ require further evaluation. In addition, values less than $40 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ have been reported in some patients with genetic evidence of cystic fibrosis. ${ }^{25}$

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Obtain a detailed history (including onset, aggravating factors, associated symptoms, etc.) of the symptom(s) from the parent/guardian and, when possible, the child; a thorough family and past medical history should also be obtained.
- Start the physical examination with inspection of the chest wall for shape and symmetry as well as respiratory rate and effort. Also assess skin for cyanosis and atopy. Relate findings to child's age and symptoms.
- Systematically auscultate breath sounds bilaterally. Note any adventitious sounds and correlate findings with clinical history.
- Systematically palpate chest bilaterally. Note excursion and vocal fremitus; correlate findings with clinical history.
- Systematically percuss chest bilaterally. Note sounds; correlate findings with history.
- All respiratory findings should be related to the child's age and clinical symptoms.

\section*{Embryological development}

The rapid growth of the head begins during the third to fifth week of embryonic life, as the brain simultaneously undergoes a similar period of rapid growth. By the eighth week, the embryo is humanlike in form, but the head size is dispropo rtionate to the body. During this early fetal development, the head is the fastest growing part of the body and constitutes $50 \%$ of the body length at 8 weeks' gestation. The head growth then slows during the period from the 9th to the 12th week in the developing fetus while spine growth accelerates. Disturbances or deficiencies during this early fetal period can result in brain and spinal defects. During the 13th week, ossification of the cranium begins in the skull, which is one of the primary ossification centers of the skeletal system. As the bones of the cranium grow medially from the ossification centers, sutures form at the junctions of the calvaria or skullcap, and fontanels form at the intersection of the sutures. The hair patterns on the scalp develop during the 13th through 16th week of fetal development, and the scalp hair present in the term infant is established by the twentieth week of gestation. ${ }^{1}$ The fetus continues to grow, and the head size becomes proportional to the body during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

\section*{Developmental variations}

The normal growth of the skull depends on placental function, familial, and hereditary factors, growth potential within the uterus, and optimum nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood. Insufficient vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and insufficient intake in early infancy is associated with an increased risk of skull deformity in first year of life. ${ }^{2}$ The contour of the cranium of the newborn reflects fetal positioning and the effects of the delivery presentation. The cranial bones are pliable and are loosely connected by the sutures and the fontanels, which allow the head to be molded during delivery. Depressed skull fractures are rare, but they can occur with forceps delivery or vacuum-assisted vaginal births. If intrauterine growth retardation does occur as a result of either intrinsic or extrinsic factors in fetal growth, skull growth and brain development are impacted and result in longterm consequences of delayed growth and development in the infant.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

At birth, there are seven movable and separate skull plates, or bones, joined together by sutures that accommodate brain growth (Fig. 10.1). The fontanels are the membranous spaces between the frontal and parietal bones and the parietal and occipital bones. The anterior fontanel lies along the coronal, sagittal, and frontal or metopic sutures (Fig. 10.2). The posterior fontanel lies at the juncture of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures. There are smaller fontanels located bilaterally in the lower skull. The sphenoid fontanel is located at the lower juncture of the frontal and parietal bones superior to the ear and along the coronal suture. The mastoid fontanel is posterior to the ear at the juncture of the occipital and posterior parietal bones. The cranium is supported by the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, a solid vertebra, and rests on the second vertebra, the axis. These bones form the rotational bones of the skull. Ossification of the skull continues throughout infancy and childhood and into adulthood.

\end{figure}

The facial bones are also pliable at birth, except for the maxilla and the mandible, which are very small and underdeveloped in the newborn. The facial skeleton consists of the larger bones of the frontal area, zygomatic processes, maxilla, and mandible (Fig. 10.3). The two nasal plates and the lacrimal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones comprise the smaller bones in the head. The maxillary and ethmoid
sinuses are present at birth but are small, and the sphenoid and frontal sinuses develop during infancy and childhood.

\end{figure}

The muscular structure of the head and neck is an intricate part of the underlying fascia of the cranium and neck structures. The connections between the muscular fascia and the facial orifices control facial expressions such as smiling, raising the eyebrows, and wrinkling the forehead. The superficial and deep muscles of the neck support the pivotal rotation of the head. The sternocleidomastoid or sternomastoid muscle is the largest muscle in the neck, running from the mastoid area at the base of the ear to the clavicle and sternum, and is primarily responsible for turning the head from side to side. The trapezius muscle lies at the back of the neck and is triangular. The origin of the trapezius muscle is in the back at the 12th thoracic vertebra extending to the lateral border of the clavicle and attaches at the posterior edge of the occipital bone. It supports the head movement from side to side and the shoulder movement.

The structures in the neck are protected by the deep vertebral muscles, which support the side movements of the head. The trachea is the cartilaginous tube that extends from the larynx to the bronchi in the upper chest beneath the sternum. In infants and children, it is more mobile and more deeply recessed in the vertebral muscles than in adults.

The thyroid gland lies in the anterior middle region of the neck just below the larynx surrounding the fifth or sixth tracheal ring. There are two butterfly-shaped lobes, joined or connected by an anterior isthmus that lies across the trachea below the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid gland is composed of tiny follicles filled with thyroglobulin, which binds with iodine in thyroid synthesis. A dietary intake of 150 to $200 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of iodide is enough to produce sufficient quantities of thyroid hormone, and large reserves of iodide are concentrated in the thyroid gland. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is necessary for normal growth and development in children and normal sexual maturation. The thyroid gland is extremely vascular and secretes thyroxine directly into the bloodstream, which promotes normal growth.

The four parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands generally located on the posterior side or dorsal surface of the thyroid gland. Like the thyroid gland, they do not contain ducts, and they secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium metabolism. Infants born with abnormal development of the parathyroid gland have an embryological defect known as DiGeorge syndrome caused by a chromosomal microdeletion (22q11). It is often associated with congenital heart defects, facial abnormalities, and other systemic defects.

The head and neck region are perfused by the carotid arteries. The external carotid supplies the head, face, and neck, and the internal carotid supplies the cranium. Blood from the cranium is drained through the subclavian and jugular veins. The thyroid and parathyroid are perfused by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.

\section*{Physiological variations}

Rapid growth in the infant brings rapid changes in the head and neck. At birth, the anterior fontanel ranges in size from an average of 2 cm to 4 to 5 cm in the term infant. The anterior fontanel may be small at birth, about the size of a fingertip, because the skull is compressed during vaginal delivery, and then the fontanel enlarges in the early neonatal period. The posterior fontanel may or may not be palpable at birth. It enlarges by a range of 0.5 to 1 cm and closes
by 6 weeks to 2 months of age. Suture lines can be overlapping or protuberant after birth and often are palpable until 6 months of age from molding at birth. Gestational age at birth and sex are not associated with significant differences in fontanel size. ${ }^{3}$

Slow progression of closure of the anterior fontanel occurs during the first year of life. However, closure in some infants may begin by 9 months of age with only a fingertip concavity present at the crown of the scalp, and $25 \%$ to $50 \%$ of fontanels are closed by 12 months of age. Normally, closure of the anterior fontanel occurs by 18 months of age, and $98 \%$ to $100 \%$ are closed by 24 months of age. ${ }^{3}$ Head growth in the first year is determined not by the size of the fontanel, but by the normal increase of the occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) of the head. Microcephaly, a small head for gestational age, is considered 1 to 2 standard deviations (SD) below the norm for age and size, and macrocephaly, a large head for gestational age, is 1 to 2 SD above the norm for age and size.

Cephalhematoma is a soft, fluctuating effusion of blood trapped beneath the pericranium caused by rupture of the blood vessels over the parietal area (Fig. 10.4). It is usually unilateral and does not cross the sagittal suture (Fig. 10.5). The bleeding into the periosteum of the cranium may occur slowly, and therefore may not be apparent until the infant is 24 to 48 hours old. A cephalhematoma may be associated with hyperbilirubinemia. Resolution of a cephalhematoma may be slow, and it may persist until 6 weeks to 2 months of age. See Table 10.1 for developmental variations in the head and neck.

\section*{TABLE 10.1 \\ Developmental Variations of the Head and Neck}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Age & Physiological Variations \\
\hline Preterm infant & Symmetrical or asymmetrical head shape with a flattened temporal/parietal region giving head an elongated shape \\
\hline Newborn & Symmetrical or asymmetrical head shape with head circumference > chest circumference \\
\hline Infancy & Symmetrical brain growth is reflected in occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) of skull; abnormal growth patterns of skull are indicated by a misshapen cranium and/or a rapidly increasing OFC or slow growth of skull; closure of anterior fontanel is expected by 18 months of age in a healthy term infant. \\
\hline Early childhood & After 18 months, chest circumference exceeds head circumference by $5-7 \mathrm{~cm}$; brain reaches $80 \%$ of adult size by 2 years of age; cranium continues to ossify; sutures are proximate and immobile; neck lengthens by 3-4 years of age and neck-to-body proportion is closer to adult proportion. \\
\hline Middle childhood & Nasal sinus cavities widen and deepen with skull growth, and size approximates those of an adult; thyroid gland is more readily palpable and approximates adult size. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

African American, Hispanic, and Chinese infants have a slightly larger anterior fontanel than do Caucasian infants secondary to familial and genetic factors. ${ }^{3}$ Native American infants have an additional horizontal suture line over the occipital bone.

\section*{System-specific history}

Obtaining a thorough history of growth and development of the head and neck area, including any injury or insult to the skull during the growth process, is an important part of accurate assessment and diagnosis. The Information Gathering table presents pertinent questions to ask about the growth and development of the head and neck area.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Physical assessment of the head and neck}

The examination of the head and neck area involves inspection and palpation. In infants and young children, examination of the head and neck region may follow the quieter parts of the examination, the cardiac and respiratory exam, as palpation around the head and neck region often makes young children very fearful and uncomfortable, or ticklish, with a response of moving their shoulders upward. In the older child, the physical examination may proceed head to toe. Examination of the head and neck area requires good lighting particularly to view the areas of the neck region during examination. Gloves can be worn if skin lesions are noted.

\section*{Inspection of the head and neck}

Inspection of the head includes observation by the health care provider for head movement and head control. Head lag when pulling the infant to the sitting position is normal until 3 to 4
months of age in the term infant. Head lag should be evaluated in all infants in the first 6 months of life as an indicator of muscle tone. Persistent head lag between 4 and 6 months of age in the term infant is concerning, and the infant should be monitored closely for the attainment of developmental milestones and referred when indicated.

Head alignment should be evaluated in the young infant with the head at midline on the examining table and in the older infant and young child while being supported in a sitting position by the parent or caregiver. Persistent head tilt from the normal position may indicate hypotonia, congenital torticollis, muscular abnormalities, gastrointestinal reflux, or visual and hearing deficits. Range of motion and movement of the head should be examined to determine tone and flexibility. In examining the infant younger than 3 months, the provider should move the head passively on the examining table to the left and right to determine mobility and range of motion. At 3 to 4 months of age, the infant can begin to follow a light or small toy to determine the full range of motion of the head and neck and the function of the musculature. Any limited range of motion, head bobbing or jerking, tremors, persistent downward gaze, or involuntary muscle contractions or spasms should be further evaluated and referred when indicated.

Observe the shape and size of the head in the infant and young child. Head shape varies widely in young infants and generally follows a normal growth pattern influenced by familial and genetic patterns and cultural influences. A flattened occipital region or a unilateral flattening of the parietal region can occur in young infants because of prolonged positional placement. Positional skull deformities are often benign and reversible and will normalize by 3 months of age. ${ }^{4,5}$ With the universal recommendation of supine or "back to sleep" positioning of infants to prevent sudden infant death syndrome, there has been an increase in reported cases of positional or deformational plagiocephaly. Plagiocephaly refers to an asymmetrical flattening or deformity of the skull and occurs when external forces are applied to the developing skull of an infant and it becomes misshapen, often resulting in asymmetry of the ears and face. ${ }^{5,6}$ Deformational plagiocephaly is most commonly seen on the lateral and central side of the occiput (Fig. 10.6). ${ }^{6}$ It is more common
in infants with a lower level of motor activity, and with congenital torticollis or head tilt. ${ }^{7}$ Deformational plagiocephaly may be prevented by varying the head position frequently when putting the very young infant down to sleep on the back and by giving supervised tummy time when awake.

\end{figure}

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Most positional skull deformities can be prevented by alternating the infant's head position when supine from the left to right occipital area during sleep and providing short periods of supervised tummy time while the infant is awake. ${ }^{4}$

Craniosynostosis is the premature closure or fusion of sutures in the skull of the young infant, and causes a trapezoidal head shape
with flattening of both the occiput and frontal regions on the affected side, occurring in approximately 1 in 2000 births. ${ }^{4,7}$ Craniosynostosis often presents with palpable ridges along the cranial sutures. ${ }^{6}$ Health care providers need to be able to properly differentiate infants with positional or deformational plagiocephaly from those with craniosynostosis (Table 10.2). Lambodial craniosynostosis occurs in 3 in 100,000 births, and it causes a parallelogram-shaped skull with the ear displaced posteriorly and inferiorly. ${ }^{7}$ Always inspect the shape of the head in infants from above and with the infant supported in a sitting position with the head midline to verify the shape of the head and accuracy of the OFC of the head. If any significant abnormal shape of the head is noted, educate parents proactively to decrease the development of occipital and parietal flattening. ${ }^{4}$ For moderate to severe deformational plagiocephaly and craniosynostosis, referral is indicated. Repositioning and molding or helmet therapy are recommended for infants over 4 months of age. ${ }^{7}$

On inspection of the head, observe the level of the fontanel in the cranium. Normally, there is a slight pulsation in the anterior fontanel, and it is fuller or tenses slightly when the infant is crying but flattens when the infant calms. In the ill infant, a tense, bulging anterior fontanel can be a sign of increasing intracranial pressure due to meningitis or head trauma and is a medical emergency. Tumors in the brain and meninges can also cause increased intracranial pressure indicated by a bulging fontanel. Infants can have a mildly depressed fontanel, unaccompanied by other symptoms, which may indicate mild dehydration due to the metabolic demands of growth or fluid lost through heat and perspiration. A sunken fontanel, if accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, infection, or loss of normal turgor of skin and mucous membranes, may indicate severe dehydration and requires immediate further evaluation and treatment.

The neck should be inspected for symmetry, shape, and mobility. In the newborn and very young infant, the neck is shortened and the musculature is underdeveloped, so it is best to inspect the neck with the infant on a firm surface for examination. While supporting the neck and shoulders cradled with the thumb and forefingers, use the opposite hand to extend the infant's head back slightly to expose the shortened neck region and conduct a full inspection. This position allows the examiner to determine the symmetry and strength of the musculature of the neck, the alignment of the trachea, and the condition of the skin in the infant and young child, who are vulnerable to fungal and bacterial infection in the anterior neck region. Torticollis, or wryneck, causes the head to tilt to one side and limits range of motion of the neck muscles. Congenital torticollis is the most common associated finding in infants with deformational plagiocephaly, and early referral is indicated to support repositional therapy for the head. ${ }^{6}$ Acquired torticollis in the infant or young child may be related to viral infection or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) associated with
overfeeding, or it may be associated with hypotonia or neurological condition with rotation of the head and extension of the neck.

Infants and young children with unexplained fever, irritability, or a bulging fontanel associated with increased intracranial pressure may indicate pain or neck stiffness during examination of the neck region. Meningismus or meningitis, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, can manifest in the neck. To assess for meningismus, flex the head forward or ventrally with the infant or young child lying on a flat surface or examining table. Pain, irritability, resistance to movement, and range of motion on flexion of the neck is a sign of nuchal rigidity. Brudzinski sign or flexion of the lower extremities will occur spontaneously, with flexion of the head forward when meningismus is present to guard or protect the body from pain. Kernig sign, pain or resistance to straightening legs or knees from the flexed position, also indicates a positive sign for meningeal irritation. Opisthotonos, hyperextension of the neck and spine, indicates severe meningeal irritation.

In the school-aged child, tilting the head back slightly during inspection of the neck will assist the health care provider in evaluating the structures of the neck. Inspect the thyroid gland for size and symmetry, and note any swelling or masses. Asking the child to swallow may assist the provider in distinguishing the structure of the neck and movement of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland should rise as the child swallows. In children who are obese, adipose tissue in the neck region is common and should not be mistaken for an enlarged thyroid gland.

\section*{Inspection of the face}

Examination of the facial area begins with initial observation of the infant, child, or adolescent for symmetry of facial features, ears, and facial movements. Observing the smile, laugh, facial creases, and nasolabial folds reveals normal innervation of the facial structures. Observing the symmetry of the facial features in the infant while crying will assist in assessing any facial or neurological injury that occurred during birth. During vaginal deliveries, excessive lateral traction of the head and neck away from the shoulder may injure the brachial plexus and the ventral root of the fifth cervical nerve, ${ }^{1}$ and cause paralysis of the arm and shoulder. Injury to the facial
nerve before or during the birth process may cause asymmetrical nasolabial folds and/or asymmetrical facial expression. Any unusual facies with disproportional features, frontal bossing of the forehead, and small or low-set ears may be indicative of a genetic abnormality and require further evaluation and referral.

\section*{Palpation of the head}

Begin palpation at the crown of the head and evaluate the scalp and the bony structures of the skull. In the infant, palpate fontanels for size, level of tenseness, and pulsations (Fig. 10.7). Note the length and width of the fontanel for infants with unusually large fontanels and monitor the head circumference. Infants and young children who present with a bulging fontanel and signs of increased intracranial pressure may have a resonant or cracked-pot sound, Macewen sign, when the scalp is tapped or percussed with the forefinger.

\end{figure}
fontanels (B).
In the first few months of life, an infant may have a visible or palpable ridge at the sutures lines of the cranium. This is a metopic ridge and is normal variant when the head shape appears normal and the OFC is normal. Infants with a wide margin along the sagittal suture may have a communicating anterior and posterior fontanel, often referred to as a metopic suture. Suture lines are normally not palpable after 4 to 6 months of age in the term infant. Premature closure of the sutures may indicate craniosynostosis, or asymmetrical growth of the skull, which requires immediate evaluation and referral. Separation of the sagittal suture is one of the most common findings in infants with Down syndrome, along with a flattened occiput and a small rounded head.

When palpating the skull of an infant less than 6 months of age, an abnormal softness of the cranium known as craniotabes may be noted, and it is related to an incomplete ossification of bone in the cranium or widened sutures. It can be a normal variant in the term infant; however, if craniotabes is accompanied by abnormal facies or persists after 6 months of age, it may be associated with hydrocephalus or rickets, and further evaluation and referral is necessary.

Palpate for any tenderness, masses, skin lesions, or edema of the skull on examination, and note the size, location, and character of the mass or nodule, and evaluate for mobility and pain. Infants should be monitored closely for increasing head size, misshapen head, or positional deformities. Any abnormal skull findings require diagnostic evaluation and referral as indicated. Any depression on the scalp indicating a skull fracture requires urgent evaluation.

\section*{Palpation of the sinuses}

Only the maxillary and frontal sinuses can be assessed in school-age children and adolescents by physical examination through inspection and palpation. Evaluate for swelling and tenderness by tapping with the forefingers or applying mild pressure with the thumb or forefinger over the maxillary and frontal sinus area (see Chapter 14).

\section*{Palpation and auscultation of the neck}

If masses or nodules are noted during the inspection of the neck in the infant, then the provider should palpate the neck to evaluate the size, shape, and character of the mass or nodules. Brachial cleft cysts are smooth, nontender masses on the lateral neck area along the border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. They may be fluctuant and require surgical removal. Thyroglossal duct cysts present higher in the neck region and require diagnostic evaluation and referral. Surgical removal may be indicated. Palpation of the lymph glands is reviewed in Chapter 11.

In the infant and young child, palpate the sternocleidomastoid muscle for masses, strength, and tone, including the clavicular area at the base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Any sign of pain or irritability, or resistance to range of motion of the neck or arm in the infant, child, or adolescent, indicates an abnormal finding and requires further evaluation. Resistance to lateral motion of the neck may indicate torticollis, lymph gland swelling, infection, or trauma to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. If webbing of the neck is noted, it may indicate Turner syndrome (Table 10.3).

\end{tabular}

The jugular vein is not normally distended in children who are sitting or standing upright. Pulsations in the jugular vein in the neck may be seen when the child is lying supine on the examining table. The jugular vein should appear full but not bulging, and it is normal to observe jugular venous pulsations (JVPs). The JVP is normally a gentle undulation visible in good lighting. The pulsations should be of normal rate and amplitude, without bruits, or blowing sounds, heard on auscultation over the vessel. Abnormal pulsations can indicate right-sided heart failure or pericarditis. In older children, carotid pulsations can be palpated with the finger pads of the second and third fingers in the area between the trachea and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Evaluate for rate, rhythm, and intensity. Avoid significant pressure to the carotid artery, which may cause a vagal response or hypotension. Auscultation may be performed to detect bruits, but is not routinely performed on children.

\section*{Palpation of the thyroid gland}

Palpation of the thyroid gland is not usually performed in infants
and young children, unless masses or nodular lesions are noted on inspection of the neck. The neck is short with strong musculature and difficult to palpate. Thyroid disease in infants and young children often presents with systemic symptoms including hypotonia, lethargy, distended abdomen, and enlarged tongue as in congenital hypothyroidism (see Table 10.3). Newborn screening for thyroid disease is required in all states, and results should be confirmed by the pediatric health care provider on the initial postpartum or well-child visit.

In school-aged children and adolescents, palpation of the thyroid gland is most easily approached from the front of the neck in the young child to minimize any fear that may occur during the examination. Tilt the head forward slightly while the child maintains a sitting position with the back straight. To guide the examination, the provider may gently support the child's head. Begin by using the forefinger to locate the prominent ring of the tracheal cartilage, the cricoid cartilage, which provides a landmark to determine the position of the thyroid gland (Fig. 10.8A). Just lateral to the carotid cartilage, palpate the thyroid gland by placing one hand on one side of the trachea and gently displacing the thyroid tissue to the contralateral side of the neck (see Fig. 10.8B). Repeat this movement to examine both sides of the thyroid gland. Once positioned, extend the forefingers of both hands and apply slight pressure for deep palpation along both sides of the trachea and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and ask the child to swallow. Fingernails must be groomed short for effective examination of the thyroid. Tilting the head to one side or rotating the neck very gently may help evaluate the size, quality, and firmness of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland can also be examined from behind in adolescents and young adults with the head tilted slightly forward. Using the cricoid cartilage as a landmark, the provider uses the forefingers of both hands to palpate deeply, laterally to the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see Fig. 10.8C). A soft, mushy gland, or any masses or nodules noted on examination of the thyroid gland, are abnormal and require prompt evaluation. A goiter is a firm, nontender, mobile, symmetrical mass in the neck. Enlargement of the thyroid gland may occur with hyperthyroidism,

Graves disease, or Hashimoto thyroiditis.

\section*{Diagnostic procedures}

An ultrasound may be the most appropriate initial noninvasive test to perform in an infant with positional or deformational plagiocephaly, or for an infant or child with an abnormal mass in the neck region. Computed tomography (CT) imaging may be necessary in some cases for differentiation of cysts or solid neck lesions. On a child or adolescent with an enlarged thyroid or signs and symptoms of thyroid disease such as weight loss, fatigue, or growth failure, thyroid function test, thyroxine ( $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ), and TSH should be performed. Chapter 11 reviews the diagnostics for the lymph glands in the neck region and lymphatic system.

For children or adolescents presenting with a history of moderate or severe head trauma, a CT scan may be indicated to aid in diagnosis. Children must remain immobilized during CT imaging. For diagnosis of possible tumors or malformations in the skull, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated. MRIs require sedation in children and may require injection of contrast for digital subtraction angiography. Skeletal radiography is used to evaluate
cranial abnormalities such as craniosynostosis.

\section*{Head and neck conditions}

Table 10.3 presents the most common acute and chronic conditions of the head and neck in infants, children, and adolescents.

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Observe the infant for head control. Head lag is normal until 3 to 4 months of age when pulling the infant to the sitting position.
- Observe shape and size of the head in the infant and young child. Monitor head circumference for abnormal growth. Note any misshapen skull or masses, nodules, or lesions on scalp.
- Fontanels should be palpated for size, pulsations, level of tenseness, or depression of fontanel.
- Inspect neck for symmetry, shape, and mobility.
- Palpate neck for any swelling, masses, or nodules.
- Palpation of the thyroid gland is often omitted in infants and young children unless masses or nodular lesions are noted on inspection.
- To examine the thyroid, begin by locating the cricoid cartilage as a landmark for examination of the thyroid gland. Palpate the thyroid gland by placing one hand on one side of the trachea and gently displacing the thyroid tissue to the contralateral side of the neck. Apply slight pressure with the forefingers. Ask the child or adolescent to swallow.
- Any masses or nodules on the scalp or masses in the neck area require diagnostic evaluation and referral when indicated.

Lymphatic system assessment

\section*{Embryologic development}

The lymphatic system is established in the mesoderm layer during the third week of embryonic development, and the development of the primary lymphoid organs, the thymus, and bone marrow begins during the fifth to sixth week of fetal development. ${ }^{1}$ The secondary lymphoid organs-the spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissue-develop soon after the primary organs and are well developed at birth. The ectoderm gives rise to the epithelial linings of the glandular cells of the large organs that make up the lymphatic system. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Developmental variations}

The spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissue are small at birth and mature rapidly after exposure to antigens or microbes during the postnatal period. The thymus is the largest lymphoid tissue in the body at birth and continues to develop during the first year of life as the immune system develops. At puberty the thymus begins slowly regressing as the immune system is well established in the lymphoid tissue. ${ }^{1}$

Lymphatic malformation can occur during early embryonic
development as a congenital defect of the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic channels may become blocked, and lymphatic fluid collects in the vessels during embryonic development, forming a mass or cyst which is present at birth but may not be detected until later in the first year of life or in early childhood. Fetal ultrasound (US) may detect large congenital malformations noted at birth. A lymphatic cyst or mass generally occurs in the neck, mouth, or tissues around the ear and may be associated with other chromosomal abnormalities (Table 11.1).

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Lymphatic system}

The lymphatic system is one of the most sensitive indicators of infection and toxins in children. The lymphatic tissue plays a role in the immune system as a first responder to fight infection through phagocytosis, the destruction of harmful cells, and the production of lymphocytes and antibodies. The lymphatic system forms an extensive network throughout the body and is composed of capillaries, collecting vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs.

The bone marrow and thymus, which are the central lymphoid organs, provide the center for the production and maturation of the immune cells. ${ }^{1}$ The peripheral lymphoid organs-the spleen, tonsils, appendix, and lymphatic tissue in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems-concentrate antigens or immunogens and promote the cellular interactions of the immune response throughout the body to seek out and destroy microbes. ${ }^{1}$

Lymph is a clear, colorless fluid filtered and collected through the lymphatic capillaries from the organs and tissues throughout the body. The fluid consists of white bloods cells and occasionally red blood cells. The collecting vessels or lymphatic vessels are small canals that lie near the blood vessels and carry lymph from the lymphatic capillaries to the lymph glands and back to the bloodstream. The lymph is deposited into the bloodstream through the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck. The lymphatic system also absorbs fat and fat-soluble substances from the intestinal wall. The lymph and fat are transported from the lymph glands to the larger ducts and through venous return to the heart. The lymphatic system plays a major role in the maintenance of fluid balance and filters fluid at the lymph nodes and removes bacteria. Obstruction of lymph flow or removal of lymph nodes causes lymphedema.

Lymph glands are small aggregates of lymphoid tissue lying along lymphatic vessels throughout the body and consist of outer cortical layers and an inner medullary layer. The terms lymph gland and lymph node are often used interchangeably, and both terms can be applied to the lymphatic system. A gland is an organ that produces a substance or secretion, and a node is a swelling or protuberance. The lymph nodes throughout the body are filters for the collection vessels. Each lymph node processes lymph from the surrounding anatomic area. Lymph nodes remove antigens and microbes from the lymph before it enters the bloodstream, serve as the site of the body's immune response, and aid in the maturation of lymphocytes and monocytes. The immune response within the lymph node ultimately leads to its increase in size. ${ }^{2}$ Fig. 11.1 illustrates the lymph glands in the head and neck area and gives a view of the lymphatic chain in the body.

The T lymphocytes are responsible for cell-mediated immunity and aid in antibody production. They are activated in the cortex of the lymph nodes and proliferate to fight antigens. The B lymphocytes are essential for humoral immunity. They interact with the T lymphocytes and migrate to the medulla to mature before releasing antibodies. Many interactions in the immune system depend upon the secretion of chemical mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. Cytokines are soluble proteins secreted by cells of the immune system and mediate many functions within the cell. Chemokines are cytokines that stimulate the immune system and activate inflammatory cells systemically in acute and chronic conditions activating the lymphatic system. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Occipital nodes are located high above the hairline in the infant and are often missed by the examiner palpating too low at the nape of the neck. Occipital adenopathy may be an indicator in the newborn of maternal infection during pregnancy or in the infant of an acute viral infection. They may be visible on inspection and are often noted by the parent of a young infant.

The tonsils and adenoids are organs of the lymphatic system. The buds of tonsillar tissue are present in the oropharynx at birth but are underdeveloped. As the immune system develops and reacts to respiratory triggers, such as viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and environmental toxins, the tonsils are the first line of defense. The tonsils harbor the immune cells needed to respond to the constant exposure of microorganisms. The adenoidal tissue is a mass of lymphoid tissue situated posterior to the nasal cavity. The adenoids are also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil. Significant hypertrophy of the adenoidal tissue can partially or completely block airflow through the nasal passages and impact the quality of the voice. Adenoiditis, the inflammation of the adenoid tissue, often accompanies tonsillitis and occurs mainly in childhood. Incidence decreases with age, due to atrophy of adenoid tissue after adolescence.

The thymus gland is embedded beneath the upper sternum above the heart and is a fully developed organ in the term infant. The thymus gland is prominent in the mediastinum of the newborn and infant in the first year of life, often shadowing the cardiac silhouette on radiographs (Fig. 11.2). In the infant the thymus begins to produce mature T lymphocytes and plays an important role in cellmediated immunity. In puberty, when the immune system is well established, the thymus decreases in size and is gradually mostly replaced by adipose tissue. Thymus tissue persists in the adult but has no demonstrated function.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 11.2 Thymus gland in young child.}
\end{figure}

The spleen lies in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen protected by the rib cage. It is composed of lymphoid tissue and reticuloendothelial cells and is a densely vascular organ. The spleen acts to filter antigens in the bloodstream and responds to systemic infections. The spleen acts as a part of the immune system and hosts a sequence of activation events similar to the lymph nodes to fight blood-borne infection. In the infant and young child the spleen stores erythrocytes and filters the blood through the large presence of phagocytes. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system and the storage of erythrocytes, but it is a nonvital organ in the body.

\section*{Physiologic variations}

In the newborn the amount of lymphatic tissue is small, but lymphadenopathy, enlargement of the lymph glands, can often be detected particularly in the occipital region as a result of perinatal infections. Lymphoid tissue increases throughout the first year of life, and cervical lymph nodes become more pronounced with respiratory infections by 12 months of age. In the young child, splenomegaly may also occur with episodic viral illness. By school age, tonsillar and adenoidal tissues are approximately the same size as in an adult, and then they increase in volume during pubertal development when tonsillar tissue becomes twice the adult size. During late adolescence the volume of lymphatic tissue begins to decrease and resumes an adult level, which is $2 \%$ to $3 \%$ of total
body weight.
The variable size of the lymphoid tissue in early and middle childhood may be one of the contributing factors of obstructive sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing, but other common causes include congenital craniofacial abnormalities, chronic nasal allergy, recurrent respiratory infections, environmental irritants, and childhood obesity. All children and adolescents should now be screened for snoring. ${ }^{2}$ It is important to differentiate primary snoring from snoring associated with disordered breathing. Pediatric sleep-disordered breathing is characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and intermittent obstructive apnea that disrupts normal sleep patterns. ${ }^{3}$ The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is currently $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ in the pediatric population, and the prevalence of primary snoring is estimated to be $3 \%$ to $12 \% .^{4}$

\section*{System-specific history}

When a child presents with lymphadenopathy or enlarged lymph glands, obtaining a complete history is key to an accurate assessment of infection in the pediatric population. The Information Gathering table reviews the areas of assessment that are pertinent for each age group and developmental stage and focuses on exposure to infection.

\section*{Physical assessment}

Lymph glands are distributed throughout the body and normally range in size from 3 mm in the head to 1 cm in the neck and inguinal area. In children, lymph glands are often palpable and the pediatric health care provider will often palpate small, firm, mobile lymph nodes along the cervical chain on physical examination. These are occasionally referred to as "shotty" nodes because of their pellet like distribution. The provider must be an astute observer when examining the lymphatic system, because each region of the body has clusters or chains of lymph glands that can signal infection in adjacent areas.

\section*{Inspection and palpation}

It is important to include the inspection and palpation of the lymph glands regionally during the physical examination. The examination includes palpating lymph glands accessible in four areas: the head and neck, arms, axillae, and inguinal areas of the body. Most effective for palpation are the pads of the examiner's second, third, and fourth fingers. It is important to distinguish between massage and palpation. Superficially massaging an area may not detect nodes, but superficial then deep palpation with the forefingers moving over the neck regions can better determine the size and mobility of a lymph gland. Lymph nodes are generally mobile and nontender and do not feel warm to the touch. Lymph nodes $>1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter are considered enlarged and defined as cervical lymphadenopathy. ${ }^{2}$ Inspect enlarged lymph nodes for erythema or edema. Lymph nodes that are immobile, tender, and warm to the touch indicate infection or an abscess and require further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Table 11.2 reviews
sizing of the lymph nodes commonly used to describe findings on physical exam.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Visible swelling in the lymph glands on inspection is generally an ominous sign in the child or adolescent and indicates the need for further diagnostic work-up and treatment if indicated.

\section*{Head and neck}

Assessment of the lymph glands begins with the inspection of the clusters of lymph glands in the head and neck area followed by palpation (Fig. 11.3). The cervical nodes constitute the largest collection of lymph glands in the body. In children, the cervical glands are often palpable because of the frequency of respiratory infections. The posterior auricular and preauricular nodes are often not palpable in the presence of common viral respiratory infections but are enlarged and palpable with infection related to the external and internal ear, the pinna, and surrounding skin. The occipital nodes in the infant and young child lie on either side of the occiput just above the base of the skull. In the young infant the occipital nodes are located well above the hairline, adjacent to the occipital bony prominence, and are commonly palpable with viral respiratory infections.

\end{figure}

The parotid glands are located anterior to the ear and surround the oral cavity. The submandibular, sublingual, and submental glands are located along the anterior and posterior jaw line and under the anterior jaw. They are palpable when infection occurs in the tongue, mucous membranes of the mouth, sublingual area extending to the base of the tongue, or gums or when decay or abscess occurs in the teeth (Fig. 11.4).

\end{figure}

The anterior superficial cervical nodes are palpable at the juncture of the mandible and sternocleidomastoid muscle at the neck. This examination requires both superficial and deep palpation, depending on the age and developmental stage of the child or adolescent. These glands are almost always palpable during throat and respiratory infections, but may be missed due to incorrect positioning of the fingertips during the assessment of the neck. The posterior superficial cervical nodes along the posterior neck area are palpable with systemic infection (Fig. 11.5), and posterior deep cervical nodes are rarely palpable in children and are only identifiable with deep palpation in the older child. The supraclavicular nodes, along the clavicle, are rarely palpable and if enlarged may indicate a malignancy (Fig. 11.6). Visible swelling in the lymph glands on inspection is generally an ominous sign in the
child or adolescent and indicates the need for further diagnostics and prompt consultation and referral. Table 11.3 presents conditions associated with lymph node findings on physical exam.

Abdomen
Palpation of the spleen is an important part of the examination for the lymphatic system, and tenderness and enlargement of the spleen on deep palpation indicates the need for further diagnostic evaluation. The examination of the spleen is reviewed in Chapter 15.

The inguinal nodes can be palpated along the juncture of the thigh and abdomen and along the inguinal ligament and the saphenous vein. The horizontal chain of inguinal nodes runs along the inferior groin, and the vertical chain can be palpated on deep palpation along the upper inner thigh. If lymph glands are enlarged in the inguinal area, they are often visible in normal weight children when lying supine on the examining table. Fig. 11.7 shows a young child in the supine position for examination of the inguinal nodes.
\end{abstract}

Inguinal lymphadenopathy often occurs with systemic viral infection in the pediatric patient.

\section*{Extremities}

The axillary, brachial, and subscapular nodes lie anteriorly along the brachial artery and in the axillae along the lateral edge of the pectoralis major muscle. They are generally noted in children only on deep palpation unless enlarged. Examination of the subscapular nodes of the axillary chain is illustrated in Fig. 11.8. The epitrochlear nodes lie along the medial aspect of the arm above the elbow and are palpable over the humerus. The epitrochlear and popliteal nodes are the only peripheral lymph nodes in the lymphatic system and act as collection ducts for the limbs. Table 11.4 reviews some of the causes of regional and systemic lymph node swelling in infants, children, and adolescents.

\end{table}

\section*{Diagnostic procedures}

For evaluation of lymphadenopathy in infants and children, a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, peripheral blood smear, blood culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP), rapid streptococcal antigen test and throat culture, ${ }^{5}$ and purified protein derivative (PPD) intradermal testing or interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFeron testing are commonly used. Ultrasound (US) is used, if indicated, for initial imaging of palpable neck masses in infants and children to avoid radiation exposure with computed tomography (CT). ${ }^{2}$ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated for pediatric neck masses compared with CT because it limits radiation exposure but requires sedation and is less readily available. Biopsy of the lymph nodes may be indicated when the diagnosis is unclear after initial work-up, systemic symptoms persist, or an isolated, enlarged lymph node or nonmobile mass persists that does not respond to antibiotic therapy.

Children with primary snoring and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea require a full-night sleep study or polysomnography (PSG) for confirmative diagnosis of pediatric sleep-disordered breathing. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Lymphatic conditions}

The extensive lymphatic system throughout the body provides the pediatric health care provider with a map in times of illness. The patterns of drainage leading to the regional lymph glands are indicative of infections that occur in different areas throughout the body. The head and neck region is the area of the body with the highest concentration of lymph glands, and even mild infections in children cause swelling in the regional lymph glands. However, generalized swelling of the lymph glands indicates a systemic source of infection, and general lymphadenopathy is more likely to occur in children than in adults. Accurate assessment and diagnosis
may depend on the pediatric health care provider's knowledge of the lymphatic drainage system.

Lymphadenopathy in children is generally episodic, benign, and self-limiting and is most often associated with viral infections. Cervical lymphadenitis refers to enlarged, inflamed, and tender lymph node(s) of the neck; although lymphadenitis refers to inflamed lymph nodes, the terms lymphadenitis and "lymphadenopathy" are often used interchangeably. Table 11.5 reviews common pediatric infectious conditions presenting with lymphadenopathy. ${ }^{2,7}$

\section*{Eyes}

\section*{Karen G. Duderstadt}

The eye is the most remarkable organ in the body as it is underdeveloped at birth and undergoes dramatic development in the first year of life. Although the eyes are anatomically complete, the sense of vision begins to develop over the first weeks and months of life. The development of normal vision depends on the reception of light rays that stimulate the internal eye during the early critical period after birth. Visual acuity is also determined by an infant's genetic predisposition, as well as physical and environmental health factors. Eye conditions that limit or occlude the process of visual development in the first year of life may affect the long-term visual health of the infant and child. A complete and thorough eye examination by the pediatric health care provider is critical to early detection and intervention to assure optimum visual development for infants and children.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The development of the eye begins in the third week of embryonic development, with the optic grooves forming in the neural tube, and by the end of the fourth week the optic vesicle is formed and lies close to the ectoderm surface. The surface of the ectoderm thickens and forms the lens placode. By the fifth week of gestation the optic cup and the lens cavity are formed, and by the sixth week, invagination of the optic vesicles occurs, forming the choroid layer and vasculature of the eye. The formation of the cornea, lens, and
anterior chamber proceeds during the seventh and eighth week, and the eyelid folds develop and begin to cover the palpebral fissure. It is during this period of gestation that insults to the fetus, such as maternal rubella and varicella cause the development of congenital cataracts. Development of the retinal tissue continues with the differentiation of the nerve fiber layer, proliferative layer of the macula, and the pigmented layer of the retina that precedes the development of the iris and the ciliary body, which occurs between the 9th and 12th weeks of embryonic development. The ciliary body gives rise to the ciliary muscles, which control the accommodative reflex and pupillary aperture (Fig. 12.1). Development of the structures of the eye is complete by 15 weeks gestation. During the fourth month of gestation, the development of the retinal blood vessels is initiated and full vascularization of the retina occurs just before birth in a term infant and is incomplete in the preterm infant. The pupillary light reflex, which requires an intact optic nerve and oculomotor nerve, can be elicited by 30 weeks gestation.

\end{figure}

\section*{Developmental and physiologic variations}

Visual development begins after birth at the very center of the retina in the macula. The macula is a circular area surrounding the fovea. At birth, the macula is not fully developed but holds the genetic potential for $20 / 20$ vision. The retina predominantly consists of rods at birth, and the cones are located near the outermost layer of the retina. As the retina is exposed to light, the cones migrate toward the center to become the anatomical macula on the fundus located on the posterior surface of the retina. The lens has a key role in focusing light on the neural layer of the retina, and the ciliary muscles assist in accommodation of the lens.

The optic nerve is also developing at the same time as the retina. There are as many as 8 million cells in the optic nerve and 5 million retinal cells in the optic neuron at birth that compete for synaptic sites on the nerve. Cells that are not oxygenated do not develop. In almost all term Infants the retina and retinal vasculature is fully developed. ${ }^{1}$ Hypoxia or hyperoxia in preterm infants often impacts the normal development of the retina and causes a retinopathy, a disorder of the retinal vessels. Preterm infants have an avascular zone in the periphery of the retina that disrupts the normal proliferation of the retinal vessels and interrupts blood flow to the visual receptors. The disruption of blood flow may lead to retinal detachment from the choroid, causing visual impairment or blindness if left untreated. The extent of the immaturity of the retina and the avascular zone depends mainly on the degree of prematurity at birth. ${ }^{1}$ Very low birth weight infants ( $\leq 1500 \mathrm{~g}$ ) are at highest risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and infants born at 28 weeks gestation or weighing $\leq 1000 \mathrm{~g}$ are at risk for developing macular folds and retinal detachment. ${ }^{2}$ Refractive anomalies also occur approximately eight times more frequently in preterm infants than in term infants. ${ }^{3}$ Infants with a birth weight of $\leq 1500 \mathrm{~g}$ or a gestational age of 30 weeks or less and infants with a birth weight between 1500 and 2000 g or gestational age of greater than 30 weeks with an unstable neonatal course should be referred to ophthalmology for retinal screening. ${ }^{1}$

Term infants from 36 to 40 weeks of gestation can perceive shape, color, motion, and patterns at birth. Visual development in the newborn is dependent upon development of the visual pathways that link the eyes to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and to the visual cortex located in the occipital lobe of the brain. Exposure to light begins the synaptic development of the neurons at birth. ${ }^{3}$ Central fixation is present shortly after birth in the term infant, and the human face at a distance of 8 to 12 inches holds the most visual interest for a newborn. The term infant is hyperopic, or farsighted, at birth. Visual images are focused behind and not on the retina, so the visual image is blurred. For the infant to see near objects, the ciliary muscles of the eye must work hard to accommodate, or shape, the lens; in time these efforts of the ciliary muscles result in thickening of the lens, which makes accommodation of the image onto the retina possible.

The term infant's eyes often wander or deviate in the first 6 weeks when trying to achieve visual fixation in the central field of vision. After 6 weeks of early visual stimulus, an infant is able to focus and visually follow an object or the parent's movements. Any inability to visually focus after 6 weeks of age in a term infant is considered suspect and at 3 months of age is considered abnormal. As the eyeball or globe grows, the hyperopia decreases and the lens hardens, but detailed visual acuity is not present until 3 to 4 months of age in the healthy eye and not until 3 to 4 months corrected age for preterm infants (Table 12.1). Differentiation and maturation of the fovea and the retinal layers of the macula continues until 8 months of age. ${ }^{3}$ The fovea is responsible for central vision, and the macula is responsible for colors and contrasts, and normal development of both are required for precise visual acuity. The critical window for normal development of full visual acuity is from birth to 5 to 6 years of age, and the synaptic development of the neuronal paths in the visual cortex continues until approximately 10 years of age. After this age, conditions that affect early visual development cannot be completely corrected (Table 12.2).

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{External eye}

The bony orbit is the structure surrounding the eye in the cranium. Only one-third of the eyeball, or optic globe, in the infant and child is exposed to the examiner, and the cranium protects the remainder of the globe in the orbital cavity. The optic foramen is the opening in the cranium that allows the passage of the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, and ophthalmic vein to pass from the globe to the brain and visual cortex. The upper eyelid is shaped by connective tissue containing tarsal plates. The meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plates near the hair follicles of the eyelashes in the upper and lower lids. In infants and children with atopic or allergic reactions, the meibomian glands, one of the oil-producing sebaceous glands in the body, exude a whitish or yellowish sebaceous material onto the base of the eyelids.

The lacrimal gland is located in the lateral aspect of the frontal bone in the orbital cavity (Fig. 12.2). It is a peanut-sized gland similar to the salivary glands. In each eyelid, the lacrimal duct opens onto the eyelid margin, and the nasolacrimal duct opens into the lacrimal sac, which is buried in the frontal process of the maxillary bone. The lacrimal puncta are noted at the edge of the upper and lower eyelids at the medial or inner canthus and allow the drainage of tears into the nasolacrimal duct and the lacrimal caruncle. The lacrimal caruncle is the elevated area of tissue bordering the upper and lower medial canthus and assists in drainage of tears. Tear production is normally present by 6 weeks of age in the term infant. The eyelashes add further protection to the surface of the eye and assist in lubricating the exterior surface of the eye.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 12.2 External eye and lacrimal apparatus.}
\end{figure}

The sclera, the outermost layer of the exterior structure of the globe or eyeball, is the firm collagenous layer that protects the intraocular structures (see Fig. 12.1). The conjunctiva is formed by thin mucous membrane lining the anterior surface of the sclera and inner eyelids and acts along with the tear film as a protective covering for the cornea (see Fig. 12.2). The conjunctiva has two surfaces: the palpebral and bulbar. The palpebral conjunctiva lines the inner eyelids, is vascular, and is covered by papillae. The bulbar conjunctiva is clear and contains no papillae and very few blood vessels. The bulbar conjunctiva covers the sclera up to the limbus, the juncture of the sclera and the cornea.

The cornea, the most anterior aspect of the external eye, is a lenslike structure that acts as a refractory surface for the eye and connects with the sclera at the limbus. The cornea is transparent and contains no blood vessels. The transparency allows light to be
focused on the retina. It derives oxygen from the aqueous humor and from tears. The anterior chamber is directly behind the cornea, and the posterior chamber is the thin area between the lens and the posterior iris. The anterior and posterior chambers contain aqueous humor, a clear nutrient fluid that circulates around the lens and the cornea and provides nutrition and oxygen. Glaucoma is increased intraocular pressure resulting from abnormalities in the ocular drainage of the aqueous humor, which damages the optic nerve. Congenital glaucoma may result from the abnormal development of the ocular drainage system and may cause clouding or enlargement of the cornea. It may be present at birth or develop during the first year of life and may result in blindness if untreated.

The iris is the pigmented structure containing the sphincter and dilator muscles, connective tissue, and pigmented epithelium. An absence of color in the iris may indicate albinism. The center of the iris is controlled by the ciliary body and iris muscles and forms the aperture, or pupil. The pupil constricts or dilates depending on the amount of light entering the eye. The ciliary body produces aqueous humor and controls accommodation. The iris lies behind the anterior chamber and in front of the crystalline lens and is protected by a thin clear capsule attached by small filaments to the ciliary body. A cataract is an opacity that occurs in the crystalline lens and obscures vision.

The upper eyelid is elevated by the levator muscle, which inserts into the tarsal plate in the upper eyelid and is innervated by cranial nerve III.

\section*{Extraocular muscles and internal eye}

The six ocular muscles, inserted into the scleral surface, control the movement of the eye (Fig. 12.3). The four rectus muscles-the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti-originate at the top of the globe deep in the cranium and extend from the anterior to the posterior globe and insert at the back of the globe. The medial rectus muscle is responsible for the movement of the eye toward the midline, and the lateral rectus muscle innervated by cranial nerve VI moves the eye away from the midline. The inferior and superior rectus muscles move the eye up and down and also have overlapping functions with the oblique muscles. The two oblique
muscles-the superior and inferior oblique-insert at the anterior and posterior globe. The superior oblique tendon passes through the trochlea, the small, cartilaginous pulley on the frontal bone. The superior oblique muscles are responsible for movement of the eye downward and inward, and the inferior oblique moves the eye upward and inward. The superior oblique muscle is also innervated by cranial nerve IV, and paralysis of the cranial nerve IV causes a head tilt or torticollis in children to compensate for the weakened muscle.

\end{figure}

The vitreous body is the large interior cavity of the globe and
contains a clear gel or vitreous humor. The choroid is the interior layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina and is continuous with the iris and ciliary body. It is highly vascular and nourishes the receptor cells of the retinal epithelium. The outer layer of the retina contains photoreceptors, the rods and cones, which are stimulated by light focused by the lens and translate light energy or impulses into neuronal activity. The neurons activate the nerve fiber layer of the retinal epithelium and synaptic activity and transmit through the optic nerve to the brain, which perceives the visual image.

The retinal vessels and optic nerve fibers enter and exit through the optic cup and divide into two branches on the surface of the optic disc. The optic disc, the anterior aspect of the optic nerve, is pink to orange-red or pale to dark with a yellow cup at its center (Fig. 12.4). There are no photoreceptors in the optic disc, which creates a blind spot of 5 degrees in the visual field. ${ }^{4}$ The macula lies medial to the optic nerve on the fundus, the posterior surface of the retina. The fovea or fovea centralis is a central depression in the macula without vessels and has darker pigmentation than the retina. This is the area where vision is most perfect, and the ciliary body works to accommodate the lens to focus an image on the fovea. The arteries on the fundus appear thinner and more orangered than the veins, which are larger and darker (see Fig. 12.4). The normal arterial-to-venous ratio ( $\mathrm{A}: \mathrm{V}$ ) is approximately $2: 3$ in the healthy individual. Vascular changes present in the retina that often reflect abnormal conditions in the systemic vasculature such as diabetes and hypertension. Papilledema, bilateral optic disc edema, is also associated with increased intracranial pressure. Retinal hemorrhage is associated with acute traumatic brain injury and inflicted traumatic brain injury. Retinal hemorrhages associated with inflicted traumatic brain injury in children involve deeper layers of the retina and are found more on the periphery of the retina (Fig. 12.5). ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

Thick epicanthal folds are seen more commonly in infants and young children of Asian and Latino descent. They partially or completely cover the inner canthus at birth and diminish by middle childhood. Asian populations have a genetic predisposition to myopia. In one study, $68 \%$ of Asian children were found to be myopic. ${ }^{3}$ The pediatric health care provider should focus particular attention to early vision screening in this population of children.

Ethnicity is a risk factor for severe ROP. Asian and African American infants have a higher risk of developing threshold ROP as compared with white infants. ${ }^{5}$

Retinal pigment or melanin is often found on the scleral surface of Latino and African-American children. The pigmented areas
usually become evident in early or middle childhood and persist into adulthood. This is within the range of normal variations of the eye and does not impact visual health. The retinal light reflex or "red" light reflex varies in color in darkly pigmented individuals. The fundus appears pale yellow or beige because of the increased melanin in the skin, and the optic disc is also often a pale yellow. Scleral melanocytosis is a common pediatric condition that characteristically features black or gray-blue pigmentation in the scleral tissue and becomes more prominent with increasing age. It is a benign condition common in Latino, African American, and Asian children and is usually bilateral (Fig. 12.6).

\section*{System-specific history}

Detecting vision problems early is critical to the healthy development of the visual system in infants and young children and to timely referral and intervention. Obtaining a complete history is key to early identification of visual problems or visual changes in infants, children, and adolescents. The Information Gathering table reviews the pertinent areas of information gathering for each pediatric age group and developmental stage of childhood.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Equipment}

The traditional ophthalmoscope performs all necessary screening in the pediatric population. The PanOptic ophthalmoscope, if available, provides a larger view of the internal eye structures in children (Fig. 12.7). A penlight may be used for screening the corneal light reflex and testing the pupillary reflex. The Snellen E, Tumbling E, Lea symbols, Allen vision cards, color vision, and near vision testing cards may be used in the clinical setting for vision acuity testing for the young child through young adulthood. An eye cover will assist in proper vision testing. Children under 4 years of age can also benefit from instrument-based pediatric vision testing. Testing of cranial nerves is presented in Chapter 20.

\end{figure}

\section*{Inspection of the external eye}

Begin the inspection of the eyes with a general inspection of the periorbital region, globe position, and lid margins. Note any asymmetry in the eyelids or eyebrows and whether the eyelashes are normally distributed. Note the size and shape of the periorbital cavity. The palpebral fissure or opening should be on a horizontal plane between the medial and lateral canthus in infants, and slants upward laterally in infants and children of Asian descent or children with Down syndrome. The upper eyelids should appear symmetrical. Inspect the conjunctiva for erythema or irritation, and the lid margins for erythema, crusting, lash distribution, and cysts or lesions. The eyelashes should be carefully examined for nits or lice. Observe for entropion (eyelashes curl inward) or ectropion
(lower eyelid appears droopy and eyelashes curl under).
Conditions such as ptosis, an eyelid that droops or has an absent or faint lid crease, may be a normal familial variant or the result of a brachial plexus injury during a difficult delivery. Ptosis extending partially over the pupil and causing the infant to tilt the head in an effort to see constitutes an impact on the visual field and requires prompt referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist (Fig. 12.8). When closed, the upper eyelid should meet the lower eyelid and completely cover the cornea and sclera.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{Inspection of the upper eyelid}

Inspection of the inside of the upper eyelid may be necessary when a child or adolescent presents with conjunctival irritation, infection, trauma, foreign body, or possible injury or abrasion of the cornea. To evert the upper eyelid for examination in the cooperative child, give the child a toy or bright object and ask the child to look down at the object. Grasp the upper eyelashes at the base and gently pull out and up while pushing in and down with a cotton applicator on
the upper tarsal plate (Fig. 12.9). Gently remove the cotton applicator and hold the eyelid while inspecting the adnexa. The palpebral conjunctiva should have a pink and glossy appearance and the adnexa should be clear. To return the lid to a normal position, have the child look up as the lid is released. This procedure is well tolerated by middle childhood and in cooperative school age children. In early childhood, administration of a topical anesthetic, such as proparacaine, may be necessary, or referral to an ophthalmologist may be made if indicated to ensure a thorough assessment of the eye. Newborn infants will occasionally have an inverted eyelid, which is within the normal range of variations.

\section*{Assessment of visual fields and visual alignment}

Sight is the most complex of the senses, and any insult to the eye along the visual pathway during development of the sensory organ
can impact vision. The alignment and position of the pupil in the visual field and the clarity of the cornea is determined by the corneal light reflex, or Hirschberg test. It can be performed with a penlight or otoscope light without the speculum (Fig. 12.10). Focus the light source about 12 inches from the infant, and note the reflection of the light from the cornea at the center of the pupil. The light should be symmetrical in the center of the pupil. Any asymmetry of the light reflex could indicate ocular misalignment and could impact visual development.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-338.jpg?height=1132&width=1317&top_left_y=953&top_left_x=368}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 12.10 Testing corneal light reflex.}
\end{figure}

Next, evaluate the six extraocular muscles (EOMs) by having the child or adolescent follow a penlight or the examiner's finger through the six cardinal fields of gaze in the visual field (Fig. 12.11A). This testing evaluates the normal function of the oculomotor (cranial nerve III), trochlear (cranial nerve IV), and abducens (cranial nerve VI) nerves (see Fig. $12.11 \mathrm{~B}-\mathrm{D}$ ). In infancy and early childhood, the examiner should focus the light
approximately 12 inches from the eyes. A cooperative infant should normally be able to follow the light on horizontal and vertical planes by 6 months of age.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-339.jpg?height=1583&width=572&top_left_y=573&top_left_x=736}

\end{figure}

The cover-uncover test further evaluates ocular alignment and can be performed as early as 6 months of age in an alert infant. The young infant should be assessed on the examination table. The
infant or toddler should be seated in the parent's lap. Begin by having the infant or child fixate on a penlight or light of the otoscope, the light of the large aperture on the ophthalmoscope, or a bright object. If the infant is alert but distracted, it is helpful to dim the lights and use a toy. Keep in mind infants will often reach for the toy but will often focus on a light. Use the nondominant hand or an occluder brought in laterally over the eye while the infant or child is fixating on the light or bright object. Observe the uncovered eye for fixation on the light or object. Remove the hand or occluder, and note any deviations or movement of the covered or uncovered eye from the central gaze. Any deviation or movement of the eye from the central gaze or focus on refixation on the light by either the covered or uncovered eye may indicate abnormal alignment and should be further evaluated (Fig. 12.12). An inward deviation of the eye is referred to as esotropia (Fig. 12.13); an outward deviation is referred to as exotropia. If a phoria is present, the covered eye will deviate and refixate when the hand or occluder is removed. This indicates a focusing abnormality and should be referred. As visual acuity develops, the cover-uncover test should be performed with the child fixating on a distant object or wall poster and should continue to be part of the physical examination until 10 years of age.

\end{figure}

\section*{Conditions of visual alignment}

Abnormalities in ocular alignment noted on examination may be congenital or acquired and may involve conditions affecting the muscle or nerve. Congenital esotropia occurs in the first 6 months and accommodative esotropia occurs between 12 months and 7 years of age.

Strabismus is nonalignment of the eyes causing the visual image to fall on the retina at a distance from the fovea. This disrupts binocular vision or visual fusion and keeps the eyes from working simultaneously. The resultant double vision and loss of depth perception from the blurred image impact normal binocular vision and visual development during the critical period of development in the first 5 to 6 years of life. Young children are often unaware of visual changes or deficits. If strabismus goes undiagnosed, amblyopia develops. A common finding in the young infant that prompts over referral to ophthalmology is pseudoesotropia or pseudostrabismus, a crossed appearance of the eyes caused by the large epicanthal folds covering the sclera (Fig. 12.14). The corneal light reflex or Hirschberg test differentiates pseudostrabismus from strabismus.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-343.jpg?height=398&width=926&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=562}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 12.14 Pseudoesotropia. Source: (From Palay DA, Krachmer JH: Primary Care Ophthalmology, ed 2, St. Louis, 2005, Mosby.)}
\end{figure}

Amblyopia is a monocular loss of vision during the critical period of visual development in the first 6 to 8 years of life. The visual development in one eye is suppressed due to insufficient visual stimulation and the better functioning eye becomes the dominant eye. The common causes of loss of binocular vision during visual development are changes in the visual cortex due to unequal refraction in the eyes, cataracts, ptosis, congenital hemangioma of the eyelid, trauma, and untreated strabismus. The cover-uncover test and the corneal light reflex are both required in a complete ophthalmologic examination to detect strabismus and amblyopia.

Nystagmus is spontaneous, involuntary movement of one or both eyes and is an indication of poor visual acuity. In the preterm infant, persistent or horizontal nystagmus can indicate ROP, intracranial hemorrhage, or tumor. In the term infant, congenital nystagmus can be associated with Down syndrome, atrophy of the optic nerve, retinal dystrophy, congenital cataracts, abnormalities of the ocular muscles or nerves, vestibular disturbances, and decreased visual acuity. In the older child or adolescent, drug overdose or chemical toxicity is a possible cause. Slight horizontal nystagmus in the lateral fields of gaze is normal. Children with amblyopia exhibit nystagmus because of loss of vision in the affected eye. If nystagmus is noted, a thorough neurologic examination is warranted, as well as an evaluation by a pediatric ophthalmologist.

\section*{Assessment of the internal eye}

The retinal light reflex or red light reflex determines the clarity of the posterior chamber of the eye, the receptivity to light, and the
sensitivity of the retina to visual stimulus. To elicit the retinal light reflex, the examiner brings the ophthalmoscope to touch the eyebrow and positions it obliquely at a 15 - to 25 -degree angle lateral to the eye approximately 12 inches from the infant or child. Use the ophthalmoscope on the " 0 " setting to view the fundus. Dim the lights, and bring the retinal light reflex into view in each eye. Inspect for symmetry and brightness, or brilliance, of the retinal light reflex. A lens that is congenitally dislocated or abruptly dislocated because of trauma appears as a darkened or asymmetrical retinal light reflex. Any asymmetry in size or color or darkness in the uniformity of the retinal light reflex indicates the need for immediate referral to an ophthalmologist.

The Bruckner test assesses the retinal light reflex through the ophthalmoscope simultaneously in both pupils from a distance of 2 feet to 3 feet from the infant or child. Compare the pupil and iris in both eyes for color, size, shape, movement, and clarity. To inspect for opacities, dim the light and illuminate the cornea by shining the light of the ophthalmoscope obliquely approximately 15 degrees from the lateral canthus. An alert infant with normal visual development should blink at a bright light directed at the eye.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS \\ To visualize the retinal or red light reflex in the newborn or in early infancy, hold the infant slightly upright from the exam table and, while cradling the head, gently rock the infant. As the head is lowered to the exam table, the eyes will usually open to examine the retinal light reflex.}

To test for visual accommodation and pupillary reaction, shine a bright light momentarily into the eye. As the light approaches the iris, the pupil should begin to dilate. When bringing the light of the large aperture of the ophthalmoscope near the pupil from a distance, the pupils constrict as the light nears.

\section*{Conditions of the internal eye}

Any serious defect of the cornea, aqueous chamber, lens, and
vitreous chamber can be detected in the infant and young child by assessing the quality of the retinal light reflex. Leukokoria, a whitish opacity of the pupil visible in dim light or in room light, is highly abnormal and appears as an absent retinal light reflex or a partially darkened reflex if the opacity does not cover the entire pupil (Fig. 12.15). This finding is usually unilateral. Congenital cataracts and retinoblastoma are associated with an absent or incomplete retinal light reflex and may have a presenting sign of leukocoria. A coloboma of the iris is an irregular or teardrop-shaped iris, which causes a deficit in the visual field and impacts visual acuity. Most colobomas are diagnosed at birth and are associated with chromosomal syndromes. If caused by trauma, colobomas requires immediate referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist (Fig. 12.16).

\end{figure}

\section*{Visual acuity testing}

Visual acuity testing should begin with verbal children at 2 to 3 years of age, with the Allen vision cards (Fig. 12.17 and Table 12.3). Children should be allowed to practice with a parent or caretaker to familiarize themselves with the figures. Then testing should proceed starting at a near distance, testing each eye separately using an occluder held by the parent. The examiner should then show the Allen vision cards while walking backward and continue testing one eye and then both eyes until the distance is 15 feet to 20 feet for the 3 - to 5 -year-old child. Allen vision cards test to $20 / 30$ or 15/30 depending on the distance from the child and the figure size of the cards.

The Snellen Tumbling E test begins in the prekindergarten age group and is used until the child knows the alphabet with accuracy. It is also used with children and adolescents with low literacy or learning problems. The examiner may ask the child which way the "legs of the table" are pointing. Using this directional approach may be difficult for children with learning disabilities or attention or behavior problems. The Snellen E distance acuity chart can be used when the child achieves literacy. Children of school age may become myopic (nearsighted) as the eye matures. Over the past decade, there has been an increased prevalence in myopia (nearsightedness) in children and young adults due to an interaction between environmental factors, including more near work or screen time, a decrease in exposure to outdoor light, and genetic predisposition. ${ }^{6}$ The prevalence varies according to ethnicity and geographic region. ${ }^{6}$

Testing the eyes separately to detect a difference in refractive error is extremely important in young children. Occluding the eye properly is the key to accurate testing of visual acuity. Anisometropia, a difference in refraction between the eyes, can lead
to amblyopia. It is difficult to detect in the young child because the eye initially remains in alignment. Referral is indicated if accurate visual testing yields a 20/40 refraction bilaterally or a greater than 20 difference in refraction between the eyes (e.g., 20/30 in the left eye and 20/70 in the right eye).

\section*{Instrument-based pediatric vision screening}

Instrument-based pediatric vision screening uses optical images of the retinal or red light reflex to estimate refractive error and ocular alignment, which put children at risk for developing amblyopia. Photoscreening instruments, which assess both eyes simultaneously, and autorefraction instruments, which screen one eye at a time, have been found to be accurate for vision screening in children 6 months to 3 years of age. ${ }^{7}$ Portable photoscreening and handheld autorefraction instruments may result in earlier detection of amblyopia if performed and interpreted by trained individuals. They are also useful for screening older children who are developmentally delayed or unable to cooperate with routine acuity screening. ${ }^{7}$ The use of vision charts and standard physical examination techniques to assess amblyopia in children 3 to 5 years of age remains standard practice currently.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Humans normally blink approximately 15 times a minute, but using computers and other digital screen devices, they blink half to a third that often. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends following the 20-20-20 rule-for every 20 minutes of screen time, users should shift their gaze to an item approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eye strain and eye dryness. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Evidence-Based Practice Tip}

Vision problems can interfere with the process of reading, but
children with dyslexia or related learning problems have the same visual function and ocular health as children without such conditions. Currently, there is inadequate scientific evidence to support the view that subtle eye or visual problems cause or increase the severity of learning problems. ${ }^{9}$

\section*{Color vision testing}

Visual testing for color sensitivity should occur at 4 years of age or before school entry. Children should be tested between 4 and 8 years of age for any history of difficulty with color recognition. Difficulty or confusion when identifying colors may be related to cognitive learning differences and should alert parents and teachers. The incidence of color vision deficit, previously referred to as color blindness, is $8 \%$ in white males and $4 \%$ in African American males. The incidence in females is from $0.4 \%$ to $1 \%$. Testing should be completed with the Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR) test. The HRR test uses a series of symbols rather than numbers, which allows reliable testing to be done on young children. The Ishihara test, which uses a series of figures and letters composed of spots of certain colors, can be used on the older child. The child with a color vision deficit fails to see letters or figures of a certain color.

\section*{Funduscopic examination}

The ophthalmoscopic exam permits the examiner to clearly visualize the internal structures of the eye in a child who is able to sit for examination and focus steadily on a distant point. This generally occurs by 5 to 6 years of age.

Using the lens selector disc, focus the ophthalmoscope on the palm at close distance before examining the child to determine the clarity of the image and accommodate for any visual deficit in the examiner. The lens indicator may read " 0 " or $\pm$ to produce the clearest image, depending on the visual acuity of the examiner. Resting the hand on the child's forehead just above the eyebrow, begin with the ophthalmoscope positioned laterally approximately 2 inches from the eye to decrease miosis, constriction of the pupils (Fig. 12.18). The rubber pad on the face of the ophthalmoscope should be resting on the eyebrow of the examiner. Use a distant
focal point to attract the child's attention and help him or her to fixate and look over the shoulder of the examiner. As the examiner moves medially toward the central field of vision, the vessels of the fundus should come into view. Once a vessel in the retina is in focus, follow along the vessel; where it "branches" will point toward the optic nerve. The optic disc should come into view in the medial aspect of the fundus. The macula is examined last to minimize miosis. Forcibly opening the eyes of a child results in a frustrated child and an incomplete examination. If examination is immediately necessary but cooperation is not achieved through verbal preparation or proper positioning of the child, then referral to a pediatric ophthalmologist is indicated.

The ear is a sensory organ that functions as part of a complex sensory system for hearing and vestibular equilibrium. Visual inspection of the ear is only the first step in determining the normal function of this complex organ. The role of the pediatric health care provider is to maintain function of the ear to preserve hearing and balance in the child and adolescent and to detect any abnormalities early in infancy. The goal of early detection is to promote optimum development of hearing and to support normal development of speech and language.

\section*{Embryologic development}

\section*{External ear}

The external ear is a cartilaginous structure on the external surface of the temporal bone (Fig. 13.1). The structures of the ear evolve in the mesoderm, and development of the external ear begins during the sixth week of gestation when the six hillocks of His develop from the first and second branchial arches. The individual portions of the auricle, or flap of the ear, begin to fuse and assume the classic adult shape by the 12th week of gestation, and fusion is complete by the 20th week (Fig. 13.2). The normal auricle should be no greater than 10 degrees off vertical plane or slope, and the superior portion should be in line with the outer canthus of the eye (Fig. 13.3). Minor malformations of the auricle may be normal variants, such as
preauricular skin tags, a preauricular sinus, or Darwin tubercle, a slight thickening or nodule at the upper portion of the helix (Fig. 13.4). Malformations can also be the result of intrauterine position, exposure to certain toxins or medications such as isotretinoin (Accutane), intrauterine infection, or other intrauterine complications occurring during this early phase of fetal development. Some genetic syndromes, Down syndrome, first arch syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and Nager syndrome, are associated with ear malformations, such as a small external ear, anotia, the total absence of the auricle with narrowing or absence of the external auditory opening, or malpositioned ears often in combination with internal ear abnormalities. Hearing loss also has viral causes (rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), and multiple genetic causes including Usher syndrome, Alport syndrome, and CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanaealso known as choanal atresia, growth retardation, and ear abnormalities) syndrome. Bilirubin toxicity in newborns is associated with high-frequency hearing loss.

\section*{Inner ear}

The inner and middle ear are located in the temporal bone of the skull. Although the external ear formation coincides with the gestational formation of the internal ear structures, they develop separately. The auditory placode and the acousticofacial ganglion are present the fourth week of gestation. Over the next month the first of the three turns in the cochlea develops. Arrest in development during this phase results in a common bony abnormality of the inner ear associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) known as Mondini deformity. The final 2.5 turns of the cochlea occur by the 12th week of gestation. The organ of Corti develops from the epithelium of the cochlea and is responsible for transmission of sound impulses to the eighth cranial nerve, the acoustic nerve. Improper development of the membranous labyrinth of the organ of Corti results in a Scheibe deformity, which is the most common congenital abnormality of the cochlear duct, resulting in SNHL (see later section, Hearing Loss). Alterations in development during this period due to chromosomal
abnormalities or other causes can lead to hearing loss of particular auditory tones. The semicircular canals first appear in the sixth week of gestation with differentiation of canal structures being complete by the 16th week. The sensory cells needed for equilibrium actually attain adult size by the 23rd week of gestation.

\section*{Middle ear}

Simultaneous with the early development of the inner ear is the formation of the first pharyngeal pouch, Meckel cartilage, in the oropharynx. The proximal portion of the pharyngeal pouch develops into the eustachian tube, and the distal portion becomes the tympanic cavity and supporting structures. The eustachian tube is 17 to 18 mm long at birth and lies 10 degrees off the horizontal plane. The development of the tympanic cavity with the three ossicles, the malleus, incus, and stapes, is not complete until the eighth month of gestation, but the malleus and incus reach adult size and shape by the 18th week of gestation and the stapes by the 20th week of gestation. ${ }^{1}$ Meckel cartilage forms the incus and malleus of the middle ear, and the second pharyngeal pouch, the Reichert cartilage, forms the stapes. Failure of these structures or their supporting ligaments to form properly results in a conductive hearing loss ${ }^{2}$ (see later section, Hearing Loss). Any malformation or dysfunction of the middle ear structures can result in conductive hearing loss.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{External ear (pinna)}

The external ear, the pinna, is divided into sections: the outer portion is called the helix, just medial and parallel to the helix is the antihelix, and the concha is the cavity leading to the external auditory meatus or opening of the external canal (Fig. 13.5). A firm protuberance on the anterior portion of the ear just at the entrance to the auditory canal is the tragus, and across from the tragus on the border of the antihelix is the antitragus. Beneath the tragus is the soft fold of skin that forms the ear lobe. Although the shape of the auricle varies slightly from person to person, the ears should be comparable bilaterally in size, shape, position, and appearance.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-361.jpg?height=752&width=1320&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=365}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 13.5 Anatomy of the external ear of small child labeled with anatomy.}
\end{figure}

The external auditory canal, an S-shaped canal measuring approximately 2.5 cm in length by middle school-age, connects the outer ear to the middle ear and funnels sound waves to the tympanic membrane. The auricular muscles are innervated by the seventh cranial nerve, or facial nerve. The medial portion of the canal is innervated by the fifth cranial nerve, or trigeminal nerve, and the posterior canal is innervated by the 10th cranial nerve, or vagus nerve. The distal third of the ear canal contains hair follicles, ceruminous glands, and sebaceous glands. The cilia (specialized hair) are extremely sensitive to tactile stimulation and assist in sensing sound. The ceruminous gland, a modified apocrine sweat gland, secretes a milky substance that forms cerumen when exposed to the secretions of the sebaceous glands and air. Cerumen lubricates the skin of the canal, acts as a barrier to foreign objects entering the interior canal, and has protective antibacterial properties to reduce the incidence of skin infection in the external canal. Natural lateral movement of skin and hair cells in the external canal facilitates drainage of cerumen and other debris from the external ear canal.

\section*{Middle ear}

The tympanic membrane is a thin, oval-shaped layer of skin attached to the wall of the external canal and is approximately 9 to

10 mm in diameter (Fig. 13.6). It is concave being pulled in by its attachment to the malleus and sits at an oblique angle in the external canal. It is surrounded by a fibrous band called the annulus, which becomes sclerotic later in life, diminishing movement of the tympanic membrane and often resulting in conductive hearing loss. The tympanic membrane is attached to the malleus along the manubrium conducting sound waves to the incus, stapes, and oval window of the inner ear. The tympanic membrane has a resonance frequency of 800 to 1600 Hz , approximating the normal speech frequency of 500 to 2000 Hz found in humans. The tympanic membrane is divided into sections: (1) the pars flaccida is superior to the lateral process of the malleus, (2) the pars tensa comprises the majority of the tympanic membrane inferior to the lateral process of the malleus, and (3) Prussak space, which lies medial to the pars flaccida in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane (see Fig. 13.6). Prussak space is the most common location of retraction pockets and congenital or acquired cholesteatoma (Fig. 13.7), an initially asymptomatic white mass in the middle ear that is thought to arise from repeated infections or pulling inward of the eardrum due to eustachian tube dysfunction. Over time, this mass can increase in size and destroy the delicate bones of the middle ear leading to conductive hearing loss. ${ }^{1}$ Tympanosclerosis, thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, is commonly seen after chronic infections of the middle ear or traumatic injury or surgery to the tympanic membrane (Fig. 13.8).

The three ossicles of the inner ear, the smallest bones in the body, transmit the movement of the tympanic membrane to the oval window and subsequently to the vestibular and cochlear branches of the eighth cranial nerve, the acoustic nerve (Fig. 13.9). The head of the malleus articulates with the body of the incus at the incudomalleolar joint. The long crus or leglike structure of the incus, articulates with the head of the stapes at the incudostapedial joint. These joint areas are the most vascular regions of the ossicles and, therefore, are the most susceptible to trauma or infection. The footplate of the stapes sits upon the oval window of the inner ear at the fibrous stapediovestibular joint. Because of the mechanical function of the three ossicles and the transmission of sound waves from the larger surface area of the tympanic membrane to the smaller surface area of the oval window, there is a net increase of 22 times the sound energy radiating from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.

The eustachian tube opens into the oropharynx just behind the nasal cavity and is the drainage and ventilatory structure for the middle ear. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the back of the throat. The middle ear is an air-filled space and when
patent has the same air pressure as the outside air pressure. Swallowing, yawning, and sneezing all open the eustachian tube and restore and equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the outside air pressure. Changes in altitude or ambient pressure, such as occurs on an airplane, can result in decreased air pressure in the middle ear, resulting in pain or discomfort if the eustachian is swollen or blocked. Repeated swallowing can often open the eustachian tube, equalizing pressure and reducing the associated pain. The infant who sucks on the bottle or breast can also reduce this discomfort in flight. In the adult, the eustachian tube averages 35 mm in length. In infancy, it is half that length (approximately 18 $\mathrm{mm})$ and lies in a more horizontal plane than in the adult, which allows bacteria and viruses to more easily migrate from the oropharynx to the middle ear (Fig. 13.10). The musculature of the eustachian tube, which controls function, is innervated by the motor division of the fifth cranial nerve, or trigeminal nerve. In infants and children with cleft palate and other central craniofacial abnormalities such as Down syndrome, structural or functional abnormalities of the eustachian tube interfere with normal ventilation and clearance of the middle ear, increasing the incidence of otitis media (OM) in these children. Equalization of pressure in the middle ear is critical for normal sound wave vibration of the tympanic membrane.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 13.10 Position of eustachian tube in infant and in adult.}
\end{figure}

Muscle maturation, elongation of the eustachian tube, and a more vertical position all contribute to the decreased incidence of OM and middle ear effusions in middle childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.

\section*{Inner ear}

The inner ear is the sensory end organ and is directly responsible for hearing and balance. The inner ear contains the vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea and is bathed in fluid that facilitates the transmission of sound waves to the auditory nerve and sensations of balance in the semicircular canals (see Fig. 13.1). The sound waves pass over approximately 30,000 innervated hair cells in the cochlea, which are the primary receptors, transducers, and conveyers of sound energy to the brain.

\section*{Physiologic variations}

In recent years, the understanding of genetics and the auditory system has increased significantly. Autosomal recessive genetic SNHL accounts for approximately $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of all genetic forms of hearing loss in children, and autosomal dominant genetic SNHL accounts for $10 \%$ to $15 \% .^{1}$ There are more than 400 known causes of genetic hearing loss. The most common form of recessive hearing loss is due to one gene, connexin 26 (abbreviated CX26). Approximately one-third of children with hearing loss have syndromic hearing loss with other clinical findings, such as Usher syndrome, Pendred syndrome, or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Infants with malformed external ear structures require close monitoring. Infants identified with nonsyndromic hearing loss (hearing loss without additional clinical findings) may be missed and are harder to diagnose. Many genetically determined causes of hearing loss do not present at birth and may not be identified through newborn screening. Radiographic imaging such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify up to $40 \%$ of middle and inner ear abnormalities, but imaging is used infrequently because of the concern of longterm risks of radiation exposure for infants and young children. Genetic testing is now often the first investigative tool to identify the cause of hearing loss. ${ }^{2}$

Acquired causes of hearing loss are numerous, and risk factors must be identified (Box 13.1). Prenatal risk factors include gestational diabetes in the mother, congenital infections (CMV, rubella, toxoplasmosis, herpes, syphilis, varicella), exposure to teratogens (alcohol, methyl mercury, thalidomide, cocaine), and ototoxic medications (aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, quinine). Prematurity, birth hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and administration of ototoxic medications are risk factors for acquired hearing loss in the perinatal period. Head trauma, infections (mumps, measles, varicella, meningitis, Lyme disease), recurrent OM, and excessive noise exposure are risk factors for hearing loss any time they occur. ${ }^{2}$

Environmental exposure to noise is a major source of hearing loss, and children and adolescents should be screened for exposure to loud sounds in their home, school, or recreational environments.

Children living in industrial areas with heavy traffic or near loud machinery are more prone to hearing loss in the decibel range associated with the environmental exposure. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

Risk factors for OM across ethnic groups include children living in low-income households, bottle feeding verses breast feeding, unimmunized or immunizations not up-to-date and exposure to secondhand smoke. ${ }^{3,4}$ There is research indicating an increased incidence of OM in Native American/Alaska Native children. ${ }^{3}$ There is a predisposition or genetic inheritance pattern for both OM and SNHL; therefore family history should be carefully evaluated when gathering a comprehensive health history, and children at risk should have more frequent screening for both OM and hearing deficits. Cerumen appears to vary in appearance and consistency by ethnic group. Dry, white, and flaky cerumen is more often found in Asians and Native Americans, and brown, wet, and oily cerumen is more predominant in whites and African Americans.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Equipment}

Equipment for examining the ear includes an otoscope with halogen light and speculum, pneumatic bulb attachment, and gloves if any apparent skin infection or ear drainage is present. MacroView otoscopes (see Fig. 13.14B) offer improved images of the ear canal and tympanic membrane, and computer-aided and cell phone software is also available for advanced viewing and education in the clinical setting.

\section*{Positioning}

Proper positioning of the infant and young child will ensure the least discomfort during the examination, prevent injury to the canal or tympanic membrane during examination, and ensure the health care provider has sufficient opportunity to visualize the canal and tympanic membrane. Letting the young child become familiar with
the otoscope by touching the light of the otoscope on the finger or hand often decreases the anxiety of the ear exam (Fig. 13.11A). The young infant is best positioned lying on the examination table with head securely held on either side by the examiner and the arms restrained by a comforting parent. Older infants who are able to sit securely and young children are best positioned in the parent's lap with the arm and head secured by the parent or examiner (see Fig. 13.11B). Distraction may work for some older infants and young children while examining the ears. The curve of the pediatric ear canal can be lessened by pulling the auricle inferiorly and posteriorly (down and back) in the infant and young child, as compared with superiorly and posteriorly (up and back) in middle childhood and adolescence. Be sure not to hold the auricle too firmly, causing pain when attempting to straighten the ear canal. Another examination technique that is very useful in the pediatric patient is for the examiner to position the hand above the ear, supporting the ear with the forefingers, and pulling the tragus forward or anteriorly with the thumb or forefinger (see Fig. 13.11C). This position effectively opens the external canal in young children to improve visualization of the tympanic membrane and causes less discomfort. The handle of the otoscope can be held horizontally or vertically with the examiners hand resting on the child's head when examining children to help stabilize the head and prevent movement of the otoscope during the examination (Fig. 13.12).

\end{figure}

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

The technique of pulling the tragus forward straightens the auditory canal for ease in examination and causes less discomfort than pulling on the pinna in young children.

If the child is complaining of ear pain in one ear, examine that ear last.

Do not attempt to examine the tympanic membrane unless the child can be securely positioned and held still for the examination.

\section*{External ear}

\section*{Inspection}

Before examining the ear, inspect the head, face, and neck for any asymmetry or indication of craniofacial abnormality, defect, or infection. The superior portion of the auricle should be equal in
height to the outer canthus of the eye and vertical with no more than a 10 -degree tilt. An ear that is set lower than an imaginary horizontal line drawn from the outer canthus of the eye or tilted greater than 10 degrees may indicate chromosomal abnormality or congenital abnormalities in other body systems or structures (see Fig. 13.3).

Inspect the auricles for size, shape, deformity, placement, discharge, and color. The size and shape of the ears should be similarly symmetrical and may have familial characteristics. In the newborn the cartilage should have instant recoil, but in the premature infant the cartilage may appear flattened and have less prominent incurvings of the helix or concha. Grossly misshapen external ears are often associated with anomalies of the middle and inner ear structures and with SNHL. The placement and angle or tilt of the external ear is discussed earlier. There should be no discharge from the external ear canal, although cerumen may be evident near the opening to the canal. Serous or purulent drainage may indicate a ruptured tympanic membrane, the presence of patent myringotomy tubes, inflammatory response to a foreign object in the ear, or a cholesteatoma. A white cheesy drainage may indicate an infection in the external auditory canal. The color of the auricle should be similar to the facial skin. Redness may indicate inflammation or trauma, and bruising is of particular concern as an indication of trauma possibly associated with head injury or nonaccidental trauma in cases of child abuse.

The common normal variations of the auricle include auricular or preauricular sinus, preauricular skin tags, and Darwin tubercle (see Fig. 13.4). Occasionally an infection can occur in the preauricular sinus, resulting in inflammation, redness, or discharge from the sinus. Ear piercings should be examined for signs of infection, excessive scar tissue, or trauma.

\section*{Palpation}

Palpate the auricle for any masses or areas of tenderness. Scar tissue may be palpable around ear piercings but is generally nontender. Sebaceous cysts may occur around the auricle or in the external canal and are often mildly inflamed and tender. If movement of the auricle results in pain, the examiner should suspect otitis externa, or
other inflammation of the auditory canal. A foul-smelling cheesy discharge is commonly found with otitis externa and often is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas. The mastoid process, posterior to the auricle, should be assessed for swelling, redness, or pain on palpation. Mastoiditis is an uncommon finding in immunized children, but a serious complication of OM in the developing world. If undiagnosed and untreated, it can lead to meningitis and hearing loss.

\section*{External canal}

\section*{Inspection}

Inspect the external auditory canal for patency, color, discharge, odor, and foreign bodies. The largest speculum that will fit comfortably into the external canal should be used to increase the field of vision. The smallest ear speculum ( 2.5 mm ) is often used for the infant and young child. During the initial newborn examination, patency or atresia of the external auditory canal must be determined. If the canal is not patent or is abnormally narrow or curved, additional abnormalities of the auditory system should be suspected and referral to otolaryngology and genetics for further evaluation should be made immediately. Children with Down syndrome have external canals that are narrower than normal, so the tympanic membrane may be difficult to visualize in early infancy. Vernix caseosa, a whitish cheesy debris, can often be seen in newborn ear canals and can obstruct visualization of the tympanic membrane. It also can be a contributing factor in failed newborn hearing screening or evoked otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing in the newborn. Because of the normally curved $S$ shape of the canal, visualization is improved with minimal discomfort if the tragus is pulled forward to visualize the auditory canal and the tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane of the newborn infant is thicker, grayer, and less translucent than in older children and lies on a more horizontal plane, making visualization more difficult.

\section*{Internal ear}

\section*{Inspection}

Inspect the tympanic membrane for contour (normally concave), intactness (no perforations, tympanostomy or myringotomy tubes), color (normally gray or silver but may be pink or red after crying), translucency (normally translucent without scarring or opacity), and presence of visible landmarks (umbo, handle of malleus, and light reflex; see Fig. 13.6). The light reflex is usually found between the 4 and 6 o'clock positions on the right tympanic membrane and 6 to 8 o'clock on the left tympanic membrane. The examiner should also look for the appearance of fluid bubbles behind the tympanic membrane or a fluid line, indicating the eustachian tube is not properly draining the middle ear (Fig. 13.13).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Color of the tympanic membrane is less important in diagnosing middle ear infections than identifying bony landmarks and the movement and quality of the tympanic membrane. A red or pink tympanic membrane may occur as a result of crying, irritation, or
fever and may not be an indication of an acute otitis media.

Mobility of the tympanic membrane, an important indication of middle ear pressure, can be assessed with a pneumatic attachment to the otoscope (Fig. 13.14) or by use of a tympanometer. If the middle ear pressure is equalized, the tympanic membrane will move or flutter in response to air pressure from the pneumatic insufflator in the external canal. This can be visualized through the otoscope as movement of the light reflex or recorded on the tympanometer as an equal rise and fall of pressure over the normal pressure setting of zero (Fig. 13.15). Decreased or limited movement indicates either increased negative pressure in the middle ear, which is associated with eustachian tube dysfunction and otitis media with effusion (OME) with the tympanic membrane being retracted and taut and the bony landmarks accentuated, or decreased movement due to fluid buildup behind the membrane causing the membrane to become inflamed, convex in shape, and taut. This causes an opacity in the tympanic membrane with loss of visible bony landmarks indicating infection as in acute otitis media (AOM) (Fig. 13.16). A ruptured tympanic membrane, patent tympanostomy tubes, or cholesteatoma can result in discharge from the middle ear into the external canal. Ear drainage should alert the examiner to these conditions, as well as otitis externa.

\section*{Ear cerumen}

Parents and caretakers should always be told cerumen is a normal,
protective ear secretion. Some infants and children naturally have more wax than other children, particularly children with an oily skin type. Children with allergic skin conditions often have additional cerumen, complicating the assessment of ear complaints associated with allergic symptoms or upper respiratory infections. Cerumen has two predominant types: Dry cerumen, which is gray and flaky, is found in $84 \%$ of Asians and Native Americans, and wet, honey-colored to dark brown cerumen is found in $97 \%$ of whites and $99 \%$ of African Americans. ${ }^{1}$

Parents should be encouraged to clean the child's ears only with warm soapy water and should not use cotton-tipped applicators, which can cause injury to the ear canal or tympanic membrane or result in further impaction of cerumen. School-age children and adolescents should also be instructed to not use cotton-tipped applicators. Removal of cerumen or debris from the ear canal may be necessary to visualize the tympanic membrane. If the child is cooperative, a plastic or metal cerumen spoon can be used for removal. Lighted devices for cerumen removal offer increased visualization for the examiner. An infant or young child must be positioned securely before attempting cerumen removal. If the child cannot cooperate for removal of cerumen when necessary, then irrigating the ear canal with warm water will usually loosen and flush out built-up cerumen. Irrigation should never be attempted if a ruptured tympanic membrane is suspected. Tympanostomy or myringotomy tubes inserted into the pars tensa area of the tympanic membrane for eustachian tube dysfunction are also a contraindication for irrigation of the external auditory canal (Fig. 13.17). If the child is asymptomatic, cerumen buildup can be reduced and the canals cleared by daily use of commercially prepared eardrops for dissolving earwax.

\section*{RED FLAG IN EAR ASSESSMENT}

Irrigation of the external ear canal should not be attempted if there is a possibility of a ruptured tympanic membrane or patent myringotomy tubes.

\section*{Hearing assessment}

Hearing impairment in infants and children is a common disability with implications in cognitive, psychosocial, and academic development. ${ }^{2}$ Approximately $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ of neonates have hearing loss identified in the newborn period by universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS). ${ }^{5,}{ }^{6}$ The goal of UNHS is to have all neonates screened for hearing loss before hospital discharge or by 1 month of age to ensure appropriate follow-up is obtained. Newborns who fail the newborn hearing screening and subsequent rescreening should be referred for audiologic and medical evaluations to confirm hearing loss by 3 months of age. All infants with hearing loss should begin receiving early intervention services before 6 months of age. Children who receive intervention for hearing loss by 6 months of age usually have normal language development by 5 years of age. ${ }^{6}$ Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs are working to ensure all newborns are screened for hearing loss, receive follow-up diagnostic testing if they fail the screening, and are enrolled in early interventions services if diagnosed with permanent hearing loss. ${ }^{5}$ Rates of newborn screening are now greater than $96 \%$, and enrollment in early intervention programs for infants diagnosed with hearing loss has risen from $55 \%$ to $62 \%$ in recent years. ${ }^{7}$ The pediatric health care provider must continue to
track infants who fail the newborn screening to ensure these infants are retested and diagnosed and hearing augmentation is initiated in a timely manner. ${ }^{7}$ The health care provider should not assume if the newborn hearing screening is normal that the growing infant or child's hearing is normal and no further hearing screening is necessary. Ten percent of childhood hearing loss is acquired after birth. It is important to routinely screen for hearing deficits and inquire about any changes noted in the home or school setting when gathering the health history.

The American Academy of Audiology recommends all children and adolescents be screened annually via conventional pure tone audiometry starting at age 3 years. ${ }^{6}$ Any child under 3 years of age with speech and language delays, or who has a history indicating high risk for hearing loss or whose parents have concern regarding the child's hearing should be referred to an audiologist or otolaryngologist for testing (see Box 13.1). If significant concerns about hearing are present at any age, generated either from the health history or initial screening, then referral is indicated. Most primary care practices have access to conventional pure tone audiometry, but a variety of other screening tests are available for infants and young children (Table 13.3).

\section*{BOX 13.1}

\section*{Risk Factors for Hearing Loss in Infants and Children}
- Congenital syndromes (Alport, Jervell, Lange-Nielsen, Usher, Down, Treacher Collins)
- Congenital infections: cytomegalovirus, rubella, toxoplasmosis, herpes, syphilis, and varicella
- Premature birth
- Very low birth weight (VLBW)
- Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn
- History of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy
- History of meningitis
- Exposure to ototoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, platinumcontaining chemotherapy) and cranial radiation
- Cholesteatoma
- Chronic or recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME)
- Osteogenesis imperfecta

Behavioral audiometry determines the weakest intensity at which a child shows behavioral awareness of the presence of sound. Normal sound fields include 250 Hz to 6000 Hz , but hearing screening is often performed at 25 decibels between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz. Physiologic measures of hearing determine the infant's
physiologic response to stimulation of the auditory system (Table 13.4). Speech audiometry determines the child's response to speech stimuli and tests the clarity of sound received and perceived (Table 13.5).

\begin{table}

\caption{TABLE 13.4
Physiologic Measures of Hearing}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Screening Test & Response \\
\hline Auditory brainstem response (ABR) & Measures electrical activity via scalp electrodes in the entire hearing pathway.

\section*{Interprofessional collaboration}

Prompt referral of infants and children identified with hearing loss, consultation and collaboration with pediatric otolaryngology and
audiology specialists, and close follow-up in primary care will assure optimum development of hearing in affected children.

\section*{Weber and rinne hearing screening tests}

In older children and adolescents, the Weber and Rinne tests can be performed as additional screening tests to determine deficits in either conductive hearing or sensorineural hearing. These hearing screening tests are no longer performed in the primary care setting but may have application in the pediatric specialty setting or in health care settings in low-resource countries.

The Weber test is performed by placing a vibrating tuning fork ( 512 Hz ) midline on the skull, making sure the examiner's hand does not touch the prongs of the tuning fork or the child's head. The school-age child or adolescent is then asked if he or she hears the sound of the tuning fork better on one side or the other, or equally well on both sides. If the child/adolescent indicates the sound is heard better on one side, this is called lateralization and indicates a conductive hearing deficit in the ear perceived as hearing the tuning fork better.

The Rinne test compares air conduction to bone conduction (Fig. 13.18). A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the child's mastoid bone to determine hearing via bone conduction. When the sound is no longer heard, the tuning fork should be moved to a position 1 cm to 2 cm from the external auditory canal. Sound is then being processed via air conduction in that area. Air conduction should be twice as long as bone conduction. If the bone conduction of sound is heard longer than air conduction, then a conductive hearing loss is present in the affected ear. If the ratio of air conduction to bone conduction is less than $2: 1$, then a SNHL is present. The Weber and Rinne tests are not reliable on children until school age.

\section*{Ear conditions}

\section*{Hearing loss}

Before the advent of UNHS, the average age of identification of congenital hearing loss was 2.5 to 3 years. Some infants with mild hearing loss will be missed in UNHS, and a proportion of children who pass the UNHS will develop acquired hearing loss. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing has established guidelines to improve identification of children at risk for late-onset hearing impairment (see Box 13.1). ${ }^{2}$ Ongoing regularly scheduled surveillance of developmental milestones, auditory skills, speech and language development, parental concerns regarding hearing, and objective hearing testing are needed to identify children with progressive or acquired hearing loss. ${ }^{2,7}$

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Genetic testing is now often the first investigative tool to identify the cause of hearing loss. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Conductive hearing loss}

Conductive hearing loss is caused by an abnormality in the transmission of sound waves through the ear canal, the tympanic membrane, middle ear space, or middle ear ossicles. The auditory nerve system is intact, but the sound impulses do not reach the nerve. Transient conductive hearing loss is common during episodes of OME or AOM. Recurrent or chronic bilateral ear effusions during the early years of rapid language, speech, and communication development may impede development. Cholesteatoma, with its associated destruction of the middle ear, is another common cause of conductive hearing loss, but this hearing loss will be permanent and progressive unless the cholesteatoma is surgically removed and
middle ear reconstructed. Chronic or recurrent ear infections can cause tympanosclerosis, visualized as white scarring and thickening of the tympanic membrane (see Fig. 13.8), but scarring alone rarely results in measurable hearing loss. Acquired ossicular fixation from chronic diseases of the ear is almost never seen in children, although it is a relatively common cause of acquired hearing loss in older adults. Children with osteogenesis imperfecta do develop otosclerosis and must be followed by an ear specialist.

\section*{Congenital conductive hearing loss}

Congenital conductive hearing loss can occur with Down syndrome or any gestational abnormality of the craniofacial structures. Isolated malformations of the external ear or microtia, or malformations of the ear canal, can result in conductive hearing loss. Congenital stenosis, congenital atresia of the stapes known as Treacher Collins syndrome, or congenital fixation of the stapes in the middle ear also result in a conductive hearing loss.

\section*{Sensorineural hearing loss}

SNHL is caused by abnormalities of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or the auditory pathways that traverse the brainstem ending in the auditory cortex of the brain. SNHL is often congenital and genetically acquired. Genetic predisposition is thought to play a role in 50\% of those affected by SNHL. Genetic syndromes that are associated with SNHL are Alport, Jervell and Lange-Nielsen, and Usher syndromes.

Newborns with possible perinatally acquired infections from a variety of pathogens should be screened for SNHL based on their clinical presentation. Any newborn with a history of TORCHS (toxoplasmosis and other diseases: rubella, CMV infections, herpes simplex, syphilis) should also be tested and monitored for SNHL. Infants and children with symptomatic congenital CMV infection are at greater risk for hearing impairment than those with asymptomatic infection. Approximately $22 \%$ to $65 \%$ of children with symptomatic infection have subsequent SNHL compared with only $6 \%$ to $23 \%$ of the children with asymptomatic infection. ${ }^{8}$ CMV infection at any age may result in hearing loss.

Premature infants and very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are
at increased risk for hearing loss and have a higher incidence of hearing loss than full-term infants. Neonates with a history of persistent pulmonary hypertension or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy have a $21 \%$ incidence of SNHL. ${ }^{9}$ Children of any age who develop meningitis must be carefully tested for hearing loss because of both the consequences of the infections and the ototoxic side effects of many antibiotics used to treat meningitis. Children treated for malignancies with platinum compounds (cisplatin or carboplatin) or who are receiving cranial radiation may develop delayed SNHL and must be followed carefully with audiometry testing.

\section*{Mixed hearing loss}

Hearing loss may also be a combination of conductive hearing deficits and sensorineural hearing deficits. Children with congenital syndromes often have mixed hearing loss.

The management of hearing deficits in children has advanced with new surgical techniques and bone-anchored, bone-conduction hearing aids (Fig. 13.19). Cochlear implantation and advances in hearing aids have improved the treatment of hearing loss dramatically, providing some sound to most children with even severe hearing loss.

\section*{Acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion}

AOM is an inflammation within the middle ear that is often acute but can be recurrent or chronic, lasting more than 3 months. AOM is one of the most common conditions seen in pediatric practice in young children between 6 months and 3 years of age. ${ }^{10}$ Children exposed to daycare or crowded living situations are prone to upper respiratory infections that may result in inflammation in the middle ear. Exposure to secondhand smoke has also been shown to increase the risk for AOM, whereas breastfeeding has been shown to be protective. ${ }^{3}$ There is a genetic component to OM, with a higher incidence of OM in children who have older siblings or parents with a significant history of OM.

Abnormal clearance of middle ear fluid is the cornerstone of AOM and OME. Viruses and bacteria from the nasal pharynx enter the middle ear via the eustachian tube opening in the oropharynx. Young children are more prone to AOM because of their short, horizontal, less mature eustachian tubes, and more frequent upper respiratory tract infections. Children with nasal allergy are also more prone to AOM because inflammation of the respiratory tract
associated with allergies often causes swelling and obstruction of the eustachian tube, trapping fluid. Viruses or bacteria in the middle ear from respiratory infection cause further inflammation and often obstruction. Children with craniofacial defects or immunodeficiencies are at greatest risk for ear infections, and children with placement of nasogastric tubes also have a higher susceptibility.

The majority of OM infections are presumed to be of viral etiology. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial pathogens found in AOM. Expanded immunization schedules covering an increased number of phenotypes of H. influenzae and pneumococcal strains have resulted in decreased incidence of OM caused by these organisms.

The presenting symptoms of AOM include rapid onset of ear pain or otalgia, fever, irritability, disrupted sleep pattern and occasionally otorrhea, or drainage from the ear. Severe conjunctivitis may also be present. Physical assessment should include careful otoscopy and pneumatic otoscopy to determine inflammation in the middle ear. AOM results in moderate to marked bulging of the tympanic membrane, a purulent effusion in the middle ear, and hemorrhagic redness, making bony landmarks difficult to see (see Fig. 13.16B). ${ }^{10}$ The light reflex becomes diffuse and abnormally positioned on the tympanic membrane or absent. With pneumatic otoscopy the normal fluttering of the membrane is not present because of the increased fluid pressure in the middle ear. The tympanic membrane is usually erythematous, often with increased vascularity; however, these findings can also be present in a child who has been crying, and color should not be used as the primary finding to diagnose AOM in young children.

OME is a more common finding than AOM and is defined as middle ear effusion without signs or symptoms of AOM. OME presents with opacity of the tympanic membrane caused by a clear or serous transparent effusion in the middle ear or a cloudy nontransparent effusion. ${ }^{10}$ OME causes decreased movement of the tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy or tympanogram, a retracted or concave membrane, and visible air bubbles or a fluid line indicating eustachian tube dysfunction. OME may occur after

AOM as the acute infection resolves but before air pressure equilibrates, or it may result from eustachian tube dysfunction without acute infection. Chronic OME, or persistent effusion, interferes with sound wave transmission into the middle ear and is a common cause of conductive hearing loss.

Diagnosing AOM or OME with certainty in infants and young children can be a challenge. Positioning and restraining an irritable child, presence of cerumen in a narrow curved ear canal, and difficulty obtaining a proper seal of the ear canal for pneumatic otoscopy or tympanostomy all make certainty of diagnosis difficult. Bilateral AOM occurs more frequently in the child who is younger than 24 months than in children with unilateral AOM. Occurrence of bilateral AOM should not be a determining criterion for treatment. ${ }^{10}$ Treatment guidelines and algorithms for AOM and OME are well established and take into consideration the child's age, duration of symptoms, and risk factors. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Vestibular disorders affecting children}

There is a growing recognition of vestibular system dysfunction in children resulting in gaze instability, dizziness, and balance problems. A recent study in children from 3 to 17 years found an overall prevalence of dizziness and balance problems of $5.3 \%$ that increased with age from $4.1 \%$ for children aged 3 to 5 years to $7.5 \%$ for children aged 15 to 17 years of age. ${ }^{11}$ Dizziness, vertigo, disequilibrium, and unsteadiness can cause life-altering disability and health care burden. Increased risk factors associated with dizziness and balance problems include children with history of LBW or VLBW, intellectual disability, developmental delay, frequent headaches or migraines, recurrent AOM or hearing loss, or history of seizures. It is important for pediatric health care providers to screen children for vestibular problems and refer children to a pediatric neurologist, otolaryngologist, or early developmental intervention program. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Before examining the ear, inspect the head, face, and neck for any asymmetry. The superior portion of the auricle should be
equal in height to the outer canthus of the eye.
- Inspect the auricles for size, shape, symmetry, deformity, placement, discharge, and color.
- Inspect the tympanic membrane for contour, intactness, color, translucency, and presence of visible landmarks (umbo, handle of malleus, and light reflex).
- The light reflex is usually found between the 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock position on the right tympanic membrane and 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock on the left tympanic membrane.
- Mobility of the tympanic membrane, an important indication of middle ear pressure, can be assessed with a pneumatic attachment to the otoscope or by use of a tympanometer.
- Ear drainage in the external canal should alert the examiner to otitis externa, a ruptured tympanic membrane, patent tympanostomy tubes, or cholesteatoma.
- Ten percent of childhood hearing loss is acquired after birth. Routinely screen for hearing deficits and begin puretone audiometry at 3 years of age.
- Adhere to current guidelines for treatment of AOM and OME in infants and children.
- Vestibular disorders should be considered in children with gaze instability, dizziness, and balance problems.

Nose, mouth, and throat
}

A thorough assessment of the nose, mouth, and throat is an essential part of the pediatric physical examination. Infants and children have frequent upper respiratory and viral infections, and viewing the oropharynx is particularly important when looking for a focus of infection in a febrile child. Also, the oral health of children is key to overall health, and the pediatric health care provider is an important link in providing oral health assessments and preventing dental caries.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The facial structures develop in the embryo during the first few weeks of gestation. The tongue, lips, gums, and tooth enamel all evolve from the ectoderm of the primitive mouth, the stomodeum, early in the fourth week. The lips are formed during the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation. The primary teeth and salivary glands are formed between the sixth and eighth weeks of fetal life. By the sixth fetal month, the ducts are hollow and begin producing saliva. Calcification of the primary teeth begins in the fourth month of fetal life and is complete by 1 year of age. Any insult during pregnancy to the sensitive process of tooth formation can result in an anomaly in the color, size, or shape of the primary or permanent dentition.

Early development of the nose begins during the fifth week of gestation, with development of muscle, bone, and cartilage complete by the 12th week of gestation. The palate evolves from fusion of the maxillary prominences during the seventh and eighth weeks of gestation and is completely formed by the 12th week of gestation during the fusion of the primary and secondary palates. Failure in fusion results in cleft palate. Cleft palate is a relatively common congenital anomaly and occurs in 1 in 690 births (Fig. 14.1B). ${ }^{1}$ The incidence varies with race, with Native Americans having a rate of 20.5 in 10,000 births, and blacks having the lowest rate of 10.2 in 10,000 births. ${ }^{1}$ Cleft lip can be an isolated defect or associated with cleft palate or a component of a congenital syndrome (Fig. 14.1A). ${ }^{2}$ The etiology is multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental risk factors in both syndromic and nonsyndromic clefts. Several risk factors associated with cleft type have been identified and include maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, maternal nutrition and folic acid intake, and maternal medications. ${ }^{1}$ A subcutaneous cleft also can occur during this period with incomplete fusion of the palate; it often goes undetected in the newborn and is associated with persistent abnormal speech patterns.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{External nose}

The nose of the newborn and young infant is generally flattened and malleable (Fig. 14.2). In the neonate, the septum is composed of cartilage; ossification occurs during childhood. The nose becomes pyramid-like by adolescence and develops a bony structure. It is divided into four sections: the proximal bony portion, often referred to as the nasal bridge; the mid cartilaginous vault; the tip, columella, and nares; and the interior vestibule (Fig. 14.3).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 14.3 Anatomy of the nose.}
\end{figure}

Nasal breathing is the normal breathing pattern, and infants and young children are prone to increased airway resistance, because they have anatomically small airway passages. Nasal congestion in the neonate is a common normal finding, and newborn nurseries often discharge infants with a nasal bulb syringe to enable the gentle removal of secretions from the small narrow nasal passages to clear the airway to enhance breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. In the past, it was thought that newborns are obligatory nasal breathers for the first few months of life. However, research has demonstrated newborns have the ability to switch from nasal to mouth breathing as needed, so they are "preferential" nasal breathers. ${ }^{2}$ Respiratory compromise or distress occurs rapidly in young infants when the nasal passages become occluded. The most common reason for occlusion is mucosal congestion or increased secretions, but congenital anatomical deformities, obstructive masses, or traumatic obstruction can occlude the nasal passages. Nasal resistance is an important factor in total airway resistance, and nasal occlusion may contribute to half of total airway resistance.

\section*{Internal nose}

The internal nose, the vestibule, is divided by the bony and cartilaginous nasal septum. The septum is rarely perfectly straight, and a significant deviation of the septum at birth or resulting from the birth process or trauma must be assessed to determine whether it interferes with nasal breathing. The perpendicular plate of the nasal septum ossifies by 3 years of age. The anterior portion of the vestibule is lined with vascular squamous epithelium that has tiny hair follicles and secretes mucus. The vast majority of nose bleeds, or epistaxis, result from a network of small blood vessels found in the anterior superficial portion of the septal mucosa known as the Kiesselbach plexus. The posterior portion is lined with fragile respiratory epithelium. The lateral walls of the nose are composed of horizontal bony structures known as the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates, which mature throughout childhood and resemble those of the adult by 12 years of age (see Fig. 14.3). They are covered with vascular mucous membranes. Furrows between the bony structures provide recesses to filter air and form a nasal passage, or meatus. The posterior ethmoid sinuses drain into the superior meatus, and the paranasal sinuses drain into the middle meatus. Until approximately 6 years of age, the inferior meatus is nonfunctioning except that it drains the nasolacrimal duct. This is why the nose has increased drainage in children, particularly during periods of crying or eye irritation. The space between the posterior portion of the turbinates and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx is called the choana and is of little significance in children unless blocked or narrowed by a congenital abnormality such as choanal atresia, a bony or membranous blockage of one or both naris posterior to the nasal turbinates, resulting in blockage of the airway and respiratory distress in the newborn. It occurs in 1 in 5000 to 7000 births and occurs more often in females 2:1 and unilaterally $2: 1$. In newborns, choanal atresia can be associated with the CHARGE* syndrome. ${ }^{3}$

Cranial nerve I (olfactory) innervates the nasal area. The olfactory receptor cells line the upper reaches of the nasal cavity in the olfactory epithelium and innervate the olfactory nerve. Olfactory learning begins in utero and is well developed in the newborn. It assists newborns in recognizing the distinct smell of their mother's breast milk. Nasal congestion or mucus plugging limits airflow up
to the receptors and can block the sensation of smell.

\section*{Nasopharynx}

The nasopharynx forms the superior portion of the pharynx. The eustachian tube opening is located along the lateral walls of the nasopharynx (see Fig. 14.3). Adenoidal tissue is found along the superior posterior wall of the oropharynx and is referred to as the pharyngeal tonsils. The inferior border of the nasopharynx is formed by the soft palate. The nasopharynx is surrounded by bone, ensuring patency unless trauma occurs.

\section*{Sinuses}

The paranasal sinuses consist of paired cavities: maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth but are small. The frontal sinuses begin to develop by 7 years of age, and the sphenoid sinuses develop in adolescence. As the sinuses develop, they become air-filled cavities; and when mature, they are lined with ciliated epithelium containing goblet cells and submucosal glands that produce seromucinous secretions and immune mediators. The sinuses reach their final maturity between 12 and 14 years of age (Fig. 14.4; see Table 14.2). ${ }^{4}$

\section*{Mouth and oropharynx}

The oral cavity is composed of the lips, cheeks, hard and soft palates, teeth, posterior pharynx, tongue (Fig. 14.5), sensory cells for taste, and the mandible that supports the lower gums and teeth. The cheeks form the lateral walls that are lined with buccal mucosa. Cheeks may be particularly prominent in young children because of the buccal fat pad. The cheeks and lips are innervated by cranial nerves V (trigeminal) and VII (facial). The central nervous system controls the complex mechanisms of the mouth needed for sucking, swallowing, breathing, and vocalization. The hard palate is the anterior two thirds of the palate and separates the nasal and oral cavities. The posterior third of the palate is the soft palate, which is contiguous with the lateral pharyngeal wall. It provides a slightly mobile barrier between the nasopharynx and oropharynx and is essential for normal articulation and speech intonation.

\end{figure}

\section*{Tonsils}

The palatine tonsils form the anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars. Tonsillar size is graded on a scale of 1+ to 4+ (Table 14.3 and Fig. 14.6). Additional tonsillar tissues surround the posterior pharynx but are not visible on examination. The uvula hangs down from the middle of the soft palate in line with the anterior pillar, or palatoglossus muscle. A bifid uvula, a cleft uvula with two parts, is an anomaly that results from disruption of the palate development and may indicate a submucosal cleft palate. It may also be associated with nasal polyps and is also more common in children with cystic fibrosis.

\end{figure}

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

In the infant, the palatine tonsils are not normally visible, but by

2 years of age, they are usually seen extending medially into the oropharynx. They generally are at their peak size between 2 and 6 years of age and then begin to atrophy or decrease in size along with other lymphatic tissue.

Enlarged tonsils and adenoids can partially occlude the posterior pharynx during sleep resulting in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

\section*{Teeth}

The mandibular central incisors are the first to erupt in the majority of infants, followed by the maxillary central incisors, the upper and lower lateral incisors, first molars, cuspids or canine teeth, and then the second molars. Tooth eruption, movement of the tooth through alveolar bone and gums, normally occurs between 4 and 12 months of age for the first tooth, and occurs when about two-thirds of the root for the tooth is developed. The maxillary incisors usually erupt 1 to 2 months after the mandibular incisors. The eruption of the 20 primary teeth should be complete between 24 and 30 months of age (Fig. 14.7A, C). The timing and sequence of tooth eruption depend on genetic, nutritional, environmental, and systemic factors. Delayed eruption of the primary teeth can occur in premature infants, infants small for gestational age, infants or children with metabolic or chromosomal abnormalities, or children with severe malnutrition. A familial pattern of delayed tooth eruption can also occur across generations.

The permanent teeth begin developing in the mandible during the first 6 months of life. The period of eruption of the mixed dentition occurs between 5 and 13 years of age, beginning with the eruption of the first permanent tooth. Exfoliation, or loss of the primary dentition, often begins with the central incisors and follows the eruption pattern. There are 32 permanent teeth (see Fig. 14.7B, D). Low birth weight, infection, and trauma have been associated with delayed eruption of the permanent teeth. Delayed exfoliation of the primary dentition has also been associated with Down syndrome, hypothyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, and other congenital endocrine disorders. Dental enamel can be eroded, resulting in structurally weakened teeth in some conditions such as chronic
gastroesophageal reflux disease, bulimia, and celiac disease.

Dental caries are the most common chronic health condition in childhood. ${ }^{5}$ The infectious process of dental decay begins early in infancy when the causative bacterium Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli can be transmitted from parent or caretaker to the infant through oral contact in the first few months of life. Ingestion of a high carbohydrate diet and/or frequent dietary sugars in infants and children provides a substrate for the bacteria to flourish and alters the oral bacterial composition, enhancing the development of dental caries. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Tongue}

The tongue is a mobile muscle, with its anterior two thirds located in the oral cavity and the posterior third located in the oropharynx. The anterior dorsal surface of the tongue is composed of a thick mucous membrane lined with filiform, or threadlike, papillae, and the posterior dorsal surface is lined with lymphoid tissue that forms the lingual tonsil. The ventral surface of the tongue has a thin mucous membrane with visible vessels and is normally anchored to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenulum (Fig. 14.8).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-409.jpg?height=1006&width=938&top_left_y=976&top_left_x=553}

\caption{FIGURE 14.8 Ventral surface of the tongue and salivary glands. Source: (From Fehrenbach M, Herring S: Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, ed 4, St. Louis, 2012, Elsevier.)}
\end{figure}

Cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus) innervate the tongue for sensation and taste, and cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal) innervates the tongue for motor function. The sensation of taste is immature at birth and not fully functional until approximately 2 years of age. Term infants also have a tongue-thrust reflex for the first 4 months of life that aids in breastfeeding or bottle-feeding and to protect them from choking, but it is counterproductive when trying
to feed solids by spoon. At the base of the tongue in the oropharynx lies the epiglottis, a glistening pink spoon-shaped appendage that helps direct the passage of food into the esophagus and away from the trachea (Fig. 14.9). Normally, it is not visible on examination, but in some children, it can be seen protruding upward from the posterior oropharynx, almost opposite from the uvula when the tongue is depressed and the child says "ah," which opens the throat area for examination.

\end{figure}

\section*{Salivary glands}

The salivary glands are paired exocrine glands that secrete enzymes that aid in initial digestion. The parotid glands are the largest salivary glands and are the glands that become inflamed with mumps, or parotitis. The parotid duct, or Stensen duct, empties into the oral cavity opposite the upper second molar. The submandibular gland is the second largest gland and is located in the floor of the mouth. The submandibular ducts, or Wharton ducts, exit into the mouth on either side of the lingual frenulum. The third set of salivary glands is the sublingual glands, which release their enzymes through approximately 12 ducts located on the floor of the mouth. The sublingual glands are not visible on examination. Secretions from the salivary glands begin around 6 weeks of age in the term infant, which results in increased drooling by 3 to 4 months of age. As infants mature and become more proficient in swallowing and the lower teeth develop to create a dam, the drooling decreases even though the production of saliva increases. Hundreds of additional salivary glands line the mucous membranes of the mouth and oral pharynx by late adolescence, providing additional serous and mucous secretions.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Equipment}

Equipment needed for examination of the nose, mouth, and throat
includes an otoscope with halogen light and speculum, tongue depressor, and gloves for palpation of palate and gums if any skin lesions are present.

\section*{Positioning}

Delay the examination of the mouth and nose in the infant and young child until after the "quiet" parts of the exam and after the ear examination. If the infant or young child cries, attempt to visualize the mouth and oropharynx with a tongue depressor. Infants are best positioned on the examination table with the arms secured by the sides and head stabilized to visualize the internal nose and mouth. Examination of the older infant or young child can also occur while the child is sitting in the parent's or caregiver's lap with the head secured by the examiner's hands and with the child's arms secured by the parent (Fig. 14.10 ). The feet may need to be secured between the parent's legs if the child is uncooperative. With the young child on the examination table, the parent may also secure the arms above the head to stabilize the head and visualize the oropharynx (Fig. 14.11).

Louis, 2015, Mosby.)}
\end{figure}

An alternative position for conducting the inspection of the teeth is to place the child in the "knee-to-knee" position. In this position, the examiner and parent sit face to face with their knees touching to make a comfortable support for the young infant, and the infant or young child's head is placed in the examiners lap to look directly into the child's mouth (Fig. 14.12). This position is best used for examining the teeth and applying fluoride varnish in the older infant and young child.

\end{figure}

\section*{External nose}

While the child is comfortable, note any flaring or narrowing of the nares with breathing. If an infant is feeding, watch carefully for indications of nasal obstruction requiring mouth breathing. Note the shape of the nose, any obvious deviation of the bridge or columella, the tip of the nose. In older children, a transverse crease across the nose or nasal bridge caused by repeated upward swipes with the hand due to chronic nasal drainage is known as the allergic salute. If there is drainage from the nose, note the color, consistency, and quantity and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. Allergic conditions and upper respiratory infections cause bilateral drainage, whereas foreign objects in the nose can cause unilateral,
purulent, malodorous discharge. Epistaxis, bleeding or hemorrhage from the nose, occurs from irritation of the nasal mucosa, often due to cold, dry environmental conditions, nasal allergy, or as a result of trauma. Sinus infections also may cause unilateral drainage. Swelling or dark discoloration under the eyes, often called allergic shiners, may occur with nasal congestion, sinusitis, or nasal allergy.

Palpate any areas around the nose that appear discolored or inflamed. If there is a history of facial trauma, palpate the bridge of the nose to determine tenderness or pain. If the child has a recent history of head or facial trauma and clear watery nasal discharge, a cerebrospinal fluid leak must be considered and confirmed with imaging. Traumatic fractures of the protective facial bones increase the risk of developing meningitis. Children with obvious deviation of the nose should be referred to a craniofacial specialist for evaluation. Patency of each side of the nose can be determined by gently occluding one naris at a time. In the newborn, this technique assists in diagnosis of choanal atresia.

\section*{Internal nose}

To inspect the internal nose, use a penlight or otoscope with halogen light and nasal speculum while being careful not to touch the sensitive internal nasal septum. A large ear speculum can be inserted 2 to 3 mm into the nares in older children and adolescents for inspection of the nasal cavity but is not recommended in infants and young children, to avoid trauma. An otoscope with halogen light used without a speculum is effective for visualizing the nares in infants and young children who are positioned on the exam table or on the parent's lap (Fig. 14.13).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-417.jpg?height=730&width=929&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=562}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 14.13 View of the nasal vestibule and turbinates.}
\end{figure}

The vestibule of the nose should be assessed for any blockage by foreign body, polyps, nasal secretions, mucous plugs, or dried blood. The mucosal lining should be assessed for consistency of color, abrasions, lesions, and swelling. The color is normally deep pink, and a thin layer of clear mucus gives it a shiny appearance. The nasal septum should be examined for alignment, perforations, abrasions, bleeding, or crusting. It should be relatively straight and midline in the nose. Significant deviations of the septum may interfere with breathing. The turbinates should be assessed for color and swelling. Pale, swollen mucosa and edema of the turbinates is associated with allergic rhinitis and occlusion of air passage; and inflamed, reddened mucosa and turbinates are associated with respiratory infections. Children with chronic respiratory conditions may develop polyps that appear as shiny sacs extending into the nasal vestibule.

If a foreign body is suspected, attempt to have the child blow out the object while occluding the unaffected side. If this is not successful in dislodging the object, securely position the child on the exam table for removal of the object. A gentle probe with a curette or tweezers can be attempted to dislodge the foreign body. If unsuccessful and the object has become adhered to the mucosal wall or nasal septum, refer to a pediatric otolaryngologist for removal.

\section*{Sinuses}

The maxillary and frontal sinuses can be assessed by physical examination beginning around 7 years of age through inspection and palpation. The facial area over the maxillary and frontal sinuses should be evaluated for swelling, erythema, and tenderness. Percuss with the forefingers or apply mild pressure with the thumbs over the maxillary and frontal sinus area. Evaluate pain, tenderness, and increased sensation in the frontal, ethmoid, or maxillary area, especially if there is a history of prolonged upper respiratory infection (Fig. 14.14). It may be difficult for young school-age children to accurately determine increased pain or tenderness caused by sinus inflammation, therefore, relying on accurate health history and symptom assessment is important in this age group. The diagnosis of sinusitis in children is generally made clinically. Imaging studies are not recommended unless children are unresponsive to medical therapy, develop complications of rhinosinusitis (RS), or who are being considered for surgical intervention. ${ }^{2}$

\end{figure}

\section*{Mouth}

While inspecting the oral cavity, observe for the presence of any unusual odor or lesions. Inspect the lips for color, symmetry, lesions, swelling, dryness, and fissures. The color should be pink at rest and with feeding or crying. Note any asymmetry of movement or drooling that might indicate nerve impairment. Drooling during infancy from 3 to 15 months of age is normal, but drooling later may indicate nerve damage and loss of control of oral secretions. Young infants may have a callus or blister on the lip from vigorous sucking. This is particularly common in breastfed infants in the first few months of life (Fig. 14.15). Swelling of the lips may be caused by injury or allergic reaction. Cracked, dry lips can be caused by harsh weather conditions, repeated lip licking or biting, mouth
breathing due to nasal allergy, fever, or from illness or dehydration. Sores in the mouth or on the lips may indicate a viral infection such as Coxsackie virus or herpes simplex virus type 1. Halitosis, mouth odor or bad breath, in children may be caused by poor oral hygiene and dental caries, tonsillitis, or sinusitis. Note the frenulum of the upper lip that connects the upper lip to the gums of the maxilla at the point of the central incisors. It is prominent in the infant and disappears slowly in childhood with growth and development of the maxilla. Trauma to the upper lip and gum in the young child often includes trauma to the frenulum.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 14.15 Sucking blister.}
\end{figure}

Inspect the buccal mucosa and gingivae with a tongue blade or tongue depressor for color, moisture, symmetry, and lesions (Fig. 14.16). The mucosa normally is shiny, smooth, and moist throughout. The oral mucosa may appear pale in children with darker pigmented skin and pink in children with lighter pigmented skin. Use a tongue depressor or a gloved finger to move the tongue and lips to ensure all surfaces of the mucosa are inspected. Epstein pearls, white pearly papules at the juncture of the hard and soft palates or on the anterior surface of the buccal mucosa, are common in newborns and resolve spontaneously. With a gloved finger, palpate unusual-looking areas for swelling and tenderness. If the mucosa of the gum appears inflamed or swollen, palpate for erupting teeth or hematomas. An eruption cyst or eruption hematoma is a bluish-purple, blister-like swelling on the gum, which may precede tooth eruption, particularly with the first and second
molars. Reddened, swollen, or friable gums can be an indication of poor oral hygiene, infection, or poor nutritional intake. Anticonvulsants may also cause hyperplasia of the gums.

Candidiasis, appearing as bright white superficial lesions on the tongue and buccal mucosa of the cheeks, is often seen in the young breastfed infant or in the infant or child after use of oral antibiotics or with chronic infection (Fig. 14.17). The lesions of candidiasis can be differentiated from milk or formula residue by the bright white appearance. Candidiasis lesions do not scrape off the oral mucosa with the tongue depressor. Petechiae, pinpoint erythematous lesions, may be present on the soft palate with streptococcal infections or may be indicative of a bleeding disorder.

\end{figure}

\section*{Teeth}

Inspect and note the number, color, size, and shape of the primary and permanent teeth and the pattern of eruption (Fig. 14.18). Natal teeth are prematurely erupted primary teeth that are present at birth. Natal teeth rarely occur in Caucasian infants, but they are a common variant in Native American infants. ${ }^{7}$ The incidence of natal teeth is approximately 1 in 2000 births and is often seen in infants with cleft palate and other chromosomal deletion syndromes. ${ }^{8}$ Neonatal teeth erupt in the first month of life, and $90 \%$ of neonatal teeth are lower primary teeth, or mandibular incisors. ${ }^{7}$ Both natal and neonatal teeth are often immature caps of enamel and dentine with poorly formed roots and are unstable in the gum or attached to the
gum. Natal teeth can be a risk of aspiration in the neonatal period. If the teeth are supernumerary, very loose, or cause feeding problems, consultation with a pediatric dentist and extraction may be indicated. ${ }^{7}$ Precocious eruption of primary teeth has been associated with precocious puberty. In older children with loose teeth, precaution with surgical procedures and anesthesia is indicated.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 14.18 Inspection of primary teeth.}
\end{figure}

Inspection of the teeth in infants and young children includes identifying any presence of plaque on the teeth. Evaluate oral hygiene practices. Check the primary teeth in the infant and young child for white spot lesions, or decalcifications, and brown spot lesions, or cavitations, indicating the first sign of dental decay (Fig. 14.19). White spot lesions on the anterior tooth surfaces may be a sign of early childhood caries. They are caused by early transmission of the bacterium S. mutans from parent or caretaker to child and intake of frequent dietary sugars reducing the normal pH of oral secretions, resulting in demineralization of the tooth enamel. The mandibular incisors in infants are protected by the tongue when sucking, and they are therefore not prone to decay with prolonged
bottle-feeding or breastfeeding. Dental care should commence as soon as teeth erupt, and daily oral hygiene using a damp cloth or soft infant toothbrush to gently rub the gums and teeth of the infant can prevent plaque development. In older infants and young children, teeth should be brushed at least twice daily with fluoridated toothpaste under parental supervision.

The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends establishing a dental home with a comprehensive dental assessment by 12 months of age. ${ }^{9}$ Fluoridated drinking water and application of topical fluoride varnish by pediatric health care providers helps to reduce the incidence of early childhood caries. ${ }^{9}$ Caries risk assessment in all children is an important component of the
assessment of the oral cavity. Box 14.1 assists health care providers in assessing children from 6 months to 3 years of age who are high risk for development of dental decay. ${ }^{9}$ Access to a pediatric dental home and application of dental sealants also improves oral health outcomes and reduces the incidence of dental caries.

\section*{BOX 14.1}

\section*{High Risk for Dental Caries 6 Months to 5 Years of Age}
- Mother/primary care giver has active cavities
- Child has $>3$ between meal sugary snacks or sugary beverages
- Child is put to bed with bottle containing natural or added sugar
- Child with special health care needs
- Child from low-income or immigrant family

Adapted from American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry: Guidelines on caries-risk assessment and management for infants, children, and adolescents. Pediatr Dent 2015/2016;35(5):E157-E164.

Maxillary permanent incisors may erupt widely spaced and protruding outward, and mandibular incisors may erupt behind the primary incisors but align with normal development of the oral cavity unless there is a familial pattern of malocclusion or dental deformities. A slight overlap of the maxillary incisors to the mandibular incisors occurs with normal permanent dentition. Children with significantly misaligned teeth should be referred to a pediatric orthodontist for evaluation and treatment. Bruxism, or tooth grinding, which induces moderate wear on the surface of the canines and molars, may be noted on inspection. The peak incidence is during the developmental period of mixed dentition, and it rarely damages the dentition in young children but may be significant in older children or children with special health care needs. Dental hygiene in children with special health care needs is
often a challenge because of oral aversion, oral side effects of medications or special diets, and the child's ability/inability to participate in daily oral hygiene.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Application of fluoride varnish by the pediatric health care provider to the primary teeth beginning in the first year of life is recommended to prevent dental caries. Two or more applications of fluoride varnish per year is effective in preventing caries in infants and children at high-risk for dental disease. ${ }^{9}$

\section*{Tongue}

Inspect the tongue, noting color, size, and movement. The dorsal surface should appear slightly rough but moist and pink to pale pink. There may be variation in the papillae, giving the dorsal surface a patterned appearance. Geographic tongue, a benign inflammation of the dorsal surface of the tongue, causes pink areas with absent papillae and a surrounding whitish border (Fig. 14.20).

The ventral surface appears thin with prominent vessels without hematomas. Connecting the ventral surface of the tongue to the floor of the mouth is the lingual frenulum. The lingual frenulum should allow movement of the tongue past the lips and to the roof of the palate. Movement of the tongue can be assessed through observation while an infant cries or a child vocalizes. Infants who are able to breastfeed or bottle-feed without difficulty have adequate movement of the tongue, and no further assessment of cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal) is needed. Newborns with significant feeding problems should be referred to an otolaryngologist and an occupational therapist trained and experienced in neonatal feeding problems. A significantly shortened lingual frenulum, ankyloglossia, is caused by an anterior attachment of the frenulum to the tip of the tongue (Fig. 14.21). It may in some cases interfere with adequate latch and sucking in the newborn and impair the infant's ability to breastfeed. Surgical intervention may be indicated in some infants and children. A frenulotomy or frenulectomy is the surgical procedure in which the lingual frenulum is cut. This surgical procedure remains controversial, particularly in relation to later speech development.

\end{figure}

Macroglossia, enlarged tongue, can be congenital or acquired and is associated with hypothyroidism, Down syndrome, and other congenital anomalies. Pierre Robin syndrome is associated with a malpositioned tongue, feeding and breathing difficulty, and a high arched or cleft palate. A small jaw, or mandible, can be associated with congenital craniofacial anomalies, genetic conditions, or small for gestational age infant and may be associated with feeding problems, choking, or gagging.

In the older child and adolescent, ask the child to stick the tongue out past the lips and move the tongue from side to side to test cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal). These maneuvers should be easy to perform without fasciculation of the tongue. The ability to curl the tongue is a hereditary trait in some children. Any lesions, areas of tenderness, or swelling should be palpated to determine the size and depth.

\section*{Palate}

Inspect the hard palate for patency or lesions. It should appear dome shaped but not deeply indented, lighter in appearance than the skin on the buccal mucosa and soft palate, and have transverse firm ridges. In a newborn infant with jaundice, the hard palate appears yellowish. In darker pigmented infants and children, it is helpful to inspect the hard palate and sclera to assess for jaundice. The hard palate is contiguous with the soft palate and extends to the anterior pillars and the uvula. The soft palate should appear intact and rise symmetrically along with the uvula when the child vocalizes or says "ah." This movement tests for cranial nerve X (vagus). Movement of the soft palate is necessary for the development of normal speech and articulation.

The hard and soft palates should always be palpated in the newborn to determine whether there is any submucosal cleft not visible on inspection or congenital anomalies associated with cleft palate. A gloved finger can be placed on the infant's palate to determine whether the palate is intact. As the infant sucks, evaluate the strength of the suck reflex and the palate surface. After the newborn period, palpation of the palate is not usually performed
unless lesions, swelling, or erythema is noted.

\section*{Tonsils}

Inspect the palatine tonsils for size, color, exudates, pitting or enlarged crypts, or membranous covering. The tonsils are normally the color of the buccal mucosa or slightly lighter, should appear equal in size and position, and should be rated on a scale of $1+$ to $4+$ during well visits and during periods of illness to evaluate change (see Table 14.3). Tonsils that are larger than normal may indicate chronic respiratory allergies and if reddened indicate infection. White or yellowish exudate in the crypts of the tonsils is often associated with bacterial tonsillitis or infectious mononucleosis and requires further diagnosis and treatment if indicated. Unequal size tonsils and color may indicate a peritonsillar abscess, requiring further diagnostics, antibacterial therapy, and possible hospitalization. Pitting or enlarged crypts of the tonsils is often seen in children with a history of recurrent throat infections or chronic respiratory allergies (Fig. 14.22).

\section*{Tonsillar Size}

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{ Size } \\
\hline $1+$ & Tonscription \\

\end{tabular}

Some children and adolescents have chronically enlarged tonsils and adenoids that partially block air passage in and out of the oropharynx, requiring them to breathe with their mouth open to enlarge the air passageway. Dry, cracked lips are a hallmark sign of chronically enlarged tonsils in children. During sleep, relaxation of the pharyngeal musculature exacerbates the occlusion of the air passages, resulting in obstruction of airflow and sleep-disordered breathing and may result in periodic sleep apnea. Sleep-related breathing disorders, referring to the duration and quality of sleep, have been associated with nasal allergy, tonsillar hypertrophy related to allergies or recurrent viral or bacterial infections, and childhood obesity. They may impact school performance because of fatigue and inattention and have been associated with hyperactivity and behavioral problems. ${ }^{10}$ The pediatric health care provider should obtain a health history regarding the child's sleep, sleep pattern, and the occurrence of snoring. Referral of the child to pediatric pulmonology to determine the need for a sleep study and follow up with a pediatric otolaryngology specialist to evaluate the oropharynx is often warranted. Adenotonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in children. The two leading indications for adenotonsillectomy are sleepdisordered breathing and recurrent throat infections. ${ }^{10}$ Obstruction of the airway, rather than infection, has become a primary indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in younger children. Infection becomes a more prominent indication as age increases. ${ }^{4}$

\section*{Vocalization}

Vocalization and speech patterns in infants and children should also be assessed. A high-pitched cry in the newborn or young infant may indicate increased intracranial pressure, and a hoarse cry in infants with upper respiratory infection may indicate croup or
laryngitis. Hoarseness in the neonatal period may be associated with congenital anomalies or a laryngeal hemangioma. In children, prolonged hoarseness should be investigated to determine the etiology that includes acute or chronic infection, benign lesions of the vocal cord folds, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and psychogenic causes. Prolonged unintelligible speech may indicate a speech articulation problem, expressive language delay, cognitive delay, or a hearing problem and should be promptly evaluated and referred for early intervention. Intelligible speech is critical for early success in school, and evaluation of speech and language delay and initiating speech therapy should not be delayed in hopes that the child will outgrow the problem. See Chapter 3 for further discussion on important developmental milestones for speech and language development and Chapter 13 for hearing assessment.

\hline
\end{tabular}

GABHS, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
Rhinosinusitis (RS) is one of the most prevalent diseases in childhood. Children average 6 to 8 upper respiratory tract infections per year, and the vast majority are caused by viruses with only $0.5 \%$ to $5 \%$ progressing to acute sinusitis. ${ }^{2}$ Symptoms include nasal congestion, nasal discharge that can be clear, mucoid, thick or thin, low-grade fever, irritability, cough, halitosis, and rarely headache, a cardinal sign of sinusitis in adults. Acute bacterial RS should be suspected when symptoms persist beyond 10 days or if there is purulent rhinorrhea for 3 to 4 consecutive days with fever of $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or above. Since RS usually has a viral origin, no antibiotics should be prescribed, and rarely are nasal decongestants indicated. There is no consensus on management of acute bacterial RS in children as compared to adults, with limited indications for use of antibiotics.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is the most common bacteria associated with pharyngotonsillitis in children and the only "sore throat" treated with antibiotics. "Strep throat," the common term used for GABHS pharyngitis, peaks in winter and spring, and transmission occurs through spread of droplets. Symptom history may reveal a household contact with similar symptoms or a diagnosed strep throat. Children and adolescents with prior history of GABHS are more susceptible to repeat infection. Signs and symptoms of GABHS pharyngitis are acute in onset and characterized by high fever, palpable cervical lymphadenopathy, sore throat, headache, and abdominal pain, sometimes with nausea and vomiting. Pharyngeal and tonsillar
mucosa are typically erythematous with exudate present in $50 \%$ to $90 \%$ of cases. ${ }^{2}$ A rapid antigen detection test (RADT) with confirmative throat culture is necessary to accurately diagnose GABHS.

Although symptoms will resolve within a few days without treatment, early treatment with penicillin (preferred) or amoxicillin, cephalosporins, macrolides, or clindamycin has effectively eradicated the infection and are presumed to prevent sequelae, including rheumatic fever. The incidence of rheumatic carditis is $0.3 \%$ in endemic environments. Acute glomerulonephritis is a sequela of a specific nephritogenic strain of GABHS, and $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of people infected with this strain of GABHS will develop acute glomerulonephritis regardless of treatment. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Summary of examination}
- In the infant, inspect for patency of nares and note any flaring or narrowing of the nares with breathing.
- An otoscope with halogen light is often used without a speculum to externally visualize the nares in infants and young children.
- Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth but are small; the frontal sinuses begin to develop by 7 years of age and the sphenoid sinuses develop in adolescence.
- Percuss with the forefingers or apply mild pressure with the thumbs over the maxillary and frontal sinus area to evaluate tenderness.
- The cheeks and lips are innervated by cranial nerves V (trigeminal) and VII (facial).
- Inspect the lips for color, symmetry, lesions, swelling, dryness, and fissures.
- Delay the examination of the mouth and nose in the infant and young child until after the "quiet" parts of the exam and after the ear examination.
- Inspect the buccal mucosa and gingivae with a tongue depressor for color, moisture, symmetry, and lesions.
- Inspect for tonsillar size and quality. Tonsillar size is graded on a scale of $1+$ to $4+$.
- Tooth eruption normally occurs between 4 and 12 months of age for the first tooth, and eruption of the 20 primary teeth should be complete between 24 and 30 months of age.
- Check the primary teeth in the infant and young child for "white spot" lesions, or decalcifications, and "brown spot" lesions, or cavitations, indicating the first sign of dental decay

\title{
Abdomen and rectum
}

\author{
Victoria F. Keeton
}

Assessment of the abdomen and rectum involves the evaluation of multiple organ systems and functions, including the gastrointestinal, renal, vascular, endocrine, immune, and female reproductive systems. The health care provider should always maintain a holistic view of the child, adolescent, and family during the assessment, which may help distinguish clinical symptoms from psychosomatic complaints in the pediatric population and help focus the abdominal examination.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The primitive gut forms during the fourth week of gestation from the dorsal section of the yolk sac. It begins as a hollow tube arising from the endoderm, which then forms the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut develops into the esophagus, stomach, upper portion of the duodenum (bile duct entrance), liver, biliary system, and pancreas. It is perfused by the celiac artery. The midgut develops into the distal duodenum and the remainder of the small intestine, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and most of the proximal portion of the transverse colon; it is perfused by the superior mesenteric artery. The hindgut develops into the remaining transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and superior portion of the anal canal; it is perfused by the inferior mesenteric artery.

By the end of the sixth week of gestation, the gut herniates
outside of the abdominal cavity, where it rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and continues to elongate. By the 10th week of gestation, the gut returns to the abdominal cavity and rotates another 180 degrees counterclockwise. With the normal intestinal rotation, the stomach and pancreas rotate into the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and are pressed against the dorsal abdominal wall to fuse into position.

The pancreas arises from ectodermal cells from the most caudal part of the foregut and develops into dorsal and ventral buds. The dorsal bud is larger and becomes the major portion of the pancreas. The dorsal and ventral buds fuse to form the main pancreatic duct. Secretion of insulin begins around the 20th week of gestation. Up until the 14th week, the spleen is only a hematopoietic organ. Between weeks 15 and 18, the spleen then loses its hematopoietic function and transforms into an organ of the immune system.

The liver begins as a bud that develops on the distal part of the foregut and grows into the septum transversum, where it divides into two parts. The larger part develops into the right and left lobes of the liver, and the second smaller division of the hepatic bud develops into the biliary system. Hematopoiesis begins at the sixth week of gestation and is responsible for the large size of the liver. It is approximately $10 \%$ of the total weight of the fetus. Bile begins to form at 16 weeks of gestation, giving meconium its dark green color.

Development of the kidney begins with a primitive, transitory structure called the pronephros, or forekidney, which arises near the segments of the spinal cord. These segments appear early in the fourth week of gestation on either side of the nephrogenic cord. The pronephros itself soon degenerates but leaves behind its ducts for the next kidney formation, the mesonephros, or midkidney, to utilize. In the fifth week, the metanephros, or hindkidney, begins to develop and becomes the permanent kidney. By the eighth week, the hindkidney begins to produce urine and continues to do so throughout the fetal period.

The adrenal glands develop from the medulla, which originates from the neuroectoderm. At the seventh week of gestation, the medulla attaches to the fetal cortex, which develops from the mesoderm, and by the eighth week, the fetal cortex begins to
encapsulate the medulla. The fetal adrenal gland is 20 times larger than the adult adrenal and is large compared with the kidneys. However, the adrenals rapidly decrease in size as the fetal cortex regresses and completely disappear by 4 years of age, when they are replaced by the adult cortex.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

The abdomen is the area of the torso from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor and is a three-dimensional space within which many organs overlap one another (Fig. 15.1). It is lined by the peritoneum, a serous membrane covering the abdominal viscera. The membrane of the peritoneum creates a smooth, moist surface that allows the abdominal viscera to glide freely within the confines of the abdominal wall and also provides protection.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-439.jpg?height=1757&width=1329&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=356}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15.1 Side view of the torso and abdomen.}
\end{figure}

The liver lies immediately below the right diaphragm and is the largest and heaviest organ in the body. It is composed of the right and left hepatic lobes and is an extremely vascular organ. The liver is perfused by the hepatic artery, which arises from the abdominal aorta, and by the portal vein, which delivers blood from the spleen, pancreas, and intestines. The liver is responsible for metabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It also breaks down toxic substances and drugs; stores vitamins and iron; produces
antibodies, bile, prothrombin, and fibrinogen for coagulation; and excretes waste products. The hepatic veins return blood to the vena cava. Within the inferior surface of the liver lies the gallbladder, a sac-like organ. The liver excretes bile into the hepatic duct, which is collected and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is secreted into the duodenum via the cystic duct and the common bile duct to aid in the digestion of fats.

Below the left diaphragm, from posterior to anterior, respectively, lie the spleen, pancreas, and stomach. The spleen is a concave organ made mostly of lymphoid tissue that lies around the posterior fundus of the stomach. The spleen filters and breaks down red blood cells and produces white blood cells (lymphocytes and monocytes). It also stores blood, which can be released into the vascular system during an acute blood loss. The pancreas is nestled between the spleen and stomach and crosses the midline over the major vessels. The pancreatic head extends to the duodenum and the tail reaches almost to the spleen. It is responsible for producing enzymes needed for the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates; these enzymes are excreted into the duodenum via the pancreatic duct and aid digestion. The pancreas also produces insulin and glucagon, which are secreted directly into the bloodstream, helping regulate blood glucose levels and endocrine function. The stomach is the most anterior organ in the LUQ of the abdomen. It is connected proximally to the esophagus, which enters through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus. The stomach receives food from the esophagus through the lower esophageal sphincter. It secretes hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, which are used to metabolize proteins and fats. When the stomach is distended, it is stimulated to contract and expel its contents through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum, the first portion of the small intestine.

The duodenum is C-shaped and curls around the head of the pancreas. The pancreatic and bile ducts empty into the upper portion of the duodenum. The duodenum transitions to the jejunum, which is responsible for the majority of the absorption of water, proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins. The ileum composes the last and longest part of the small intestine and absorbs bile salts, vitamins C and $\mathrm{B}_{12^{\prime}}$ and chloride. Intestinal contents leave the ileum
through the ileocecal valve and empty into the cecum, located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, which is the beginning of the large intestine (Fig. 15.2). The appendix, a long, narrow, tubular structure, arises from the base of the cecum. The large intestine lies anteriorly over the small intestine, ascends along the right anterior abdominal wall, and forms the ascending colon; it traverses the abdomen to the splenic flexure, forming the transverse colon, and descends along the left lateral abdomen wall as the descending colon. At the level of the iliac crest, the colon becomes the S -shaped sigmoid colon. It descends into the pelvic cavity and turns medially to form a loop at the level of the midsacrum. The sigmoid colon connects to the rectum, which lies behind the bladder in males and the uterus in females. It stores feces until it is expelled through the anal canal and out the anus, which is located within a ring of nerves and muscle fibers midway between the tip of the coccyx and the scrotum or vaginal fourchette. The anal canal and anus remain closed involuntarily by way of a ring of smooth muscle, the internal anal sphincter, and voluntarily by a ring of skeletal muscle, the external anal sphincter.

The kidneys lie on either side of the vertebral column in the retroperitoneal space below the liver and spleen. The right kidney tends to be lower than the left because it lies below the right lobe of the liver. Kidneys have a lobulated appearance at birth, which disappears with the development of the glomeruli and tubules in the first year of life. The kidneys are perfused by the renal arteries and filter and reabsorb water, electrolytes, glucose, and some proteins. They regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and the acidbase composition of blood and other body fluids; actively excrete metabolic waste products; and produce urine. The kidneys are capped by the adrenal glands, pyramid-shaped organs that synthesize, store, and secrete epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress. The adrenals also produce the corticosteroids, which affect glucose metabolism, electrolyte and fluid balance, and immune system function.

Urine is excreted from the kidney into the ureters, long, thin muscular tubules that transport urine to the bladder. The ureters connect to the superior pole of the renal pelvis. They descend posteriorly to the peritoneum and slightly medially in front of the psoas major muscle into the pelvic cavity, implanting into the superior posterior wall of the urinary bladder. The oblique insertion of the ureters through the bladder wall creates a one-way valvular mechanism that prevents the reflux of urine. The urinary bladder lies anterior to the uterus in females and anterior to the rectum in males. When filled to its capacity, the bladder then contracts and releases urine through the bladder neck and out the urethra. The urethra is normally located at the tip of the penis in males and between the clitoris and vagina in females. In nonpregnant females, the reproductive organs lie within the pelvis between the bladder (anterior pelvis) and the rectum (posterior pelvis). They include the ovaries, uterine or fallopian tubes, and uterus. These organs descend into the pelvic cavity during normal growth and development and ascend into the abdominal cavity during pregnancy or with ovarian cysts or other abnormalities of the female reproductive system. See

Chapter 18 for further discussion of the female genitourinary system.

Finally, a layer of fascia and then muscle covers the anterior abdomen. The rectus abdominis muscle extends the entire length of the front of the abdomen and is separated by the linea alba in the midline. The transverse abdominis and internal and external oblique muscles cover the lateral abdomen. The umbilicus lies in the midline usually below the midpoint of the abdomen (Fig. 15.3).

\section*{Physiologic variations}

Many aspects of the development of the organs and structures in the abdomen continue into the first few years of life. The muscle tone of the lower esophageal sphincter is not fully developed until 1 month of age and may remain slightly weak for the first year. The stomach is round until approximately 2 years of age and then elongates into its adult shape and position by about 7 years of age. Stomach capacity is also smaller in the infant, whereas emptying time is faster, which results in the pattern of small and frequent feedings. The small bowel grows from approximately 270 cm at birth to up to 550 cm by 4 years of age. The liver constitutes $5 \%$ of the term neonate's body weight, versus $2 \%$ in the adult. The kidneys also remain relatively large for the size of the abdomen until adolescence.

\section*{System-specific history}

Information gathering for the assessment of the abdomen should include questions regarding diet, elimination, medications, environmental exposures, and a thorough psychosocial history (see Information Gathering table). Evaluation of abdominal symptoms that may be related to the genitourinary tract are discussed in more depth in Chapters 16 and 18. An assessment of the menstrual cycle in the female and history of sexual activity in adolescents is also essential.

\section*{Abdominal pain}

When a complaint of abdominal pain is reported, the examiner must elicit a detailed history of the pain. Information regarding the character and severity of the pain, onset and duration, location or radiation, position of comfort, things that alleviate or worsen the pain, history of trauma, and any associated symptoms of fever, vomiting, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, or frequent stooling with or without noting blood is important in narrowing the scope of the differential diagnosis. A complaint of recurrent pain related to meals or after meals should be elicited in the history. A detailed history can help in determining whether the abdominal pain is acute or chronic. Remember that abdominal pain can be referred from an extra-abdominal source or can be a condition associated with systemic disease. For example, abdominal pain is common in children with beta-streptococcal pharyngitis, lower lobe pneumonia, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, and many other conditions. See Box 15.2 for a differential diagnosis of symptoms or conditions related to different abdominal
regions.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

When a child presents with chronic abdominal pain, a primary goal is to determine whether the pain has a functional or organic cause to create an effective management plan. However, confirming the presence or absence of an organic disease is not enough to determine the degree of impairment a child may experience related to chronic abdominal pain. Evidence shows that children with functional abdominal pain (FAP) experience a significant decrease in quality of life and are more prone to impairment in social, psychological, and academic functioning. ${ }^{1}$ Therefore it is imperative to include an evaluation of functional impairment for any child with chronic abdominal pain.

\section*{Red Flag In Abdominal Assessment}

Nocturnal awakening with pain and/or stooling may be a red flag in the school-age child and requires further assessment and diagnostic workup as indicated.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Equipment}

In performing an abdominal exam in an infant or child, good lighting, warm hands, and a stethoscope may be all the equipment necessary. Diagnostic imaging can play an important complementary role in the assessment of some abdominal complaints, but it is essential that the decision to use such resources be warranted and evidence-based. ${ }^{2}$ A proper physical examination by the health care provider remains essential to determining the best course of action and the level of acuity of the presenting condition. If the assessment reveals abdominal pain accompanied
by any red flags (Box 15.1), further evaluation through laboratory analysis and/or diagnostic imaging may be warranted. ${ }^{1-3}$ See later section, Diagnostic Procedures, for further discussion.

\section*{Preparation and positioning}

Infants and toddlers can initially sit comfortably on the parent's lap directly facing the examiner. Inspection and auscultation of the abdomen can be done with the child sitting upright. For light and deep palpation, the examiner should be seated in a knee-to-knee position with the parent and with the child lying with head and torso in the parent's lap and the hips and legs in the examiner's lap (Fig. 15.4). The initial examination can occur with the child partially dressed and the diaper can be unfastened or pants and underwear pulled below the groin area. For older children and adolescents, the abdomen should be assessed on the examination table. It is important for the examiner to consistently place the older child or adolescent in the same position when preparing for the abdominal examination-ideally with the head on the examiner's left and the right side of the child's body in front of the examiner. This will aid in accurate anatomic findings and accurate diagnosis of abdominal symptoms and conditions.

\end{figure}

The abdomen is divided into four equal quadrants, with the transverse and midsagittal planes intersecting at the umbilicus (Fig. 15.5 A ). For a child or adolescent who presents with abdominal pain or for other abdominal conditions, use a mapping technique with
nine sections to accurately describe findings and for purposes of charting in the electronic health record (see Fig. 15.5B). Mentally visualizing the anatomic location of the organs and adopting a mapping technique for abdominal assessment is key to an accurate and informative examination. There may be some variation in the anatomic positions of the organs in children and adolescents depending on the body type, respiratory phase at the time of the exam, the amount of contents within the stomach or bladder, and the amount of palpable stool in the abdomen.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15.5 (A) Four abdominopelvic quadrants. (B) Nine abdominopelvic regions.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Inspection}

Examination of the abdomen begins with the initial inspection of the child or adolescent's facial expression and color, attitude, activity level, and level of comfort to determine any distress. Observe whether the child has difficulty walking or climbing onto or off of the exam table. Children with peritoneal irritation often walk cautiously and resist lying on the exam table. Ask the child to hop or jump and note whether these movements elicit pain. If the child is guarding the abdomen, prefers to keep the legs flexed, or if the abdomen is rigid, this can indicate diffuse peritonitis.

Begin the abdominal assessment by extending each leg and note
if pain is elicited and its location. Inspect the abdomen by noting its contour, symmetry, skin texture, color, and integrity. Note any lesions, rashes, pigment variations, piercings, gastrostomy tubes, or scars. Scars can indicate previous abdominal surgery and should always be explored during history taking. View the abdomen from the side and note the shape and anteroposterior dimension. Infants and young children have less developed abdominal musculature, so the abdomen is more protuberant and round. Young children to 4 years of age will have a potbellied appearance while supine or standing (Fig. 15.6). If the abdomen is scaphoid at any age, it can indicate malnutrition or displaced abdominal organs, as with a diaphragmatic hernia or intestinal atresia in a newborn. If the abdominal contour is distended, it can indicate an intestinal obstruction, a mass, organomegaly, or ascites. Fullness over the symphysis pubis can be seen in a thin child with a full bladder. Asymmetry of the abdomen may indicate a mass, organomegaly, hollow organ distention, or curvature of the spine.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15.6 Potbelly stance of the toddler.}
\end{figure}

Observe for any pulsations. It is normal to see pulsations in the epigastric area of a young infant or very thin child. Distended veins in the abdominal integument could indicate vascular compression
or obstruction, hypertension, or intestinal obstruction. If an intestinal obstruction is suspected, note any obvious loops of bowel and observe for peristaltic waves on the surface by viewing the abdomen at eye level.

Inspect the umbilicus for any signs of drainage, infection, hernia, or mass. In the initial newborn exam, inspect the cord for the umbilical vessels, two arteries, and a single vein. The arteries are smaller and have a thicker vessel wall. Infants with a two-vessel cord may have congenital anomalies and should be referred for further diagnosis and evaluation. The majority of umbilical cord remnants detach by the 10th day of life but can take up to 3 weeks to slough. Once the cord has detached, the stump should dry and heal within a few days. Occasionally, umbilical granulomas or granular tissue at the base of the umbilicus can be present and drain serous or seropurulent fluid or occasionally blood (Fig. 15.7). For persistent umbilical granulomas, cauterization or surgical ligation of the stump may be needed. Any prolonged drainage should be investigated for presence of a urachal remnant or cyst. If stool is noted coming from the umbilicus, an omphalomesenteric duct remnant is present, and the infant should be referred immediately to a pediatric surgeon. Any sign of infection in the umbilicus should be aggressively treated in the neonate. Neonatal omphalitis is a rapidly progressing, acute, and potentially fatal infection of the abdominal wall caused by a bacterial pathogen. Any infant with purulent discharge or sign of cellulitis should be treated with systemic antibiotics and referred immediately if the infection progresses.

Atlas of Neonatology, ed 7, Philadelphia, 2000, Saunders.)

Note any protrusion or mass in the umbilicus. Observe the midline of the abdomen of the infant or young child when he or she is reclining or sitting. A wide bulging superior to the umbilicus is likely diastasis recti abdominis (Fig. 15.8), a common finding in children when the rectus abdominis muscle does not meet in the midline. Diastasis recti abdominis does not create any functional problem during infancy and early childhood and usually diminishes or resolves as the child grows and the abdominal muscles strengthen.

\end{figure}

\section*{Auscultation}

Auscultation of the abdomen should be done before palpation or percussion so as to prevent any alteration in bowel sounds that may occur from manipulation of the area. Systematically listen to each quadrant or section of the abdomen with a stethoscope. In the infant and young child, auscultate the abdomen when you are completing the quiet parts of the physical exam (i.e., the cardiac and respiratory assessment). Bowel sounds can be heard within the first few hours of life and indicate peristalsis and movement of contents through the bowels. Normal bowel sounds are heard every 10 to 20 seconds, and frequency of bowel sounds may be approximately 5 to 30 in 1 minute. Hypoactive (more than 30 seconds apart) or absent bowel sounds (none heard within 3 to 5 minutes) may indicate a paralytic ileus, or inactivity of the intestines, as in constipation. Hyperactive bowel sounds indicate rapid movement through the intestines, usually associated with diarrhea or a mechanical obstruction. If the child is hypertensive, auscultate for bruits using the bell of the stethoscope to assess for signs of renovascular disease. A newborn with a scaphoid abdomen or signs of respiratory distress should be carefully evaluated for bowel sounds or decreased breath sounds in the chest, which may indicate a diaphragmatic hernia. During auscultation of the abdomen, the examiner can carefully watch the child's facial expression to identify areas of tenderness while lightly pressing the stethoscope against each section of the abdomen.

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation is the most important technique in assessing the abdomen and identifies areas of tenderness, masses, organomegaly, ascites, and signs of inflammation or peritonitis. It should not be omitted even with a child who is having difficulty cooperating with the exam. The ideal position for palpation of the abdomen is to have the child lie supine with the knees and hips gently flexed to relax the abdominal wall.

Begin with light palpation using the pads of the forefingers to assess the four quadrants of the abdomen. Use a firm therapeutic touch for palpation. Massaging the abdomen should be avoided. Observe the child's facial expression to note any signs of pain,
discomfort, or areas of tenderness. If areas of tenderness are detected with light palpation, examine those areas last when performing deep palpation.

\begin{abstract}
PEDIATRIC PEARLS
Give infants a pacifier to suck, or distract the young child in the parent's lap with a toy or favorite stuffed animal, so as to help relax the abdomen during the abdominal exam. If a child is ticklish during palpation, place his or her hand under your hand with your fingers interlaced and palpate the abdomen together. Distraction with conversation is also effective in eliciting cooperation throughout the exam.
\end{abstract}

Deep palpation requires a firmer therapeutic touch, and the child may resist palpation because of fear or pain over areas of inflammation. It may be helpful to use two-handed palpation with the nondominant hand to exert pressure over the examining hand when evaluating the abdomen in obese children and adolescents. McBurney's sign, tenderness with deep palpation of the right lower quadrant, or referred right lower quadrant pain with deep palpation of the left lower quadrant, Rovsing's sign, could be suspicious for appendicitis and should be further evaluated and referred. With deep palpation, pain can also be assessed with rebound tenderness. To produce rebound tenderness, place fingertips at a 90-degree angle against the abdomen and gently but firmly press into the abdomen. Quickly lift the hand off the abdomen and note if any pain is elicited. The child with rebound tenderness will have more pain when the examiner's hand is lifted from the abdomen than with deep palpation. Pain with rebound of the abdomen may be a sign of inflammation or peritonitis. Rigidity of the abdomen is the involuntary tightening of the abdominal musculature that occurs in response to underlying inflammation in the abdomen. Peritonitis may be indicated if pain is worse when the examiner lifts the hand off the abdomen when testing for rebound tenderness. Guarding is the voluntary contraction of the abdominal wall musculature to prevent pain and may subside if the child relaxes.

To palpate the liver, place the fingertips at the right midclavicular line a few centimeters below the rib cage at the costal margin. Move the fingers slightly up and inward and feel for a firm nudge by the liver tip on inspiration. Note the distance between the location of the costal margin and liver tip. The liver may be palpable in an infant or toddler 1 to 2 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatomegaly is suspected in any child whose liver is palpable more than 3 cm below the costal margin. In the obese child or adolescent, hepatomegaly is highly suspect for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and should prompt further evaluation through laboratory and imaging studies ${ }^{4}$; however, other causes of an enlarged liver should be considered; these include systemic infection, tumors, hepatic storage disorders, biliary masses, intrahepatic vascular disease, and cardiac disease.

To palpate the spleen, position the fingertips in the left midclavicular line below the costal margin and feel for firmness on inspiration (Fig. 15.9A and B). An alternative technique in infants is to palpate the spleen between the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. The spleen can be felt in about $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of children and should be slightly mobile. If splenomegaly is suspected, ultrasound examination can differentiate spleen enlargement from other masses that may arise in the LUQ. Splenomegaly can be caused by infection, inflammation, blood dyscrasias, a mass, or vascular and oncologic conditions. The spleen is a very vascular organ and should be gently palpated if injury/trauma is suspected. If blunt trauma to the abdomen is suspected, avoid deep palpation of the spleen or liver. If the liver or spleen is lacerated, a clot tamponading the laceration could be dislodged, causing further bleeding with deep palpation.

\end{figure}

The kidneys can sometimes be palpated in infants. Place the left hand behind the right flank of the infant and, using the fingertips of the right hand, palpate deeply in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), to the right of the midline. The right kidney may be "trapped" between the hands. Repeat the technique, placing the right hand behind the infant's left flank, and use the left fingertips to palpate the left kidney in the LUQ. The kidneys should be round, smooth, and firm. A distended bladder may be palpated in the midline above the symphysis pubis, which may indicate a vesicoureteral or bladder neck obstruction, acute bladder retention, or neurogenic bladder.

Palpate the umbilicus for masses or herniation. The most common umbilical disorder is an umbilical hernia in which the
intestine protrudes through the abdominal fascia, or linea alba (Fig. 15.10). The umbilicus appears to protrude especially when the child is crying, stooling, or coughing, but generally it can be easily reduced when the examiner applies light pressure with the fingertips to the umbilicus. Palpate the fascia below the umbilicus with the fingertips to determine the size of the defect. If the opening is larger than the width of two fingers or the child is older than 3 years of age, surgical closure may be necessary. Incarceration of an umbilical hernia is very rare. Most will spontaneously close by the time the child is 3 or 4 years of age. The most common umbilical mass is a dermoid cyst. It appears as a firm, skin-covered, nonreducible mass within the umbilicus that may have a slight discoloration and can be lobulated. Other cysts or an umbilical polyp should be referred to a pediatric surgeon for evaluation. Diastasis recti abdominis, or separation of the abdominal wall musculature, can be noted with light palpation over the midquadrant. An infant between the ages of 3 and 8 weeks of age with projectile, nonbilious vomiting may have pyloric stenosis. Examine the infant while the abdomen is relaxed and palpate in the upper abdomen, slightly right of the midline for a firm, olive-shaped mass, which is highly suspicious for a hypertrophic pylorus. If a child presents with constipation, a sausage-shaped mass of stool may be palpated in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) or in the midline below the umbilicus or rectosigmoid colon. The palpation of stool throughout the abdomen may indicate fecal impaction.

Palpate the groin bilaterally for femoral arterial pulses and the presence of lymph nodes (Fig. 15.11). Check the groin area for a mass or inguinal hernia. Note any persistent bulging in the groin. Palpate to determine size and reducibility. If the inguinal bulge or hernia can be reduced, referral is indicated for elective surgery and repair. An irreducible or incarcerated hernia is a surgical emergency. Scars from previous surgical hernia repairs should also be evaluated. An incisional hernia may be present and should be evaluated and referred.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15.11 Palpating femoral pulses and lymph nodes.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Percussion}

Percussion of the abdomen can help to identify whether distention of the abdomen is caused by air, a mass, or fluid (Fig. 15.12). When percussing, place your nondominant hand firmly against the abdominal wall so that only your middle finger is resting on the skin. With a relaxed wrist, tap on the distal interphalangeal joint of your middle finger two or three times with the tip of the middle finger of your dominant hand. Air or gas in the abdominal cavity creates a hollow, drum-like sound, or tympany, in tapping firmly over the area. Tympany is common in infants and young children
because they swallow air while feeding or crying. Percussion can also delineate rough dimensions of solid masses and organs, although in most settings diagnostic imaging is used to confirm the accuracy of any abdominal findings. To measure liver size, percuss superiorly between the ribs until no dullness is noted. The upper edge of the liver should be detected at the right midclavicular line near the fifth intercostal space. Mark this point and measure its distance from the lower edge of the liver. The lower edge of the liver should not extend more than 1 to 2 cm below the costal margin. This technique identifies only the anterior surface of the liver and not the anteroposterior dimension. Fluid in the abdomen creates a dull sound when percussing over the area and may indicate the presence of ascites in the abdominal cavity.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 15.12 Percussion of the abdomen.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Rectal examination}

A rectal exam should be approached carefully with informed consent of child and parent, and it should be performed if there is concern regarding anal or rectal patency, anal discomfort, constipation or sphincter tone, fissures, hemorrhoids, or rectal polyps. ${ }^{5}$ Abdominal pain may be an indication for a rectal exam depending on the child's or adolescent's health history.

If the abdominal exam and health history are unclear or the information obtained from a rectal exam would assist in the diagnosis, explain clearly to the parent and child or adolescent the
need for the rectal exam. Keep in mind that a rectal exam is physically invasive, and many children will no longer cooperate with a physical exam after a rectal exam has been performed. If it is necessary to perform a rectal exam, do so at the very end of the physical examination, using the talk-through approach as presented in Chapter 1.

Position the child on the side with knees flexed (fetal position). An infant or toddler can lie supine with the hips and knees flexed. Assess the sacrum for dimples, sinuses, or tufts of hair. Note the location of the anus; if displaced anteriorly, it could predispose a child to issues such as constipation. Inspect the anus for rashes, fissures, skin tags, or discoloration. Contraction of the external anal sphincter (anal wink reflex) is a normal response to stroking of the skin in the perineum. Gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger (usually the smallest finger in infants; the index finger in an older child) into the rectal vault and feel for any narrowing. Assess sphincter tones. Feel for any masses or polyps or pressure compressing the lumen of the rectum. Note whether there is stool in the rectum and whether it is hard or soft. If an explosive stool is elicited with the rectal exam, it may be a sign of a rectal obstruction, such as Hirschsprung disease. Gently press toward the right lower quadrant and observe whether this elicits a pain response, which can support a diagnosis of appendicitis. Alternately press in all directions and note any pain. If any stool is retrieved from the exam, perform a guaiac test on the specimen if there is concern for occult blood in the stool, keeping in mind that trauma during a rectal exam may affect the result.

\section*{Diagnostic procedures}

A number of diagnostic procedures may be useful to aid in the assessment of abdominal and rectal complaints. ${ }^{6}$ Guaiac stool testing or a urine dipstick may be easily performed in the clinic setting or office. Laboratory analyses that could be useful include the evaluation of liver and kidney function, analysis of urine or stool, monitoring of electrolytes, or checking for antibody markers, including for Helicobacter pylori or celiac disease. Abdominal ultrasound is often the first step in diagnostic imaging, depending
on the child's health history and physical examination findings. Proceed with radiographic procedures such as a kidneys-uretersbladder (KUB) x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if indicated, to locate and measure organs or masses or detect intestinal inflammation, obstruction, or perforation. A computed tomography (CT) scan would be performed with caution in consultation with pediatric surgery or gastroenterology when indicated. Endoscopy of the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract may be useful to visualize anatomy, lesions, and obtain biopsies; for example, to evaluate for inflammation of the esophagus due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.

\section*{Abdominal conditions}

Box 15.2 presents conditions of the abdomen according to where the signs or symptoms may occur. Keep in mind that many conditions involve diffuse abdominal pain, and children often have a difficult time localizing pain to a specific region.

\section*{Summary of examination}
- A thorough and detailed history is an essential part of the abdominal assessment and should include the medical and family health history, nutrition and elimination habits, a psychosocial evaluation, and a review of pain or other
presenting symptoms.
- Infants and young children may be more comfortably assessed in the lap of the parent or caregiver.
- Abdominal assessment should be performed using a mapping technique by mentally dividing the abdomen into four quadrants or nine regions.
- Begin inspection of the abdomen by observing the child or adolescent's posture, behavior, and activity level; then inspect the abdomen for size, shape, and pulsations.
- Auscultate each quadrant of the abdomen before palpation and note the quality and frequency of bowel sounds.
- Use light palpation to identify areas of tenderness before deep palpation.
- During palpation, note size of organs if palpable, presence of tenderness or pain on palpation, any guarding or rigidity in the abdomen, and the size and quality of any masses.
- Perform percussion to identify the presence of air or gas and to estimate the size of solid organs or masses.
- A rectal examination should be performed only when applicable and, if so, should be done at the end of the physical exam.

\section*{Male genitalia}

\section*{Angel K. Chen}

The pediatric physical examination is not complete without a thorough evaluation of the developing genitalia. Routine surveillance of the genitourinary system is equally important in all patient encounters, and when assessment of the genitalia is performed routinely, abnormalities can be identified and promptly treated. Many parents, children, and adolescents are concerned and anxious about the genitalia, yet they may not feel comfortable expressing those concerns initially. A review of systems in the health history and the routine genital exam offers an opportunity for the parent, child, and/or adolescent to voice concerns and for the provider to offer reassurance and education on normal development. The provider has a role in fostering dialogue between the parent and child regarding reproductive health, and establishing this dialogue early with families when gathering the health history forms the basis for discussions on reproductive health during puberty and in the developing adolescent.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The differentiation of the sexual organs begins as early as the third week of embryonic development, dictated by the sex chromosomes at the time of fertilization. ${ }^{1}$ The mesoderm is the embryonic layer that becomes smooth and striated muscle tissue, connective tissue, blood vessels, bone marrow, skeletal tissue, and the reproductive and excretory organs. As proliferation of the embryonic layers
continues, maturation of the external genitalia in the fetus is established by the 12th week. ${ }^{1}$ The sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY gene) activates the differentiation of the embryonic gonad into a testis, without which, the gonad would become an ovary. The antimÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) prevents development of the uterus and fallopian tubes, whereas testosterone stimulates the wolffian ducts to develop into the male reproductive structures, including the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. Testosterone is also the precursor to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which stimulates the formation of the male urethra, prostate, and external genitalia. ${ }^{1}$

Urine production begins between the 9th and 12th weeks and is excreted into the amniotic cavity through the urethral meatus. During development, the fetus continues the production and excretion of urine, which forms the amniotic fluid. Between the 17th and 20th weeks, the testes, which develop in the abdominal cavity, begin to descend along the inguinal canal into the scrotum, bringing the arteries, veins, lymphatics, and nerves that are encased within the cremaster muscle and spermatic cord. ${ }^{1}$ The inguinal canal closes after testicular descent. Incomplete or abnormal embryonic development of the inguinal canal predisposes the newborn to the formation of hydroceles or hernias. Preterm infants are at increased risk for these conditions. At birth, the infant's genitourinary system is functionally immature with limited bladder capacity, inability to concentrate urine sufficiently, and frequent voiding.

Growth of the fetus and differentiation of the sexual organs can be affected by placental function, the hormonal environment during pregnancy, maternal nutrition, maternal infection, and genetic factors or chromosomal abnormalities. A fetal insult from intrinsic or extrinsic factors during the eighth or ninth week of gestation may lead to major abnormalities of the developing external genitalia. The data on impact from chemical exposure is mixed and inconclusive; ${ }^{2}$ however, endocrine-disrupting chemicals do play a role in the development of the endocrine and genitourinary system, which is further reviewed in Chapter 5.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Penis}

The penis consists of the shaft, glans, corona, meatus, and prepuce. The shaft is composed of erectile tissue called corpora cavernosa (two lateral columns) and corpus spongiosum (ventral column). The anterior portion of the corpus spongiosum forms the glans penis, the border or edge of which is called the corona. The urethra is within the corpus spongiosum, and the orifice, or urethral meatus, is the slitlike opening just ventral to the tip of the penis (Fig. 16.1).

Examination, ed 7, St. Louis, 2011, Mosby.)}
\end{figure}

The prepuce, or foreskin, is the fold of skin at the tip of the penis that covers the glans penis in the uncircumcised male and forms the secondary fold of skin from the urethral meatus to the coronal region of the penis called the frenulum. The skin of the penis is thin, does not contain subcutaneous fat, and is loosely tied to the deeper layer of the dermis and fascia. Often, the skin of the shaft is more darkly pigmented, particularly in children or adolescents with darker pigmentation or darker skin. The skin of the glans penis does
not contain hair follicles but does have small glands and papillae that form in the epithelial cells to produce smegma, the white oily material made up of desquamated epithelial cells trapped under the foreskin, which is normal and often mistaken as pathologic (Fig. 16.2). The foreskin is generally nonretractable at birth because of adherence of the inner epithelial lining of the foreskin and glans. ${ }^{3,4}$ Desquamation of the tissue layers continues until the separation of the prepuce and glans penis is complete secondary to intermittent erections and keratinization of the inner epithelium, generally by 6 years of age. Partial adhesions of the foreskin to the prepuce may produce smegma along the coronal region, which often persists throughout childhood.

\end{figure}

\section*{Scrotum and testes}

The scrotum is made up of a thin layer of skin that forms rugae (folds) and contains the testes. The epididymis is the thin palpable structure along the lateral edge of the posterior side of the testes.

Sperm production occurs within the seminiferous tubules in the testes, which connect to the epididymis. The vas deferens is the cordlike structure that is continuous with the base of the epididymis and stores sperm. The spermatic cord extends from the testes to the inguinal ring and is felt only on deep palpation of the testicular sac. The right spermatic cord is shorter in some males, which causes the right testis to hang higher than the left.

The male accessory organs include the seminal vesicles, which lay deep in the abdominal cavity alongside the vas deferens and secrete liquid into the semen as it passes from the testes. The opening of the seminal vesicles joins the vas deferens to form ejaculatory ducts and drains to the posterior urethra. The Cowper glands, or bulbourethral glands, lie along the urethra in the male genitalia. These are exocrine glands that produce a viscous secretion that lubricates the urethra for the passage of sperm. It also neutralizes the acidic urethral secretions that could otherwise damage the spermatozoa in the semen. The prostate gland is the small, firm mass that lies within the pelvic cavity. It first becomes palpable on manual examination in the adolescent male. The prostate gland surrounds the posterior urethra and secrets an alkaline secretion during ejaculation to promote fertilization. The smooth muscle within the prostate gland assists with urinary elimination. An enlarged prostate gland may cause urinary obstruction.

\section*{Physiologic changes in puberty}

Puberty has a gradual onset, and although it is marked by a growth spurt, it may be difficult to ascertain when the first changes in the male begin in the transition to secondary sexual characteristics (Fig. 16.3). In males, sexual development, or true gonadal activation, begins with an increase in size of the testicles, which is often difficult to determine. Testicular volume should be evaluated and is the most accurate measurement of the progression of puberty in the developing male. In some boys, this begins around 10 years of age and is complete in about 3 years, with the normal range extending to 5 years. ${ }^{5}$ The sexual maturity rating (SMR) scale, also known as Tanner stages, helps to classify physical pubertal maturation (Fig. 16.4 and Table 16.2). ${ }^{5}$ Genital development and pubic hair may develop at different rates. Ejaculation usually occurs at SMR 3 during the midpoint of sexual development. Fertility is established by SMR 4, although sperm are present in some quantity with ejaculation during SMR 3.

Data from Neinstein LS, Katzman DK, Callahan ST, Gordon CM, Joffe A, Rickert VI: Neinstein's Adolescent and Young Adult Health Care: A Practical Guide, ed 6,

Philadelphia, 2016, Wolters Kluwer.
In male adolescents, it is the tempo of growth and maturation that is distinctly different than that in females. At mid-puberty, with rising testosterone concentrations, most of the rapid linear growth occurs. Recent studies have provided evidence of earlier onset puberty in males, particularly in African Americans. ${ }^{5}$ The trend is an overall earlier start of puberty but prolonged progression to genital maturity.

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, ethnic, and other considerations}

Understanding and respecting cultural differences is an important part of the role of the health care provider, particularly in relation to the assessment of the genitourinary system. Identifying which family members may be a part of the discussion and/or be present during the examination of the genitalia and how to approach the exam are the first steps in developing a trusting relationship with the family. Parental and family attitudes about sexuality vary widely both within cultures and among cultures. Sexual awakening first occurs in the young child with the discovery of the genitalia as a sensual organ. This initial experience and the parental attitude toward normal fondling and exploration may set the stage for either normal sexual development in a child or a feeling of shamefulness and an attitude in the child that fosters abnormal functioning throughout life. Often, cultural attitudes concerning sexuality and reproduction form the basis of conflict between the parent and young child or maturing adolescent. Mediating this difference between the adolescent and the parent may be the most important and challenging role for the health care provider. In addition, documentation in the health care record provides opportunity to communicate these attitudes to the next provider to ensure consistent delivery of care.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Preparation}

Although there is a tendency toward skipping assessment of the genitalia in the course of performing a physical examination, the
provider should be mindful that it is a critical part of evaluating a growing and developing body. If performed regularly by the provider during pediatric well visits, the genital examination then becomes simply an expected part of the routine physical assessment at all ages, including through adolescence. Reticence on the part of the child, adolescent, parent, or even the provider is not a reason for omitting the examination of the genitalia. The provider should proceed as with the rest of the physical examination, maintaining a matter-of-fact approach and using a purposeful technique that is not traumatic for the child or adolescent.

Before the start of the genitourinary exam, the provider should discuss the rationale for performing this exam as well as what to expect during the exam. Anticipatory guidance is of utmost importance for all age groups beyond the infant and young child. Parents of adolescents should be prepared to leave the exam room for the physical examination of the genitalia after bringing up any concerns during the health history. This gives the provider an opportunity to discuss with the adolescent the consent to confidential reproductive health services and the limits to confidentiality, which differ from state to state (see Chapter 4).

> PEDIATRIC PEARLS
> In early childhood, the provider should emphasize that the exam is only to be done when a parent or guardian is present but not with strangers or other adolescents or adults. In middle childhood, the genital exam is a chance to reinforce normal development, and the exam prepares the child for what to expect as an adolescent. In adolescence, the exam is a chance to be alone with the provider to discuss questions and/or concerns about their genitalia and sexual development.

As with all parts of the physical examination in pediatrics, it is important to talk through the assessment of the male genitalia and reassure the adolescent of normal findings as well as discuss any concerns when completing the examination. This is also an opportunity to discuss normal growth and development, hygiene
issues, and anticipatory guidance. With the adolescent male, the talk-through exam provides the opportunity to establish rapport and validates feelings and concerns during and after the examination. There is often a hidden agenda with adolescents around issues of normalcy or reproductive health. The pediatric health care provider must be ready to discuss any issues involving reproductive health in a supportive and professional manner.

\section*{Positioning}

During the first 4 to 6 months of life, infants are best positioned on the examination table for assessment of the male genitalia. Beyond early infancy, the child may be lying on the parent's lap in a knee-to-knee position with the provider, or continue to be examined on the exam table. The young child may be lying down or sitting in the tailor position (cross-legged) on the exam table (Fig. 16.5). The middle-age child may be examined lying supine on the exam table or sitting or standing to enhance gravity of the testicles, as in the adolescent and young adult male. ${ }^{5,6}$ It is important to have draping available and only expose the child as long as needed for inspection, palpation, and/or education. Lengthy discussions can be done once the child is dressed. Respecting the need for privacy, particularly in the young child and the developing adolescent, establishes a good patient-provider relationship.

\end{figure}

\section*{Inspection and palpation}

Assessment of the male genitalia includes inspection and palpation of the penis, foreskin, urethral meatus, scrotum, testes, rectal sphincter, and perineal skin status. Always inform the child or adolescent before beginning inspection and palpation. Physiologic phimosis, when the foreskin cannot be retracted over the glans penis, is normal before 6 years of age (Fig. 16.6). Forcible retraction of the foreskin may cause trauma, with increased risk for infection and/or scarring, leading to pathologic phimosis (see Table 16.4). Good hygiene of the penis and foreskin can decrease the risk of developing infection or adhesions of the foreskin to the glans penis and should be reviewed regularly at well-child visits during childhood.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Do not forcibly retract the foreskin. If indicated, treat with steroid ointment (betamethasone $0.05 \%$ or triamcinolone $0.1 \%$ ointment), applied 3 times/day to retracted foreskin for 4-6 weeks (see Fig. 16.6). Surgical intervention is rarely indicated in physiologic phimosis. ${ }^{7,8}$

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Care of the uncircumcised penis: Rinse penis and foreskin with water and soap during bathing. Always return foreskin over glans following retraction. For older boys, instruct the child to gently retract the foreskin during voiding. Refer parents to the American Academy of Pediatrics website for more information on caring for a child's penis. Available at
http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Caring-For-Your-SonsPenis.aspx

In the newborn, the urethral meatus is normally on the tip of the glans penis. In middle childhood and adolescence, the urethral meatus is a slitlike opening on the ventral side of the glans penis. Examination in the adolescent male includes an inspection for erythema or discharge (Fig. 16.7).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-479.jpg?height=1315&width=1118&top_left_y=976&top_left_x=462}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 16.7 Examination of urethral meatus in adolescent.}
\end{figure}

Inspection of the scrotum includes assessing the fullness of the scrotum, color, median raphe, and rugae, as well as determining SMR or Tanner stage. Before palpation of the scrotum in the infant
and prepubertal male, the provider should place a hand firmly above the inguinal canal, near the superior anterior iliac crest, milk down the testis along the inguinal canal, and trap the testis in the scrotum with the thumb and index finger of the opposite hand to prevent retraction of the testes (Fig. 16.8). Isolate the testis between the thumb and forefinger, and roll within the pads of the fingers to assess for testicular size, shape, consistency, and any point tenderness (Fig. 16.9). The cremasteric reflex causes retraction of the testes into the inguinal canal/abdominal cavity and can be activated by cold, touch, or emotion, particularly in infancy and early childhood. Retractile testis is a testis that may retract on exam but may be normally positioned in the scrotum. This may confuse the findings of the exam, prompting unnecessary referral in a normal male child.

FIGURE 16.9 Palpation of scrotal sac. (A) Left testicle. (B) Right testicle.

Compare the testes bilaterally for any significant difference in size. Testicular size discrepancy of greater than $15 \%$ should be noted for further evaluation. ${ }^{6}$ An orchidometer may be used to screen testicular size in the growing and developing male (Fig. 16.10), although scrotal ultrasound is used as a more accurate measurement of testicular volume. ${ }^{9}$ If the testis is not palpable in the scrotum in the young child, often a positional change to sitting with legs crossed (tailor style) will facilitate relaxation of the cremasteric muscle and allow for the testes to descend to the scrotal sac (see Fig.16.5). Careful inspection and palpation of the inguinal, suprapubic, scrotal, and perineal region may reveal an ectopic testis. ${ }^{10}$

\end{figure}

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Cryptorchidism, or undescended testicle, is best evaluated by history and physical examinations initially. Radiologic imaging with ultrasounds offer poor diagnostic value and increase the cost of health care. Referral to pediatric urologists without first obtaining ultrasounds for evaluation and management is indicated. ${ }^{10,}{ }^{11}$ Generally, if testes were detected in the normally formed scrotum in the first 6 months of life but are now present as undescended, they are most likely retractile in nature. Acquired cryptorchidism, or ascent of a previously descended testis, may occur in $1 \%-7 \%$ of the boys and peak at 8 years of age. ${ }^{10}$ Acquired cryptorchidism would require further evaluation by a pediatric urologist.

In the adolescent male, the examiner should palpate for the epididymis on the posterior surface. It can be felt on the lateral
surface of the testes as smooth, discreet, and slightly irregular. The vas deferens can be palpated from the testes to the inguinal ring. Any testicular nodules should be referred for further evaluation to rule out malignancy. The adolescent male should be educated about testicular self-examination (TSE) along with a return demonstration. Although there is controversy among organizations regarding the effectiveness of routine TSE for testicular cancer screening, ${ }^{12} \_{ }^{15}$ the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine (SAHM) does recommend TSE as a way for adolescents to detect abnormalities that may lead to testicular cancer or infertility. ${ }^{16}$

For young adolescent males with SMR or Tanner stage 3 and above, another essential part of the genitourinary exam is the inguinal hernia exam. This is a routine part of the preparticipation sports physical assessment. To examine the inguinal ring, invaginate the skin from the scrotal sac with index finger and advance into the slitlike opening of the inguinal ring (Fig. 16.11). Ask him to bear down or cough so any protrusion/masses may be noted. If an inguinal mass is noted, auscultation may occasionally be used to ascertain whether bowel sounds are present, although this technique has been replaced by using ultrasound in most instances.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 16.11 Examination for inguinal hernia.}

\section*{Rectal examination}

Rectal examination in the infant and young child is indicated to assess tone, constipation, rectal bleeding, fissures, hemorrhoids or other gastrointestinal concerns, and history of sexual abuse when indicated. The rectal examination may include an external inspection, and/or a digital rectal exam. It is performed in a young child in a supine position with the legs flexed. Inspect the anal area for location of the anus, fissures, rectal tears, hemorrhoids, any lesions, or inflammation and placement. A discoloration around the anus may indicate heavy metal toxins. Note any sacral sinus, tufts of hair, or dimpling on the buttock. Use the index finger, or the fifth digit for an infant, gloved and lubricated with a small amount of gel. Press the pad of the finger against the anus. The anal sphincter should relax (this is called the anal wink) and allow the small digit
to slip into the anal canal. Digital exploration of the rectal vault requires a gentle approach. During digital exam assess tone, presence and characteristics of stool, feel for polyp, sweep finger all around anal canal. On any stool obtained on exam test for blood using office fecal occult blood testing materials. False positive occult blood test result may be related to trauma during the exam. The digital rectal exam is not performed routinely unless symptoms or history warrants the examination.

In the adolescent male, digital manipulation is performed with the adolescent positioned on his left side with knees flexed or standing with hips flexed and upper body supported with hands on the examining table. The index finger, gloved and lubricated, is used for the exam, as previously described. Rotate the finger and palpate the anterior rectal wall to feel the prostate gland, which in the adolescent and young adult male should be firm and smooth and measure about 2 to 3 cm (Fig. 16.12). The rectal exam in the adolescent requires careful explanation of the purpose of the exam beforehand to avoid inflicting physical or psychological trauma.

\caption{FIGURE 16.12 Rectal examination technique in adolescent.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Circumcision}

Circumcision is the excision of the foreskin. In the newborn, the procedure is a matter of parental choice in consultation with the health care provider, taking into consideration the cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions along with medical factors. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) formed a multidisciplinary task force that concluded the health benefits of newborn circumcision "outweigh the risks of the procedure," and thus families should have access to circumcision should they choose to have it done. ${ }^{17}$ Benefits of circumcision may include the decrease in risk of urinary tract infections, which is most beneficial in high-risk males, as well as potential decrease in risk of transmission of some
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, and development of penile carcinoma. ${ }^{17}$ However, evidence is lacking for recommendation of routine newborn circumcision for all males. ${ }^{17}$ Parents should be given accurate and unbiased information and be provided opportunity to discuss and make the decision regarding circumcision. Newborns who are circumcised require procedural analgesia for pain control, and the risks of analgesia should be reviewed with parents.

\section*{Sexual abuse}

A complete physical examination, including thorough evaluation of the genitourinary system, is warranted with any indication or revelation of sexual misconduct on history taken either from parent or child or adolescent. Although in $95 \%$ of sexual assault cases there is no apparent visible physical evidence, children and adolescents who are known or suspected victims of sexual assault require careful evaluation for any evidence that may be present. ${ }^{18}$ The history must be obtained in a safe and private environment, while using open-ended and nonleading, developmentally appropriate questions. Examination of the oral cavity as well as the genitals and anus requires careful inspection. Penis and scrotum should be evaluated for bruising or signs of external trauma, redness, swelling, or discharge. The anus and rectum should be inspected for hemorrhoids, warts, rectal dilatation, rectal fissures, or fistulas that would indicate trauma incurred as a result of intercourse. A digital exam should be performed with a gloved, lubricated finger to evaluate the sphincter tone and the rectal vault. For a complete explanation of findings to the child or adolescent and family, referral to Child Protective Services (CPS), consultation with child abuse experts, referral to additional resources, and follow-up are indicated.

\section*{Disorder of sexual differentiation}

The first step in diagnosing the infant or child with disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD), including those with disorder of chromosomal sex, disorders of gonadal sex, or disorder of phenotypic sex including ambiguous genitalia, starts with obtaining
a detailed history. Family history of previous spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or any neonatal death of a male sibling that could be related should be noted; family history of excess androgen and congenital adrenal hyperplasia or an autosomal recessive genotype should also be carefully reviewed. Afterwards, a careful inspection of any dysmorphic features and examination of the abdominal and genital area is performed. The key finding of the genital exam is the presence or absence of gonadal or testicular tissue palpable in the scrotum, labioscrotal folds, or inguinal canal (Fig. 16.13). ${ }^{19}$ Palpable gonads lead to the high probability that the infant is an XY male, because ovaries do not descend. Document size of penis, location of meatus, and any hyperpigmentation of the labioscrotal folds. For newborn males with bilaterally impalpable testes yet phenotypically appear to be male with formed phallus, an immediate consult to pediatric urology and pediatric endocrinology is warranted to determine a possible diagnosis of DSD.

Research continues to define new and multigenetic factors involved in the development of DSD, but there is still insufficient information to develop practice guidelines. ${ }^{20}$ Acute conditions
warrant immediate management. Genetic karyotyping and additional laboratory tests are required to make a sex determination, and immediate referral to a multidisciplinary team, including neonatologist, pediatrician/pediatric nurse practitioner, pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric urologist, geneticist, psychologist, social worker, and ethicist, is indicated. ${ }^{21}$

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Acute onset of scrotal pain is presumed to be testicular torsion until proven otherwise and is a true urologic emergency. Ischemia longer than 8 hours will attribute to testicular atrophy; thus, the best course of action is to restore testicular blood flow through manual detorsion (temporary relief) or surgical exploration. ${ }^{22,23}$

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Routine examination of the genitourinary system is expected at all routine well visits. It is an opportunity to discuss ageappropriate normal growth and development, provide anticipatory guidance, and identify any abnormality or pathology early in development. Be familiar with the wide variations of "normal."
- Be mindful and respectful of cultural variations in discussion of the genitourinary development and examination. Ask permission to discuss and examine.
- Prepare the child/adolescent by discussing what the exam will entail and provide proper draping as appropriate; be mindful of exposing child/adolescent longer than necessary. Talk through the exam and provide reassurance of normal development.
- Adolescents will be given the opportunity to have the exam performed without parents in the room, and informed consent/confidentiality policy will be discussed.
- Obtain a thorough history including gestational history, birth history, family history, and voiding/elimination history (see Information Gathering table).
- Assess penis and note foreskin status, penile size, curvature, and meatal location.
- Physiologic phimosis is expected until about 6 years of age. Avoid forceful retraction of foreskin. Discuss care of the uncircumcised penis with the family. Refer to pediatric urology if pathologic phimosis is unresponsive to steroid ointment trial.
- Assess scrotum and testes at every routine well visit. Determine if palpable testes are descended, retractile, undescended, ascending, or ectopic. Assess testicular size, shape, and consistency and note the presence of any masses or pain. Refer to pediatric urology if testes are undescended by 9 months of age or impalpable at any age.
- Perform a detailed scrotal and testicular examination for any scrotal mass or pain.
- Evaluate rectum, anus, and lumbar sacral region for dimples, clefts, or tufts of hair.
- Report and follow up on any suspicion of sexual abuse from history or physical exam.

Male and female breast

Male and female breast development is similar until puberty; therefore the examination of both boys and girls will be reviewed in this chapter, along with pubertal changes expected for both genders. The primary intention of the breast exam in children and adolescents is to recognize normal variants, monitor development, and identify nonmalignant pathology. Making assessment of the breast part of the routine physical examination in preadolescents gives the parent or caregiver and child an opportunity to voice any concerns and fosters a dialogue about reproductive health and puberty. It is important to respect privacy in performing the examination of the breast in all children and adolescents. Current evidence and recommendations related to the efficacy of breast examination focus on the detection of breast cancer, which is an exceedingly rare diagnosis in adolescents; therefore, child and adolescent breast exam recommendations are based on expert practice rather than evidence. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Embryologic development}

A mammary ridge forms from the ectodermal layer on day 20 of embryonic life and extends from the forelimb to the hind limb. In the sixth week of fetal life the nipple and areola form over a bud of breast tissue that is composed of the primary mammary ducts and a loose fibrous tissue or stroma. Fifteen to twenty-five secondary buds then develop and bifurcate into tubules, forming the basis of the duct system. ${ }^{2}$ Each duct, as it develops, opens separately into the nipple.

\section*{Physiologic variations}

At birth, the breasts of both male and female infants may be swollen because of the maternal estrogen effect (Fig. 17.1). An unusual but normal finding in the newborn is the secretion of a milklike substance, also known as "witch's milk," for 1 to 2 weeks (Fig. 17.2). ${ }^{3}$ Male and female breast tissue is similar until puberty. Occasionally, a prepubertal male or female develops an enlargement of one or both breasts, which involves a soft, mobile, subareolar nodule of uniform consistency. ${ }^{2}$ In general, the nipple and areola are not developed or pigmented with such an
condition usually regresses spontaneously within weeks to months, and in the absence of other secondary sexual characteristics, a biopsy is not indicated. ${ }^{2}$ If other signs of puberty appear, then these changes could be the first sign of precocious puberty, in which case referral and further diagnostic work-up are indicated.

Supernumerary nipples may arise from the mammary ridge and be present at birth (Fig. 17.3A). They are often raised, generally require no treatment, and become imperceptible over time. There is a weak association between supernumerary nipples and renal and cardiovascular abnormalities in white newborns. ${ }^{3}$ In females, supernumerary nipples will on rare occasion develop a small amount of breast tissue during puberty (see polymastia in Table 17.2; see Fig. 17.3B). The adolescent may elect to have cosmetic surgery for removal of the supernumerary breast tissue. Widespread nipples are defined as a nipple spread of greater than $25 \%$ of the chest circumference and may be associated with congenital disorders such as Turner syndrome. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Physiologic variations in the male breast}

At puberty the ductal and periductal mesenchymal breast tissue of boys proliferates under the influence of estrogens, with later involution as testicular androgens rise to adult levels. ${ }^{2}$ Male estradiol levels triple during puberty, and androgens ultimately increase 30 times. Until recently, it was believed that peak estrogen levels occurring prior to peak androgen levels resulted in physiologic gynecomastia, a benign increase in glandular and stromal breast tissue in pubertal males (Fig. 17.4). However, the current understanding identifies leptin, a hormone made by adipose cells to regulate energy balance, as the hormone most likely responsible for pubertal gynecomastia. ${ }^{2}$ Most circulating estrogens are produced outside of the testes, and an increase in fatty tissue, as in obesity, may lead to a higher incidence of gynecomastia (Box 17.1).

At 14 years of age, up to $64 \%$ of adolescent males have some degree of gynecomastia, with only $4 \%$ of adolescent males having severe gynecomastia that persists into adulthood. ${ }^{2}$ Approximately $50 \%$ of males experience the onset of gynecomastia at sexual
maturity rating (SMR) stage 2 of male genital development, another $20 \%$ at SMR stage 1, $20 \%$ at SMR stage 3 of male genital development, and $10 \%$ beginning at SMR stage 4 (see Chapter 16). Recent research shows an association between pubertal height velocity and the development of benign pubertal gynecomastia in a cohort of boys with delays in development, suggesting a causal relationship between acceleration of growth and development of gynecomastia in peripubertal males. ${ }^{4}$ In general, adolescent males can be reassured that most cases of physiologic gynecomastia will resolve spontaneously within 12 to 18 months, although it can rarely persist after sexual maturity. ${ }^{3}$ Treatment alternatives for persistent gynecomastia, including pharmacologic and surgical options, may be appropriate to discuss with youth and families when this condition does not resolve or is particularly distressing.

Gynecomastia, although a normal variant, is also present in relation to hormone imbalances due to thyrotoxicosis, cirrhosis, adrenal and testicular neoplasm, primary hypogonadism, chromosome abnormalities such as Klinefelter syndrome, and severe malnutrition. ${ }^{2}$ In addition, prescription drugs such as ranitidine, omeprazole, ketoconazole, metronidazole, antiretrovirals, digoxin, spironolactone, phenothiazines, and some illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana, anabolic steroids, amphetamines, and alcohol) can cause gynecomastia. ${ }^{3}$

Breast development, an initial sign of secondary sexual development in males and females, is readily apparent to family members and peers, often eliciting unwanted comments as to presence or absence and size of breast tissue. Breast development is a common issue for teasing, bullying, and sexual harassment in middle school. The health care provider should be mindful that sexual harassment is a major issue for teens, often jeopardizing a teen's mental health and school performance. If the preteen or young adolescent seems particularly concerned or uncomfortable with the health history about breast development or the breast examination, gentle exploration of the issue by the provider, including queries as to teasing or bullying, or unwanted attention from family members, should be explored, and the adolescent should be referred for counseling if indicated.

\section*{Physiologic variations in the female breast}

Thelarche, or the beginning of female breast development, is usually the first sign of puberty in girls and occurs between 8 and 13 years of age, on average at the age of 11.2 years (Table 17.1 and Fig. 17.5). ${ }^{1}$ Full breast development at SMR 5 signals the end of puberty in females. Breast development during puberty involves both multiple hormones and the binding of hormones to breast tissue. Estrogen, especially estradiol, influences ductal development, whereas progesterone influences additional lobular alveolar development. ${ }^{2}$ Thyroxine and corticosteroids are also involved.

\end{figure}

Up to $90 \%$ of newborns of both sexes commonly have a palpable nodule under the nipple and areola, which is thought to be related to exposure to estrogens through the placenta, and which generally regresses within 6 to 12 months. ${ }^{2}$ Premature thelarche is defined as breast development without other signs of puberty, occurring before 7.5 years. Although isolated premature thelarche is usually benign and self-limited, the examiner should be sure to evaluate for other signs of precocious puberty. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion on endocrine-disrupting chemicals.) ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

Mature female breast tissue at SMR stage 5 extends from the second or third rib to the sixth or seventh rib, and from the sternal margin to the midaxillary area with the nipple located centrally, surrounded by the areola. The breast is composed of glandular and fibrous tissue and subcutaneous and retromammary fat (Fig. 17.6). Fifteen to twenty lobes radiate around the nipple, and each lobe is divided into 20 to 40 lobules of milk-producing acini cells that empty into lactiferous ducts. ${ }^{2}$ These cells are small and inconspicuous in the nonpregnant, nonlactating woman. A layer of subcutaneous fibrous tissue provides support for the breast, as do the suspensory ligaments. The muscles forming the floor of the breast are pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, external oblique, and rectus abdominis. Vascular supply comes from the internal mammary artery and the lateral thoracic artery. The lymph system drains to the anterior axillary, subscapular, and supraclavicular nodes.

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, ethnic, and other considerations}

Cross-sectional studies in the past 20 years have found variations in
the onset of puberty by race, ethnicity, and weight. A recent longitudinal study of breast development in more than 1200 girls (childhood to early adolescent) has confirmed these observations, finding variation in thelarche by both race/ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). ${ }^{5}$ Biro et al. found that thelarche, as defined by the age at which girls reach SMR stage 2 of breast development, occurs at an average age of 8.8 years in African American girls, 9.3 years in Hispanic girls, and 9.7 years in non-Hispanic white and Asian girls. ${ }^{5}$ Development was also influenced significantly by BMI, with girls above the 50th percentile reaching SMR 2 at an earlier age. Regardless of race/ethnicity, a BMI at or above the 85th percentile was associated with earlier breast development in all groups and was found to be the strongest predictor of earlier age of thelarche.

\section*{System-specific history}

The Information Gathering table reviews the important information to be gathered for male and female breast assessment at key developmental stages, and for adolescent females presenting with breast symptoms or concerns.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Inspection and palpation}

\section*{Prepubertal breast}

Prepubertal breasts are easily inspected and palpated while examining the chest to assess cardiovascular and respiratory status. The health care provider should note any masses or pain, nipple discharge, or signs of premature thelarche, or breast development.

\section*{Adolescent male}

Pubertal breasts are inspected with the male adolescent supine with his hands behind his head. Place the pads of the three middle fingers at the margins of the breast. Palpate the breast bilaterally for the presence of adipose tissue or breast buds if evaluating for gynecomastia. Note any nodular tissue or firm rubbery masses. In conditions such as a lipoma or dermoid cyst, the mass is usually noted to one side of the areola.

\section*{Adolescent female}

There is controversy about the age at which health care providers should perform routine breast exams in women, or whether they should be performed as part of a preventative visit at all. The American Cancer Society (ACS) does not recommend the clinical breast examination (CBE) for women of average risk at any age. ${ }^{6}$ The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) are under review but currently recommend including CBE as part of a routine physical exam every 1 to 3 years for women age 20 to 39 years and annually after age 40 years. ${ }^{7}$ The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated recommendations for mammography and retained the recommendation of the CBE to begin at 40 years of age. ${ }^{8}$

Although malignancies in adolescents are rare and more often due to metastatic disease than to a primary breast malignancy, adolescents and young adults do present with breast concerns that must be addressed. Discussion about breast development in early to middle female adolescents provides an opportunity for reassurance and education about normal breast findings and variations of normal. Most adolescent breast complaints are related to normal developmental changes and can be evaluated through obtaining an adequate history and physical exam. When imaging is indicated, ultrasound is the primary modality because adolescent breast tissue
tends to be too dense for mammography.

> Red Flag in Breast Assessment
> Concerns requiring a CBE with or without imaging include complaints of breast masses, breast pain, and/or nipple discharge.

For adolescents with a family history consistent with hereditary breast cancer, CBE paired with screening ultrasound beginning at 25 years old is recommended. Screening mammography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women beginning at 30 to 35 years of age depending on the earliest onset of known breast cancer in the family. ${ }^{9}$ Young women with a history of irradiation to the chest (e.g., treatment of Hodgkin disease) have a breast cancer risk comparable to those with hereditary breast cancer risk. For these young women, annual mammography with MRI is recommended starting at 25 years of age or 8 to 10 years after completion of radiation therapy. ${ }^{10}$ Some authors recommend performing and teaching about breast self-exam (BSE) as a way of increasing young women's investment in their own health care, ${ }^{3}$ and experienced adolescent providers believe there is a value in teaching adolescents about the texture of glandular breast tissue and normal findings around and under breast tissue, such as ribs and ligaments, which may increase comfort with their own developing bodies. However, there is limited evidence about the best time in adolescent or young adult development to teach breast self-awareness.

\section*{Clinical breast examination}

In a full adolescent or young adult breast exam, the breasts are initially inspected with the patient sitting, disrobed to the waist, in the following positions: arms extended overhead, hands pressed against hips or against each other, and leaning forward from the waist (Fig. 17.7). These three positions are most helpful if examining for a lump or mass. ${ }^{3}$ The provider will have to weigh the benefits of full breast inspection in young adult women who are at low risk for breast cancer against the aversion most teens or young adults have
to being undressed in front of a provider.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 17.7 Inspection of the breast. (A) Arms extended overhead. (B) Hands pressed together.}
\end{figure}

Although the breasts can be palpated sitting and supine, the preferred position for the adolescent is supine, with one arm under her head. With the adolescent supine, the breasts are in a more stable position, and touching of the breast with the nondominant hand of the examiner can be minimized. For purposes of examination, the breast is divided into four quadrants and a tail that extends into the axilla (Fig. 17.8).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-514.jpg?height=992&width=664&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=693}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 17.8 Quadrants of the left breast, tail of Spence.}
\end{figure}

The breasts should be palpated with the pads (not tips) of the middle three fingers with the fingers palpating over the breast tissue from the sternal margin to the midaxillary area and from the second or third rib to the sixth or seventh rib at the base of the breast. Palpation proceeds stepwise with the fingers to ensure a thorough assessment of the breast tissue. The preferred methods for palpation of the breast are illustrated in Fig. 17.9. The examiner should include palpation of the tail of Spence in the axilla in addition to the supraclavicular and infraclavicular regions. When palpating the breast, the examiner should use the dominant hand and stabilize the breast, if necessary, with the nondominant hand. Place the pads of the middle fingers at the margins of the breast to begin palpation, and note any masses, pain, nipple discharge, or signs of premature breast development. If firm, rubbery tissue or a nodular mass is noted, fine palpation is required for accurate sizing and to distinguish among fatty tissue, cysts, and other nodular masses.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 17.9 Methods of breast palpation. (A) Palpation strip method. (B) Palpation wedge method. (C) Palpation circle method.}
\end{figure}

It is important to incorporate patient education into the breast examination for the young female adult. During the examination, ask permission to guide the adolescent's hand onto her breast, pointing out landmarks and normal findings in the developing breast, such as the thicker ridge of breast tissue often found in the inferior aspect of the breast and the nodularity of normal adolescent breast tissue especially in the upper outer quadrant. Have the adolescent also feel the ribs underneath the medial border of the breast because this normal finding is often mistaken by adolescents for a breast lump.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Asymmetrical breasts are common early in pubertal development in both adolescent males and females (Fig. 17.10).

\section*{Breast self-awareness}

Teaching BSE has become replaced by the concept of teaching breast self-awareness. ${ }^{7}$ Breast self-awareness may assist the adolescent in accepting her body, increase comfort with the breast examination, and provide an opportunity to reinforce or correct information the adolescent may have received from health classes, teen magazines, or female relatives about breast health. However, the USPSTF recommends against teaching BSE for adolescents or women of any age. ${ }^{11}$ Both the ACS and ACOG recommend teaching breast self-awareness to women age 20 years and older. ${ }^{7,12}$ This includes assisting women to become familiar with their breasts' normal feel and appearance, focusing on the importance of selfdetection and early assessment of symptoms. As noted previously in the section on clinical breast exams, there is currently no consensus or evidence-based recommendation on teaching such awareness to younger adolescents.

\section*{Breast conditions}

The following are variations of normal that occur with stages of breast development:
- Physiologic swelling and tenderness: Breast lobules undergo proliferative changes due to the normal menstrual cycle, leading to pain and discomfort, swelling, and distinct masses that recede after menses.
- Asymmetry: In most women, one breast is slightly larger than the other, and this difference may be accentuated by asymmetrical breast development during puberty, which usually corrects by adulthood.
- Proliferative breast changes: Formerly called fibrocystic disease, many authorities now consider increased nodularity to be a variation of normal, occurring in more than $50 \%$ of women of reproductive age. Adolescents often have painless lumps, which may become tender 1 week before menses. Areas of nodularity may be a few millimeters to 1 cm in diameter.
- Cysts: Usually associated with few symptoms, cysts are well circumscribed, small, and freely movable masses, commonly less than 1 cm in adolescents.
- Montgomery tubercles: These tubercles arise from sebaceous glands associated with a lactiferous duct. They present as small, soft papules around the areola, with occasional thin, clear to brown discharge and possibly a small lump under the areola. The condition usually resolves without intervention.
Breast cancer in adolescents is extremely rare. Malignant lesions comprise only $0.9 \%$ of all surgically excised lesions in the adolescent and young adult age group. Breast variations and benign tumors are presented in Table 17.2.

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Prepubertal breast examination in both male and female children is focused on the identification of normal variants and nonmalignant pathology and monitoring development.
- Focus on the developing breast may be embarrassing and uncomfortable for pubertal children and early adolescents.
- Pubertal gynecomastia is common in approximately $50 \%$ of
developing male adolescents and may be a source of concern for youths and families.
- Thelarche is the first sign of puberty in developing female adolescents.
- Breast development is often a common issue for teasing, bullying, and sexual harassment in middle school.
- There is insufficient evidence to formulate recommendations for BSE and CBE in adolescents and young adults.
- Young adult females may benefit from patient teaching on breast self-awareness, which includes the normal feel and appearance of the breasts, focusing on the importance of self-detection, and early assessment of symptoms.

\section*{Female genitalia}

\section*{Erica Bisgyer Monasterio, Naomi A. Schapiro}

The female genital examination is a recommended yet an underperformed part of the routine physical for pediatric and adolescent girls. Routine performance of the female genital exam allows the health care provider to build skills and familiarity with normal variants in the genitourinary system and establish a baseline from which to monitor individual development and provide information and reassurance to children, youth, and parents or caregivers. However, many health care providers are underprepared to recognize normal genital findings in the prepubescent girl and are unfamiliar with common variations. ${ }^{1}$

With knowledge of normal development of the female reproductive anatomy, the health care provider can incorporate the routine examination of the genitalia into well-child care. The review of systems and genital exam offer an opportunity to foster a dialogue between parent and child concerning reproductive health. For religious and cultural reasons or personal preference, parents, children, and adolescents may be more likely to request female providers for the breast and female genital exam. In nonemergent situations, it is important to honor this request, either within the practice setting or by referral, and to respect privacy and confidentiality in performing the examination and discussing findings.

\section*{Embryologic development}

At 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, fetal gonads are bipotential, capable of differentiating into either a testis or an ovary. Both male and female embryos have one pair of primary sex organs, or gonads, and two pairs of ducts, wolffian ducts and mÃ¼llerian ducts. During the sixth week the primordial germ cells migrate into the primary sex cords and begin to differentiate. Leydig and Sertoli cells appear in male embryos, producing testosterone and anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone. In female embryos the gonads do not produce testosterone, and the gonads develop into ovaries. The wolffian ducts deteriorate, and the mÃ¼llerian ducts develop into the uterus, upper vaginal tract, and fallopian tubes. The external genitalia differentiate at between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation (Fig. 18.1). Active mitosis continues and thousands of germ cells, oocytes, are produced. A newborn female may have 2 million primary oocytes at birth. However, after birth, no further oogonia occurs. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Developmental and physiologic variations}

In preterm neonates the labia majora may not cover the labia minora, and the clitoris will be prominent. Term newborns will have enlarged labia majora, which usually cover other external structures, a relatively large clitoris, and labia minora with dull pink epithelium, because of maternal estrogen effects (Fig. 18.2). A creamy white or slightly blood-tinged discharge is normal for up to 10 days after birth. The hymen is relatively thicker, pink-white, and redundant and may remain so up until 2 to 4 years of age (Fig. 18.3). ${ }^{3}$

Disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD) have their genesis in early fetal development and result from developmental variations in one or more of the three components of sex determination and differentiation: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, and/or phenotypic sex. Manifestations of some types of DSD are evident at birth in the newborn with ambiguous genitalia, and infants with ambiguous genitalia should be referred in the neonatal period to a tertiary center with a comprehensive multidisciplinary team with an ethicist. ${ }^{4}$ Other types of DSD may become evident only in early adolescence with variations in secondary sexual development (see Chapter 16 for further discussion).

In the absence of congenital anomalies, all female infants are born with a hymen, which can present in a variety of configurations. Commonly, the hymen is fimbriated, annular, or crescentic (Fig. 18.4). Annular hymens are more common at birth, whereas crescentic hymens are more common in girls older than 3 years. Fig. 18.5 illustrates hymen types that are rare-septate, cribriform, and imperforate. Table 18.1 presents congenital anomalies in development of the female genitalia.

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

After the newborn period and before menarche, the clitoris is approximately 3 mm in length and 3 mm in transverse diameter. The effects of estrogen can be seen in infants, with pinker and more redundant, or wavy hymens. In prepubertal preschool- and schoolage girls, hymens are thinner, redder and more sensitive to touch. The prepubertal vagina is rigid, nonelastic, and thin-walled, lined by columnar epithelium, which normally appears redder than the squamous epithelium lining the vagina of pubertal adolescents and adult women. During early puberty, the effects of increased circulating estrogens are seen on the vulva, including the hymen, as labia minora develop more fully and the hymen becomes thicker, pinker and more redundant. ${ }^{3}$ Table 18.2 presents pubertal changes of the vagina.

SMR, Sexual maturity rating.
Adrenarche, the development of pubic and axillary hair, occurs at approximately the same time as thelarche, the development of the breast. The mean age of adrenarche in girls is 9 to 10 years of age but may occur as early as 7 to 8 years of age, particularly in African American girls (Fig. 18.6). Table 18.3 correlates development and sexual maturity rating (SMR), which includes breast development and pubic hair distribution in girls. The external genitalia and internal structures-labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vagina, ovaries, uterus-are developing under the influence of increasing estrogens, but they are not included as part of the SMR.

SMR, Sexual maturity rating.

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, ethnic, and other considerations}

Development and amount of pubic and general body hair varies greatly with race/ethnicity. Young women of Asian or indigenous descent tend to have less body hair than young women of European or African descent, and pubic hair development may not correlate well with sexual maturity. Many young women remove pubic hair through shaving or waxing, which may make the determination of SMR based on pubic hair distribution challenging. Genital piercings are also an increasingly common practice among adolescents.

Female circumcision, or female genital mutilation, is prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in some African and Middle Eastern countries, and is considered a rite of passage and a prerequisite for marriage in some cultures. The procedure is not legal in the United States or Canada, but immigrant girls and adolescents may have had the procedure performed before migration or during a visit back to their country of origin. ${ }^{5,6}$ It is estimated that as many as 513,000 women in the United States may have had this procedure performed. ${ }^{6}$ Complications include infection, hemorrhage, tetanus, difficulty in urination, sexual dysfunction, childbirth complications, and infertility. ${ }^{7}$ There is evidence the acceptability of female genital mutilation is decreasing in some countries and with immigrant populations in the United States; however, second-generation girls and adolescents may be at risk. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Examination of the newborn}

\section*{Inspection and palpation}

In the newborn, assess presence and size of the clitoris, patency of the vaginal orifice, presence and location of urethra, and distance between the posterior fourchette and the anus. The labia majora should be palpated for the presence of gonads or hernias, even in a normal-appearing female. Any palpable gonads are likely to be testes because ovaries rarely descend below the inguinal ring. Reassurance of a normal vaginal examination or prompt communication of any abnormal or concerning physical findings is an important part of building a trust relationship between the parent or caregiver and pediatric health care provider.

\section*{Examination of prepubertal girls}

\section*{Positioning}

Most young children can be examined in the frog-leg position: supine, with knees apart and feet touching in the midline (Fig. 18.7). For an apprehensive young child, the parent or caretaker can sit in a chair or on the examination table in a semireclined position (feet in or out of stirrups) with the child's legs straddling her thighs. Older children can be placed in adjustable stirrups. In cases of suspected trauma or abuse, a foreign body in the vagina, or other suspected structural abnormalities, knee-chest position can be used in a child older than 2 years of age (Fig. 18.8). Have the child rest her chest on the exam table and support her weight on bent knees, which are positioned 6 to 8 inches apart. Her buttocks will be held up in the air, and her back and abdomen will fall downward. In this position, using a penlight or an otoscope head for magnification and light, the examiner can visualize the lower vagina, and in prepubertal girls often the upper vagina. Lateral separation of the labia will be required to visualize the hymen (Fig. 18.9).

Touching the hymen in prepubertal girls causes pain. Discharge for wet mounts, potassium hydroxide (KOH) exams, Gram stains, or culture should be collected with a small Dacron-tipped swab moistened with saline. The child can be asked to take a deep breath for distraction and to open the hymen. If the examiner avoids touching the hymen, this procedure can be painless. Rarely, in cases of suspected abnormalities, a rectoabdominal examination may be performed following inspection of the vaginal area by placing the gloved and lubricated index finger or little finger of one hand into the rectum and placing the other hand on the abdomen. The cervix and uterus may be felt as a "button," and ovaries are not palpable. As the examiner withdraws the finger, the vagina can be gently milked to elicit discharge, a foreign body, or in rare cases, a polypoid tumor.

Young preschool girls are curious about their bodies and often explore the vaginal area. It is not uncommon for young girls to insert foreign objects - crayons, beads, coins, batteries, small parts of toys, and other small objects-into their vagina. It is also common for toilet tissue to ball up and enter the vagina. Children with developmental delay who are diapered may have stool pushed into the vaginal vault. Foreign bodies can remain in the vagina for an extended period and cause inflammation and vaginal discharge, often foul smelling, or bleeding. A foreign body should always be considered when a young preschool girl presents with vaginal or urinary symptoms. If the examiner sees a foreign body, it
may be removed by using a moistened cotton swab or by gently irrigating the vagina with normal saline, or consider referral for removal under anesthesia.

There is no indication for a speculum exam in the prepubertal child. Any invasive exams or procedures should be performed under anesthesia by a pediatric gynecologic specialist.

\section*{Examination of the adolescent}

There are currently few indications for a pelvic exam in an adolescent. Regardless of history of sexual activity, only the symptomatic young woman may be a potential candidate for a pelvic exam until age 21 when a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is indicated. ${ }^{8}$ Many examiners will consider an initial evaluation of vaginal complaints in adolescents with careful inspection of the external genitalia and specimen collection of vaginal discharge from the introitus and a vaginal swab for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing if the patient reports sexual activity. The vaginal specimen can be obtained through the patient obtaining a self-swab or can be collected by the examiner. This preliminary process can be followed by a full pelvic exam if indicated. The presence of trichomonas, a vaginal STI, on wet mount indicates the need for a full pelvic exam. In the case of primary amenorrhea or absence of the onset of menstrual periods, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge or lower abdominal pain, a pelvic exam and/or ultrasound imaging may be appropriate. ${ }^{9}$

Table 18.4 reviews current indications for pelvic exams and alternatives to the recommended exam for adolescents who refuse or are unable to tolerate the pelvic examination.

The following description of the pelvic examination should be considered a supplement to careful supervision and mentoring of the novice examiner by the more experienced health care provider. Proper clean technique is more easily demonstrated, and specific procedures for collecting specimens for the Pap smear and testing of STIs vary among clinics and laboratories.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Cervical cancer screening (Pap smear) should not begin until age 21 years, regardless of age of onset of sexual activity in immunocompetent young women. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Preparing for the exam}

Explain the pelvic exam carefully, using a plastic pelvic model, diagram, or internet module and video (see http://www.sexualityandu.ca/sexual-health/going-to-doctor/first-pelvic-exam) that enables the adolescent to gain a concrete understanding of the examination process. It is useful to show the adolescent the speculum and specimen collection implements in advance to dispel any anxiety or fear of the unknown. Clearly define for the patient whether the exam must be completed with some urgency (e.g., to rule out pelvic inflammatory disease) or can be performed when the youth feels prepared (e.g., as part of an evaluation of primary amenorrhea) and has brought her support person of choice to accompany her. Some examiners provide the adolescent with a mirror, if desired, to observe the examination in progress. The adolescent should be encouraged to empty her bladder before the exam. If any specimens are needed, such as for urine pregnancy test, urinalysis, or urine for STI screening tests, they can be collected at this time. The adolescent should be informed that she can change her mind about the exam at any point, and the exam should never be forced or coerced. Some adolescents may want to have a parent, friend, or partner present for the pelvic examination to provide support. With sufficient preparation and explanations, most adolescents are able to tolerate the examination well. However, adolescents who have been
sexually abused, have suffered other trauma, or who are particularly anxious may be helped by specific visualization and relaxation techniques. ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Positioning}

Adjust stirrups appropriately for the leg length. The adolescent can leave socks on to make the stirrups more comfortable. Ask the youth to move her buttocks forward to the very edge of the exam table, while the feet are in the stirrups. Although many adolescents are uncomfortable with this position, it is necessary for proper visualization and manipulation of the speculum. Avoid touching or pulling the teen; encourage her to move on her own. Most adolescents prefer to have a sheet draped over their abdomen and thighs, but the drape should be positioned so that the examiner can maintain eye contact with the adolescent. The knees should be abducted as far as possible. To have the teen's active participation, encourage her to push her knees apart as if she were doing an exercise in stretching to avoid any references that could remind her of unwanted sexual activity. The adolescent should be encouraged to take slow, even breaths, to avoid tensing her abdominal muscles, and to keep her buttocks down on the exam table.

\section*{Inspection}

Note the condition of the clitoris, urethra, labia majora, labia minora, hymen, and introitus (Fig. 18.10). Inspect for swelling or lesions such as inflamed pubic hair follicles; condyloma, or venereal warts; any clitoral hypertrophy; presence or absence of estrogenization; and any inflammation or discharge. The external structures can be visualized more completely if the examiner gently separates the labia majora to note the vaginal structures and anal area.

\end{figure}

\section*{Palpation}

Palpation of the Skene glands and Bartholin glands is usually avoided in the adolescent, unless the adolescent presents with a complaint of pain or swelling in the labial or vaginal area or the examiner notes abnormalities upon inspection (Fig. 18.11).

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 18.11 Examination of the Skene and Bartholin glands.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Speculum exam}

\section*{Choosing the speculum}

The correct size speculum should be selected, and the speculum warmed, if possible, before insertion. Although many clinics use plastic specula (Fig. 18.12), the range of available sizes is limited and the option to use metal specula is more desirable if the capacity to clean and sterilize them is available.
- A Huffman (Huffman-Graves) speculum, ( $1 / 2 \times 41 / 2$ inches) should be used if the hymenal opening is small, as in virginal teens.
- A pediatric or child speculum (5/8-7/8 $\times 3$ inches) should not be used in the postpubertal adolescent because of the excessive width and inadequate length.
- A Pedersen speculum ( $7 / 8 \times 41 / 2$ inches) and rarely a Graves speculum ( $13 / 4 \times 33 / 4$ inches) are used for a sexually active teen.
- Light source: Some plastic specula have a built-in light source. Otherwise, angle the light over the examiner's shoulder to illuminate the introitus. Warn the patient the light may feel warm. If the lamp needs readjustment after speculum insertion, remember to change gloves before touching the neck of the light.
- Inserting the speculum: The examiner should develop an approach that works for him or her to maintain clean technique. Some examiners double glove, others change gloves after inspection of the external genitalia and insertion of the speculum. Using the fingers of one hand to separate the labia, one finger, lubricated with water or a scant amount of lubricating jelly, can be inserted into the introitus, pressing down on the posterior fourchette to facilitate easy insertion of the speculum. The examiner should use the other hand to gently insert the speculum, angled toward the sacrum, with slight downward pressure to avoid irritating the urethra. Be careful not to pinch the labia minora or to catch pubic hair in the speculum bills. Fig. 18.13 illustrates the steps of speculum insertion.
- Avoid putting pressure on the hymen in virginal teens.
- An alternate method of speculum insertion is to use the second and middle fingers to separate the labia, then press in gently on either side of the lower introitus to relax the fourchette tissues without direct pressure.
- Have the teen take in a deep breath or perform a Valsalva maneuver to help relax the introitus to insert the speculum.
- To locate the cervix, use a slight side-to-side motion; if the cervix does not come into view, it may cause less discomfort to withdraw the speculum and use one finger to locate the cervix rather than to move the speculum excessively.
- After the speculum is in place and the cervix is in view, secure the speculum in the open position, and remove the first glove on the hand that separated the labia (if double-gloved) or change the glove on the hand that contacted the labia/introitus; then proceed with specimen collection.

\section*{Inspection of the vagina and cervix}

Inspect the walls of the vagina, and note the presence, color, and consistency of any discharge. Carefully inspect the cervix for color, lesions, and any discharge at the cervical os. The cervical os, the opening of the cervix into the endometrial canal, is round in a nulliparous woman, but may be slitlike in a parous adolescent. Physiologic variations of the cervix include nabothian cysts, which are small, white or yellow, raised, round areas on the cervix; and an ectropion cervix, a visible ring of redder, glossy columnar epithelium protruding out and surrounding the os of the cervix. Table 18.5 presents abnormal findings of the female genitalia.

\begin{table}

All adnexal masses should be imaged, first with ultrasound, then (if needed) with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Specimen collection}

The recommended order of specimen collection is to start with the Pap smear then follow with the collection of specimens for STI screening. It may be reasonable to collect STI specimens first in some adolescents if there is a copious amount of discharge or purulent discharge from the cervical os, because the exudate needs to be removed before specimen collection for the Pap smear.
- Use a spatula and cytobrush for Pap smear collection. Follow laboratory instructions for either a conventional Pap smear or the newer liquid cytology, in which the cells are collected and placed in a liquid medium. Be sure to sample the squamocolumnar junction, which may be on the ectocervix, or external os, in some adolescents. In some young women with disabilities, collection of the Pap smear by means of a speculum exam may not be a viable option due to spasticity or other conditions that preclude a standard pelvic exam. The option to obtain a Pap smear using a "blind technique" (without using a speculum, palpate the cervical os using a finger then slide the cytobrush over the finger to obtain the endocervical sample) is an acceptable alternative to ensure appropriate and timely cancer screening. ${ }^{11}$
- Next collect vaginal swabs for chlamydia and gonorrhea-the preferred specimen source due to the highest sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), ${ }^{12}$ unless using urine for STI screening.
- Use a moistened cotton-tipped swab or plastic or wooden
spatula to collect some vaginal secretions for wet mount and KOH preparations from both the vaginal pool and the vaginal wall, unless there is significant blood present.
Make sure to release the locking mechanism of the speculum before withdrawal to avoid pinching the cervix when closing the speculum bills. Do not force the speculum bills closed because this may cause the cervix or vaginal walls to be pinched. Testing vaginal pH is a valuable adjunct to the wet mount and KOH prep exams, and vaginal discharge adhering to the speculum bills can be collected for pH testing before the speculum is discarded or placed in cleaning solution. Alternatively, a swab of vaginal secretions can be applied to a pH tape or strip.

\section*{The bimanual exam}

The purpose of the bimanual exam is to assess the cervix, the corpus of the uterus, and the adnexa. The adolescent should be encouraged to relax the abdominal muscles by breathing slowly and steadily, or performing a Valsalva maneuver, which may facilitate insertion of the examiner's fingers. The examiner applies lubricant to the fingers and then inserts the middle and index fingers of a gloved hand into the vagina, keeping the pressure against the posterior fourchette and the pubococcygeal muscle and away from the delicate anterior structures of the clitoris and urethra (Fig. 18.14). In virginal adolescents, it may be possible to insert only one finger. If the need for a bimanual exam is indicated, the examiner should consider the alternative option of a rectoabdominal exam for adolescents who request to avoid vaginal penetration for cultural or religious reasons.
- Palpate the cervix: Note consistency of the cervix, normally firm and shaped like the tip of a nose. Note presence of any bumps on the cervix, such as nabothian cysts, 3 - to $8-\mathrm{mm}$ smooth, nontender, firm lumps, which result from blockage of endocervical gland ducts.
- Palpate the uterus: Press down on the abdomen with the other hand while supporting the cervix. Assess the size, shape, consistency, mobility, and tenderness of the uterus and any palpable masses. The position of the uterus varies from anteverted, anteflexed, midposition, and retroverted to
retroflexed (Fig. 18.15). The normal uterus is shaped like an upside-down small pear and is approximately 7.5 cm long and 2.5 cm thick.
- Assess for cervical motion tenderness: The examiner wiggles the cervix side-to-side and forward and backward between the palpating fingers. In a normal exam the movement of the uterus creates an unusual sensation in the pelvis for an adolescent. Ask the adolescent to distinguish between pain and discomfort or an unusual feeling. Tenderness or pain on exam is a symptom of pelvic infection.
- Assess the adnexae and ovaries: Place the examining fingers in the vagina first at the right lateral fornix then at the left lateral fornix, posteriorly and high. Begin with the opposite hand on the abdomen just below and medial to the iliac crest and move diagonally toward the symphysis pubis. Apply a firm, steady sweeping motion with the hand on the abdomen as you palpate briefly. Normal ovaries are smooth and almond shaped, slightly tender to deep palpation, and approximately $3 \times 1.5 \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$. Tenderness or fullness of the adnexae is abnormal and may indicate infection, ectopic pregnancy, or endometriosis.
- Rectovaginal exams: This exam is usually omitted in adolescents, unless there is a suspicion of abnormality or an extremely retroflexed uterus, or the hymenal ring is too tight to adequately assess for the cervix and uterus. It is performed with the index finger in the vagina, the middle finger in the rectum, and the opposite hand on the abdomen. The rectovaginal septum should be thin, pliable, and free of masses. The teen should be reassured that although she may feel the urge to defecate, she will not.
- Sizing an intrauterine pregnancy: Recognizing a pregnancy in the adolescent can aid in the swift diagnosis of the cause of complaints ranging from fatigue and nausea to secondary amenorrhea, abdominal fullness, or a mass. The health care provider should maintain a high index of suspicion for pregnancy, even in the youngest adolescents who deny a history of sexual activity. Adolescents may be reluctant to disclose early or unwanted sexual activity. Point of care urine testing for $\beta$ hCG is invaluable. The weeks of pregnancy are counted from
the first day of the last menstrual period, even though ovulation generally occurs 2 weeks after the beginning of menses (Box 18.1). Fundal height provides a guide for estimating uterine size (Fig. 18.16).

\section*{Sizing an Intrauterine Pregnancy}

Nulliparous uterus: $7.5 \times 2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ (size of small lime on bimanual exam)
8-week uterus: 9-11 cm $\times 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ (size of orange on bimanual exam) 12-week uterus: $12-14 \mathrm{~cm} \times 7 \mathrm{~cm}$ (size of grapefruit, very soft, sometimes difficult to palpate on bimanual exam); just palpable, abdominally at level of symphysis pubis
16-week uterus: Palpate abdomen, felt halfway between symphysis pubis and umbilicus
20-week uterus: Palpate abdomen, felt at umbilicus

> More than 20 weeks: Measure from symphysis pubis to height of fundus (number of centimeters - approximate number of weeks)

\section*{Wrapping up the examination}

The adolescent should be handed some tissues, so she may wipe off the lubricant used. The examiner should stay in the room long enough to ensure that the adolescent does not feel dizzy upon sitting up and then leave while she dresses. Results of the exam should be given while the teen is dressed, and any abnormalities should be thoroughly explained. To ensure confidentiality, present and discuss results with the adolescent alone.

\section*{Suspicion of sexual abuse}

In cases of suspected child sexual abuse the history and behavioral observations are crucial. Any history of abuse disclosed to the health care provider that occurred within the previous 72 hours (up to 120 hours in some states) requires immediate referral for a forensic examination with possible collection of evidence. Guidelines recommend collection of DNA evidence within 24 hours for prepubertal children and 72 hours for adolescents; however, some regions using DNA amplification will collect DNA evidence over a longer time span, and providers should be familiar with local resources and recommendations. ${ }^{13}$ Most sexually abused prepubertal girls will have normal physical exams because of the following:
- Delays in disclosure
- Rapid healing of genital and anal tissue in prepubertal children
- Predominance in this age group of sexual abuse involving fondling or oral-genital contact, which does not leave physical signs
It is important to remember that the vast majority of children reporting sexual abuse will have a normal genital exam. ${ }^{1}$ The following physical findings in prepubertal girls should raise suspicion of sexual abuse and prompt referral for an exam by specially trained practitioners ${ }^{13}$ :
- Hymenal irregularities or absence of hymen, including notches,
transections, or thin, rounded edges, posterior from the 4- to 8o'clock position with the child supine; should be confirmed in knee-chest position, because an apparent notch may be a fold in a redundant hymen
- Acute trauma to the hymen or posterior fourchette, or laceration of vaginal mucosa, particularly extending to the rectal mucosa
- Confirmed STI, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a child $\geq 2$ years old
Other possible findings include increased erythema, irritation, and vaginal discharge, which may or may not be signs of sexual abuse. Failure or delay of fusion of the median raphe between the posterior fourchette and the anus is often mistaken for trauma or sexual abuse. However, it is essential for health care providers to keep in mind they should not solely rely on physical findings when considering a diagnosis of sexual abuse. The examiner should keep the possibility of sexual abuse in mind whenever other nonvenereal infections, chemical irritation, foreign bodies, and/or poor hygiene are included in the differential diagnosis.

\section*{Female genital conditions}

Table 18.6 presents common conditions and findings of the genitalia in the prepubertal and pubertal female. The prepubertal vagina is hostile to yeast, and vulvovaginal candidiasis is rare except in cases of diabetes mellitus, recent antibiotic usage, compromised immune system, or diaper use in infants or children with special health care needs. Sexually transmitted pathogens, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, infect the columnar epithelium of the vagina rather than the cervix in sexually active adolescents. Bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus and Shigella, can cause purulent or even bloody vaginal discharge in infected individuals.

\hline Vulvar irritation & Often results from irritants such as bubble bath, poor hygiene, candidal overgrowth caused by antibiotics or diaper occlusion; rarely scratching can occur secondary to pruritus from a pinworm infestation \\
\hline Vulvovaginitis & Vaginal discharge may be caused by bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus, Shigella) or overgrowth of normal flora; foreign body in vagina (typically toilet paper); poor hygiene; sexually transmitted infection (STI) \\
\hline Straddle injuries to vulva & Straddle injuries (as in playground falls) generally cause trauma to anterior vulvar structures and rarely cause trauma to posterior portion of hymen or posterior fourchette; in addition, injury is usually somewhat asymmetrical and not penetrating in nature \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Summary of examination}
- The genital exam in the child and asymptomatic adolescent includes an assessment of the external genitalia only.
- SMR in girls is based on breast development and pubic hair distribution.
- Secondary sexual development must be assessed in the context of overall growth and development.
- The norms for SMR are based on data collected on white children. Children of Asian or Native American descent may not have pubic hair development that matches SMR. Pubic hair development may not correlate well with sexual maturity.
- There are currently few indications for a pelvic exam in an adolescent.
- A pelvic exam is not necessary for recommended STI screening in asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents.
- Ninety-five percent of children reporting sexual abuse will have a normal genital exam.
- Variations in external genitalia may be due to congenital disorders or cultural practices, such as female circumcision.

\section*{Musculoskeletal assessment}

\author{

Assessing the musculoskeletal system is challenging for pediatric health care providers due to the variations in growth and development and the normal range of rotational changes in the extremities in children from birth to young adulthood. Increasing knowledge about the normal developmental changes in the musculoskeletal system is key to accurate assessment and limiting overreferral. Performing appropriate physical assessment techniques assists in diagnosis of common orthopedic conditions and prompt referral when indicated for children with intentional or unintentional injuries.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The rudimentary skeletal system forms as early as the fourth week of gestation, when the development of the vertebrae begins and the upper extremities begin as buds on the fetus. As early as the seventh week of gestation, embryonic vascular growth progresses toward the center of the osteoblasts in the long bone, which forms cartilage. During the ninth week of gestation, ossification, or bone growth, begins in the ossification centers in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae, and ossification continues in the femur. The hand pads develop from the extremity buds by days 33 to 36,
and the finger rays begin to form on days 41 to $43 .{ }^{1}$ It is during this period of gestation that polydactyly, the presence of extra digits, or syndactyly, the webbing or fusing of the digits, occurs along with other deformities of the extremities. The calcaneus, the largest tarsal bone of the foot, ossifies at the sixth month of fetal life. The position of the fetus in utero has the greatest impact on the skeletal system, and the most common variants present at birth.

Muscle structures, including the tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and joints, originate from the embryonic mesoderm. Muscle fibers are developed by the fourth or fifth month of gestation. They increase in size along with changes in muscle and fat proportions throughout childhood and adolescence.

\section*{Developmental variations}

At birth, the epiphyses of the long bones are composed of hyaline cartilage. Shortly after birth, the secondary ossification centers begin to replace the cartilage along the mat plate. During early periods of rapid growth, ossification occurs in secondary sites throughout the body: the ends of the long bones, the vertebrae, the flat bones in the clavicle, and the skull. The replacement of cartilage by bone is known as endochondral ossification. The epiphyseal plate ossifies, becoming the diaphysis, the shaft of the long bone; and cartilage at the metaphyseal plate replaces bone cells (Fig. 19.1).

\end{figure}

Bone growth continues in infants and children along the epiphysis as new bone is added to the outer surface of existing bone. Growth along the epiphyseal plate continues until the cells in the growth plate mature and stop dividing in puberty, and closure of the growth plate occurs in young adulthood when the metaphysis and the epiphysis fuse.

Several factors influence the healthy development of the skeletal system and normal growth at the epiphyseal plate. Trauma during childhood can cause separation of the epiphysis and the blood vessels to rupture, resulting in cessation of bone growth and a shortened extremity. ${ }^{1}$ Nutritional factors, such as adequate protein in the diet, the amount of calcium intake daily, and adequate intake of vitamin D, which regulates the adsorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines, impact bone growth. Adequate levels of vitamin D, particularly important in the breastfed infant, may also have a role in improving muscle and immune function in
childhood. Parents are advised to apply sunscreen and limit direct sun exposure for infants and children due to long-term risks of skin cancer, therefore reducing vitamin D synthesis from the skin. Balancing safe sun exposure and maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D in infants and children is important to maintaining bone strength. Rickets is a deficiency of vitamin D in which the growth plate is impaired by calcification of newly formed bone on the metaphyseal plate. Alterations in thyroid or growth hormones can also impact normal patterns of growth in childhood. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Head and neck}

Assessment of the head and neck area is reviewed in Chapter 10.

\section*{Upper extremities and torso}

The clavicle lies in a horizontal plane above the first rib and rotates between the sternum and the superior surface of the scapula (Fig. 19.2). The scapula, a large, flat triangular bone, lies posterior on the upper back and forms the posterior portion of the upper extremity, and the superior, lateral angle articulates with the rounded head or capsule of the humerus, the large bone in the upper arm. The distal end of the humerus forms the condyle and is divided into the medial epicondyle and the lateral epicondyle. The proximal end of the ulna attaches at the articulating surface of the humerus and forms one of two long bones in the forearm. The olecranon is the outer, rounded distal surface of the ulna and forms the major portion of the elbow. The distal end of the ulna is small and articulates with the wrist bones. The radius is along the lateral side or thumb side of the forearm, and the distal end of the radius forms a large portion of the wrist bones.

The hand consists of eight carpal and five metacarpal bones. Many of the carpal bones are cartilaginous at birth. A radiograph of a child's hand at 2.5 years of age illustrates ossification of only the capitate and hamate bones in the midhand. Development and ossification of the hand continues until 11 years of age, when all of the carpal bones are ossified except for the small pisiform bone, which develops by 12 years of age. Abnormalities of the phalanges, or fingers, such as syndactyly, webbing, or fusion between adjacent digits of the hands or feet, may be an isolated anomaly or indicative of profound developmental delay (Fig. 19.3). Polydactyly, the presence of supernumerary digits, is a more common variant and is not usually associated with other congenital anomalies.

\section*{Spine}

The infant has a C-shaped spinal curve at birth in comparison with the double $S$ curvature that is present in late adolescence (Fig. 19.4).

Thoracic and pelvic curves are present at birth, and the secondary cervical curve is present by 3 to 4 months of age, when the infant begins to hold up his or her head. The lumbar curvature begins to form as the infant bears weight and begins to walk. The young child often has an exaggerated thoracic-lumbar curvature and a protuberant abdomen until 3 years of age, when gait and balance become more normal (Fig. 19.5). The sacrum is composed of five separate bones at birth and by 18 to 20 years of age is fused into one large bone. The $\operatorname{coccyx}$ consists of three or four small bones that begin to ossify between the first and fourth years of life and fuses into one bone by 25 years of age.

\end{figure}

\section*{Pelvis}

The hip bone has three distinct parts in childhood, which are later fused in the adult. The ilium is the superior, broad, flat surface of the hip bone. The ischium is the strongest portion of the hip bone and contains a portion of the acetabulum, which forms the attachment at the hip bone for the femur and the opening or foramen (see Fig. 19.2). The pubis contains the medial portion of the acetabulum and joins medially to form the complete pelvic girdle.

\section*{Lower extremities and feet}

The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the body. The head of the femur becomes ossified during the first year of life, but the shaft of the femur does not become completely ossified until 14 years of age. The long bones of the extremities continue to grow at the site of the epiphyseal plate throughout childhood and adolescence; peak bone mass is achieved by young adulthood. In the lower leg, the larger bone is the tibia, the proximal end articulates with the femur and the distal end forms the medial malleolus of the ankle. The fibula
is the smaller bone in the lower leg and lateral to the tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms the lateral malleolus of the ankle.

The patella is the small triangular bone that forms the kneecap and lies over the junction of the femur and the tibia. The health of the patella during growth and development depends not only on strong bone growth but also on the strength of the ligaments and tendons supporting the patella.

The seven tarsal bones and five metatarsal bones of the foot undergo dramatic ossification during the first year of life. The ossification of the bones in the foot follows the normal development of the gross motor milestones. The talus is ossified by the seventh month of life to form the ankle, and the remaining metatarsal bones continue to form during the latter half of the first year of life. The phalanges continue the ossification process through adolescence.

The lower limbs go through a continuous process of growth and rotational change until approximately 8 years of age. The torsional development of the skeletal system is a process that begins in infancy and progresses from sitting to crawling, then standing, cruising, and finally walking with an exaggerated gait and a wide base of support. The laxity in the ligaments and fetal positioning in the intrauterine environment, as well as sitting and sleeping patterns in the early years, contribute to the normal torsional variations in the lower extremities during childhood. Torsional variations and musculoskeletal abnormalities are hereditarily linked and often show a strong family tendency.

\section*{Monitoring growth}

During growth, bone has the remarkable capacity to remodel itself. Bone is deposited in areas subjected to stress and reabsorbed in areas where there is little stress. This physiologic process explains the ability of children to remodel residual deformity after fractures and demonstrates the biologic plasticity of growing bones. The rate of bone growth is greatest in the lower extremities before the onset of puberty, and the distal extremities reach adult size in early puberty. This is often reflected in shoe size in preadolescents. The trunk and proximal extremities exhibit the dominant growth during puberty and into young adulthood. Bone growth is completed at age 20 years, and peak bone mass is not achieved until 35 years of
age.
Monitoring the velocity of growth is the key focus of routine well-child visits and when following children with chronic health conditions, particularly cardiac conditions. For the child with slow growth or delayed onset of puberty, obtaining past growth charts and evaluating the progression of the growth curve along with familial patterns of growth and pubertal development is critical to assessing an abnormal growth pattern.

\section*{Muscle development}

The rate of muscle growth and development increases rapidly beginning at age 2 years. Early muscle growth is balanced by a normal decrease in adipose tissue in early childhood. ${ }^{1}$ The growth and maturation of the muscles continues along with the ossification of the skeletal system (Fig. 19.6). Muscle tone is the state of normal tension of the muscles, and term infants normally have strong muscle tone at birth. Abnormalities in muscle tone in an infant may be noted shortly after birth when an infant is floppy. Less than normal muscle tone is described as hypotonia; rigidity or increased muscle tone is known as hypertonia; and spasticity is resistance to the range of motion of the muscles, including flexion and extension. Musculoskeletal terminology is presented in Box 19.1. Normal muscle function requires the normal function of the lower motor neurons (LMNs) in the spinal cord and the normal reflexivity of the muscle fibers. Normal muscle tone requires the normal function of the spinal cord stretch reflex and the balance of the upper motor neurons (UMNs) and LMN function. Lesions on the UMNs result in increased tone, and LMN lesions result in decreased tone.

The greatest increase in muscle size occurs during puberty when boys' muscle mass and muscle cell size begin to exceed that in girls. In early and middle childhood, girls' muscle size increases at a greater rate than in boys up until puberty.

\section*{Physiologic variations}

Table 19.1 presents physiologic and developmental changes in the musculoskeletal system from the newborn through adolescence.

\hline Adolescence & Hormonal changes impact ligaments and tendons; laxity of knees is particularly common in adolescent females, making them vulnerable to injury \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

African American infants often have advanced musculoskeletal development and achieve developmental milestones earlier. Asian American infants often have increased hypotonia at birth due to increased laxity in the ligaments of the muscle, and they may also have an increased abduction of the hips bilaterally on examination in early infancy.

\section*{EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE TIP}

Racial and ethnic diversity may impact the rate of bone growth and must be considered when evaluating growth curves in the primary care setting. A growth parameter that falls outside of the accepted two standard deviations (SDs) above or below the mean may be normal when the parental stature is considered.

\section*{System-specific history}

Obtaining a complete history or a symptom-related history of the musculoskeletal system is key to accurate assessment in children and adolescents. The Information Gathering table reviews the pertinent areas for each age group and developmental stage of childhood.

\section*{Physical assessment}

\section*{Preparation for the examination}

For a thorough and complete assessment of the musculoskeletal system, infants must be undressed except for the diaper, and children must be undressed except for underwear. A young child cannot be thoroughly assessed when wearing socks and shoes or when gowned. In preadolescence and adolescence, maintaining modesty while assessing the spine can be challenging, particularly in girls. Maturing females must be in underwear and gown to obtain a thorough examination of the spine. The skeletal positions are presented in Fig. 19.7.

\end{figure}

\section*{Inspection and palpation}

Initial inspection of the musculoskeletal system in the child from birth to adolescence begins with inspection of skin for color and temperature; inspection of palmar creases; and noting of scars, unusual pigmentation or lesions, swelling, and any bruising. Erythema, swelling, tenderness, or temperature changes should also be noted over the joints. Bruising is the most common sign of physical abuse and intentional injury in children. Bruising over bony prominences such as the shins, knees, and forehead are common in children and usually the result of active play. However, bruising seen on the buttocks, neck, face, and earlobes should be considered suspect and require further information gathering and assessment for signs of abuse (Fig. 19.8). ${ }^{2}$

\end{figure}

Observation of posture when standing and sitting, assessing the proportion of upper extremities to lower extremities, and noting any obvious gait abnormalities are part of a complete musculoskeletal assessment. Palpation for bone or joint tenderness, and any unusual prominence, thickening, and/or indentations in the bony skeleton should be noted. Muscle tone, muscle strength, and symmetry should be evaluated. Assessment of the mobility of the spine and range of motion of the joints and extremities are included in a thorough and complete assessment of the musculoskeletal system.

\section*{Joints}

Joints in the body have a slightly moveable to freely moveable motion throughout the period of growth and development. The hinge joint, between the humerus and the ulna, permits motion in one plane, whereas the pivotal joint, between the radial-ulnar joint, allows rotation only (Fig. 19.9). The condyloid joint in the wrist
allows flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. Saddle joints, such as in the thumb, have a similar motion to the condyloid joint in the wrist, except that the joint forms a concaveconvex fit to achieve motion. Note any widening of wrist joints, which can indicate decreased bone mineralization at the growth plates, common in children with rickets. The hip and shoulder joints are examples of ball-and-socket joints. Finally, the gliding joints, also known as planar joints, allow a gliding motion between two flat or nearly flat surfaces, such as in the vertebrae and between the carpal and metacarpal bones in the hand and the tarsal and metatarsal bones in the feet.

\end{figure}

\section*{Head and neck}

Assessment of the head and neck is presented in Chapter 10. Children presenting with head and neck pain should be evaluated for nuchal rigidity to determine if they have pain or resistance when
neck is flexed forward when lying supine. See Chapter 10 for further musculoskeletal examination techniques to evaluate head and neck pain in children.

\section*{Upper extremities and clavicle}

In the newborn infant the clavicles should be fully palpated to detect a possible fracture often associated with a traumatic delivery. Localized tenderness at the proximal end of the clavicle shortly after birth often leads to a palpable bony prominence as the fracture heals. A full range of motion of the upper extremities, including the elbows and wrists, must be evaluated to determine any trauma that may have affected the clavicles or shoulders during the birth process. In Erb palsy, injury to the fifth and sixth cranial nerves, no spontaneous abduction of the shoulder muscles or flexion of the elbow is noted on examination (Fig. 19.10). The arm is adducted and internally rotated, but normal grip in the hand is present.

Range of motion should be passively evaluated in infants and young children and assessed actively when children are cooperative with examination. Any limitation of range of motion in joints and extremities or asymmetrical response should be further investigated. Muscle tone and strength should also be evaluated. In early childhood the radial-ulnar joint is particularly vulnerable. Subluxation, or partial dislocation, of the radius from the humerus, often referred to as nursemaid's elbow, is common in children from 2 to 4 years of age. Often there is no clear history of trauma, but laxity of the ligaments in the young child predisposes them to injury. In cases of a subluxation the child usually refuses to use the affected arm. Passive range of motion is possible except for supination (palm facing upward). Dislocation of the shoulder can also occur in the young child and is marked by swelling, pain, and a limp arm.

\end{figure}

Trauma to the upper extremities is common in children and adolescents. Strains, sprains, or fractures can occur with strenuous activity, falls, motor vehicle or pedestrian injuries, or participation in competitive sports. Careful assessment is warranted in the growing child when any history of trauma is obtained. Fractures that are highly suggestive of intentional injury or abuse in children are rib fractures, especially posterior rib fractures, scapular fractures, sternal fractures, fractures of the spinous processes, and metaphyseal lesions. ${ }^{2}$ Clavicular fractures and long bone fractures in children older than 1 year of age are common traumatic injuries of childhood.

\section*{Lower extremities and feet}

Assessment of the lower extremities includes evaluating flexion/extension, adduction/abduction, and internal/external rotation. Muscle tone, muscle strength, and symmetry should be evaluated with the child standing and while observing gait. Leg length is evaluated with the infant or child supine, with knee and hip joints extended and legs aligned. A discrepancy in length or
asymmetrical appearance may indicate an abnormality in hips, long bones, or knees. In infants, leg length discrepancy may indicate congenital or developmental hip dislocation. Leg length in children can be evaluated by measuring from the anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus. Abnormal leg length should be evaluated by bone scan and referred to pediatric orthopedics for further evaluation.

Inspect the malleoli to evaluate the presence of torsion in the lower extremities. The medial malleolus lies at the distal end of the tibia, forming the medial ankle, and the lateral malleolus forms the lateral ankle at the distal end of the fibula. In the infant the medial and lateral malleoli are parallel when examining the infant supine. A rotation of up to 20 degrees posteriorly occurs in the lateral malleoli during the normal growth and development of the musculoskeletal system.

At birth, the infant has significant torsion in the lower extremities. Intrauterine positioning may be a contributing factor to the degree of bowleggedness or genu varum in the infant and young child. Genu varum is a normal condition until 2.5 to 3 years of age (Fig. 19.11). It is the most common cause of intoeing in children less than 3 years of age and normally resolves with growth. Standing behind the young child, observe the child walk while wearing only a diaper or underwear. Observation of gait is important in evaluating the impact of genu varum on motor development and performance. Genu varum or bowing after 2.5 to 3 years of age that is severe can be the result of nutritional deficiencies or obesity in young children and may require further evaluation.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-574.jpg?height=1315&width=883&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=582}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 19.11 Genu varum (bowleggedness).}
\end{figure}

Tibial torsion, a curvature or twisting of the tibia also often referred to as bowleggedness, is a common finding in young children and is the most common cause of intoeing. The child should be examined wearing only underwear and be seated with the legs dangling freely from a chair or the exam table (Fig. 19.12). The provider places a thumb and forefinger on the lateral and medial malleoli with the knee facing forward to determine the degree of rotation and flexibility of the tibia. The forefoot and hindfoot should be in line with the knees. On inspection, only the anterior edge of the lateral malleolus should be in the midline. Tibial torsion generally resolves with growth and is common until 4 or 5 years of age. Therefore reassuring the parent is an important component of anticipatory guidance.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 19.12 Tibial torsion.}
\end{figure}

Genu valgum, or knock-knee, should be evaluated with the child standing and is present if the medial malleoli are more than an inch apart when the knees are touching. Genu valgum is normal until 7 years of age and resolves in middle childhood with the rotational development of the lower extremities (Fig. 19.13). Persistence of genu valgum may be familial or the result of childhood obesity and, if persistent, may require further evaluation and referral.

Gower sign is a screening test for muscle weakness in children and is an early sign of a neuromuscular abnormality often associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Ask the child to stand from a sitting or supine position. The child with muscle weakness will move from a supine position to standing by facing prone and then grasping on the legs and hips with the hands to push the trunk up until they are erect. A child with good muscle strength will rise to a standing position without using the arms for leverage. ${ }^{3}$

Assessment of the feet in the infant includes the position and alignment of the forefoot and heels and the range of motion of the ankle and plantar arch. Limited dorsiflexion, or a fixed position of the hindfoot, is abnormal in the newborn, as is adduction of the forefoot and may be diagnostic of clubfoot. Decreased range of motion or pain should be noted on exam and referred for further evaluation. With the infant supine and the knees flexed to 90 degrees, inspect the thigh-foot angle and evaluate any adduction of the forefoot past the midline, which may be diagnostic for metatarsus adductus (Figs. 19.14 and 19.15). A foot that is rigid on range of motion requires further evaluation. A mild deformity with a flexible foot requires passive stretching, which consists of
supporting the heel at a right angle to the leg and rotating and stretching the forefoot laterally.

Infants and toddlers do not develop a longitudinal arch until the
second or third year of life. Lack of development of a longitudinal arch in the young child may indicate a generalized laxity of the ligaments or flat foot, pes planus, and a thorough assessment of muscle tone is warranted. Pes planus is hereditary, and use of orthotics and referral is required for further evaluation if symptomatic. Examine the feet with the child standing erect and on tiptoe to determine the longitudinal arch of the foot (Fig. 19.16). Older children may have physiologic flat feet due to laxity of the ligaments with rapid growth, which is a normal variant and usually improves with age.

\end{figure}

\section*{Hip}

The examination of the hip in the newborn and growing infant is performed with the infant in the supine position with the knees flexed bilaterally and supported by the thumb and forefinger of the examiner, with the pad of the second finger on the bony prominence of the greater trochanter and the thumb near the lesser trochanter (Fig. 19.17A). It is best to have the diaper open when examining the hips. Fully abduct the thighs to the examining table; mild pressure to the greater trochanter may cause the unstable hip to partially dislocate, subluxation, or dislocate. Ortolani sign, the presence of a clunk during the maneuver, is a positive sign for
dislocation of the hip. Barlow test also assists in detecting the unstable or dislocatable hip. With the infant supine and the knees flexed, the thigh is grasped and adducted while applying downward pressure (see Fig. 19.17B). With pressure on the acetabulum, the hip goes from a reduced position to a dislocated position. A dislocation of the femoral head is a positive Barlow. A click can occur during the maneuvers that may radiate from the knee and is often associated with crepitus of the joint, which is a normal finding. Galeazzi or Allis sign is also used to detect unequal leg length or hip dislocation. With the knees in the infant flexed to 90 degrees and the feet stabilized on the examining table, inspect for symmetry of height of knees. The knees should be equally aligned. Any asymmetry of the knees is abnormal and may indicate a subluxated or dislocated hip that requires further evaluation. With the infant prone, inspect for the symmetry of the thigh folds (see Fig. 19.17C). Asymmetry should be noted, but it is not highly correlated with hip abnormality. Examination of the hips is indicated until an infant is walking independently without support and gait is normal.

\end{figure}

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a congenital or acquired condition involving an improper alignment of the radial head of the femur and the acetabulum. DDH is associated with a range of conditions. The incidence of DDH in infants remains controversial due to the changing development of the femoral head in the acetabulum. The incidence of DDH with dislocation or hips with persistent dysplasia is 3 to 5 per 1000 infants. The overall incidence of DDH including infants with a partial dislocation or subluxation of the hip or an unstable hip is higher, at 1.4 to 35 per 1000 infants. ${ }^{4}$ In infants with a positive clinical examination in the early neonatal period, DDH resolves in $60 \%$ to $80 \%$ of infants by 2 to 8 weeks of age. ${ }^{5}$ Screening for DDH leads to earlier detection in affected infants but can lead to overtreatment. Therefore the recommendation for routine clinical examination and screening remains controversial. ${ }^{6}$ Infants born in breech presentation, female
infants, and infants with a positive family history of DDH are at higher risk, and ultrasound and referral is recommended. ${ }^{4}$ Clinical examination and observation of an unstable hip by the pediatric health care provider can limit unnecessary imaging and overreferral in the first 2 months of life. Nine percent of all primary hip replacements and up to $29 \%$ of hip replacement in adults up to 60 years of age are related to DDH , so detecting and referring the infant with persistent misalignment of the femoral head in the acetabulum remains important to prevent premature degenerative joint disease in adulthood. ${ }^{7}$

Examination of the hip in middle childhood and adolescence begins with observation of the standing posture. The height of the iliac crests should be level or equal, and the child should be able to stand on one foot without any tilting of the pelvis. ${ }^{8}$ A positive Trendelenburg sign is noted when the iliac crest drops, indicating weak hip abductor muscles on the weight-bearing side. The range of motion of the hips should be evaluated with the child or adolescent lying supine. With the hip and knee fully flexed, rotate the hip joint medially and laterally and note any pain or asymmetry in range of motion. Any child with abnormal findings, pain on examination, and/or presenting with a limp should be further investigated and referred if indicated.

\section*{Knee}

The knee is a common site for both overuse and injury in middle childhood and adolescence. The symmetry and range of motion of the knee should be assessed initially with the child standing. Note any swelling in the knee and pain with weight bearing. The remainder of the knee examination should be performed with the child lying supine on the exam table. The patella should be evaluated for any abnormal tilt or alignment from the midline and for any evidence of effusion in the joint, or ballotment. Joint line tenderness or pain may indicate a meniscal tear. ${ }^{9}$ Inspect and palpate knee for any swelling, obvious deformity, and incomplete range of motion on medial or lateral rotation, as well as signs of ligamentous laxity. Children and youth with a history of knee pain or laxity, as well as those who are unable to fully squat and perform a duck walk, require further evaluation and referral.

A common complaint of adolescent athletes is medial or anterior patellar pain with exercise or prolonged sitting, and pain or buckling when ascending or descending the stairs. Pain may be elicited on exam; however, findings may also be relatively normal. Sudden traumatic injury of the knee in the young athlete is common, particularly in adolescent females. Box 19.2 presents the physical examination of the knee and assists with decision-making regarding the need for imaging and referral. The knee maneuvers should be performed bilaterally beginning with the noninjured knee with the child lying supine on the examining table. Some variation in the flexibility and laxity of the joints is within normal.

\section*{BOX 19.2}

\section*{Examination of the Knee}

\section*{Lachman test}
- To assess anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), knee should be flexed 20-30 degrees with child or adolescent lying supine; stabilize the femur with one hand while pulling the tibia anteriorly with the dominant hand; feel resistance at firm endpoint and note how far tibial tubercle moves anteriorly compared with the unaffected knee.
- Positive finding: Excessive movement of tibial tubercle anteriorly or forward from neutral position indicates partial or complete tear of the ACL. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Anterior/posterior drawer test}
- To assess the ACL and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) for injury, hips should be flexed to 45 degrees and knees flexed to 90 degrees with child lying supine; foot should be stabilized on exam table in neutral position with examiner sitting on the child's foot. With the hamstrings relaxed, pull the tibia anteriorly (anterior drawer test) and posteriorly (posterior drawer test) from neutral position (Fig. B19.2A).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-583.jpg?height=575&width=861&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=593}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE B19.2A Drawer test}
\end{figure}
- Positive finding: Excessive movement of tibia anteriorly from neutral position or lack of firm endpoint indicates ACL insufficiency. Excessive posterior tibial sag suggests PCL insufficiency. ${ }^{6}$ The PCL is normally placed anterior to femur with knee flexed to 90 degrees. Significant laxity on exam suggests tear of ACL or PCL.

\section*{Varus/valgus stress test}
- To assess the stability of medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL), with the child lying supine, leg should be extended without flexion in knee with femur and ankle stable on exam table. With examiner's hand stabilizing knee joint anteriorly, lift knee to 20-30 degrees and apply varus stress to tibia; move hand to posterior side of knee and apply valgus stress to knee (see Fig. B19.2B).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE B19.2B Varus/valgus stress test with knee}
\end{figure}
- Note: For valgus stress, push on the lateral knee, stabilizing at medial malleolus. For the varus test, push on medial knee while stabilizing lateral malleolus.
- Positive finding: Lateral knee pain or excessive varus movement of tibia indicates injury to LCL. Medial knee pain or increased valgus movement with lack of a firm endpoint indicates injury to MCL. Laxity or opening in the joint space suggests tear of MCL or LCL.

\section*{Mcmurray test}
- Assess the medial and lateral meniscus with child lying supine, flex knee to 90 degrees while supporting foot and lower leg. Stabilize medial and lateral joint lines of knee with thumb and forefinger (see Fig. B19.2C). Using other hand, rotate tibia medially (valgus force) to test medial meniscus and laterally (varus force) to test lateral meniscus while extending knee to 90 degrees.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE B19.2C McMurray test}
\end{figure}
- Positive finding: Any clicking or pain along medial joint line indicates a medial meniscus tear. A click or pain along lateral joint indicates a lateral meniscus tear.

\section*{Ballottement of patella test}
- Ballottement sign: With child lying supine and knee fully
extended, examiner applies downward pressure on suprapatellar pouch to force fluid between patella and femur; then push the patella downward against the femur (see Fig. B19.2D).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-585.jpg?height=572&width=855&top_left_y=642&top_left_x=596}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE B19.2D Ballottement/bulget test}
\end{figure}
- Positive finding: If patella floats back to neutral position, fluid is present. A palpable click of patella striking femur on downward pressure is positive for knee joint effusion.

\section*{Spine}

The spine should be inspected and palpated in infancy to note any congenital abnormalities, such as hair tufts, dimples, a sacral sinus, or hemangiomas, that could indicate spinal abnormalities. Young children develop a normal curvature of the spine with lordosis of the neck and lumbar region and kyphosis of the thorax. An exaggerated lordosis is normal in the young child. Viewing the child or adolescent from the side allows the examiner to evaluate normal alignment. Inspection of the spine in the child and adolescent begins with the examiner behind the child. Assess for the contour of the back, the symmetry of the shoulders, the symmetry and/or prominence/shape of the scapula and ribs, and the symmetry of the waistline and the iliac crests (Fig. 19.18A-C). The head should be
aligned directly over the sacrum because any deviation from the midline may indicate scoliosis or a spinal deformity. Range of motion of the spine is evaluated by asking the child or adolescent to bend to the side, flex, and extend. An elevated scapula, uneven iliac crests, or an uneven waistline, or the presence of a rib hump indicates a positive finding (Fig. 19.19). The Adam's forward bend test begins with the child or adolescent standing with knees straight and feet together. Ask the child to bend forward and to touch the toes with hands dangling or in a diving position (see Fig. 19.18D). Observe the spine for alignment, any curvature, asymmetry, or rib hump from the rear and sides. A scoliometer can be used to assess the angle of trunk rotation (Fig. 19.20). Place the scoliometer on the trunk at the peak of the curvature to evaluate alignment. A suspected curve or rotation of 10 degrees or greater requires further evaluation and referral.

\end{figure}

Routine screening for scoliosis remains controversial, and the US Preventive Services Task Force no longer recommends routine school screenings because the benefits do not outweigh the risk of overreferral and unnecessary imaging. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend that pediatric health care providers screen for scoliosis and judiciously manage positive screening results and the need for further evaluation or referral. Adolescents who are in a period of rapid growth, have a positive family history, and have a more notable curve on presentation are more likely to progress and require imaging and referral. Females have up to a 10fold greater risk of curve progression. Evaluation of sexual maturity rating (SMR) or Tanner stage is key to determining skeletal and spinal maturity when diagnosing scoliosis in adolescents.

\section*{Diagnostic procedures}

Concern over the relationship of frequent cumulative exposure to radiologic diagnostic procedures, particularly computed tomography (CT) scans, and later health effects including cancer in children and adults remains. Pediatric health care providers have continued to adhere to the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) policy and an Image Gently in most pediatric health care settings. ${ }^{10}$

Ultrasound is used to evaluate soft tissue masses and to diagnose DDH until 4 to 6 months of age, due to incomplete ossification of the femoral heads in early infancy. ${ }^{11}$ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used for higher anatomic detail for soft tissue masses, but sedation is frequently required. ${ }^{11}$ Bone age radiographs of the secondary ossification centers at the end of the long bones are used to assess growth rate in children who lag behind in height velocity compared with the norm or who have delayed onset of puberty. A skeletal series of radiographs is indicated to detect occult fractures when serious physical abuse is suspected, especially in children under 2 years of age. ${ }^{2}$ A bone scan or CT scanogram is used to diagnose and evaluate unequal leg length in childhood. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Preparticipation sports physical}

\section*{Preparticipation sports history}

The primary purpose of the preparticipation sports physical exam is to exclude or restrict the young athlete with a temporary or permanent contraindication from participation in competitive sports. In addition, the pediatric health care provider can help to match the athlete to the appropriate type and level of sport and can help to prevent injury by recommending the appropriate stretching or strengthening exercises. The preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE) is often the healthy adolescent's only contact with a pediatric health care provider during an important period of physical and psychosocial growth and development. Therefore, the PPE should incorporate routine health maintenance and confidential psychosocial screening. It is important to evaluate any risks related to sports participation and use the encounter as an opportunity for
anticipatory guidance regarding reproductive health and in encouraging positive health behaviors. ${ }^{12}$

The PPE is also an opportunity for the pediatric health care provider to evaluate risky health practices related to participation in sports, particularly unhealthy weight loss or weight gain (Box 19.3). Sports such as wrestling, boxing, and martial arts are graded by weight class, which creates significant pressure on the young athlete to maximize body strength and bulk. There are equally powerful pressures on dancers, distance runners, and gymnasts to maintain a low weight. By contrast, youth playing positions such as linebacker in football may want to increase weight gain, even if their body mass index (BMI) is greater than the 95th percentile for age. Information gathering during the PPE should include satisfaction with or concerns about weight and body image. Athletes should also be questioned about such practices as severe food restriction, binging or purging, weight loss, or muscleenhancing supplements, including medications containing ephedra, creatine, and anabolic steroids or their analogs. Tables 19.2 and 19.3 present a review of systems and medical conditions related to participation in competitive sports.

To perform the PPE, the young pubertal female athlete should be examined in gym shorts and sports bra, and young males should be in gym shorts to ensure a thorough assessment of the joints and muscles. A 14-step orthopedic exam is included in the PPE to assess the athlete's musculoskeletal health (Fig. 19.21). The components of the 14 -point orthopedic examination are as follows:
1. With the young athlete standing, assess for frontal symmetry of trunk, shoulders, and extremities.
2. Assess neck flexion, extension, lateral flexion side to side, and rotation to evaluate range of motion of cervical spine.
3. Assess trapezius strength by having the young athlete shrug shoulders against resistance from the practitioner.
4. Assess deltoid strength by having the young athlete abduct the shoulders against resistance from the practitioner.
5. Assess internal and external rotation of shoulder to evaluate range of motion of the glenohumeral joints.
6. Assess range of motion of the elbows by having young athlete perform flexion and extension of the arms.
7. Assess range of motion of the wrists and elbows by observing pronation and supination of the forearm.
8. Assess range of motion of the hands and fingers by having the young athlete clench the fist and spread the fingers.
9. Assess symmetry of the posterior body with the young athlete standing.
10. Have the young athlete stand with knees straight and then flex forward and bend backward to assess any discomfort of the lumbar spine.
11. Perform Adam's forward bend test by having the young athlete bend forward and touch the toes if possible with hands dangling
or in a diving position. Assess for rib hump or asymmetry.
12. To assess for symmetry of leg musculature, have the young athlete stand facing the practitioner with quadriceps flexed.
13. Assess hip, knee, and ankle range of motion, strength, and balance by having the young athlete duck walk four steps.
14. Assess calf strength, symmetry, and balance by having the young athlete stand on heels and then toes.

\end{abstract}

In young athletes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a cardiovascular condition caused by an asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy and a nondilated left ventricle with impaired diastolic function, is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death is defined as a nontraumatic death by cardiac arrest within 6 hours of a previous state of good health. ${ }^{14}$ The incidence is thought to be 1 in 200,000 high school athletes and 1 in 65,000 college athletes, ${ }^{14}$ although the incidence is higher in African American athletes compared with white athletes and to young men compared with young women. ${ }^{15}$ In general, no evidence of cardiac disease is present before sudden cardiac death. Other cardiac conditions implicated in sudden cardiac death include anomalous coronary arteries, Marfan syndrome, prolonged QT interval, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Following the example of countries such as Italy, some US experts recommend a screening ECG for all adolescent athletes. ${ }^{15}$ However, the AHA has recently affirmed its stance against universal ECG screening. Instead, they recommend that any concerning history elements and any findings on physical examination, which include hypertension, absence of femoral pulses, signs of stigmata of Marfan syndrome, or auscultation of
heart murmur, would indicate the need for referral to pediatric cardiovascular specialists. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{Sports injuries}

Sports injuries can be classified as traumatic (macrotrauma), usually from collision or contact sports, such as basketball, football, or soccer, or as overuse (microtrauma). The pediatric health care provider should assess the level of sports participation, recreational versus competitive sports, that young athletes are involved in when gathering history about injuries. Young athletes who play highcontact sports such as football, basketball, and soccer should be screened for history of previous concussion, fractures, and ligament damage. Athletes who participate in lower-contact sports, such as running or swimming, should be screened for repetitive motion and overuse injuries to the shoulder, knee, elbow, or shin (tibia).

Children who are overweight or obese have a higher number of reported fractures, more musculoskeletal discomfort, and impaired mobility. ${ }^{16,17}$ The incidence of lower extremity malalignment predisposing children and adolescents to injury are also more prevalent in overweight children and adolescents. Studies show young female athletes are at greater risk than young male athletes for stress fractures, particularly tibial stress fractures. ${ }^{18}$ In addition, young female athletes who are runners sustain an overall higher injury rate than young male runners. ${ }^{18}$ A young athlete's SMR is also relevant to injury and the mechanism for injury. Rapid growth during adolescence results in decreased strength in the growth plates and greater strength in ligaments compared with bones, leading to greater potential for fractures relative to older adolescents and adults. ${ }^{19}$ Rapidly growing athletes with relative good muscle strength yet incomplete ossification of the growth plate are predisposed to physeal (growth plate) fractures. Because injuries may recur from season to season, young athletes with a history of repetitive injuries such as frequent ankle sprain should be given strengthening exercises at the time of the PPE to help prevent future injury. Early sports specialization may lead to overuse injuries, and cross training in young athletes is recommended. ${ }^{20}$ For most adolescents the physical and social benefits of carefully
monitored sports participation outweigh the risks, including adolescents with chronic health conditions and special health care needs.

\section*{PEDIATRIC PEARLS}

Ligaments are stronger than bones until adolescence; therefore injuries to long bones and joints in the preadolescent are more likely to cause fractures rather than sprains.

\section*{Sports-related concussions}

Concussions are common, often unrecognized, and usually do not involve loss of consciousness. ${ }^{6}$ Concussion is defined as an impact to the brain, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an "impulsive force" transmitted to the head, resulting in rapid onset of neurologic symptoms, with or without loss of consciousness, with spontaneous (though often delayed) resolution. ${ }^{21}$ There has been an increased focus on the immediate and long-term sequelae of concussion as a subset of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the pediatric and adolescent athlete that is due to their increased in participation in high-impact competitive sports. ${ }^{21,22}$ It has been estimated that by the time a young athlete reaches high school, $53 \%$ will have reported a history of concussion. ${ }^{23}$ Athletes younger than 18 years take longer to recover from concussion than older athletes. The short sequelae of concussion may include postconcussion syndrome, which can last for weeks to months, and second impact syndrome can occur if a second head injury occurs during the postconcussion period. The long-term sequelae of concussion include permanent neurologic deficits, such as decreased cognitive functioning and limiting cognitive potential. ${ }^{21}$

Current guidelines for concussion recommend cognitive rest, in addition to exclusion from play until completely asymptomatic, with a gradual return to play after symptoms resolve. In no cases should the athlete return to play on the same day as the injury. ${ }^{21}$ Information gathered during the PPE should include screening questions related to prior concussions and related symptoms, including any headaches or cognitive, emotional, or sleep
impairment. See Box 19.5 for signs and symptoms of concussion. The Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) for evaluation of young athletes 13 years of age and older following history of head injury or concussion, and a Child SCAT3 for children 5 to 12 years of age and be obtained at http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/5/263.full.pdf.

\section*{The female athlete}

Female athletes are at higher risk than male athletes for certain musculoskeletal injuries, such as noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and dislocation of the patella. The lowest intake of vitamin D and calcium are in female adolescents and female young adults. Eating disorders are also more common in female adolescents than male adolescents. Patellofemoral pain syndrome is also more common in female athletes, and it often presents as complaints of anterior knee pain radiating from the posterior patella and biomechanical or physical changes in the patellofemoral joint. It is an overuse or overload injury occurring from repeated weight-bearing impact and may be managed with rest and quadriceps strengthening exercises.

Undernutrition in female adolescents can impair skeletal health and impact bone mineral density (BMD) in adulthood. The female athlete triad comprises menstrual function, BMD, and energy availability and is more common in sports that emphasize endurance and a lean body. ${ }^{24}$ Although previously defined as amenorrhea, osteopenia, and disordered eating, the current definitions allow for conceptualization of each element of the triad on a spectrum from health to severe dysfunction. ${ }^{24}$ Furthermore, studies have shown that inadequate energy intake may be unintentional, rather than a sign of an eating disorder. It is thought that between $4 \%$ and $18 \%$ of female high school athletes have two of the triad components concurrently and the prevalence of one component is between $16 \%$ and $54 \%$. Casual comments by coaches or family members about the adolescent's need to lose weight can be triggers for disordered eating. ${ }^{25}$ Whether intentional or not, prolonged inadequate energy availability affects bone density accumulation and puts athletes at increased risk for stress fractures, with greater menstrual disruption and injury seen in those teens who do intentionally restrict their energy intake. ${ }^{24}$

\section*{Musculoskeletal conditions}

Table 19.4 presents the most common abnormal orthopedic conditions seen in infants, children, and adolescents by the
pediatric health care provider.

\section*{TABLE 19.4}

\section*{Musculoskeletal Conditions}

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Nutritional factors, such as adequate protein in the diet, the amount of calcium intake daily, and adequate intake of vitamin D, which regulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines, impact bone growth.
- Growth along the epiphyseal plate continues until the cells in the growth plate mature and stop dividing in puberty, and closure of the growth plate occurs in young adulthood.
- Evaluating progression of the height growth curve is critical to assessing normal and abnormal growth patterns, along with familial patterns of growth and pubertal development.
- Note any obvious gait abnormalities; observe posture when standing and sitting; assess proportion of upper extremities to lower extremities. Standing behind the young child, observe the child walk to evaluating torsional variations of genu varum and genu valgum.
- Evaluate range of motion of joints and assess muscle tone of trunk and extremities.
- Evaluation of the lower extremities includes assessment of flexion/extension, adduction/abduction, and internal/external rotation.
- Assessment of the hip in the young infant is performed in supine position with the knees flexed bilaterally and thumb and forefinger of examiner on the bony prominence of greater trochanter. Ortolani sign tests for dislocation of hip and Barlow test evaluates stability of hip.
- Knee assessment maneuvers should be performed bilaterally beginning with the noninjured knee. Some variation in the flexibility and laxity of knee joints is normal.
- Assess for contour of back, symmetry of shoulders, shape and/or prominence of scapula and ribs, and symmetry of iliac crests.
- Observe for alignment of spine with child or adolescent in forward bend position. Note any curvature, asymmetry, or rib hump from the rear and sides of the back.
- To perform the PPE, a 14-step orthopedic exam is included to assess the athlete's musculoskeletal health.
- The AHA recommends the PPE include (1) auscultation for heart murmurs; (2) palpation of femoral pulses; (3) evaluation for Marfan syndrome; and (4) blood pressure evaluation.

The normal development of the nervous system provides the vital motor, sensory, and cognitive functions that sustain human life and comprise human behavior. For the pediatric health care provider, surveillance and monitoring the development of the nervous system is one of the most important aspects of assessment in infants and children. The nervous system contains the most complex and delicate pathways in the body and is the center of all vital bodily functions. The challenge is to assess not only the progress of gross motor and fine motor skills in infants and children, but also to assess cognitive development and subtle deficits in attention and information processing that may impact learning behavior.

\section*{Embryologic development}

The formation of the nervous system begins very early during the third week of embryonic life. Cell differentiation when the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm split to begin forming tubes which support organ growth. The ectoderm forms skin, hair, nails, brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. ${ }^{1}$ The notochord, which becomes the spinal column, develops during this period and forms the neural plate and neural folds. Closure of the neural plate is complete by the fourth week of embryonic development, and the
neural tube is formed. Any fetal insults that occur during this period can result in defects in the brain and spinal cord, such as anencephaly or spina bifida defects, which occur in 1 of 1000 live births. During the fifth week of fetal development, the anterior portion of the neural tube enlarges to form the segments of the brain. Brain growth proceeds, with the most rapid brain growth occurring between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation.

By 24 weeks of gestation, the fetus has developed most of the nerve cells, or neurons, needed for the formation of the neural pathways. The germinal cell matrix is highly vascular and is prone to hemorrhage in the preterm infant.

The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system, and each neuron contains numerous dendrites and one axon (Fig. 20.1). Dendrites are the protoplasmic branches of the cell body. Neural impulses enter the cell body through the dendrites and leave through the single axon. They then connect by a series of synapses with another dendrite of the next axon. At the synaptic junction, neurons also release specific neurotransmitters (such as GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine) that regulate brain and body functions. Myelin, a lipoid material surrounding cell fibers, covers the axons and allows for rapid and smooth transmission of nerve impulses. However, only a portion of the axons contain myelin at birth.

\end{figure}

\section*{Developmental variations}

Brain growth is rapid after birth, with $50 \%$ of postnatal brain growth achieved by 1 year of age. By 2 to 3 years of age, the brain is $80 \%$ of adult size. ${ }^{1}$ Head circumference increases sixfold in the first year of life and is the best indication of normal brain growth. Myelination, the deposit of the protective fatty substance around the axons, continues in the brain throughout the first 2 years of life, and in the preterm infant continues into the third year of life. Myelination proceeds from head to toe, cephalocaudal, beginning with the spinal cord and cranial nerves and then from midline to fingertips, proximodistal, following with the brainstem, corticospinal tracts, and sensory pathways. Preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants may develop from toe to head, which is associated
with persistent hypertonia in the lower extremities. The control of motor functions in infancy and early childhood is closely associated with the normal myelination of the nerve fibers. ${ }^{1}$ The development of intelligence in infants depends on the normal progression through two primary developmental domains-problem solving and language.

The rapid increase in myelination in the brain in the first 2 years of life is followed by a decrease in brain growth and maturation during early childhood. The growth of the gray matter in the brain continues throughout childhood into adolescence and early adulthood in a nonlinear pattern. ${ }^{2}$ Lifestyle habits such as sleep and adequate nutrition, as well as genetic factors, affect the volume of gray matter and brain growth. ${ }^{2}$

\section*{Anatomy and physiology}

\section*{Central nervous system}

\section*{Cerebrum}

The outermost part of the brain is the cerebral cortex, which is often referred to as the gray matter because the neurons are unmyelinated and give a gray rather than a white appearance. The outer layer of the brain is composed of fissures and grooves, or sulci, and the ridge between grooves is the gyrus. The newborn infant has fewer convolutional surfaces, or sulci, in the cerebral cortex and more pliable skull bones, which decrease the incidence of bruising and tearing of the cerebral cortex in the developing infant with minor head trauma. The sulci of the brain deepen throughout childhood and continue to mature into young adulthood.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is covered by the cerebral cortex. The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres. The right hemisphere controls the functions of the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the functions of the right side of the body. Depending on hand preference, one hemisphere is considered dominant due to the location of important speech and language centers. For right-
handed people, the left hemisphere is dominant, and for lefthanded people, the right hemisphere or both hemispheres may be dominant. The hemispheres are connected by a bridge of myelinated axons, the corpus callosum, which lies between the fissures of the left and right hemispheres. ${ }^{1}$ The corpus callosum controls and integrates motor, sensory, language, and higher intellectual functions. The right and left hemispheres are divided into four lobes-frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital-with arbitrary borders. Each lobe controls particular bodily functions and behaviors (Fig. 20.2).
- Frontal lobe: Considered the "personality center" of the brain and is responsible for higher cognitive functions. Initiates movement control of the flexor muscles of hands and feet. Broca area in the frontal lobe controls the ability to articulate speech. Prefrontal area controls thought processes for anticipation and prediction of behavior, and the frontal region is involved in complex learning movement patterns and writing. Damage to the frontal region causes expressive aphasia, motor weakness or personality changes.
- Parietal lobe: Controls processing and interpretation of sensory input-visual, auditory, smell, taste, and touch sensations, including pain and temperature; perceives where a stimulus or pressure is and on which part of the body, and provides proprioception, the sense of the position of the limbs of the body. It has an important role in language processing and symbol interpretation. Damage to the parietal region results in sensory loss, spatial disorientation, or receptive language deficits like agnosia, an inability to recognize or perceive the meaningfulness of an object, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells.
- Temporal lobe: Primary center for the perception and interpretation of sounds and auditory association and perception, and memory recall; also involved in integration of taste, smell, and balance. Wernicke area in the temporal lobe is related to spoken words and language comprehension. The temporal lobe also has a role with mood and emotional control.
- Occipital lobe: Primary visual cortex in the brain and is the center for receiving and interpreting visual data and depth perception.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 20.2 Regions of the cerebral cortex.}
\end{figure}

The basal ganglia are a cluster of neurons deep in the subcortical layer that process connections between the cerebral motor cortex and the upper brainstem. The maturation of the basal ganglia occurs in early childhood with the development of fine motor skills and, in childhood, process movement functions such as arm swinging during walking and running and throwing a ball overhand. The basal ganglia also have a role with behavioral control and are associated with disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Dopamine plays an important role in basal ganglia function. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia results in abnormal postural movement patterns as in cerebral palsy (CP), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington chorea.

\section*{Cerebellum}

The cerebellum is located in the posterior cranium and maintains the body's equilibrium and coordinates both voluntary and involuntary movements of the limbs, trunk, head, larynx, and eyes. ${ }^{1}$ The motor cortex in the cerebrum relays signals to the cerebellum, which results in the precise muscle movements requiring a high level of fine motor dexterity. It is the portion of the brain that processes the sensory input from the musculoskeletal system, as well as from the visual, auditory, and touch receptors, and it transmits signals to the motor system to direct reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and balance.

The cerebellum also has some role with cognitive functions, emotional control and speech. Damage to the cerebellum can cause ataxia, loss of coordination of motor movement, inability to perform rapid alternating movements, and a wide-based gait. Abnormal development or dysfunction of the cerebellum in preterm infants can result in hypotonia, nystagmus, and language deficits.

\section*{Brainstem and cranial nerves}

The brainstem is in the central core of the brain and includes the pons, medulla oblongata, and midbrain (Fig. 20.3). The brainstem contains the sensory and motor tracts that connect the brain and spinal cord and is the location for most of the twelve cranial nerves. The pons acts as the neural transmission center from all parts of the central cortex and supports ascending and descending nerve fibers. It controls basic bodily functions-breathing, eating, and motor functions. Cranial nerve V (trigeminal nerve), cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) and cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) arise from the pons. Dysfunction or damage of the peripheral pons is associated with a loss of outward or lateral motion of the eye muscles causing strabismus and may also cause a loss of sensory or motor function of the facial and mouth area. The medulla oblongata, which lies between the pons and the cerebellum, is a continuation of the spinal cord. The medulla oblongata processes impulses from the hypoglossal, vagal, spinal accessory, glossophyarngeal, and the vestibular and acoustic cranial nerves. It also aids in the life functions of respiration and circulation, and controls involuntary reflexes such as coughing, sneezing, and yawning. Dysfunction or damage of the medulla causes weakness in the shoulder muscles, affects tongue muscles and salivary function, decreases gastrointestinal motility, alters swallowing and speech functions, causes nerve deafness, and diminishes cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The midbrain controls the integration of basic bodily functions, and contains the neural fibers of cranial nerve III (oculomotor) and cranial nerve IV (trochlear) that come from the spinal cord and merge into the thalamus and hypothalamus. The midbrain also contains the reticular activating system which regulates wakefulness and arousability.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 20.3 Brain and brainstem.}
\end{figure}

The diencephalon (Fig. 20.4) is the extension of the brainstem and lies embedded in the cerebral cortex. It contains the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the pineal gland-an endocrine gland that produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleepwake cycle. Parts of the third ventricle and the nuclei of the cranial nerve II (optic nerve) and retina arise from the diencephalon.
- Thalamus: Acts as the brain's relay station and receives input from the sensory and motor systems of the body and dispatches input from the pons and cerebellum to the cerebral cortex.
- Hypothalamus: Controls and regulates the body's internal environment-body temperature, metabolic processes, and involuntary response activity.
- Pituitary gland: Responsible for hormonal control of growth and reproductive function and assists in regulating thyroid gland function, lactation, and metabolism. The posterior pituitary produces vasopressin, which regulates the balance of water and sodium in the body.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 20.4 The diencephalon.}
\end{figure}

The limbic system is the group of subcortical structures in the diencephalon including the hypothalamus and hippocampus. This system regulates emotion and motivation and organizes memories. Aggression and fear also are regulated by the limbic system. Disruption that occurs during the development of the limbic system causes distorted perceptions and aggressive behavior. Maternal substance abuse early in pregnancy can disrupt the migration of neuron activity in the cerebral cortex, and later prenatal exposure disrupts neuronal synapses. Infants exposed to illicit drug use in utero often have disturbances in memory, learning, attention span, and oppositional behavior disorders during childhood.

\section*{Ventricular nervous system}

The brain and spinal cord are lubricated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which provides support and protection for the brain and allows for the removal of waste products. CSF is produced by specialized tissue called choroid plexus, which line the ventricles of the brain and spinal cord. It flows from the lateral ventricles to the third and fourth ventricles through a series of foramens. The fourth ventricle, which lies in the medulla, contains three openings that allow the cerebrospinal fluid to pass into the subarachnoid space. Approximately 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid is produced daily in adolescence and young adults and is continually being reabsorbed in the brain. ${ }^{1}$ Any disruption in the circulation or absorption of CSF
causes a build-up in the ventricles, resulting in hydrocephalus.
The brain is covered by protective layers that cushion and lubricate the outer surface (Fig. 20.5). The dura mater lies just beneath the skull bone and periosteum and consists of layers of fibrous connective tissue. Adjacent to the dura mater is the arachnoid, the avascular, weblike membrane that cushions the cortex. The dura mater is separated from the arachnoid by the subdural space. The pia mater is the highly vascular area of the cortex that attaches directly to the gray matter or irregular surface of the brain. The subarachnoid area and a cushion of cerebrospinal fluid separate the arachnoid from the pia mater.

\caption{FIGURE 20.5 The meningeal layers.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Spinal nerves}

There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves that innervate the upper and lower torso, extremities, skin, and muscles -8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal (Fig. 20.6). ${ }^{1}$ These spinal nerves form complex nerve networks called plexuses. There are four major plexuses in the peripheral nervous system-the cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral plexuses-and the body surface that is innervated by the plexus of a spinal nerve is called a dermatome. Although dermatomes map specific segments of the body surface, spinal nerve sensation can be transmitted to adjacent dermatomes (see Fig. 20.6). The sensory pathways of the spinal nerves carry sensations of touch, temperature, and pain; the motor fibers activate reflexes and impulses that control skeletal muscles and the involuntary muscles of the viscera. The spinal nerves function as
part of the lower motor neurons and become dysfunctional in the presence of spinal cord lesions.

FIGURE 20.6 The spinal nerves and dermatomes (A) Ventral view (B) Dorsal view.

The spinal cord is an extension of the medulla oblongata and is composed of gray and white matter extending to the lumbar region. The gray matter runs laterally along the spinal cord and protects the myelinated and unmyelinated fibers of the white matter. Proprioceptors, the specialized nerve endings in muscles, tendons, and joints, are located in the white matter and are sensitive to changes in the tension of muscles and tendons. Temperature, pain, touch, and equilibrium are transmitted through the proprioceptors to the brainstem.

\section*{Peripheral nervous system}

The spinal nerves originate in the spinal cord and exit from the intervertebral spaces. They contain sensory and motor fibers and with the cranial nerves and visceral fibers of the autonomic nervous system compose the pathways of the peripheral nervous system. The autonomic nervous system carries impulses to and from the CNS. It is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and is made up of unmyelinated nerves. The sympathetic nervous system activates in times of stress and provides increased energy for needed bursts of activity. The parasympathetic nervous system balances the activities of the sympathetic nervous system by restoring stability and maintaining reserve energy for daily bodily functions such as digestion and elimination.

\section*{Upper and lower motor neurons}

Upper motor neurons are located within the central nervous system (CNS) and convey impulses from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. They can influence the function of the lower motor neurons, as evidenced in conditions such as $C P$. The lower motor neurons are located primarily in the peripheral nervous system and provide pathways for nerve fibers to translate movement of the muscles into action. Muscle wasting can be the result of dysfunction in the anterior horn cells of the upper motor neurons. Dysfunction in the lower motor neurons can cause wasting of localized muscle groups and a soft rather than firm tone to the muscle mass. Acquired atrophy of the muscles accompanied by a wide-based gait and muscle weakness when arising from a sitting position is characteristic of muscular
dystrophy, a developmental muscle wasting condition with onset in early childhood.

\section*{Spinal reflexes}

Reflex behavior provides the major assessment of brainstem function. A reflex is an expected response between a stimulus and an elicited motor response. The reflex arc operates outside the level of conscious control and is the basic defense mechanism of the nervous system. Reflexes help the body maintain appropriate muscle tension and react to painful or harmful stimuli. A stimulus creates an impulse that is transmitted instantaneously outward by the motor neurons of the spinal cord via the spinal nerve and peripheral nervous system to produce a brisk muscle contraction (Fig. 20.7).

\section*{Physiological variations}

Table 20.1 reviews the physical, developmental, and cognitive variations that occur during the development and maturation of the nervous system in infancy and childhood.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Family, cultural, racial, and ethnic considerations}

Cultural practices may affect the progress of developmental milestones. Infants who are frequently swaddled on a mother's back for the first year may stand and begin walking at a later age. Increased muscle tone is often seen in African-American infants, with an equal balance between increased flexor and extensor tone. Decreased tone is more common in Asian infants and is usually unbalanced with more extensor tone throughout movement.

\section*{System-specific history}

The Information Gathering table reviews the pertinent areas for the neurologic system for each age group and developmental stage of
childhood. Obtaining a complete history of gross motor and fine motor milestones in infancy, assessing speech and language development, and assessing learning including auditory and visual processing are key to early identification of insults to the nervous system.

\section*{Physical assessment}

The comprehensive assessment of the pediatric neurologic system includes evaluation of mental status, cranial nerves, sensory and motor function, muscle strength and tone; observation of balance, coordination and gait; and age-appropriate assessment of reflexes, speech and language development, learning and cognition. An infant or child presenting with a developmental delay or neurologic symptoms requires a more focused neurologic examination targeted to the appropriate age and developmental stage, performing the most invasive aspect of the examination, the gag reflex, last. In early childhood, it is important to remember to assess balance, gait, and agility as the child walks, pivots, and turns while holding onto the parent's hand. If the young child is fearful or refuses to walk as requested, gently pick up the child and direct him or her toward the parent and observe the gait from behind with the child undressed except for a diaper. Observing the gait will assess any abnormalities and assist the pediatric health care provider with parental anticipatory guidance about the normal neuromuscular developmental process in early childhood. Box 20.1 presents the basics of the neurologic examination in infants and young children.

\section*{BOX 20.1}

\section*{Pediatric Neurologic Assessment Checklist}
- Infant reflexes at $<1$ year of age
- Fontanels at $<18$ months
- Level of alertness or consciousness
- Motor and sensory function
- Cranial nerves
- Deep and superficial reflexes
- Coordination
- Balance and gait

\section*{Evaluation of motor function}

Muscle tone, the normal degree of tension maintained by muscles while at rest, changes during the first 2 years of life as myelination of the neuronal pathways proceed, the primitive reflexes disappear, and the cerebral cortex begins to control motor functions. The assessment of muscle tone begins in the young infant by observing the resting posture. In the term infant at birth, arms and legs are in a semiflexed position with the hips slightly abducted (Fig. 20.8). At the 2 -month-old visit, tone in the neck and trunk is evaluated by gently pulling the infant upward from the exam table, grasping the hands and forearms. Significant head lag or inability of the infant to exhibit strength in the neck and shoulders when pulled to sitting may indicate hypotonia, a decrease in the normal resting tension in the muscle. In the term infant 4 to 6 months of age, strength in the extremities and trunk is evaluated by gently pulling the infant to a sitting position; muscle tone can also be evaluated in the standing position while supporting the trunk to assess the strength of the lower extremities. At 9 months of age, gently pull the infant with both arms from a sitting position to standing to evaluate muscle tone and strength.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-623.jpg?height=521&width=920&top_left_y=1661&top_left_x=562}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{FIGURE 20.8 Normal flexion in term infant.}
\end{figure}

Abnormal muscle tone and abnormal positioning or posturing of the extremities in the newborn and young infant may indicate neurological dysfunction. Hips positioned in external rotation or in a "frog-leg" position in the term newborn indicates abnormal muscle tone. Hypotonia, low muscle tone, most commonly presents
in the newborn or infant as floppy infant syndrome which includes limited muscle tone and strength in the extremities, arms are often straight at the infant's side, and hips are abducted with lower extremities abducted on the exam table. When placed in ventral suspension, the infant's head and extremities will hang or drape over the examiner's hand with inability to maintain or move to a horizontal position due to hypotonia of trunk muscles. Infants with hypotonia can actively move all extremities through normal range of motion, but spontaneous movements may be less frequent than in infants with normal muscle tone.

Neurological disorders often present in early infancy with hypotonia and muscle weakness. Hypotonia may be caused by lesions in the central or peripheral nervous system, as well as neuromuscular disorders, sepsis, organ failure, and metabolic dysfunction. ${ }^{3}$ Infants and children with a CNS etiology may have a history of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxia, perinatally acquired infection, maternal substance abuse or drug exposure, and or exposure to environmental toxins. It is important to obtain a family history, if known, of any neurological disorders such as congenital myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, or inherited metabolic disorders. ${ }^{3}$

Preterm infants may have hypertonia, or increased extensor tone in their lower extremities, during the first year of life, as well as decreased truncal tone. Infants who have hypotonia initially may later develop hypertonia or spasticity as the cerebral cortex matures. Asymmetry in muscle tone may not be identified early in infancy due to the primitive reflexes and lack of voluntary control of the musculoskeletal system from the cerebral cortex. Transient hypertonia may be noted in drug-exposed infants in the neonatal period. It generally diminishes during the first year of life and disappears by 2 years of age. If the infant exhibits opisthotonos, a persistent arching of the back and extension of the neck, this indicates serious neurologic compromise and needs urgent referral.

Developmental delays in preterm and term infants may occur in any area of development-gross motor, fine motor, language, social/emotional, and/or cognitive development-but delays are usually first noted in gross motor skills and abilities. Assessing the primitive and postural reflexes will assist the pediatric health care
provider to detect any evidence of delayed maturation of sensory and motor function and prompt earlier referral for evaluation and earlier intervention services. Table 20.2 presents red flags and indicators for delayed cognitive development in an infant with developmental delay.

\section*{Primitive reflexes}

The primitive reflexes appear as early as 25 weeks' gestation. They are involuntary and controlled at birth by the brainstem. Spontaneous movement is dominated by a primitive grasp reflex at birth. ${ }^{4}$ The primitive reflexes should always be symmetrical and are considered abnormal if asymmetrical or absent at birth (Table 20.3; Figs. 20.9 through 20.12). In the first 3 months after birth, term infants search out objects with their eyes rather than their hands and visually fixate on objects and faces by tracking with their eyes. As the primitive reflexes diminish, infants start to voluntarily grasp with their hands. ${ }^{4}$ The primitive reflexes normally diminish by 3 to 4 months of age as the cerebral cortex matures during the first year of life. They disappear altogether in the normal term newborn by 4 to 6 months of age and are considered abnormal if persistent after 6 months of age. The primitive reflexes provide the earliest indication of CNS dysfunction. If an infant is very sleepy, irritable, or satiated after feeds, the primitive reflexes will be diminished and should be reevaluated when the infant is alert between feedings.

\section*{Postural reflexes}

The appearance of the postural reflexes predicts normal development (Table 20.4). The postural reflexes appear between 5 and 6 months in the term infant and progress in a cephalocaudal direction beginning with head control to grasping objects. If postural reflexes do not appear by 8 to 9 months of age, it is considered an abnormal finding. When evaluating tone in early infancy, the infant's head must be kept in the midline position when supine to eliminate eliciting the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (Fig. 20.13). When holding the infant firmly suspended prone in the examiner's hand, the infant should lift the head and extend the spine and lower
extremities (Fig. 20.14). While supporting the trunk, hold the infant just above the examination table to elicit the positive support reflex by lowering the infant to touch the feet gently on the surface of the table to elicit extension of the legs and partial weight bearing (Fig. 20.15). The normal development of the postural reflexes makes upper posture possible. Remnants of the postural reflexes persist throughout life.

\section*{Involuntary motor function}

Tremors, a rhythmic and oscillatory movement of a part of the body with more or less constant frequency and variable intensity, ${ }^{5}$ can be observed intermittently in the term newborn in the first few days after birth and they are generally considered within normal limits. Persistent tremors beyond the newborn period are considered abnormal and require referral and further diagnostic evaluation by a pediatric specialist. ${ }^{5}$

Clonus, rhythmic tonic-clonic movements of the foot elicited by stimulus, can be a normal finding in the newborn. Clonus can be elicited by the examiner's firm touch on the sole of the foot with the finger. In infancy, clonus may indicate an upper motor neuron dysfunction and is considered abnormal as well as exaggerated or asymmetric tendon reflexes which require further diagnostic evaluation and referral if indicated.

Movement disorders in children are characterized by abnormal involuntary movement. ${ }^{6}$ Tics are the most common movement disorder in childhood after 7 years of age and may be motor or vocal. If both vocal and motor tics are present, there may be a need for evaluation for Tourette syndrome. Note that tics can also be simple, involving one body part, or complex, involving several body parts. Children with language or learning difficulties, severe anxiety, and psychiatric disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorders may have associated tic disorders. Simple tics include blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and hand or head jerking. Transient tic disorders, lasting less than 3 months, occur in up to $25 \%$ of normal children, and they cease during sleep. ${ }^{6}$ Chorea is the slow, involuntary, random, twisting movement that can be
seen in children with cerebral palsy and Huntington disease, and Huntington disease is the most frequent cause of hereditary chorea.

Infantile spasms involve the muscles of the neck, trunk, and extremities. ${ }^{7}$ Infantile spasms is an epileptic disorder of infancy and early childhood that presents as repetitive flexor/extensor movements with head nod, mixed movements, or as myoclonictonic spasms or seizures. The peak incidence of onset is between 3 and 7 months of age, and $90 \%$ of affected children present with symptoms by 1 year of age. ${ }^{7}$ The spasms may be subtle, brief, and sudden and may be associated with an underlying disorder. Infantile spasms can cause irreversible brain damage, therefore, prompt referral to a specialist is indicated if infantile spasms are suspected. The diagnostic work up includes electroencephalography (EEG), MRI of the brain, and evaluation by a pediatric neurologist.

\section*{Evaluation of sensory function}

Touch, deep pressure, pain, temperature, and vibration are all characteristics assessed in sensory function. Tactile sensation can be tested in the verbal child by gently touching different areas of the body with a cotton swab when the eyes are closed. The child should be able to identify the spot by pointing to the area of the body. Pain sensation can be tested similarly in the verbal child by touching the body with the sharp and dull ends of a reflex hammer. Temperature and vibration are sensations not usually elicited in early childhood. Discrimination sensation can be assessed in the children older than 5 to 6 years of age using the following tests:
- Stereognosis: The ability to recognize an object by its feel. With eyes closed, ask the child to identify small familiar objects placed in the palm, such as a key or a coin. If you are not testing expressive language, have the child point to the correct object when eyes are open. Children with $C P$ are generally unable to identify the object.
- Graphesthesia: The ability to identify shapes traced on the palm. Younger children are usually tested with shapes and older children with numbers. May be repeated in each palm to ensure accuracy in testing. Children with spatial and proprioceptive dysfunction will not be able to discriminate shapes or numbers.
- Two-point discrimination: A test of spatial discrimination of the body. With the child's eyes closed, touch lightly on the skin with two points in close proximity on the body, and then follow with touching the child with one point. Ask whether the child felt one or two points.
Loss of sensation can reflect impairment in the peripheral nervous system, spinal column, brainstem, or cerebral cortex. Children under 5 years of age often have difficulty with sensory testing and comparing touch points.

\section*{Cranial nerves}

Assessment of the cranial nerves is performed as part of a comprehensive physical examination. Cooperative young children and school-age children usually delight in the activity of testing the cranial nerves. Tables 20.5 and 20.6 summarize the assessment of cranial nerves in infancy and early and middle childhood. Cranial nerve testing may be difficult to assess in infants if they are drowsy, crying, or satiated after feeding and in young children if they are fearful or irritable during the physical examination.

\section*{Deep tendon reflexes}

The reflex arc of the deep tendon reflexes is a complex function of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems and requires an intact sensory neuron, a functional synapse in the spinal cord, an intact motor neuron, a functional neuromuscular junction, and a competent muscle (Table 20.7; Figs. 20.16 through 20.22). Reflex testing is useful in young children because it provides information on the normal development and maturation of the neuromuscular system. Assessment of the deep tendon reflexes may help to distinguish between upper and lower motor neuron lesions. Abnormally brisk reflexes with clonus may suggest upper motor tract involvement. Absent reflexes are consistent with a neuropathic lesion, an inflammatory demyelinating disorder such as Guillian Barre syndrome, or severe myopathy. ${ }^{8}$ Box 20.2 shows assessment of the response to performing deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Further discussion of deep tendon reflexes is presented in Chapter 19.

\section*{Evaluation of cerebellar function}

Assessment of cerebellar function evaluates balance, coordination, cognitive processing, and input from visual, auditory, and touch receptors. The following simple tests can be performed in children during the physical examination and is fun and effective in assessing cerebellar function:
- Romberg test: Assesses balance and equilibrium. This test can be performed in the cooperative 3- or 4-year-old child. Ask the child to stand erect with eyes closed and hands touching the sides. Observe the child's balance for several seconds while monitoring the child closely. Lesions in the cerebellum can cause the child to stagger or fall.
- Finger-to-thumb test: Assesses cerebellar function, coordination, and cognitive processing disorders in middle childhood. Ask the child to touch each finger to the thumb in rapid succession. Test can be performed with one hand at a time and then repeated with both hands.
- Hopping in place: Ask the child to alternately hop on one foot and then the other. Tests for balance, cerebellar function, intact motor function, and spatial sense. The child should be able to maintain balance on one leg by 4 years of age.
- Heel-to-toe walking or tandem walking: Assesses balance and coordination. Ask the child in the kindergarten physical exam to
walk heel to toe in a straight line. This requires a high level of neuromuscular coordination and is often not accomplished until 6 years of age.
- Rapid alternating movements test: Assesses for cerebellar function, coordination, and cognitive processing disorders in the middle childhood. Ask the child to place his or her hands palm down on the thighs. Then demonstrate the rapid, rhythmic movement of the hands back and forth, asking the child to repeat the movement rapidly for 10 seconds. Next ask the child to perform the rapidly alternating movement with one hand only. Inability to perform the task may indicate cognitive or behavioral dysfunction and requires further evaluation. The child should be able to perform by 8 to 9 years of age. Findings of motor overflow, noted when one hand performs a motor task and the other hand mirrors the movement, may indicate a lag in the normal progression of fine motor development in children.
- Finger-to-nose test: Ask the child to close his or her eyes and then touch his or her nose with the first finger of one hand and then with first finger of the other hand. Then, with eyes open, have the child touch their nose with first finger and then touch the examiner's finger held approximately 18 inches in front of the child. Repeat with both hands. Then increase speed of movements with examiner's finger changing position. Consistent failure of child to point at the finger indicates dysfunction in spatial perception and coordination. The child should be able to perform this by 8 to 9 years of age. Inability to perform task may indicate ataxia, lack of coordination caused by cerebellar dysfunction, requiring referral and further diagnostic evaluation.
- Heel to shin test: Assesses coordination and balance in middle childhood. Ask the child to stand and place the right heel on the left shin below the knee and then slide the heel down the shin to the foot. Repeat with the left leg. The test may be performed with the child lying down or sitting. Inability to perform the task or maintain balance may indicate decreased motor strength, a cerebellar dysfunction, or an alteration in proprioception.

\section*{Evaluation of cerebral function}

Assessing general cerebral function in children requires evaluating the level of consciousness, mood and affect, thought, memory, judgment, and communication. In the developing child, cerebral function is more challenging to assess than in adults. In the child with head trauma, the basic components of the initial neurologic examination include (1) pupil reactivity, (2) assessing level of consciousness, (3) sensory function, and (4) motor function.

The Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is an adapted assessment tool that assesses the level of consciousness for children with blunt head trauma. ${ }^{9}$ For both preverbal ( $<2$ years of age) and verbal ( $>2$ years of age) children, the Pediatric GCS correlates with the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). ${ }^{10}$ For infants and young children, the Pediatric GCS assess visual acuity with the ability to open the eye spontaneously (response to speech, to pain, or no response); verbal cues (coos and babbles appropriately, irritable cries inconsolable, cries or screams persistently to pain, grunts or moans to pain, or no response); and motor function (normal spontaneous movements, withdraws to touch, withdraws to pain, abnormal flexion, abnormal extension, or no response) which reflect the functional integrity of the major CNS pathways (Table 20.8).

\section*{Diagnostic procedures}

Pediatric health care providers in most pediatric health care settings have adopted an Image Gently policy and an As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) policy to limit frequent cumulative exposure to radiologic diagnostic procedures. ${ }^{11}$ Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more often used to evaluate neurologic injury or a cerebral abnormality related to developmental delay. Computed tomography (CT) is the most common diagnostic tool for evaluation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cranial abnormalities such as a skull fracture or acute hemorrhage. Indications for CT in a child who presents with blunt head trauma are presented in Box 20.3. Clinical assessment is key in influencing provider choice to image, as well as access to timely imaging and need for conscious sedation for the young child.

\section*{BOX 20.3}

\section*{Red Flag Indications for Head Computed Tomography for Child with Blunt Head Trauma}

High risk with one of the following:
- Suspicion of child abuse
- Focal neurologic findings
- Acute skull fracture, including depressed or basilar fracture
- Altered mental status (lethargy or irritability)
- Bulging fontanel
- Persistent vomiting
- Seizure following injury
- Definite loss of consciousness if longer than a few seconds and especially if associated with other neurologic findings

Adapted from Schutzman S. Minor head trauma in infants and chlidren: Evaluation. UpToDate 2017; https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation. Accessed May, 2017.

For infants or children presenting with history of spasms or seizures, EEG is used as the diagnostic tool. Ultrasound may be used in evaluating neonates and infants with an open anterior fontanel for hydrocephalus or intraventricular hemorrhages.

\section*{Neurologic conditions}

Table 20.9 presents the most common neurologic conditions occurring in infants, children, and adolescents. TBI and concussion are also addressed further in Chapter 19.

\section*{TABLE 20.9 \\ Neurologic Conditions in Infants, Children, and Adolescents}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Condition & Description \\
\hline Abusive head trauma & Characterized by severe trauma or shaking in small infants causing acceleration and deceleration of the delicate brain tissue within the periosteum, resulting in retinal hemorrhages and subarachnoid and subdural hematomas. Shaken baby syndrome can also result in epidural hematoma. Severe trauma can be fatal. \\
\hline Prader-Willi syndrome & A rare chromosomal disorder characterized by hypotonia, insatiable appetite, obesity and uncontrolled appetite, hypogonadism, incomplete sexual development, and developmental delay. \\
\hline Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and 2 & Characterized by six or more cafÃ© au lait macules over 5 mm in diameter, axillary or inguinal freckling noted in infancy or early childhood, subcutaneous neurofibromas or optic nerve gliomas. In NF-2, children present with acoustic nerve tumors. \\
\hline Migraine headache in children & Characterized by pulsating pain and high pain intensity. May be associated with chronic daily headaches in up to $53 \%$ of children presenting with migraine headaches. ${ }^{8}$ \\
\hline Tension-type headaches in children & Characterized by pressing, mild pain and described as less intense than migraine headaches. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Cerebral palsy}

CP is a permanent, nonprogressive central motor dysfunction disorder that affects muscle tone, posture, and movement. ${ }^{12}$ The overall prevalence of CP is 2 per 1000 live births, and the risk for CP increases in preterm births, with a prevalence of 6.8 to 1000 live births in infants 32 to 36 weeks gestation. ${ }^{13}$ The etiology is multifactorial often with intraventricular hemorrhage or a brain insult or injury to the CNS as a primary contributing factor in preterm infants. There are numerous prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal risk factors for the development of CP, but the most common risk factors are perinatal hypoxia and neonatal asphyxia. Intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine infection, and multiple pregnancies also increase the risk of CP in preterm and term infants. ${ }^{14}$ CP is often referred to as static encephalopathy with a delayed developmental presentation. Although CP is a motor disorder, it can also be associated with additional developmental disabilities and cognitive impairment depending on the degree of brain injury. CP may be classified as a pyramidal (spastic) or an extrapyramidal (nonspastic) disorder, indicating the area of the brain that has been affected and the predominant disability. Children with CP may present with a wide range of abilities and may have asymmetric motor dysfunction and normal cognition or severe
motor dysfunction and delayed cognitive abilities.

\section*{Interprofessional collaboration}

Interprofessional collaboration is paramount for children and adolescents with neurological disorders. It is important for the pediatric health care providers to provide team-based collaborative care with pediatric neurological and developmental specialists, occupational and physical therapists, behavioral health, and learning specialists to assess cognitive and intellectual function, and gross and fine motor skills in children with CP. This will ensure prompt early interventions that foster the child's full developmental and intellectual potential.

\section*{Down syndrome}

Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosomal abnormality in children. The prevalence of Down syndrome is 1.1 out of 1000 live births. Common characteristics of Down syndrome include facies with upward slanting palpebral fissures and inner epicanthal folds, flattened nasal area, brachydactyly or abnormal shortening of fingers and toes with wide-spaced first and second toes, simian crease, hypotonia, macroglossia, and mental retardation. Infants and children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for congenital cardiac defects, duodenal atresia, leukemia, thyroid dysfunction, visual and hearing defects, obesity, atlanto-occipital joint instability that impacts extension and flexion movements, and delayed sexual development. Strabismus and refractive errors are also common. Approximately $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of children with Down syndrome have autism spectrum disorder. Careful assessment of cognitive and intellectual function by the pediatric health care provider as well as developmental milestones is important to assist the child in developing to his or her full potential.

\section*{Summary of examination}
- Assessment of muscle tone and strength is a key component of evaluating the development of the neurologic system. Evaluate
tone and strength in the young infant by observing the resting posture and assessing movement of extremities.
- Assess balance, gait, and agility as the older infant walks, pivots, and turns while holding on to the parent's hand.
- Development delays in preterm and term infants can occur in any area of gross motor, fine motor, language, social/emotional, or cognitive skills, but delays are usually first noted in gross motor skills and abilities.
- Evaluating primitive and postural reflexes assesses sensory and motor function in the young infant.
- Cranial nerve testing and deep tendon reflex testing is performed in young children to assess normal development and maturation of the neuromuscular system.
- The Pediatric GCS assesses cerebellar and CNS function by evaluating level of consciousness, pupil reactivity, motor function, and verbal response
