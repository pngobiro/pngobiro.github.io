                        <p>Growth is the most dynamic aspect of childhood. In the early years, height and weight measurements are key indicators of health. Abnormal progression of weight gain and/or height parameters is often the first indicator to the health care provider of abnormalities in growth and maturation patterns. Growth normally proceeds in a predictable pattern during childhood, from cephalocaudal (head to tail) and proximodistal (near to far). Plotting serial measurements regularly on a standardized growth curve for age and gender is a reliable method of monitoring growth and is an essential component of comprehensive well-child care. Gender- and agespecific standardized growth charts are available at https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm</p>
                        <p>Accurate assessment of growth begins in the newborn period by evaluating progress on the growth curve and continues throughout childhood and adolescence by evaluating growth in relation to age. An accurate assessment of gestational age in the newborn begins with the prenatal and birth history; it can help the provider anticipate conditions associated with preterm birth. Infants can be classified by gestational age as term infant, preterm infant, or postterm infant. See Chapter 6 for a review of newborn assessment parameters. It is important to use the correct technique when gathering measurements of infants, children, and adolescents; doing this is one of the significant challenges in pediatrics. Table 2.1 presents average weight, height, and head circumference gains from infancy through middle childhood and adolescence growth patterns.</p>

                        <p>Measurement of head circumference is a routine part of growth assessment in the first 2 years of life. An accurate measurement of the head is taken with the measuring tape placed around the head at the point of greatest circumference from the occipital protuberance above the base of the skull to the midforehead or point of greatest bossing of the frontal bone (Fig. 2.1). The head circumference measurement is then plotted on the growth curve specific for sex and age at each well-child visit to determine if the growth pattern is normal. If the initial head measurement is plotted on the growth chart and indicates a concerning pattern of growth, it is important to remeasure the head to ensure accuracy of head size. A head circumference that plots 1 to 2 SD above height and weight on the growth curve or >95th percentile or <5th percentile for age should be evaluated. Microcephaly may be indicative of a small-forgestational (SGA) infant, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), or premature closure of the cranial sutures, termed craniosynostosis, which requires immediate referral. Macrocephaly, a large head in proportion to the body size, may indicate increased intracranial pressure or may be a familial variant. Consistent and accurate assessment of the head circumference is a critical part of the evaluation of normal growth and development in the first year of life.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chest circumference</h3>
                        <p>Chest circumference is smaller at birth than head circumference. Chest circumference is measured at the nipple line. The head circumference is normally 2 cm greater than the chest circumference in the first 6 months of life. Molding of the head in the term newborn may make it appear as though the measurements are equal. By 1 year of age, the chest circumference should closely equal the head circumference. With the progression of growth, the chest circumference becomes larger than the head circumference at about 2 years of age and continues to grow more rapidly during childhood. Chest measurements are not routinely taken unless an infant has abnormal physical findings at birth or demonstrates abnormal growth.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Height</h3>
                        <p>Height is the most stable measurement of growth and maturation in childhood. Linear growth is genetically predetermined, and therefore adult height generally occurs within a predictable range if accurate family history is available. Linear growth often occurs in spurts followed by long quiescent periods in which no growth occurs. Infants and young children may demonstrate an increase in appetite before a growth spurt, followed by an increased need for sleep.</p>
                        <p>For the infant or toddler, recumbent height is required for accurate measurement of linear growth. Place the infant supine on a flat surface or examination table equipped with a measuring device or length board (Box 2.1). Accurate measurement requires the infant's legs to be flat against the measuring device with the foot in the level position and head held erect against the measuring device (Fig. 2.2). Term newborns vary in height between 45 to 55 cm (18 and 22 inches) at birth, and height increases by approximately 2.54 cm ( 1 inch) per month over the first few months of life. Although infant measurement is often taken on the examination table by marking the position of the top of the head and the bottom of the foot on table paper and then determining length with a measuring tape, this method can result in inaccurate measurements. Always compare linear measurements with previous growth trends to assure accuracy. [1]</p>

                        <p>Term infants generally increase in length by 50% in the first year. The increase is primarily in truncal growth. Doubling the height at 2 years of age can give an estimate of adult height (see Table 2.1). After 2 years of age transition to standing height is most accurate and appropriate, however, recumbent height with a measuring device is often easier to obtain in the first part of the second year if the child is fearful. The increase in height averages 3 inches ( 7.5 cm ) over the second and third years. Measurement is recorded without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm or 0.25 inches. Standing height should be taken using a wall-mounted or portable stadiometer for accuracy. Accurate measurement requires a cooperative child to stand erect with head level, feet flat, and heels against the measuring surface (Fig. 2.3). From the end of the third year until the onset of puberty, the increase in height averages 3 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches) per year. In adolescence, girls' height potential is generally realized by 16 years of age, and boys' growth potential continues until 18 years of age. Linear growth ceases when the maturation of the skeleton is complete (see Chapters 16 and 18 for discussions of growth and sexual maturity rating).</p>

                        <p>In familial short stature, growth follows a curve below the normal growth curves, and both parents and infant are small. Familial short stature is often not recognized as the most likely assessment for slow linear growth when parents are anxious about their child's height. Poor nutritional status is less often the cause of short stature. Linear growth deficiency (stunting) or short stature may be a key indicator in children with chronic conditions including cardiac and renal disease, fetal alcohol syndrome, methadone exposure, metabolic abnormalities, growth hormone deficiency, or chromosomal abnormalities.

                            <p>Height at 2 years of age is approximately 50% of adult height. To estimate adult height, double the height at 2 years of age. [1]</p>

                        <p>An adolescent male or female of tall stature with a disproportionate arm length should be evaluated for arm span measurement. This should be taken with the arms outstretched. Measure the distance from the tip of the middle finger across the crest of the shoulders to the other middle fingertip. The arm span should equal the height. In Marfan syndrome, the arm span exceeds the height and is associated with a disproportionate appearance.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Weight</h3>
                        <p>The average birth weight in term infants is 3175 to 3400 g ( 7 to 7.5 lb). The average range of weight in a healthy term newborn is from 2500 to 4000 g ( 5 lb 8 oz to 8 lb 13 oz ). Infants may lose up to 10% of their birth weight in the first week of life and normally regain it by the end of the second week. [1] Poor weight gain in early infancy is indicative of failure to thrive and may be caused by poor feeding patterns, malnutrition, neglect, cardiac or renal disease, chronic infection, or chromosomal and congenital anomalies.</p>
                        <p>Infants can be accurately weighed lying on an infant balance scale while wearing a dry diaper. Infants should be weighed in the sitting position only with extreme caution and only after they are able to sit without support. Weight is recorded to the nearest 0.5 oz or 0.01 kg ( 10 g ). After 2 years of age, standing weight should be recorded to the nearest 0.25 lb or 0.1 kg ( 100 g ; see Box 2.1). If a young child is very fearful or irritable, parent and child can be weighed together on standing scale; then parental weight is subtracted from total weight to obtain an estimate of child's weight. For children with special health care needs or disabilities, accommodations for wheelchair scales or special purpose scales should be made available in the clinical setting.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Adiposity</h3>
                        <p>Adipose tissue is a unique form of connective tissue with cells that maintain a large intracellular space. These adipocytes, or fat cells, store large quantities of triglycerides and are a repository of energy in the body. More than 90% of the body's energy is stored in the adipose tissue, and lipids are the main source for stored fuel in the body. [2] Although adipocytes do not reproduce, they do have a long life span, and infants born with a large numbers of fat cells are at risk for obesity in childhood. In a typical pattern of growth and development in children, adipose tissue typically declines in later infancy, with the lowest point in early childhood; it then rebounds in middle childhood through the adolescent growth spurt, as shown by the upturn in the age- and sex-specific child growth charts and the body mass index (BMI) curve. This upturn in the growth curve is known as adiposity rebound and is normally expected at about 5 to 7 years of age. [3] Large weight gains in infancy and early childhood alter the normal pattern of growth and adiposity rebound. Thus, early adiposity rebound is associated with increased depositions of fat in middle childhood, and risks associated with early adiposity rebound persist at least until early adulthood. [3] Gestation, early infancy, middle childhood, and adolescence are critical periods for the development of adiposity; the focus for pediatric health care providers is to closely monitor the pattern of the growth curve and BMI to help parents and families maintain healthy weights throughout childhood. [3]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Body mass index for age in children</h3>
                        <p>BMI provides a guideline for health care providers to determine the healthy weight of a child beginning at 2 years of age based on height. The formula for determining BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (BMI = weight [kg]/ height squared [m<sup>2</sup>]). Calculating and plotting BMI during the routine health visit and discussing this information with parents and families is an important part of providing comprehensive well-child care. BMI is used to determine whether a child or adolescent is underweight, overweight, or obese, and interpretation of the BMI growth chart in children depends on age and sex. The BMI growth curve is easier to use than the standard weight-for-height on the age-and-sex growth charts to point out weight trends to parents. Children with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex or a BMI greater than or equal to 30 are considered obese, and children with a BMI between the 85th and 94th percentiles for age and sex are considered overweight (Table 2.2). Electronic health records (EHRs) include growth charts and calculate and plot BMIs, making it easily available to review with parents and families. There are no BMI parameters for children under 2 years of age. However, children younger than 2 years of age who have a weight-to-height ratio on the standard growth curve of &ge;95th percentile for age and sex are considered overweight.</p>

                        <p>The overall prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents between 2 and 19 years old in the United States is 17%. For children 6 to 11 years of age, the overall prevalence of obesity is 17.5%; in adolescence, it is 20.5%. There are significant differences by race and ethnicity for the prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly among non-Hispanic black children (19.5%) and Hispanic (21.9%) children 2 to 19 years of age. [4] Overweight is defined as a BMI &ge;85% and obesity is defined as a BMI &ge;95% for age-sex-specific growth charts. [4]</p>
                        <p>The prevalence of childhood overweight has remained stable over the past decade, and presents a serious pediatric health concern. Increased BMI in childhood is associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease in adulthood and the early onset of type 2 diabetes. [5, 6, 7] Obesity has its origins in early life, and routine serial measurements of height and weight in the growing infant and child are most important in evaluating trends in weight gain early and communicating this information to parents and families. Rapid weight gain in early infancy, early adiposity rebound in childhood, and early pubertal development all influence the risk of becoming overweight and have been implicated in the development of childhood obesity.</p>
                        <p>The categories of BMI percentiles may not adequately define risk of obesity-related comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia, in children. [8] Overweight children have different levels of body fatness and degrees of risk factors. Obese children are taller than children of average weight, often 1 standard deviation above their counterparts for age. Abdominal obesity is identified as an important factor in the adverse health effects of childhood obesity. A high ratio of waist circumference to height has been associated with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes in adolescents. Among overweight children, a high ratio of waist circumference to height is more strongly associated with adverse risk factors than a high BMI for age or skinfold thickness. [8]</p>

                        <p>Asian children may be at risk for comorbidities due to obesity at lower BMI thresholds than other ethnic groups. The risk of comorbidity is modified by actual body composition, family history of comorbidity, birth weight, and other variables, including race/ethnicity. [9] A recent study of South Asian children has shown BMI cutoffs at &ge;95% for obesity and &ge;85% for overweight on the age-and-sex growth charts may not approximate risks, indicating a need for additional anthropometric measures and/or ethnic-specific criteria. Waist circumference-to-height ratio has been identified as a more accurate predictor for ethnic-specific BMI identifiers for overweight and obesity, but further research is needed. [9] South Asian and East Asian children have a higher percentage of body fat than other racial and ethnic groups of the same age, sex, and BMI and may experience greater obesity-related comorbidities at lower BMI cutoffs on the age-and-sex growth charts.

                        <p>Assessment of temperament is a key part of comprehensive health assessment in infants, children, and adolescents. Temperament is the inborn tendency to react to one's environment in certain ways and is thought to be generally constant and at least partially genetically determined. The personality of an individual child reflects the interaction between the child's temperament and environment. Temperament can be assessed by report, clinical observation, or by a formal assessment tool. The term goodness of fit describes the concept of how well the child's temperament meets the expectations of his or her parents and caregivers. Goodness of fit promotes healthy development in the family unit through adaptation to the infant's personality, and it has a critical influence on a child's emotional well-being and behavior. Table 2.3 identifies the nine characteristics of temperament. Certain temperamental characteristics may be associated with resiliency in children, whereas other characteristics may signal emotional difficulties. Characteristics of frustration tolerance and intensity may be specific indicators of emotional dysregulation in some children and may indicate an underlying dysfunction in affective processes that significantly increases risk for mood disorders in later childhood or in adulthood. [11] An easy temperament with strong characteristics of regularity and adaptability acts as a protective factor for socialemotional development and could be related to resilience in children living in an adverse social environment.

                        <p>An understanding of temperamental characteristics removes judgment and blame and helps parents to recognize that all rules do not work equally well with all children. Setting limits and time out is more difficult with some children, and some children are more difficult to discipline and require more parental ingenuity. Temperament theory objectifies these differences. A comprehensive approach to assessing development includes assessing and understanding temperament and sharing this information with parents and caregivers.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Temperature</h3>
                        <p>Measurement of temperature continues to be a dynamic process in the infant and young child. Much discussion has occurred on the accuracy of temperature measurement and the ideal instrument to use. Currently there is a range of methods for measuring temperature in the infant and young child.</p>
                        <p>Axillary temperature measurement is the recommended method for the healthy newborn. Place the electronic digital thermometer under the arm at the base of the axilla for 3 to 5 minutes and hold the arm firmly against the side of the body with swaddling.</p>
                        <p>Research has shown parental report of axillary temperature measurement can be considered reliable and has shown a high correlation with measurement by trained, experienced staff. [13]</p>
                        <p>Rectal temperature remains the standard and most reliable method for detecting core body temperature in infants and young children. Rectal temperature aligns more closely with the core body temperature than axillary, temporal, or tympanic measurements. In early infancy to 8 to 9 months of age, rectal temperature is most accurately measured with the infant placed in the supine position on the examining table with knees flexed toward the abdomen. The infant can see the practitioner and be secured more easily in this position. Proper positioning prevents injury. In males, stimulation often elicits urination, so the penis should be covered. A child from 9 months to 2 years of age can be placed in the parent's arms or laid supine on the parent's lap. Insert the lubricated tip of thermometer into the anal opening of the rectum a distance of 0.5 to 1 inch. Rectal measurement of temperature remains the recommended standard in clinical practice for infants under 1 month of age to determine fever and when considering further diagnostic evaluation. Oral measurement is the preferred method for cooperative children over 4 years of age. Oral temperature is typically 0.6&deg;C (1.0&deg;F) lower than rectal temperature. Oral temperature readings can vary by thermometer position and in children with mouth breathing, tachypnea, or respiratory distress.</p>
                        <p>Tympanic membrane thermometer readings can vary depending on proper positioning in the ear, impacted cerumen, and/or otitis media. Recent studies comparing tympanic membrane and rectal temperatures in children have had contradictory results; it has been concluded that tympanic membrane thermometry shows insufficient agreement with established methods of core body temperature measurement to be used in infants and children where detection of fever has clinical implications and requires diagnostic workup. [14, 15]</p>
                        <p>Noncontact infrared thermometers are often used by parents and in some clinical settings as a noninvasive method for measuring temperature for infants and young children. Temperature is measured by pointing the infrared beams of light approximately 3 cm from the forehead or naval. Research comparing the accuracy of the noncontact infrared thermometers with rectal temperatures has been inconclusive. Infrared thermometry has tended to overestimate the temperature of afebrile children and underestimate the temperature of febrile patients (P&lt;.01). [16] Temperatures measured with noncontact infrared thermometers in comparison with rectal temperatures varied significantly and did not reliably predict fever in infants and young children. [17] The digital thermometer provides the best agreement with the traditional mercury-in-glass thermometer in detecting fever in infants and young children. [18]</p>
                        <p>For smart phones, apps are now available for measuring temperature in the pediatric population. An external sensor is required and the accuracy of the temperature depends on the quality of the sensor. Currently there is no standardization and no studies are available on the specificity and sensitivity of the external sensors.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pulse</h3>
                        <p>Although pulse is most often monitored electronically, pulses should be assessed for the quality of rate, rhythm, and volume or strength, and it is important to detect any differences in pulse between the upper and lower extremities. Children under 2 years of age require apical pulse (AP) measurements. Readings should be taken when the child is quiet. AP measurements are taken with the stethoscope placed over the heart below the nipple at the apex. For children over 2 years of age, the radial pulse is a satisfactory measurement. In infants and young children, the pulse should be counted for a full minute to account for irregularities in rhythm. Fig. 2.4 illustrates the location of the pulses. The radial and femoral pulses should be evaluated and compared for strength and quality. Detecting the femoral pulse in newborn and young infants requires focus and concentration by the examiner. The femoral pulse is located in the midinguinal area over the head of the femur. In children who are overweight or obese, locating the femoral pulse is challenging and requires palpating through adipose tissue to determine the presence and strength of the pulse. An absent or weak pulse in the lower extremities compared with the upper extremities is diagnostic of coarctation of the aorta. Table 2.4 presents the grading of pulses used to evaluate strength and quality.</p>

                        <p>Respirations should be assessed for rate and pattern. They should be taken when the child is quiet to accurately assess the rate and quality of breathing. In infants and young children, observe the abdominal movements when you are evaluating respiratory rate. An infant's breathing is primarily diaphragmatic. Also evaluate the use of any accessory muscles in the upper chest or any difficulty breathing. Respirations should be assessed for a full minute, because the typical respiratory rate is irregular in the newborn and very young infant. Table 2.5 shows the normal range of vital signs in children.</p>

                        <p>Measurement of oxygen saturation has become a standard in most clinical settings for respiratory assessment in the pediatric patient. Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive method of determining oxygen saturation (Spo<sub>2</sub>) and should be part of the criteria for evaluating any infant for respiratory distress or cardiovascular defects or any child presenting with wheezing, respiratory distress, respiratory compromise, or for preoperative evaluation. A normal Spo<sub>2</sub> of 95% to 96% is adequate, and 97% is generally considered to be normal. A Spo<sub>2</sub> &le;92% is considered hypoxemic. Spo<sub>2</sub> assists the practitioner in clinical decision making when the need for prolonged observation or hospital admission is being determined. Pulse oximetry alone may detect cyanotic heart disease in the asymptomatic newborn, preventing morbidity and delayed diagnosis of cardiac disease. [2]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Blood pressure</h3>
                        <p>Blood pressure should be assessed at all routine well-child visits beginning at 3 years of age. In infants and children younger than 3 years of age, blood pressure should be evaluated in children who are at risk for cardiac defects or who experience trauma or have chronic conditions. The size of the blood pressure cuff is critical to obtaining an accurate measurement. The blood pressure cuff should cover about two thirds of the upper arm and should encircle the arm once. A cuff that is too large will result in a low blood pressure reading. If the cuff is too small, the blood pressure reading may be too high. For obese children and adolescents, an extra-large adult cuff may be needed to obtain an accurate measurement. Blood pressure readings can increase in children who are crying and in children and adolescents who are feeling anxious. Table 2.5 reviews the normal range of blood pressure at different ages. For healthy children and adolescents with a blood pressure reading at or above the 90th percentile for age, three independent readings should be taken to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pain</h3>
                        <p>An accurate assessment of pain response in infants and young children requires strategies specific to the developmental level of the child. The use of the pain scale in children 3 years of age and older has greatly improved the ability of the health care practitioner to accurately assess and treat pain in the pediatric patient. Fig. 2.5 presents the FACES pain rating scale used across most pediatric clinical settings. [19] For nonverbal children, cognitively impaired children, or children with special health care needs, the revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Scale has been validated for evaluating postoperative pain in the acute care setting and for pain secondary to trauma or other chronic conditions. [20] Zero to two points is assigned to each of the five categories on the scale, and total score from 0 to 10 reflects no pain to severe pain. Table 2.6 presents the FLACC Behavioral Scale.</p>

Ask the child to choose the face that best describes its own pain, and record the appropriate number. Note: Use of these instructions is recommended. A rating scale can be used with children 3 years of age and older. Original instructions: Explain to the child that each face is for a person who feels happy because he has no pain (hurt) or sad because he has some or a lot of pain. FACE 0 is very happy because he doesn't hurt at all. FACE 1 hurts just a little bit. FACE 2 hurts a little more. FACE 3 hurts even more. FACE 4 hurts a whole lot. FACE 5 hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying to feel this bad. Ask the child to choose face that best describes how much hurt he has. Record the number under the chosen face on the pain assessment record.</figcaption>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inspection</h3>
                        <p>Inspection is about looking. Inspection is a skill acquired by developing detailed and meticulous observation of children and learning to see the whole as well as the parts. It involves not only the sense of sight but also the senses of hearing and smell. Inspection requires good room lighting and complete visibility of the body part to be examined to accurately assess symmetry, shape, color, and odor. It is an essential skill for the pediatric health care provider, particularly when interacting with the nonverbal child, the young pediatric patient, or a child who is ill.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation</h3>
                        <p>Palpation is about touching and feeling, a skill used to detect temperature, vibration, position, and mobility of body organs and glands. Palpation appreciates shape, pulsation, texture, and hydration of the skin and tenderness. It detects masses and differences in size and shape of glands, organs, muscles, and bones in all parts of the body. The fingertips are most sensitive to tactile differences, the backs of the fingers are most sensitive to temperature, and flattened fingers and palm on the chest detect vibrations. The examiner's hands should move smoothly over the body without hesitation, first using light palpation, then followed by deep, firm pressure with palpation. It is important to know the distinction between palpation and massage. Massage incorporates rubbing, in contrast to the technique of palpation, which is the movement of the fingers over an area using light to firm pressure for the purpose of identifying size, location, mobility, sensitivity, and temperature of lymph nodes, muscles, tissues, and body organs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Percussion</h3>
                        <p>Percussion is a helpful skill for mapping out the borders of the organs or sternum and for determining the presence of solid tumors. Percussion requires using the examiner's fingers and hands to produce sounds on the area of the body being examined. The density of the body parts is determined by the sounds emitted when the examiner's finger strikes the middle finger of the opposite hand. The fingers produce sounds ranging from the least dense sound, tympany or resonance, as heard over the stomach or intestines, to the most dense sound, dullness or flatness, produced by striking over bone. This technique can be useful when examining the abdomen to detect the size of an organ prior to diagnostic imaging.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Auscultation</h3>
                        <p>Auscultation is listening to body sounds transmitted through the stethoscope. With infants and small children, low-pitched cardiac sounds are heard best with the bell-shaped side of the stethoscope, and high-pitched lung and bowel sounds are best heard with the diaphragm, or flat portion, of the stethoscope. The bell shape is effective in isolating cardiac sounds from stomach sounds in the young infant. For best results during the physical examination of a child, it is essential to match the size of the stethoscope head to the size of the child proportionately, or the pressure on the head of a dynamic stethoscope. In listening to the lungs and heart, it is important to develop the skill to screen out adventitious sounds that occur in infants and children. The close proximity of the organs requires the examiner to screen out stomach and abdominal sounds in listening to the heart and the respirations in the lung. The techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation are among the most important tools available to the examiner for accurate diagnosis. When applied correctly, they can limit unnecessary and expensive diagnostic testing for the child or adolescent and family.</p>
