                        <p>Pediatric health care providers have a unique role in the development of a child's health over a lifetime. Health is an interactive, dynamic process shaped by genetics, exposures, human experiences, and individual choice. [1] From a life course perspective, early experiences can "program" a child's health and development. [1] Protective factors, such as a nurturing family and safe neighborhood, improve health and contribute to healthy development, whereas risk factors, such as limited access to quality health care and social services, have a negative effect on a child's development and ability to reach his or her full developmental potential. [1]</p>
                        <p>A significant body of literature indicates that many chronic conditions in adulthood and disparities in adult health have their origins during childhood and increase over time. [2] Physical, cognitive, and social-emotional health are established in the early years of life. Pediatric health care providers are now charged with identifying developmental concerns early and focusing on interventions that promote the health and well-being of children and families and limit the adverse effects of toxic stress on brain development. [2] Toxic stress, in contrast to tolerable stressors during childhood, is defined as prolonged activation of the physiologic stress response system that is not buffered by environmental protections or by stable, responsive parent and caregiver relationships. [2] Early investments in health promotion can empower healthy choices for both child and family, greatly improve child health outcomes, alter the life course, and decrease the cost of health care services.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Children have unique needs because of their long period of dependency and development, which presents a unique challenge to the pediatric health care provider. Children's health and wellbeing depend greatly on the care received from their family units and the environment in which they live. Addressing the needs of the parent or caregiver while caring for the child and fostering a healthy relationship in the family unit are among the most important and challenging tasks in pediatrics.</p>
                        <p>Care is best provided in a patient-centered medical or health care home, which promotes holistic care of the child and family by partnering with a primary pediatric health care provider. The patient-centered health care home allows the provider to create a trusting partnership, to limit the effects of psychosocial adversity in childhood, and to improve the quality of care through empowering and supporting the family unit. [3] Children, adolescents, and families benefit from motivational and anticipatory guidance in health promotion, and care provided over time by the same provider is associated with higher odds of receiving multiple preventive services, particularly for adolescents. [4] The caring relationship established by the primary care provider reinforces positive parenting and provides behavioral consultation to the child, adolescent, and family at critical periods of development.</p>
                        <p>A caring relationship includes a patient-provider relationship without bias in regard to racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic difference. The attitudes and behaviors of health care providers has been identified among many factors contributing to health disparities. [5] Implicit attitudes are those thoughts and feelings that exist outside of conscious awareness and are difficult to acknowledge and control. [5] Implicit biases can influence behavior and clinical decision making without the provider's awareness. [5, 6] The perception of bias in clinical encounters undermines the caring relationship. Health care providers must make conscious efforts to overcome bias in their actions. Educating providers on racial, cultural, and socioeconomic biases, self-regulating behavior, and helping them to develop new mental habits can ensure the highest quality of care for all children and families.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>One of the most important aspects of the health interview is observing and eliciting interactions between the parent and child or adolescent. Analyzing verbal responses and interactions during the encounter gives the health care provider an idea of how the parental relationship fosters child development and child selfesteem. It also gives the health care provider a window into the child's world. Interactions between the parent or caregiver, the family members, and the health care provider reveal family dynamics, family connectedness, family authority, and the approach to problem solving.</p>
                        <p>Nonverbal cues provide the most revealing picture of the child's demeanor and of the parent-child relationship and give the health care provider additional understanding of the context in which the child lives. Stop and observe these cues, and verbalize your concerns to the parent and child: "You look sad today. Can you tell me what that is about?" Ask yourself the following: Is the parent or caregiver disengaged with the child or infant during the encounter? Does the parent appear depressed or angry? Does the data from the health interview fit with the demeanor of the child during the encounter?</p>
                        <p>A child who is withdrawn, refuses to make eye contact, or is consistently stressed when communicating with a parent is exhibiting signs of strain in her or his environment. This should alert the health care provider to communicate her or his concern to the family and provide support, counseling, and referral when indicated. Children often mirror the emotions of the adults around them. Families involved in conflict, who have experienced violence, or who are under stress often cannot see their own interactions clearly or the effect that their interactions have on the child. Pediatric health care providers should assess parenting behaviors by asking open-ended questions, such as "How do you handle negative child behaviors in the home?" or "How do you negotiate limiting screen time?". [8] By fostering and supporting effective parenting in early childhood and providing problem-based counseling, the pediatric health care provider offers a service that is critical to the healthy psychosocial development of the child.

                        <p>A large part of the social and emotional development of children and adolescents is now occurring while they are using mobile devices. Children's virtual lives constitute a larger part of their social interactions daily. It is important for parents and caregivers to monitor children's social media, gaming, web, and cell phone activities for their potential impact on the child's emotional health. Population-based studies have shown associations between excessive screen time and cognitive, language, and social-emotional developmental delay. [9] Infants with more handheld screen time are at increased risk for expressive speech delay. [10] Excessive screen time in middle childhood and adolescence may involve bullying or peer-to-peer communications that pose potential risks to their privacy and safety.</p>
                        <p>Heavy parental use of mobile devices is associated with fewer verbal and nonverbal interactions between parents and children; therefore, reducing parental media use and enhancing parent-child interactions may be an important area of family behavioral change. [9] The quality of parenting can modify the associations between media use and the child's speech and language development. Introducing high-quality programming and viewing programs together with children is the recommended approach, along with limiting daily screen time. [9] Temperament may also influence how much media children consume. Excessive media use is often more likely in young children with self-regulation problems, and these children will present greater challenges with parental limit setting. [9]</p>
                        <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has a Media and Children Communication Toolkit that provides parent with resources to help them manage screen time.

                        <p>The view of the parent or caregiver and the view of the child may differ quite remarkably, and this difference can often affect health care decisions and treatment outcomes. Promoting opportunities for children and adolescents to contribute to health care decisions creates a child-centered approach to care that empowers and enables the child or adolescent within the family unit.</p>
                        <p>A model to facilitate children's participation in the health history provides a framework for communication that is attentive, sensitive, and values the child's perspective while capturing the shared responsibility of families, health care professionals, and health care organizations. [11] The model proposes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Irrespective of age the child is listened to.</li>
                            <li>The child is supported in expressing his or her views.</li>
                            <li>The child's views are taken into account.</li>
                            <li>The child is involved in the decision-making process.</li>

                        <p>It is essential that health care professionals attend to the increasing diversity within a globally connected society. [12] The increasing global immigration of populations will continue to pose challenges to health care professionals working with diverse populations. Providers will be required to assess the extent to which culture plays a role in health care decisions in the family and how it impacts treatment plans and adherence to these plans. An understanding of diversity must include not only knowledge of the culture but also respect and the tailoring of communications to embrace and value diversity. [12]</p>
                        <p>Cultural beliefs also affect care-seeking behavior and the delivery of clinical care by health care providers. Effective models of care incorporate sensitivity to cultural differences and enhance the protective factors of cultural practices within families. Studies demonstrate that differences within ethnic groups are as great as the cultural differences between groups; therefore no valid assumptions can be made in health care on the basis of physical appearance or surname. It is important for providers to acknowledge cultural differences, understand their own background and culture, and understand how that influences the care they deliver. They also must engage in self-assessment, acquire cultural knowledge and skills consistent with the practice setting, and value diversity within the health care team. Cultural humility involves a change in overall perspective around diversity and increasing awareness of power imbalances in the provider-patient relationship. [12]</p>
                        <p>Ideally, delivery of health care services should occur in the first language of the client. When this is not possible, a model framework for the encounter between the health care provider, child, and family should include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognizing language barriers and effectively using interpreters</li>
                            <li>Exploring parental beliefs and their impact on the child</li>
                            <li>Building on family strengths</li>
                            <li>Recognizing and exploring the use of cultural beliefs and alternative therapies, how they influence child health, and the effect on clinical care</li>
                            <li>Understanding, as the health care provider, how your personal values and beliefs influence care delivery and affect health outcomes</li>
                            <li>Altering care practices to eliminate disparities in health care delivery related to race/ethnicity and economic status</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cultural humility is an essential component of responsible health care services for multicultural populations. Embracing and valuing cultural diversity in the health care encounter will build honesty and trust in the caring relationship. Throughout this text, attention is given to how culture and ethnicity influence the assessment process in child health.</p>

The skilled pediatric health care provider learns to make eye contact when a child is interested and to avoid eye contact when a child is fearful. Initially directing attention to the parent or caretaker allows the infant or young child time to adjust to the environment.</p>
                        <p>Children are comfortable when they know what to expect in an environment. Explaining clearly to the young child or adolescent exactly what you are going to assess during the physical exam will decrease anxiety and build trust. With each part of the exam, explain or "talk through" the assessment and the findings. Reassure the child or adolescent of your findings when normal and explain abnormal findings as appropriate for the child's age. Talking through every step of the encounter decreases anxiety in the child and adolescent. Even busy practitioners in time-pressured environments will find the child or adolescent to be a more willing participant when this talk-through format is added to the health care encounter.</p>

                        <p>Engaging children in the interview process can reveal their understanding of health, allow their participation in the health care encounter, and provide insight into their social-emotional world. Eye-level encounters are the most effective with young children and make the health care provider appear more approachable.</p>
                        <p>Many young children are effective communicators and can respond to questions about their dietary habits, daily activities, school, or child care and relationships with school friends. It is important to engage children early in gathering health information. Health education can easily follow when this interview technique is used, and the child's responses create a dialogue that establishes a supportive provider-patient relationship.</p>
                        <p>Children 6 to 11 years old can be directly interviewed and can be participants in their health care. Health care providers can be role models for parents as they engage the child in the health interview and teach aspects of health and safety education. This approach teaches children from a young age to understand and care about their health and establishes the importance of building healthy habits for life.</p>
                        <p>Adolescents should always be interviewed separately from the parent. It is important to prepare the parent for this transition to a more independent role for the adolescent during the health care encounter. Allowing time to engage the adolescent independently will provide the best opening for discussion of personal or sensitive concerns that need to be voiced and for discussion of any conflicts in the home or school environment that are affecting the adolescent's well-being.</p>
                        <p>Use of the following clear communication techniques when interviewing will build a caring, trusting relationship with children/adolescents and their families.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Question indirectly to encourage children and adolescents who are reluctant to discuss feelings. Engage the young child with, "I am going to tell you a story about a 5 -year-old who lost his favorite pet. How do you think he feels?" or the adolescent with, "Some 15-year-olds have tried vaping or smoke marijuana. Do you have any friends who smoke?"</li>
                            <li>Pose scenarios to the child or adolescent. "What would you do if . . . ?" is appropriate for the young child, in contrast to, "How would you feel if . . . ?" which is appropriate for the older school-age child and adolescent.</li>
                            <li>Begin with less threatening topics and move slowly to more sensitive topics for the child or adolescent. "Tell me how things are going at school this year," in contrast to, "Has anyone ever hurt you?" or directed to the adolescent, "Has anyone forced you to have sex against your will?"</li>
                            <li>State your expectations clearly. Say to the child, "I need you to be very quiet now so I can listen to . . . " Or to the adolescent, "To take care of you, I need you to tell me . . ."</li>
                            <li>Do not offer a choice to the child or adolescent when in reality there is no choice.</li>
                            <li>Use "I" when speaking to the child or adolescent. "I need to ask you this question because I want to help you . . ." in contrast to, "You must tell me what is going on." Avoid using the word you, which creates a defensive atmosphere when interviewing children or adolescents. This will provide positive role modeling for parents and also build the caring relationship between the health care provider, the child, and the parent.</li>
                            <li>Ask the young child to draw a picture or draw his or her family. This captures the child's attention and establishes your interest in the child's abilities. Children often reveal feelings or communicate important family issues through their art. [13]</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As health care providers increasingly rely on imaging and technology, the practice of diagnosing a health condition or disease from a physical examination has taken a back seat. The physical exam may be a ritual, but it is an important diagnostic tool when applied by skilled hands and can yield important diagnostic information and decrease the cost of health care. [14] The physical exam helps providers to ask better questions of the diagnostic tests they order. [15] Further, performing the physical examination provides important psychosocial benefits to the patient and can relieve stress and provide reassurance. Diagnostic evidence is important, but it is most valuable when decisions about diagnostic testing are made after completing a thorough health history and performing a thorough physical examination.</p>
                        <p>Besides the importance of focusing the diagnostic testing, what is also lost in eliminating the physical examination is the meaningful encounter between the patient and provider. [15] Recent studies have indicated that the trusting relationship between the provider and the family is the most influential factor in assisting families in making sound decisions about the care of their child. This provider-patient relationship is an important part of the therapeutic effect when working with families. It is crucial for pediatric health care providers to master the skills of history taking and physical examination in order to decrease or prevent medical errors and to increase the efficiency in ordering diagnostic testing and treating patients and families to decrease health care costs.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>"Quiet to active" is an important mantra that should be adopted by the health care provider who will be caring for infants and young children. It refers to the approach of beginning with the parts of the physical examination that require the child to be quiet or silent in order for the health care provider to differentiate physical findings. The "quiet" parts of the physical examination in infants and young children include pulse and respiratory rate, auscultation of cardiac sounds and respiratory sounds, and auscultation and assessment of the abdomen. Respiratory and cardiac sounds are subtle, and accurate assessment requires a relatively cooperative child. Therefore, approaching these areas first during the physical examination produces the best results. Assessment of the genitalia and cranial nerves in the infant and young child can also be completed before the more invasive examination of the ears and mouth and before measuring height, weight, temperature, and blood pressure when indicated. Varying the sequence of the physical examination to fit the temperament and activity level of the child is an essential part of pediatrics, but omitting an aspect of the physical examination does not serve the health care needs of the child and risks a diagnosis made on the basis of an incomplete assessment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preterm infants and newborns</h3>
                        <p>In the clinical setting, it is important to begin the physical assessment with the infant initially swaddled on the examining table or in the parent's arms to maintain body temperature. In this manner, auscultation of the cardiac and respiratory sounds can be accomplished before disturbing a sleeping infant or cooling the infant significantly. After the "quiet" parts of the examination are completed, transfer the infant to the examining table if in the parent's arms and begin a complete assessment with the infant wearing only a diaper. Observing the movements of the newborn for symmetry, strength, and coordination must be accomplished with the infant undressed. Assessment of overall appearance, skin color, breathing pattern, and degree of alertness or responsiveness should be noted. The health care provider should remain flexible in regard to the order of the exam throughout the encounter, because often the physical examination is performed between the eating and sleep cycles of the newborn.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infants up to 6 months of age</h3>
                        <p>Until 6 months of age, infants are most effectively assessed on the examination table. It provides a firm surface to support the infant's head during the physical exam and also provides a stable surface for the examination techniques required during a complete physical assessment. A calm, gentle approach works well and avoids possibly frightening the infant. The "quiet" parts of the exam may be accomplished with the infant in the parent's arms, but other parts are difficult to accomplish effectively in that position. Remember never to leave the examining table while you are evaluating a young infant.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Children 6 months to 2 years of age</h3>
                        <p>The inspection of infants and young children necessitates using a completely different social approach than with any other age groups. In establishing a therapeutic relationship with an adult, etiquette requires immediate eye contact. With infants 7 to 9 months of age, a progressive approach to eye contact is required because of the developmental phenomenon of stranger anxiety. First, observe the infant or young child covertly while speaking with the parent or caretaker, so as to allow the child to adjust to your presence in the environment. If the young child is looking at you and listening, then make glancing eye contact. If you are not rejected, then speak to the young child and, finally, reach out to touch the child. This approach will produce the best results in establishing the caring relationship. By offering puppets or small, washable toys to the child or using dolls to demonstrate parts of the physical examination, you will also often provide a calming effect at the beginning of the encounter.</p>
                        <p>Once the infant is able to sit stably, normally around 6 to 8 months of age, the examination can proceed with the child in the parent's lap, so as to decrease fear and stranger anxiety. Clothing should be removed gradually as the physical examination progresses from "quiet" to "active." Optimal examination of the abdomen and genitalia occurs with the child on the examining table, but in the fearful child, the exam may proceed with the child still in the parent's lap and with the examiner seated at the same level as the parent in a knee-to-knee position to create a surface for the child to lie on. With the young child's head and shoulder on the parent or caretaker's lap, the examiner proceeds with assessment of the abdomen, genitalia, and hips, thereby avoiding the need to place the child on the examination table and thus eliciting anxiety. When the infant is old enough to begin walking, it is important to observe the infant toddling in only a diaper to evaluate gait and musculoskeletal coordination.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Young children</h3>
                        <p>By 3 years of age, most children, though still apprehensive, are able to make eye contact and separate briefly from the parent. Observe their ability to be comforted, evaluate their response to the environment, their level of social interaction, and their relationships with parents or caretakers and siblings if present. How appropriate is their behavior in the setting? What is the quality and variety of their verbal responses? What is their level of activity and attention span? Young children generally respond best to a slow, even, steady voice. Give the young child time to warm to the situation before undressing him or her. The confident young child should be able to be examined sitting on the examining table. The "quiet" to "active" approach is advisable with this age group also; that is, beginning with the cardiac and respiratory examination and then proceeding head to toe. Give children 3 to 5 years of age clear directions, allow them to respond, and recognize success. Young children particularly enjoy games, drawing, and role playing the physical examination with dolls or stuffed animals (Fig. 1.1).</p>

                        <p>Modesty sets in during the preschool years, and health care providers need to be respectful and mindful of this developmental stage.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Children 6 to 11 years of age</h3>
                        <p>Children 6 to 11 years old benefit most from the talk-through approach to the physical exam. They are interested in learning about their bodies and are forming a body image of themselves. They are becoming more independent from their parents. Schoolage children gain the most from education about good health habits. Learning more about their bodies helps them connect their health with their health habits. Allow the child to participate in all aspects of the physical exam and respect his or her modesty. A "head-to-toe" assessment with the child on the examining table is most effective during middle childhood.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Adolescents</h3>
                        <p>The approach used with the adolescent during the health care encounter should be based on the child's developmental stage rather than his or her age. This is true for all children but particularly those in adolescence. Development during early, middle, and late adolescence proceeds unevenly and can vary widely among 11- to 18 -year-olds. Respect and confidentiality are essential components of developing a trusting relationship with the adolescent. Parental input is important during the health encounter, but adolescents should be interviewed and examined separately from the parent or peers. Avoid power struggles and give the adolescent control whenever possible. Involve adolescents in planning their health care and in establishing realistic goals and health habits. Chapter 4 further discusses evidence-based practice for the adolescent health visit.</p>
