                        <p>The eye is the most remarkable organ in the body as it is underdeveloped at birth and undergoes dramatic development in the first year of life. Although the eyes are anatomically complete, the sense of vision begins to develop over the first weeks and months of life. The development of normal vision depends on the reception of light rays that stimulate the internal eye during the early critical period after birth. Visual acuity is also determined by an infant's genetic predisposition, as well as physical and environmental health factors. Eye conditions that limit or occlude the process of visual development in the first year of life may affect the long-term visual health of the infant and child. A complete and thorough eye examination by the pediatric health care provider is critical to early detection and intervention to assure optimum visual development for infants and children.</p>

                        <p>The development of the eye begins in the third week of embryonic development, with the optic grooves forming in the neural tube, and by the end of the fourth week the optic vesicle is formed and lies close to the ectoderm surface. The surface of the ectoderm thickens and forms the lens placode. By the fifth week of gestation the optic cup and the lens cavity are formed, and by the sixth week, invagination of the optic vesicles occurs, forming the choroid layer and vasculature of the eye. The formation of the cornea, lens, and anterior chamber proceeds during the seventh and eighth week, and the eyelid folds develop and begin to cover the palpebral fissure. It is during this period of gestation that insults to the fetus, such as maternal rubella and varicella cause the development of congenital cataracts. Development of the retinal tissue continues with the differentiation of the nerve fiber layer, proliferative layer of the macula, and the pigmented layer of the retina that precedes the development of the iris and the ciliary body, which occurs between the 9th and 12th weeks of embryonic development. The ciliary body gives rise to the ciliary muscles, which control the accommodative reflex and pupillary aperture (Fig. 12.1). Development of the structures of the eye is complete by 15 weeks gestation. During the fourth month of gestation, the development of the retinal blood vessels is initiated and full vascularization of the retina occurs just before birth in a term infant and is incomplete in the preterm infant. The pupillary light reflex, which requires an intact optic nerve and oculomotor nerve, can be elicited by 30 weeks gestation.</p>

                        <p>Visual development begins after birth at the very center of the retina in the macula. The macula is a circular area surrounding the fovea. At birth, the macula is not fully developed but holds the genetic potential for 20/20 vision. The retina predominantly consists of rods at birth, and the cones are located near the outermost layer of the retina. As the retina is exposed to light, the cones migrate toward the center to become the anatomical macula on the fundus located on the posterior surface of the retina. The lens has a key role in focusing light on the neural layer of the retina, and the ciliary muscles assist in accommodation of the lens.</p>
                        <p>The optic nerve is also developing at the same time as the retina. There are as many as 8 million cells in the optic nerve and 5 million retinal cells in the optic neuron at birth that compete for synaptic sites on the nerve. Cells that are not oxygenated do not develop. In almost all term Infants the retina and retinal vasculature is fully developed. [1] Hypoxia or hyperoxia in preterm infants often impacts the normal development of the retina and causes a retinopathy, a disorder of the retinal vessels. Preterm infants have an avascular zone in the periphery of the retina that disrupts the normal proliferation of the retinal vessels and interrupts blood flow to the visual receptors. The disruption of blood flow may lead to retinal detachment from the choroid, causing visual impairment or blindness if left untreated. The extent of the immaturity of the retina and the avascular zone depends mainly on the degree of prematurity at birth. [1] Very low birth weight infants (&le;1500 g) are at highest risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and infants born at 28 weeks gestation or weighing &le;1000 g are at risk for developing macular folds and retinal detachment. [2] Refractive anomalies also occur approximately eight times more frequently in preterm infants than in term infants. [3] Infants with a birth weight of &le;1500 g or a gestational age of 30 weeks or less and infants with a birth weight between 1500 and 2000 g or gestational age of greater than 30 weeks with an unstable neonatal course should be referred to ophthalmology for retinal screening. [1]</p>
                        <p>Term infants from 36 to 40 weeks of gestation can perceive shape, color, motion, and patterns at birth. Visual development in the newborn is dependent upon development of the visual pathways that link the eyes to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus and to the visual cortex located in the occipital lobe of the brain. Exposure to light begins the synaptic development of the neurons at birth. [3] Central fixation is present shortly after birth in the term infant, and the human face at a distance of 8 to 12 inches holds the most visual interest for a newborn. The term infant is hyperopic, or farsighted, at birth. Visual images are focused behind and not on the retina, so the visual image is blurred. For the infant to see near objects, the ciliary muscles of the eye must work hard to accommodate, or shape, the lens; in time these efforts of the ciliary muscles result in thickening of the lens, which makes accommodation of the image onto the retina possible.</p>
                        <p>The term infant's eyes often wander or deviate in the first 6 weeks when trying to achieve visual fixation in the central field of vision. After 6 weeks of early visual stimulus, an infant is able to focus and visually follow an object or the parent's movements. Any inability to visually focus after 6 weeks of age in a term infant is considered suspect and at 3 months of age is considered abnormal. As the eyeball or globe grows, the hyperopia decreases and the lens hardens, but detailed visual acuity is not present until 3 to 4 months of age in the healthy eye and not until 3 to 4 months corrected age for preterm infants (Table 12.1). Differentiation and maturation of the fovea and the retinal layers of the macula continues until 8 months of age. [3] The fovea is responsible for central vision, and the macula is responsible for colors and contrasts, and normal development of both are required for precise visual acuity. The critical window for normal development of full visual acuity is from birth to 5 to 6 years of age, and the synaptic development of the neuronal paths in the visual cortex continues until approximately 10 years of age. After this age, conditions that affect early visual development cannot be completely corrected (Table 12.2).</p>

                        <p>The bony orbit is the structure surrounding the eye in the cranium. Only one-third of the eyeball, or optic globe, in the infant and child is exposed to the examiner, and the cranium protects the remainder of the globe in the orbital cavity. The optic foramen is the opening in the cranium that allows the passage of the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, and ophthalmic vein to pass from the globe to the brain and visual cortex. The upper eyelid is shaped by connective tissue containing tarsal plates. The meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plates near the hair follicles of the eyelashes in the upper and lower lids. In infants and children with atopic or allergic reactions, the meibomian glands, one of the oil-producing sebaceous glands in the body, exude a whitish or yellowish sebaceous material onto the base of the eyelids.</p>
                        <p>The lacrimal gland is located in the lateral aspect of the frontal bone in the orbital cavity (Fig. 12.2). It is a peanut-sized gland similar to the salivary glands. In each eyelid, the lacrimal duct opens onto the eyelid margin, and the nasolacrimal duct opens into the lacrimal sac, which is buried in the frontal process of the maxillary bone. The lacrimal puncta are noted at the edge of the upper and lower eyelids at the medial or inner canthus and allow the drainage of tears into the nasolacrimal duct and the lacrimal caruncle. The lacrimal caruncle is the elevated area of tissue bordering the upper and lower medial canthus and assists in drainage of tears. Tear production is normally present by 6 weeks of age in the term infant. The eyelashes add further protection to the surface of the eye and assist in lubricating the exterior surface of the eye.</p>

                        <p>The sclera, the outermost layer of the exterior structure of the globe or eyeball, is the firm collagenous layer that protects the intraocular structures (see Fig. 12.1). The conjunctiva is formed by thin mucous membrane lining the anterior surface of the sclera and inner eyelids and acts along with the tear film as a protective covering for the cornea (see Fig. 12.2). The conjunctiva has two surfaces: the palpebral and bulbar. The palpebral conjunctiva lines the inner eyelids, is vascular, and is covered by papillae. The bulbar conjunctiva is clear and contains no papillae and very few blood vessels. The bulbar conjunctiva covers the sclera up to the limbus, the juncture of the sclera and the cornea.</p>
                        <p>The cornea, the most anterior aspect of the external eye, is a lenslike structure that acts as a refractory surface for the eye and connects with the sclera at the limbus. The cornea is transparent and contains no blood vessels. The transparency allows light to be focused on the retina. It derives oxygen from the aqueous humor and from tears. The anterior chamber is directly behind the cornea, and the posterior chamber is the thin area between the lens and the posterior iris. The anterior and posterior chambers contain aqueous humor, a clear nutrient fluid that circulates around the lens and the cornea and provides nutrition and oxygen. Glaucoma is increased intraocular pressure resulting from abnormalities in the ocular drainage of the aqueous humor, which damages the optic nerve. Congenital glaucoma may result from the abnormal development of the ocular drainage system and may cause clouding or enlargement of the cornea. It may be present at birth or develop during the first year of life and may result in blindness if untreated.</p>
                        <p>The iris is the pigmented structure containing the sphincter and dilator muscles, connective tissue, and pigmented epithelium. An absence of color in the iris may indicate albinism. The center of the iris is controlled by the ciliary body and iris muscles and forms the aperture, or pupil. The pupil constricts or dilates depending on the amount of light entering the eye. The ciliary body produces aqueous humor and controls accommodation. The iris lies behind the anterior chamber and in front of the crystalline lens and is protected by a thin clear capsule attached by small filaments to the ciliary body. A cataract is an opacity that occurs in the crystalline lens and obscures vision.</p>
                        <p>The upper eyelid is elevated by the levator muscle, which inserts into the tarsal plate in the upper eyelid and is innervated by cranial nerve III.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Extraocular muscles and internal eye</h3>
                        <p>The six ocular muscles, inserted into the scleral surface, control the movement of the eye (Fig. 12.3). The four rectus muscles-the superior, inferior, medial, and lateral recti-originate at the top of the globe deep in the cranium and extend from the anterior to the posterior globe and insert at the back of the globe. The medial rectus muscle is responsible for the movement of the eye toward the midline, and the lateral rectus muscle innervated by cranial nerve VI moves the eye away from the midline. The inferior and superior rectus muscles move the eye up and down and also have overlapping functions with the oblique muscles. The two oblique muscles-the superior and inferior oblique-insert at the anterior and posterior globe. The superior oblique tendon passes through the trochlea, the small, cartilaginous pulley on the frontal bone. The superior oblique muscles are responsible for movement of the eye downward and inward, and the inferior oblique moves the eye upward and inward. The superior oblique muscle is also innervated by cranial nerve IV, and paralysis of the cranial nerve IV causes a head tilt or torticollis in children to compensate for the weakened muscle.</p>

                        <p>The vitreous body is the large interior cavity of the globe and contains a clear gel or vitreous humor. The choroid is the interior layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina and is continuous with the iris and ciliary body. It is highly vascular and nourishes the receptor cells of the retinal epithelium. The outer layer of the retina contains photoreceptors, the rods and cones, which are stimulated by light focused by the lens and translate light energy or impulses into neuronal activity. The neurons activate the nerve fiber layer of the retinal epithelium and synaptic activity and transmit through the optic nerve to the brain, which perceives the visual image.</p>
                        <p>The retinal vessels and optic nerve fibers enter and exit through the optic cup and divide into two branches on the surface of the optic disc. The optic disc, the anterior aspect of the optic nerve, is pink to orange-red or pale to dark with a yellow cup at its center (Fig. 12.4). There are no photoreceptors in the optic disc, which creates a blind spot of 5 degrees in the visual field. [4] The macula lies medial to the optic nerve on the fundus, the posterior surface of the retina. The fovea or fovea centralis is a central depression in the macula without vessels and has darker pigmentation than the retina. This is the area where vision is most perfect, and the ciliary body works to accommodate the lens to focus an image on the fovea. The arteries on the fundus appear thinner and more orangered than the veins, which are larger and darker (see Fig. 12.4). The normal arterial-to-venous ratio (A:V) is approximately 2:3 in the healthy individual. Vascular changes present in the retina that often reflect abnormal conditions in the systemic vasculature such as diabetes and hypertension. Papilledema, bilateral optic disc edema, is also associated with increased intracranial pressure. Retinal hemorrhage is associated with acute traumatic brain injury and inflicted traumatic brain injury. Retinal hemorrhages associated with inflicted traumatic brain injury in children involve deeper layers of the retina and are found more on the periphery of the retina (Fig. 12.5). [5]</p>

                        <p>Thick epicanthal folds are seen more commonly in infants and young children of Asian and Latino descent. They partially or completely cover the inner canthus at birth and diminish by middle childhood. Asian populations have a genetic predisposition to myopia. In one study, 68% of Asian children were found to be myopic. [3] The pediatric health care provider should focus particular attention to early vision screening in this population of children.</p>
                        <p>Ethnicity is a risk factor for severe ROP. Asian and African American infants have a higher risk of developing threshold ROP as compared with white infants. [5]</p>
                        <p>Retinal pigment or melanin is often found on the scleral surface of Latino and African-American children. The pigmented areas usually become evident in early or middle childhood and persist into adulthood. This is within the range of normal variations of the eye and does not impact visual health. The retinal light reflex or "red" light reflex varies in color in darkly pigmented individuals. The fundus appears pale yellow or beige because of the increased melanin in the skin, and the optic disc is also often a pale yellow. Scleral melanocytosis is a common pediatric condition that characteristically features black or gray-blue pigmentation in the scleral tissue and becomes more prominent with increasing age. It is a benign condition common in Latino, African American, and Asian children and is usually bilateral (Fig. 12.6).</p>
