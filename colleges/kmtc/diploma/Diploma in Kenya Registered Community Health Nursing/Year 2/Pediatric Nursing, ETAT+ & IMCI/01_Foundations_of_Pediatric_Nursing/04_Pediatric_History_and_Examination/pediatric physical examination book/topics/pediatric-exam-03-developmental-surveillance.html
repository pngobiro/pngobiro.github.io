                        <p>Children achieve developmental milestones at their own pace, yet the sequence of developmental milestones is expected to be incremental and stepwise for all children. Screening children for developmental delay and emotional and behavioral difficulties is one of the most important components of preventive health care. Screening is an important step toward referral for evaluation and diagnosis of developmental delay and emotional and behavioral problems, and health care professionals are mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Title V of the Social Security Act to provide screening, early identification, and intervention for children with developmental delays and disabilities. [1] Early treatment of developmental delays leads to improved outcomes, enhanced function, and reduced prevalence of secondary behavior problems later in life. [2]</p>
                        <p>In the United States, 12% to 16% of children have at least one developmental delay. [3] The most common childhood developmental and behavioral problems are speech and language delay, hearing loss, emotional and behavioral concerns, learning disabilities, and delay in other developmental milestones. [4] Pediatric primary care providers can identify young children with these developmental and mental health problems early in life by providing surveillance at every well-child visit and implementing standardized developmental screening tests at the 9-month, 18-month, and 24- or 30-month well-child visit. [1] Timely identification of developmental and behavioral problems and prompt referral for early intervention can resolve or lessen the impact of a delay or disability on the functioning of the child and family, and promote their growth and readiness to progress toward the next developmental milestone. Effective interventions in early childhood increase a child's readiness for school entry and for optimum learning in the classroom.</p>

                        <p>The first component of a developmental screening program is developmental surveillance. Developmental surveillance includes eliciting parental concerns, collecting and documenting a developmental history, and identifying risks and protective factors for developmental delay or emotional and behavioral problems in the child's environment. Observations of the child's development include speech and language skills, social skills, activity level, communication, and parent/child relationship. It is important to identify strengths in the parent and caregiver that are protective factors in the child's developmental progress. The primary care provider must include input from parents, other caregivers, and teachers in child care and school settings to make informed observations of the child's developmental progress and accurately document the ongoing developmental surveillance in the health record.</p>
                        <p>Surveillance for vision and hearing development includes asking parents about any concerns they may have about their infant or young child's developing vision or response to voices or sounds in the environment. Observable normal visual behaviors include fixing on and following near faces at 6 to 8 weeks of age; visually tracking at 4 months of age, including seeing the parent or caregiver at a distance of 5 feet; and visually fixating at 5 months on a 1-inch cube or small object at a distance of 12 inches. [5] Pediatric primary care providers should ask parents about their child's ability to hear quiet sounds and turn and locate voices. All children referred for behavioral concerns should have formal hearing and vision screening tests conducted to rule out deficits or delays. Reviews of vision and hearing screening practices are in Chapters 12 and 13, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Speech refers to the mechanics of oral communication, and language encompasses the understanding, processing, and production of communication during the early developmental years and throughout childhood. Surveillance of speech and language skills in childhood includes eliciting any parental concerns about communication problems, dysfluency, stuttering, articulation disorders, or an unusual voice quality. [6] Approximately 10% to 15% of 2 year olds have language delays, and 4% to 5% remain language delayed after 3 years of age. [7] Early referral and intervention is the key to optimizing speech and language development in early childhood. Pediatric primary care providers need to conduct ongoing surveillance at each health encounter and screen children whose parents have concerns about their speech and language development. Table 3.1 presents normal developmental speech and language patterns in infancy and early childhood.</p>

                        <p>The acquisition of language is a critical developmental skill, and pediatric primary care providers can promote literacy as a component of developmental surveillance for language deficits. The Reach Out and Read (ROR) program, available at www.reachoutandread.org, was designed to target children in early childhood at risk for poor early school performance and provide families with books and anticipatory guidance about the importance of reading to infants and young children. Several studies have shown that ROR can significantly enhance a young child's early literacy environment by increasing the frequency of parent-child book-sharing activities and facilitating language development. [8, 9] Pediatric health care settings interested in establishing a pediatric literacy promotion program may contact the national ROR program.</p>
                        <p>The clinical assessment or surveillance of development without using standardized screening testing identifies less than 50% of children with developmental delays. [10] The ultimate goal of developmental surveillance and screening is to improve outcomes for children with developmental delays and disorders. Table 3.2 presents normal developmental milestones of communication, and fine and gross motor, problem-solving, and social/emotional skills from 6 months to 5 years of age in accordance with Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). [11] Guidelines for surveillance and screening during primary care visits are available at the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision for Infants, Children and Adolescents, available at http://brightfutures.aap.org.

                        <p>Surveillance also includes "close and considerable observation," where the primary care provider compares a child's growth or development from one point to another. While a 3-year-old who has been in speech therapy may not meet all of the speech milestones expected of a 3-year-old, it would be critical to note the progress they have made since the last screen or assessment.</p>

                        <p>Over 25% of children under 5 years of age are at risk for developmental, emotional, and behavioral problems, but fewer than one in five children receive the recommended developmental screening. [14] Many parents with children under 6 years of age are concerned about their child's development or behavior, yet only 20% of parents report that developmental screening was conducted at their child's primary care visits prior to entering kindergarten. [15] The AAP's recommendations for developmental testing are based on evidence that indicates standardized screening tools capture up to 80% of children with early developmental delays. [1]</p>
                        <p>Developmental screening focuses on positive development and also identifies children with delays or problems early in life. It assists the health care provider with anticipatory guidance for parents and caregivers by identifying the developmental milestones expected and met at each age as the infant grows and develops (Fig. 3.1). Identification of a deficit or delay on a developmental screening test does not provide a diagnosis, but it identifies children who need further evaluation, referral, and intervention services. Table 3.3 presents standardized developmental screening tools used in infancy and early childhood, and Table 3.4 presents standardized tools used to screen for emotional, behavioral, and mental health problems during early and middle childhood and adolescence.</p>
