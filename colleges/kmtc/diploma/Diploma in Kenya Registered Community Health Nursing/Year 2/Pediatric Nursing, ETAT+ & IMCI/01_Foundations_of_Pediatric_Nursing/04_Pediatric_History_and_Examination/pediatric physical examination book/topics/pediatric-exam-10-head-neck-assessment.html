                        <p>The rapid growth of the head begins during the third to fifth week of embryonic life, as the brain simultaneously undergoes a similar period of rapid growth. By the eighth week, the embryo is humanlike in form, but the head size is disproportionate to the body. During this early fetal development, the head is the fastest growing part of the body and constitutes 50% of the body length at 8 weeks' gestation. The head growth then slows during the period from the 9th to the 12th week in the developing fetus while spine growth accelerates. Disturbances or deficiencies during this early fetal period can result in brain and spinal defects. During the 13th week, ossification of the cranium begins in the skull, which is one of the primary ossification centers of the skeletal system. As the bones of the cranium grow medially from the ossification centers, sutures form at the junctions of the calvaria or skullcap, and fontanels form at the intersection of the sutures. The hair patterns on the scalp develop during the 13th through 16th week of fetal development, and the scalp hair present in the term infant is established by the twentieth week of gestation. [1] The fetus continues to grow, and the head size becomes proportional to the body during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>The normal growth of the skull depends on placental function, familial, and hereditary factors, growth potential within the uterus, and optimum nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood. Insufficient vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and insufficient intake in early infancy is associated with an increased risk of skull deformity in first year of life. [2] The contour of the cranium of the newborn reflects fetal positioning and the effects of the delivery presentation. The cranial bones are pliable and are loosely connected by the sutures and the fontanels, which allow the head to be molded during delivery. Depressed skull fractures are rare, but they can occur with forceps delivery or vacuum-assisted vaginal births. If intrauterine growth retardation does occur as a result of either intrinsic or extrinsic factors in fetal growth, skull growth and brain development are impacted and result in longterm consequences of delayed growth and development in the infant.</p>

                        <p>At birth, there are seven movable and separate skull plates, or bones, joined together by sutures that accommodate brain growth (Fig. 10.1). The fontanels are the membranous spaces between the frontal and parietal bones and the parietal and occipital bones. The anterior fontanel lies along the coronal, sagittal, and frontal or metopic sutures (Fig. 10.2). The posterior fontanel lies at the juncture of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures. There are smaller fontanels located bilaterally in the lower skull. The sphenoid fontanel is located at the lower juncture of the frontal and parietal bones superior to the ear and along the coronal suture. The mastoid fontanel is posterior to the ear at the juncture of the occipital and posterior parietal bones. The cranium is supported by the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, a solid vertebra, and rests on the second vertebra, the axis. These bones form the rotational bones of the skull. Ossification of the skull continues throughout infancy and childhood and into adulthood.</p>

                        <p>The facial bones are also pliable at birth, except for the maxilla and the mandible, which are very small and underdeveloped in the newborn. The facial skeleton consists of the larger bones of the frontal area, zygomatic processes, maxilla, and mandible (Fig. 10.3). The two nasal plates and the lacrimal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones comprise the smaller bones in the head. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth but are small, and the sphenoid and frontal sinuses develop during infancy and childhood.</p>

                        <p>The muscular structure of the head and neck is an intricate part of the underlying fascia of the cranium and neck structures. The connections between the muscular fascia and the facial orifices control facial expressions such as smiling, raising the eyebrows, and wrinkling the forehead. The superficial and deep muscles of the neck support the pivotal rotation of the head. The sternocleidomastoid or sternomastoid muscle is the largest muscle in the neck, running from the mastoid area at the base of the ear to the clavicle and sternum, and is primarily responsible for turning the head from side to side. The trapezius muscle lies at the back of the neck and is triangular. The origin of the trapezius muscle is in the back at the 12th thoracic vertebra extending to the lateral border of the clavicle and attaches at the posterior edge of the occipital bone. It supports the head movement from side to side and the shoulder movement.</p>
                        <p>The structures in the neck are protected by the deep vertebral muscles, which support the side movements of the head. The trachea is the cartilaginous tube that extends from the larynx to the bronchi in the upper chest beneath the sternum. In infants and children, it is more mobile and more deeply recessed in the vertebral muscles than in adults.</p>
                        <p>The thyroid gland lies in the anterior middle region of the neck just below the larynx surrounding the fifth or sixth tracheal ring. There are two butterfly-shaped lobes, joined or connected by an anterior isthmus that lies across the trachea below the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid gland is composed of tiny follicles filled with thyroglobulin, which binds with iodine in thyroid synthesis. A dietary intake of 150 to 200 &mu;g of iodide is enough to produce sufficient quantities of thyroid hormone, and large reserves of iodide are concentrated in the thyroid gland. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is necessary for normal growth and development in children and normal sexual maturation. The thyroid gland is extremely vascular and secretes thyroxine directly into the bloodstream, which promotes normal growth.</p>
                        <p>The four parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands generally located on the posterior side or dorsal surface of the thyroid gland. Like the thyroid gland, they do not contain ducts, and they secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium metabolism. Infants born with abnormal development of the parathyroid gland have an embryological defect known as DiGeorge syndrome caused by a chromosomal microdeletion (22q11). It is often associated with congenital heart defects, facial abnormalities, and other systemic defects.</p>
                        <p>The head and neck region are perfused by the carotid arteries. The external carotid supplies the head, face, and neck, and the internal carotid supplies the cranium. Blood from the cranium is drained through the subclavian and jugular veins. The thyroid and parathyroid are perfused by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.</p>

                        <p>Rapid growth in the infant brings rapid changes in the head and neck. At birth, the anterior fontanel ranges in size from an average of 2 cm to 4 to 5 cm in the term infant. The anterior fontanel may be small at birth, about the size of a fingertip, because the skull is compressed during vaginal delivery, and then the fontanel enlarges in the early neonatal period. The posterior fontanel may or may not be palpable at birth. It enlarges by a range of 0.5 to 1 cm and closes by 6 weeks to 2 months of age. Suture lines can be overlapping or protuberant after birth and often are palpable until 6 months of age from molding at birth. Gestational age at birth and sex are not associated with significant differences in fontanel size. [3]</p>
                        <p>Slow progression of closure of the anterior fontanel occurs during the first year of life. However, closure in some infants may begin by 9 months of age with only a fingertip concavity present at the crown of the scalp, and 25% to 50% of fontanels are closed by 12 months of age. Normally, closure of the anterior fontanel occurs by 18 months of age, and 98% to 100% are closed by 24 months of age. [3] Head growth in the first year is determined not by the size of the fontanel, but by the normal increase of the occipital-frontal circumference (OFC) of the head. Microcephaly, a small head for gestational age, is considered 1 to 2 standard deviations (SD) below the norm for age and size, and macrocephaly, a large head for gestational age, is 1 to 2 SD above the norm for age and size.</p>
                        <p>Cephalhematoma is a soft, fluctuating effusion of blood trapped beneath the pericranium caused by rupture of the blood vessels over the parietal area (Fig. 10.4). It is usually unilateral and does not cross the sagittal suture (Fig. 10.5). The bleeding into the periosteum of the cranium may occur slowly, and therefore may not be apparent until the infant is 24 to 48 hours old. A cephalhematoma may be associated with hyperbilirubinemia. Resolution of a cephalhematoma may be slow, and it may persist until 6 weeks to 2 months of age. See Table 10.1 for developmental variations in the head and neck.</p>

                        <p>The examination of the head and neck area involves inspection and palpation. In infants and young children, examination of the head and neck region may follow the quieter parts of the examination, the cardiac and respiratory exam, as palpation around the head and neck region often makes young children very fearful and uncomfortable, or ticklish, with a response of moving their shoulders upward. In the older child, the physical examination may proceed head to toe. Examination of the head and neck area requires good lighting particularly to view the areas of the neck region during examination. Gloves can be worn if skin lesions are noted.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inspection of the head and neck</h3>
                        <p>Inspection of the head includes observation by the health care provider for head movement and head control. Head lag when pulling the infant to the sitting position is normal until 3 to 4 months of age in the term infant. Head lag should be evaluated in all infants in the first 6 months of life as an indicator of muscle tone. Persistent head lag between 4 and 6 months of age in the term infant is concerning, and the infant should be monitored closely for the attainment of developmental milestones and referred when indicated.</p>
                        <p>Head alignment should be evaluated in the young infant with the head at midline on the examining table and in the older infant and young child while being supported in a sitting position by the parent or caregiver. Persistent head tilt from the normal position may indicate hypotonia, congenital torticollis, muscular abnormalities, gastrointestinal reflux, or visual and hearing deficits. Range of motion and movement of the head should be examined to determine tone and flexibility. In examining the infant younger than 3 months, the provider should move the head passively on the examining table to the left and right to determine mobility and range of motion. At 3 to 4 months of age, the infant can begin to follow a light or small toy to determine the full range of motion of the head and neck and the function of the musculature. Any limited range of motion, head bobbing or jerking, tremors, persistent downward gaze, or involuntary muscle contractions or spasms should be further evaluated and referred when indicated.</p>
                        <p>Observe the shape and size of the head in the infant and young child. Head shape varies widely in young infants and generally follows a normal growth pattern influenced by familial and genetic patterns and cultural influences. A flattened occipital region or a unilateral flattening of the parietal region can occur in young infants because of prolonged positional placement. Positional skull deformities are often benign and reversible and will normalize by 3 months of age. [4, 5] With the universal recommendation of supine or "back to sleep" positioning of infants to prevent sudden infant death syndrome, there has been an increase in reported cases of positional or deformational plagiocephaly. Plagiocephaly refers to an asymmetrical flattening or deformity of the skull and occurs when external forces are applied to the developing skull of an infant and it becomes misshapen, often resulting in asymmetry of the ears and face. [5, 6] Deformational plagiocephaly is most commonly seen on the lateral and central side of the occiput (Fig. 10.6). [6] It is more common in infants with a lower level of motor activity, and with congenital torticollis or head tilt. [7] Deformational plagiocephaly may be prevented by varying the head position frequently when putting the very young infant down to sleep on the back and by giving supervised tummy time when awake.</p>

                            <p>Most positional skull deformities can be prevented by alternating the infant's head position when supine from the left to right occipital area during sleep and providing short periods of supervised tummy time while the infant is awake. [4]</p>

                        <p>Craniosynostosis is the premature closure or fusion of sutures in the skull of the young infant, and causes a trapezoidal head shape with flattening of both the occiput and frontal regions on the affected side, occurring in approximately 1 in 2000 births. [4, 7] Craniosynostosis often presents with palpable ridges along the cranial sutures. [6] Health care providers need to be able to properly differentiate infants with positional or deformational plagiocephaly from those with craniosynostosis (Table 10.2). Lambdoidal craniosynostosis occurs in 3 in 100,000 births, and it causes a parallelogram-shaped skull with the ear displaced posteriorly and inferiorly. [7] Always inspect the shape of the head in infants from above and with the infant supported in a sitting position with the head midline to verify the shape of the head and accuracy of the OFC of the head. If any significant abnormal shape of the head is noted, educate parents proactively to decrease the development of occipital and parietal flattening. [4] For moderate to severe deformational plagiocephaly and craniosynostosis, referral is indicated. Repositioning and molding or helmet therapy are recommended for infants over 4 months of age.

                        <p>On inspection of the head, observe the level of the fontanel in the cranium. Normally, there is a slight pulsation in the anterior fontanel, and it is fuller or tenses slightly when the infant is crying but flattens when the infant calms. In the ill infant, a tense, bulging anterior fontanel can be a sign of increasing intracranial pressure due to meningitis or head trauma and is a medical emergency. Tumors in the brain and meninges can also cause increased intracranial pressure indicated by a bulging fontanel. Infants can have a mildly depressed fontanel, unaccompanied by other symptoms, which may indicate mild dehydration due to the metabolic demands of growth or fluid lost through heat and perspiration. A sunken fontanel, if accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms, infection, or loss of normal turgor of skin and mucous membranes, may indicate severe dehydration and requires immediate further evaluation and treatment.</p>
                        <p>The neck should be inspected for symmetry, shape, and mobility. In the newborn and very young infant, the neck is shortened and the musculature is underdeveloped, so it is best to inspect the neck with the infant on a firm surface for examination. While supporting the neck and shoulders cradled with the thumb and forefingers, use the opposite hand to extend the infant's head back slightly to expose the shortened neck region and conduct a full inspection. This position allows the examiner to determine the symmetry and strength of the musculature of the neck, the alignment of the trachea, and the condition of the skin in the infant and young child, who are vulnerable to fungal and bacterial infection in the anterior neck region. Torticollis, or wryneck, causes the head to tilt to one side and limits range of motion of the neck muscles. Congenital torticollis is the most common associated finding in infants with deformational plagiocephaly, and early referral is indicated to support repositional therapy for the head. [6] Acquired torticollis in the infant or young child may be related to viral infection or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) associated with overfeeding, or it may be associated with hypotonia or neurological condition with rotation of the head and extension of the neck.</p>
                        <p>Infants and young children with unexplained fever, irritability, or a bulging fontanel associated with increased intracranial pressure may indicate pain or neck stiffness during examination of the neck region. Meningismus or meningitis, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, can manifest in the neck. To assess for meningismus, flex the head forward or ventrally with the infant or young child lying on a flat surface or examining table. Pain, irritability, resistance to movement, and range of motion on flexion of the neck is a sign of nuchal rigidity. Brudzinski sign or flexion of the lower extremities will occur spontaneously, with flexion of the head forward when meningismus is present to guard or protect the body from pain. Kernig sign, pain or resistance to straightening legs or knees from the flexed position, also indicates a positive sign for meningeal irritation. Opisthotonos, hyperextension of the neck and spine, indicates severe meningeal irritation.</p>
                        <p>In the school-aged child, tilting the head back slightly during inspection of the neck will assist the health care provider in evaluating the structures of the neck. Inspect the thyroid gland for size and symmetry, and note any swelling or masses. Asking the child to swallow may assist the provider in distinguishing the structure of the neck and movement of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland should rise as the child swallows. In children who are obese, adipose tissue in the neck region is common and should not be mistaken for an enlarged thyroid gland.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inspection of the face</h3>
                        <p>Examination of the facial area begins with initial observation of the infant, child, or adolescent for symmetry of facial features, ears, and facial movements. Observing the smile, laugh, facial creases, and nasolabial folds reveals normal innervation of the facial structures. Observing the symmetry of the facial features in the infant while crying will assist in assessing any facial or neurological injury that occurred during birth. During vaginal deliveries, excessive lateral traction of the head and neck away from the shoulder may injure the brachial plexus and the ventral root of the fifth cervical nerve, [1] and cause paralysis of the arm and shoulder. Injury to the facial nerve before or during the birth process may cause asymmetrical nasolabial folds and/or asymmetrical facial expression. Any unusual facies with disproportional features, frontal bossing of the forehead, and small or low-set ears may be indicative of a genetic abnormality and require further evaluation and referral.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation of the head</h3>
                        <p>Begin palpation at the crown of the head and evaluate the scalp and the bony structures of the skull. In the infant, palpate fontanels for size, level of tenseness, and pulsations (Fig. 10.7). Note the length and width of the fontanel for infants with unusually large fontanels and monitor the head circumference. Infants and young children who present with a bulging fontanel and signs of increased intracranial pressure may have a resonant or cracked-pot sound, Macewen sign, when the scalp is tapped or percussed with the forefinger.</p>

                        <p>In the first few months of life, an infant may have a visible or palpable ridge at the sutures lines of the cranium. This is a metopic ridge and is normal variant when the head shape appears normal and the OFC is normal. Infants with a wide margin along the sagittal suture may have a communicating anterior and posterior fontanel, often referred to as a metopic suture. Suture lines are normally not palpable after 4 to 6 months of age in the term infant. Premature closure of the sutures may indicate craniosynostosis, or asymmetrical growth of the skull, which requires immediate evaluation and referral. Separation of the sagittal suture is one of the most common findings in infants with Down syndrome, along with a flattened occiput and a small rounded head.</p>
                        <p>When palpating the skull of an infant less than 6 months of age, an abnormal softness of the cranium known as craniotabes may be noted, and it is related to an incomplete ossification of bone in the cranium or widened sutures. It can be a normal variant in the term infant; however, if craniotabes is accompanied by abnormal facies or persists after 6 months of age, it may be associated with hydrocephalus or rickets, and further evaluation and referral is necessary.</p>
                        <p>Palpate for any tenderness, masses, skin lesions, or edema of the skull on examination, and note the size, location, and character of the mass or nodule, and evaluate for mobility and pain. Infants should be monitored closely for increasing head size, misshapen head, or positional deformities. Any abnormal skull findings require diagnostic evaluation and referral as indicated. Any depression on the scalp indicating a skull fracture requires urgent evaluation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation of the sinuses</h3>
                        <p>Only the maxillary and frontal sinuses can be assessed in school-age children and adolescents by physical examination through inspection and palpation. Evaluate for swelling and tenderness by tapping with the forefingers or applying mild pressure with the thumb or forefinger over the maxillary and frontal sinus area (see Chapter 14).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation and auscultation of the neck</h3>
                        <p>If masses or nodules are noted during the inspection of the neck in the infant, then the provider should palpate the neck to evaluate the size, shape, and character of the mass or nodules. Brachial cleft cysts are smooth, nontender masses on the lateral neck area along the border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. They may be fluctuant and require surgical removal. Thyroglossal duct cysts present higher in the neck region and require diagnostic evaluation and referral. Surgical removal may be indicated. Palpation of the lymph glands is reviewed in Chapter 11.</p>
                        <p>In the infant and young child, palpate the sternocleidomastoid muscle for masses, strength, and tone, including the clavicular area at the base of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Any sign of pain or irritability, or resistance to range of motion of the neck or arm in the infant, child, or adolescent, indicates an abnormal finding and requires further evaluation. Resistance to lateral motion of the neck may indicate torticollis, lymph gland swelling, infection, or trauma to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. If webbing of the neck is noted, it may indicate Turner syndrome (Table 10.3).</p>

                        <p>The jugular vein is not normally distended in children who are sitting or standing upright. Pulsations in the jugular vein in the neck may be seen when the child is lying supine on the examining table. The jugular vein should appear full but not bulging, and it is normal to observe jugular venous pulsations (JVPs). The JVP is normally a gentle undulation visible in good lighting. The pulsations should be of normal rate and amplitude, without bruits, or blowing sounds, heard on auscultation over the vessel. Abnormal pulsations can indicate right-sided heart failure or pericarditis. In older children, carotid pulsations can be palpated with the finger pads of the second and third fingers in the area between the trachea and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Evaluate for rate, rhythm, and intensity. Avoid significant pressure to the carotid artery, which may cause a vagal response or hypotension. Auscultation may be performed to detect bruits, but is not routinely performed on children.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation of the thyroid gland</h3>
                        <p>Palpation of the thyroid gland is not usually performed in infants and young children, unless masses or nodular lesions are noted on inspection of the neck. The neck is short with strong musculature and difficult to palpate. Thyroid disease in infants and young children often presents with systemic symptoms including hypotonia, lethargy, distended abdomen, and enlarged tongue as in congenital hypothyroidism (see Table 10.3). Newborn screening for thyroid disease is required in all states, and results should be confirmed by the pediatric health care provider on the initial postpartum or well-child visit.</p>
                        <p>In school-aged children and adolescents, palpation of the thyroid gland is most easily approached from the front of the neck in the young child to minimize any fear that may occur during the examination. Tilt the head forward slightly while the child maintains a sitting position with the back straight. To guide the examination, the provider may gently support the child's head. Begin by using the forefinger to locate the prominent ring of the tracheal cartilage, the cricoid cartilage, which provides a landmark to determine the position of the thyroid gland (Fig. 10.8A). Just lateral to the carotid cartilage, palpate the thyroid gland by placing one hand on one side of the trachea and gently displacing the thyroid tissue to the contralateral side of the neck (see Fig. 10.8B). Repeat this movement to examine both sides of the thyroid gland. Once positioned, extend the forefingers of both hands and apply slight pressure for deep palpation along both sides of the trachea and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and ask the child to swallow. Fingernails must be groomed short for effective examination of the thyroid. Tilting the head to one side or rotating the neck very gently may help evaluate the size, quality, and firmness of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland can also be examined from behind in adolescents and young adults with the head tilted slightly forward. Using the cricoid cartilage as a landmark, the provider uses the forefingers of both hands to palpate deeply, laterally to the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (see Fig. 10.8C). A soft, mushy gland, or any masses or nodules noted on examination of the thyroid gland, are abnormal and require prompt evaluation. A goiter is a firm, nontender, mobile, symmetrical mass in the neck. Enlargement of the thyroid gland may occur with hyperthyroidism, Graves disease, or Hashimoto thyroiditis.</p>

                        <p>An ultrasound may be the most appropriate initial noninvasive test to perform in an infant with positional or deformational plagiocephaly, or for an infant or child with an abnormal mass in the neck region. Computed tomography (CT) imaging may be necessary in some cases for differentiation of cysts or solid neck lesions. On a child or adolescent with an enlarged thyroid or signs and symptoms of thyroid disease such as weight loss, fatigue, or growth failure, thyroid function test, thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), and TSH should be performed. Chapter 11 reviews the diagnostics for the lymph glands in the neck region and lymphatic system.</p>
                        <p>For children or adolescents presenting with a history of moderate or severe head trauma, a CT scan may be indicated to aid in diagnosis. Children must remain immobilized during CT imaging. For diagnosis of possible tumors or malformations in the skull, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated. MRIs require sedation in children and may require injection of contrast for digital subtraction angiography.
