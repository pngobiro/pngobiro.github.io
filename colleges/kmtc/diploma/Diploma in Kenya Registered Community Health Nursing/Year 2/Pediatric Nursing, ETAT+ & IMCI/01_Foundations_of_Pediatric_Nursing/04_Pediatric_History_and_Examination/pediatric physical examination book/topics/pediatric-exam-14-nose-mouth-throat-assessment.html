                        <p>A thorough assessment of the nose, mouth, and throat is an essential part of the pediatric physical examination. Infants and children have frequent upper respiratory and viral infections, and viewing the oropharynx is particularly important when looking for a focus of infection in a febrile child. Also, the oral health of children is key to overall health, and the pediatric health care provider is an important link in providing oral health assessments and preventing dental caries.</p>

                        <p>The facial structures develop in the embryo during the first few weeks of gestation. The tongue, lips, gums, and tooth enamel all evolve from the ectoderm of the primitive mouth, the stomodeum, early in the fourth week. The lips are formed during the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation. The primary teeth and salivary glands are formed between the sixth and eighth weeks of fetal life. By the sixth fetal month, the ducts are hollow and begin producing saliva. Calcification of the primary teeth begins in the fourth month of fetal life and is complete by 1 year of age. Any insult during pregnancy to the sensitive process of tooth formation can result in an anomaly in the color, size, or shape of the primary or permanent dentition.</p>
                        <p>Early development of the nose begins during the fifth week of gestation, with development of muscle, bone, and cartilage complete by the 12th week of gestation. The palate evolves from fusion of the maxillary prominences during the seventh and eighth weeks of gestation and is completely formed by the 12th week of gestation during the fusion of the primary and secondary palates. Failure in fusion results in cleft palate. Cleft palate is a relatively common congenital anomaly and occurs in 1 in 690 births (Fig. 14.1B). [1] The incidence varies with race, with Native Americans having a rate of 20.5 in 10,000 births, and blacks having the lowest rate of 10.2 in 10,000 births. [1] Cleft lip can be an isolated defect or associated with cleft palate or a component of a congenital syndrome (Fig. 14.1A). [2] The etiology is multifactorial involving both genetic and environmental risk factors in both syndromic and nonsyndromic clefts. Several risk factors associated with cleft type have been identified and include maternal smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, maternal nutrition and folic acid intake, and maternal medications. [1] A subcutaneous cleft also can occur during this period with incomplete fusion of the palate; it often goes undetected in the newborn and is associated with persistent abnormal speech patterns.</p>

                        <p>The nose of the newborn and young infant is generally flattened and malleable (Fig. 14.2). In the neonate, the septum is composed of cartilage; ossification occurs during childhood. The nose becomes pyramid-like by adolescence and develops a bony structure. It is divided into four sections: the proximal bony portion, often referred to as the nasal bridge; the mid cartilaginous vault; the tip, columella, and nares; and the interior vestibule (Fig. 14.3).</p>

                        <p>Nasal breathing is the normal breathing pattern, and infants and young children are prone to increased airway resistance, because they have anatomically small airway passages. Nasal congestion in the neonate is a common normal finding, and newborn nurseries often discharge infants with a nasal bulb syringe to enable the gentle removal of secretions from the small narrow nasal passages to clear the airway to enhance breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. In the past, it was thought that newborns are obligatory nasal breathers for the first few months of life. However, research has demonstrated newborns have the ability to switch from nasal to mouth breathing as needed, so they are "preferential" nasal breathers. [2] Respiratory compromise or distress occurs rapidly in young infants when the nasal passages become occluded. The most common reason for occlusion is mucosal congestion or increased secretions, but congenital anatomical deformities, obstructive masses, or traumatic obstruction can occlude the nasal passages. Nasal resistance is an important factor in total airway resistance, and nasal occlusion may contribute to half of total airway resistance.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Internal nose</h3>
                        <p>The internal nose, the vestibule, is divided by the bony and cartilaginous nasal septum. The septum is rarely perfectly straight, and a significant deviation of the septum at birth or resulting from the birth process or trauma must be assessed to determine whether it interferes with nasal breathing. The perpendicular plate of the nasal septum ossifies by 3 years of age. The anterior portion of the vestibule is lined with vascular squamous epithelium that has tiny hair follicles and secretes mucus. The vast majority of nose bleeds, or epistaxis, result from a network of small blood vessels found in the anterior superficial portion of the septal mucosa known as the Kiesselbach plexus. The posterior portion is lined with fragile respiratory epithelium. The lateral walls of the nose are composed of horizontal bony structures known as the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates, which mature throughout childhood and resemble those of the adult by 12 years of age (see Fig. 14.3). They are covered with vascular mucous membranes. Furrows between the bony structures provide recesses to filter air and form a nasal passage, or meatus. The posterior ethmoid sinuses drain into the superior meatus, and the paranasal sinuses drain into the middle meatus. Until approximately 6 years of age, the inferior meatus is nonfunctioning except that it drains the nasolacrimal duct. This is why the nose has increased drainage in children, particularly during periods of crying or eye irritation. The space between the posterior portion of the turbinates and the posterior wall of the nasopharynx is called the choana and is of little significance in children unless blocked or narrowed by a congenital abnormality such as choanal atresia, a bony or membranous blockage of one or both naris posterior to the nasal turbinates, resulting in blockage of the airway and respiratory distress in the newborn. It occurs in 1 in 5000 to 7000 births and occurs more often in females 2:1 and unilaterally 2:1. In newborns, choanal atresia can be associated with the CHARGE syndrome. [3]</p>
                        <p>Cranial nerve I (olfactory) innervates the nasal area. The olfactory receptor cells line the upper reaches of the nasal cavity in the olfactory epithelium and innervate the olfactory nerve. Olfactory learning begins in utero and is well developed in the newborn. It assists newborns in recognizing the distinct smell of their mother's breast milk. Nasal congestion or mucus plugging limits airflow up to the receptors and can block the sensation of smell.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nasopharynx</h3>
                        <p>The nasopharynx forms the superior portion of the pharynx. The eustachian tube opening is located along the lateral walls of the nasopharynx (see Fig. 14.3). Adenoidal tissue is found along the superior posterior wall of the oropharynx and is referred to as the pharyngeal tonsils. The inferior border of the nasopharynx is formed by the soft palate. The nasopharynx is surrounded by bone, ensuring patency unless trauma occurs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sinuses</h3>
                        <p>The paranasal sinuses consist of paired cavities: maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses. The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth but are small. The frontal sinuses begin to develop by 7 years of age, and the sphenoid sinuses develop in adolescence. As the sinuses develop, they become air-filled cavities; and when mature, they are lined with ciliated epithelium containing goblet cells and submucosal glands that produce seromucinous secretions and immune mediators. The sinuses reach their final maturity between 12 and 14 years of age (Fig. 14.4; see Table 14.2). [4]</p>

                        <p>The oral cavity is composed of the lips, cheeks, hard and soft palates, teeth, posterior pharynx, tongue (Fig. 14.5), sensory cells for taste, and the mandible that supports the lower gums and teeth. The cheeks form the lateral walls that are lined with buccal mucosa. Cheeks may be particularly prominent in young children because of the buccal fat pad. The cheeks and lips are innervated by cranial nerves V (trigeminal) and VII (facial). The central nervous system controls the complex mechanisms of the mouth needed for sucking, swallowing, breathing, and vocalization. The hard palate is the anterior two thirds of the palate and separates the nasal and oral cavities. The posterior third of the palate is the soft palate, which is contiguous with the lateral pharyngeal wall. It provides a slightly mobile barrier between the nasopharynx and oropharynx and is essential for normal articulation and speech intonation.</p>
