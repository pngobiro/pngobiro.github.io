                        <p>The ear is a sensory organ that functions as part of a complex sensory system for hearing and vestibular equilibrium. Visual inspection of the ear is only the first step in determining the normal function of this complex organ. The role of the pediatric health care provider is to maintain function of the ear to preserve hearing and balance in the child and adolescent and to detect any abnormalities early in infancy. The goal of early detection is to promote optimum development of hearing and to support normal development of speech and language.</p>

                        <p>The external ear is a cartilaginous structure on the external surface of the temporal bone (Fig. 13.1). The structures of the ear evolve in the mesoderm, and development of the external ear begins during the sixth week of gestation when the six hillocks of His develop from the first and second branchial arches. The individual portions of the auricle, or flap of the ear, begin to fuse and assume the classic adult shape by the 12th week of gestation, and fusion is complete by the 20th week (Fig. 13.2). The normal auricle should be no greater than 10 degrees off vertical plane or slope, and the superior portion should be in line with the outer canthus of the eye (Fig. 13.3). Minor malformations of the auricle may be normal variants, such as preauricular skin tags, a preauricular sinus, or Darwin tubercle, a slight thickening or nodule at the upper portion of the helix (Fig. 13.4). Malformations can also be the result of intrauterine position, exposure to certain toxins or medications such as isotretinoin (Accutane), intrauterine infection, or other intrauterine complications occurring during this early phase of fetal development. Some genetic syndromes, Down syndrome, first arch syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and Nager syndrome, are associated with ear malformations, such as a small external ear, anotia, the total absence of the auricle with narrowing or absence of the external auditory opening, or malpositioned ears often in combination with internal ear abnormalities. Hearing loss also has viral causes (rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), and multiple genetic causes including Usher syndrome, Alport syndrome, and CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae—also known as choanal atresia, growth retardation, and ear abnormalities) syndrome. Bilirubin toxicity in newborns is associated with high-frequency hearing loss.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inner ear</h3>
                        <p>The inner and middle ear are located in the temporal bone of the skull. Although the external ear formation coincides with the gestational formation of the internal ear structures, they develop separately. The auditory placode and the acousticofacial ganglion are present the fourth week of gestation. Over the next month the first of the three turns in the cochlea develops. Arrest in development during this phase results in a common bony abnormality of the inner ear associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) known as Mondini deformity. The final 2.5 turns of the cochlea occur by the 12th week of gestation. The organ of Corti develops from the epithelium of the cochlea and is responsible for transmission of sound impulses to the eighth cranial nerve, the acoustic nerve. Improper development of the membranous labyrinth of the organ of Corti results in a Scheibe deformity, which is the most common congenital abnormality of the cochlear duct, resulting in SNHL (see later section, Hearing Loss). Alterations in development during this period due to chromosomal abnormalities or other causes can lead to hearing loss of particular auditory tones. The semicircular canals first appear in the sixth week of gestation with differentiation of canal structures being complete by the 16th week. The sensory cells needed for equilibrium actually attain adult size by the 23rd week of gestation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Middle ear</h3>
                        <p>Simultaneous with the early development of the inner ear is the formation of the first pharyngeal pouch, Meckel cartilage, in the oropharynx. The proximal portion of the pharyngeal pouch develops into the eustachian tube, and the distal portion becomes the tympanic cavity and supporting structures. The eustachian tube is 17 to 18 mm long at birth and lies 10 degrees off the horizontal plane. The development of the tympanic cavity with the three ossicles, the malleus, incus, and stapes, is not complete until the eighth month of gestation, but the malleus and incus reach adult size and shape by the 18th week of gestation and the stapes by the 20th week of gestation. [1] Meckel cartilage forms the incus and malleus of the middle ear, and the second pharyngeal pouch, the Reichert cartilage, forms the stapes. Failure of these structures or their supporting ligaments to form properly results in a conductive hearing loss [2] (see later section, Hearing Loss). Any malformation or dysfunction of the middle ear structures can result in conductive hearing loss.</p>

                        <p>The external ear, the pinna, is divided into sections: the outer portion is called the helix, just medial and parallel to the helix is the antihelix, and the concha is the cavity leading to the external auditory meatus or opening of the external canal (Fig. 13.5). A firm protuberance on the anterior portion of the ear just at the entrance to the auditory canal is the tragus, and across from the tragus on the border of the antihelix is the antitragus. Beneath the tragus is the soft fold of skin that forms the ear lobe. Although the shape of the auricle varies slightly from person to person, the ears should be comparable bilaterally in size, shape, position, and appearance.</p>

                        <p>The external auditory canal, an S-shaped canal measuring approximately 2.5 cm in length by middle school-age, connects the outer ear to the middle ear and funnels sound waves to the tympanic membrane. The auricular muscles are innervated by the seventh cranial nerve, or facial nerve. The medial portion of the canal is innervated by the fifth cranial nerve, or trigeminal nerve, and the posterior canal is innervated by the 10th cranial nerve, or vagus nerve. The distal third of the ear canal contains hair follicles, ceruminous glands, and sebaceous glands. The cilia (specialized hair) are extremely sensitive to tactile stimulation and assist in sensing sound. The ceruminous gland, a modified apocrine sweat gland, secretes a milky substance that forms cerumen when exposed to the secretions of the sebaceous glands and air. Cerumen lubricates the skin of the canal, acts as a barrier to foreign objects entering the interior canal, and has protective antibacterial properties to reduce the incidence of skin infection in the external canal. Natural lateral movement of skin and hair cells in the external canal facilitates drainage of cerumen and other debris from the external ear canal.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Middle ear</h3>
                        <p>The tympanic membrane is a thin, oval-shaped layer of skin attached to the wall of the external canal and is approximately 9 to 10 mm in diameter (Fig. 13.6). It is concave being pulled in by its attachment to the malleus and sits at an oblique angle in the external canal. It is surrounded by a fibrous band called the annulus, which becomes sclerotic later in life, diminishing movement of the tympanic membrane and often resulting in conductive hearing loss. The tympanic membrane is attached to the malleus along the manubrium conducting sound waves to the incus, stapes, and oval window of the inner ear. The tympanic membrane has a resonance frequency of 800 to 1600 Hz, approximating the normal speech frequency of 500 to 2000 Hz found in humans. The tympanic membrane is divided into sections: (1) the pars flaccida is superior to the lateral process of the malleus, (2) the pars tensa comprises the majority of the tympanic membrane inferior to the lateral process of the malleus, and (3) Prussak space, which lies medial to the pars flaccida in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane (see Fig. 13.6). Prussak space is the most common location of retraction pockets and congenital or acquired cholesteatoma (Fig. 13.7), an initially asymptomatic white mass in the middle ear that is thought to arise from repeated infections or pulling inward of the eardrum due to eustachian tube dysfunction. Over time, this mass can increase in size and destroy the delicate bones of the middle ear leading to conductive hearing loss. [1] Tympanosclerosis, thickening and scarring of the tympanic membrane, is commonly seen after chronic infections of the middle ear or traumatic injury or surgery to the tympanic membrane (Fig. 13.8).</p>

                        <p>The three ossicles of the inner ear, the smallest bones in the body, transmit the movement of the tympanic membrane to the oval window and subsequently to the vestibular and cochlear branches of the eighth cranial nerve, the acoustic nerve (Fig. 13.9). The head of the malleus articulates with the body of the incus at the incudomalleolar joint. The long crus or leglike structure of the incus, articulates with the head of the stapes at the incudostapedial joint. These joint areas are the most vascular regions of the ossicles and, therefore, are the most susceptible to trauma or infection. The footplate of the stapes sits upon the oval window of the inner ear at the fibrous stapediovestibular joint. Because of the mechanical function of the three ossicles and the transmission of sound waves from the larger surface area of the tympanic membrane to the smaller surface area of the oval window, there is a net increase of 22 times the sound energy radiating from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.</p>

                        <p>The eustachian tube opens into the oropharynx just behind the nasal cavity and is the drainage and ventilatory structure for the middle ear. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the back of the throat. The middle ear is an air-filled space and when patent has the same air pressure as the outside air pressure. Swallowing, yawning, and sneezing all open the eustachian tube and restore and equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the outside air pressure. Changes in altitude or ambient pressure, such as occurs on an airplane, can result in decreased air pressure in the middle ear, resulting in pain or discomfort if the eustachian is swollen or blocked. Repeated swallowing can often open the eustachian tube, equalizing pressure and reducing the associated pain. The infant who sucks on the bottle or breast can also reduce this discomfort in flight. In the adult, the eustachian tube averages 35 mm in length. In infancy, it is half that length (approximately 18 mm) and lies in a more horizontal plane than in the adult, which allows bacteria and viruses to more easily migrate from the oropharynx to the middle ear (Fig. 13.10). The musculature of the eustachian tube, which controls function, is innervated by the motor division of the fifth cranial nerve, or trigeminal nerve. In infants and children with cleft palate and other central craniofacial abnormalities such as Down syndrome, structural or functional abnormalities of the eustachian tube interfere with normal ventilation and clearance of the middle ear, increasing the incidence of otitis media (OM) in these children. Equalization of pressure in the middle ear is critical for normal sound wave vibration of the tympanic membrane.</p>

                        <p>Muscle maturation, elongation of the eustachian tube, and a more vertical position all contribute to the decreased incidence of OM and middle ear effusions in middle childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inner ear</h3>
                        <p>The inner ear is the sensory end organ and is directly responsible for hearing and balance. The inner ear contains the vestibule, semicircular canals, and cochlea and is bathed in fluid that facilitates the transmission of sound waves to the auditory nerve and sensations of balance in the semicircular canals (see Fig. 13.1). The sound waves pass over approximately 30,000 innervated hair cells in the cochlea, which are the primary receptors, transducers, and conveyers of sound energy to the brain.</p>

                        <p>In recent years, the understanding of genetics and the auditory system has increased significantly. Autosomal recessive genetic SNHL accounts for approximately 70% to 80% of all genetic forms of hearing loss in children, and autosomal dominant genetic SNHL accounts for 10% to 15%. [1] There are more than 400 known causes of genetic hearing loss. The most common form of recessive hearing loss is due to one gene, connexin 26 (abbreviated CX26). Approximately one-third of children with hearing loss have syndromic hearing loss with other clinical findings, such as Usher syndrome, Pendred syndrome, or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Infants with malformed external ear structures require close monitoring. Infants identified with nonsyndromic hearing loss (hearing loss without additional clinical findings) may be missed and are harder to diagnose. Many genetically determined causes of hearing loss do not present at birth and may not be identified through newborn screening. Radiographic imaging such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify up to 40% of middle and inner ear abnormalities, but imaging is used infrequently because of the concern of longterm risks of radiation exposure for infants and young children. Genetic testing is now often the first investigative tool to identify the cause of hearing loss. [2]</p>
                        <p>Acquired causes of hearing loss are numerous, and risk factors must be identified (Box 13.1). Prenatal risk factors include gestational diabetes in the mother, congenital infections (CMV, rubella, toxoplasmosis, herpes, syphilis, varicella), exposure to teratogens (alcohol, methyl mercury, thalidomide, cocaine), and ototoxic medications (aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, quinine). Prematurity, birth hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis, and administration of ototoxic medications are risk factors for acquired hearing loss in the perinatal period. Head trauma, infections (mumps, measles, varicella, meningitis, Lyme disease), recurrent OM, and excessive noise exposure are risk factors for hearing loss any time they occur. [2]</p>
                        <p>Environmental exposure to noise is a major source of hearing loss, and children and adolescents should be screened for exposure to loud sounds in their home, school, or recreational environments. Children living in industrial areas with heavy traffic or near loud machinery are more prone to hearing loss in the decibel range associated with the environmental exposure. [2]</p>
