                        <p>Assessing the musculoskeletal system is challenging for pediatric health care providers due to the variations in growth and development and the normal range of rotational changes in the extremities in children from birth to young adulthood. Increasing knowledge about the normal developmental changes in the musculoskeletal system is key to accurate assessment and limiting overreferral. Performing appropriate physical assessment techniques assists in diagnosis of common orthopedic conditions and prompt referral when indicated for children with intentional or unintentional injuries.</p>

                        <p>The rudimentary skeletal system forms as early as the fourth week of gestation, when the development of the vertebrae begins and the upper extremities begin as buds on the fetus. As early as the seventh week of gestation, embryonic vascular growth progresses toward the center of the osteoblasts in the long bone, which forms cartilage. During the ninth week of gestation, ossification, or bone growth, begins in the ossification centers in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae, and ossification continues in the femur. The hand pads develop from the extremity buds by days 33 to 36, and the finger rays begin to form on days 41 to 43. [1] It is during this period of gestation that polydactyly, the presence of extra digits, or syndactyly, the webbing or fusing of the digits, occurs along with other deformities of the extremities. The calcaneus, the largest tarsal bone of the foot, ossifies at the sixth month of fetal life. The position of the fetus in utero has the greatest impact on the skeletal system, and the most common variants present at birth.</p>
                        <p>Muscle structures, including the tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and joints, originate from the embryonic mesoderm. Muscle fibers are developed by the fourth or fifth month of gestation. They increase in size along with changes in muscle and fat proportions throughout childhood and adolescence.</p>

                        <p>At birth, the epiphyses of the long bones are composed of hyaline cartilage. Shortly after birth, the secondary ossification centers begin to replace the cartilage along the mat plate. During early periods of rapid growth, ossification occurs in secondary sites throughout the body: the ends of the long bones, the vertebrae, the flat bones in the clavicle, and the skull. The replacement of cartilage by bone is known as endochondral ossification. The epiphyseal plate ossifies, becoming the diaphysis, the shaft of the long bone; and cartilage at the metaphyseal plate replaces bone cells (Fig. 19.1).</p>

                        <p>Bone growth continues in infants and children along the epiphysis as new bone is added to the outer surface of existing bone. Growth along the epiphyseal plate continues until the cells in the growth plate mature and stop dividing in puberty, and closure of the growth plate occurs in young adulthood when the metaphysis and the epiphysis fuse.</p>
                        <p>Several factors influence the healthy development of the skeletal system and normal growth at the epiphyseal plate. Trauma during childhood can cause separation of the epiphysis and the blood vessels to rupture, resulting in cessation of bone growth and a shortened extremity. [1] Nutritional factors, such as adequate protein in the diet, the amount of calcium intake daily, and adequate intake of vitamin D, which regulates the adsorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines, impact bone growth. Adequate levels of vitamin D, particularly important in the breastfed infant, may also have a role in improving muscle and immune function in childhood. Parents are advised to apply sunscreen and limit direct sun exposure for infants and children due to long-term risks of skin cancer, therefore reducing vitamin D synthesis from the skin. Balancing safe sun exposure and maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D in infants and children is important to maintaining bone strength. Rickets is a deficiency of vitamin D in which the growth plate is impaired by calcification of newly formed bone on the metaphyseal plate. Alterations in thyroid or growth hormones can also impact normal patterns of growth in childhood. [1]</p>

                        <p>The clavicle lies in a horizontal plane above the first rib and rotates between the sternum and the superior surface of the scapula (Fig. 19.2). The scapula, a large, flat triangular bone, lies posterior on the upper back and forms the posterior portion of the upper extremity, and the superior, lateral angle articulates with the rounded head or capsule of the humerus, the large bone in the upper arm. The distal end of the humerus forms the condyle and is divided into the medial epicondyle and the lateral epicondyle. The proximal end of the ulna attaches at the articulating surface of the humerus and forms one of two long bones in the forearm. The olecranon is the outer, rounded distal surface of the ulna and forms the major portion of the elbow. The distal end of the ulna is small and articulates with the wrist bones. The radius is along the lateral side or thumb side of the forearm, and the distal end of the radius forms a large portion of the wrist bones.</p>

                        <p>The hand consists of eight carpal and five metacarpal bones. Many of the carpal bones are cartilaginous at birth. A radiograph of a child's hand at 2.5 years of age illustrates ossification of only the capitate and hamate bones in the midhand. Development and ossification of the hand continues until 11 years of age, when all of the carpal bones are ossified except for the small pisiform bone, which develops by 12 years of age. Abnormalities of the phalanges, or fingers, such as syndactyly, webbing, or fusion between adjacent digits of the hands or feet, may be an isolated anomaly or indicative of profound developmental delay (Fig. 19.3). Polydactyly, the presence of supernumerary digits, is a more common variant and is not usually associated with other congenital anomalies.</p>

                        <p>The infant has a C-shaped spinal curve at birth in comparison with the double S curvature that is present in late adolescence (Fig. 19.4).</p>
                        <p>Thoracic and pelvic curves are present at birth, and the secondary cervical curve is present by 3 to 4 months of age, when the infant begins to hold up his or her head. The lumbar curvature begins to form as the infant bears weight and begins to walk. The young child often has an exaggerated thoracic-lumbar curvature and a protuberant abdomen until 3 years of age, when gait and balance become more normal (Fig. 19.5). The sacrum is composed of five separate bones at birth and by 18 to 20 years of age is fused into one large bone. The coccyx consists of three or four small bones that begin to ossify between the first and fourth years of life and fuses into one bone by 25 years of age.</p>

                        <p>The hip bone has three distinct parts in childhood, which are later fused in the adult. The ilium is the superior, broad, flat surface of the hip bone. The ischium is the strongest portion of the hip bone and contains a portion of the acetabulum, which forms the attachment at the hip bone for the femur and the opening or foramen (see Fig. 19.2). The pubis contains the medial portion of the acetabulum and joins medially to form the complete pelvic girdle.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lower extremities and feet</h3>
                        <p>The femur is the longest and strongest bone in the body. The head of the femur becomes ossified during the first year of life, but the shaft of the femur does not become completely ossified until 14 years of age. The long bones of the extremities continue to grow at the site of the epiphyseal plate throughout childhood and adolescence; peak bone mass is achieved by young adulthood. In the lower leg, the larger bone is the tibia, the proximal end articulates with the femur and the distal end forms the medial malleolus of the ankle. The fibula is the smaller bone in the lower leg and lateral to the tibia. The distal end of the fibula forms the lateral malleolus of the ankle.</p>
                        <p>The patella is the small triangular bone that forms the kneecap and lies over the junction of the femur and the tibia. The health of the patella during growth and development depends not only on strong bone growth but also on the strength of the ligaments and tendons supporting the patella.</p>
                        <p>The seven tarsal bones and five metatarsal bones of the foot undergo dramatic ossification during the first year of life. The ossification of the bones in the foot follows the normal development of the gross motor milestones. The talus is ossified by the seventh month of life to form the ankle, and the remaining metatarsal bones continue to form during the latter half of the first year of life. The phalanges continue the ossification process through adolescence.</p>
                        <p>The lower limbs go through a continuous process of growth and rotational change until approximately 8 years of age. The torsional development of the skeletal system is a process that begins in infancy and progresses from sitting to crawling, then standing, cruising, and finally walking with an exaggerated gait and a wide base of support. The laxity in the ligaments and fetal positioning in the intrauterine environment, as well as sitting and sleeping patterns in the early years, contribute to the normal torsional variations in the lower extremities during childhood. Torsional variations and musculoskeletal abnormalities are hereditarily linked and often show a strong family tendency.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Monitoring growth</h3>
                        <p>During growth, bone has the remarkable capacity to remodel itself. Bone is deposited in areas subjected to stress and reabsorbed in areas where there is little stress. This physiologic process explains the ability of children to remodel residual deformity after fractures and demonstrates the biologic plasticity of growing bones. The rate of bone growth is greatest in the lower extremities before the onset of puberty, and the distal extremities reach adult size in early puberty. This is often reflected in shoe size in preadolescents. The trunk and proximal extremities exhibit the dominant growth during puberty and into young adulthood. Bone growth is completed at age 20 years, and peak bone mass is not achieved until 35 years of age.</p>
                        <p>Monitoring the velocity of growth is the key focus of routine well-child visits and when following children with chronic health conditions, particularly cardiac conditions. For the child with slow growth or delayed onset of puberty, obtaining past growth charts and evaluating the progression of the growth curve along with familial patterns of growth and pubertal development is critical to assessing an abnormal growth pattern.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Muscle development</h3>
                        <p>The rate of muscle growth and development increases rapidly beginning at age 2 years. Early muscle growth is balanced by a normal decrease in adipose tissue in early childhood. [1] The growth and maturation of the muscles continues along with the ossification of the skeletal system (Fig. 19.6). Muscle tone is the state of normal tension of the muscles, and term infants normally have strong muscle tone at birth. Abnormalities in muscle tone in an infant may be noted shortly after birth when an infant is floppy. Less than normal muscle tone is described as hypotonia; rigidity or increased muscle tone is known as hypertonia; and spasticity is resistance to the range of motion of the muscles, including flexion and extension. Musculoskeletal terminology is presented in Box 19.1. Normal muscle function requires the normal function of the lower motor neurons (LMNs) in the spinal cord and the normal reflexivity of the muscle fibers. Normal muscle tone requires the normal function of the spinal cord stretch reflex and the balance of the upper motor neurons (UMNs) and LMN function. Lesions on the UMNs result in increased tone, and LMN lesions result in decreased tone.</p>
