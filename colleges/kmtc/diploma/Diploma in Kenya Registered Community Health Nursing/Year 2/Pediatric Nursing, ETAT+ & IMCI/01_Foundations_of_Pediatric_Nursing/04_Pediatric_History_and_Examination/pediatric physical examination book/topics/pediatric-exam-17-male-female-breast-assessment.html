                        <p>Male and female breast development is similar until puberty; therefore the examination of both boys and girls will be reviewed in this chapter, along with pubertal changes expected for both genders. The primary intention of the breast exam in children and adolescents is to recognize normal variants, monitor development, and identify nonmalignant pathology. Making assessment of the breast part of the routine physical examination in preadolescents gives the parent or caregiver and child an opportunity to voice any concerns and fosters a dialogue about reproductive health and puberty. It is important to respect privacy in performing the examination of the breast in all children and adolescents. Current evidence and recommendations related to the efficacy of breast examination focus on the detection of breast cancer, which is an exceedingly rare diagnosis in adolescents; therefore, child and adolescent breast exam recommendations are based on expert practice rather than evidence.

                        <p>A mammary ridge forms from the ectodermal layer on day 20 of embryonic life and extends from the forelimb to the hind limb. In the sixth week of fetal life the nipple and areola form over a bud of breast tissue that is composed of the primary mammary ducts and a loose fibrous tissue or stroma. Fifteen to twenty-five secondary buds then develop and bifurcate into tubules, forming the basis of the duct system. [2] Each duct, as it develops, opens separately into the nipple.</p>

                        <p>At birth, the breasts of both male and female infants may be swollen because of the maternal estrogen effect (Fig. 17.1). An unusual but normal finding in the newborn is the secretion of a milklike substance, also known as "witch's milk," for 1 to 2 weeks (Fig. 17.2). [3] Male and female breast tissue is similar until puberty. Occasionally, a prepubertal male or female develops an enlargement of one or both breasts, which involves a soft, mobile, subareolar nodule of uniform consistency. [2] In general, the nipple and areola are not developed or pigmented with such a condition usually regresses spontaneously within weeks to months, and in the absence of other secondary sexual characteristics, a biopsy is not indicated. [2] If other signs of puberty appear, then these changes could be the first sign of precocious puberty, in which case referral and further diagnostic work-up are indicated.</p>

                        <p>Supernumerary nipples may arise from the mammary ridge and be present at birth (Fig. 17.3A). They are often raised, generally require no treatment, and become imperceptible over time. There is a weak association between supernumerary nipples and renal and cardiovascular abnormalities in white newborns. [3] In females, supernumerary nipples will on rare occasion develop a small amount of breast tissue during puberty (see polymastia in Table 17.2; see Fig. 17.3B). The adolescent may elect to have cosmetic surgery for removal of the supernumerary breast tissue. Widespread nipples are defined as a nipple spread of greater than 25% of the chest circumference and may be associated with congenital disorders such as Turner syndrome. [3]</p>

                        <p>At puberty the ductal and periductal mesenchymal breast tissue of boys proliferates under the influence of estrogens, with later involution as testicular androgens rise to adult levels. [2] Male estradiol levels triple during puberty, and androgens ultimately increase 30 times. Until recently, it was believed that peak estrogen levels occurring prior to peak androgen levels resulted in physiologic gynecomastia, a benign increase in glandular and stromal breast tissue in pubertal males (Fig. 17.4). However, the current understanding identifies leptin, a hormone made by adipose cells to regulate energy balance, as the hormone most likely responsible for pubertal gynecomastia. [2] Most circulating estrogens are produced outside of the testes, and an increase in fatty tissue, as in obesity, may lead to a higher incidence of gynecomastia (Box 17.1).</p>

                        <p>At 14 years of age, up to 64% of adolescent males have some degree of gynecomastia, with only 4% of adolescent males having severe gynecomastia that persists into adulthood. [2] Approximately 50% of males experience the onset of gynecomastia at sexual maturity rating (SMR) stage 2 of male genital development, another 20% at SMR stage 1, 20% at SMR stage 3 of male genital development, and 10% beginning at SMR stage 4 (see Chapter 16). Recent research shows an association between pubertal height velocity and the development of benign pubertal gynecomastia in a cohort of boys with delays in development, suggesting a causal relationship between acceleration of growth and development of gynecomastia in peripubertal males. [4] In general, adolescent males can be reassured that most cases of physiologic gynecomastia will resolve spontaneously within 12 to 18 months, although it can rarely persist after sexual maturity. [3] Treatment alternatives for persistent gynecomastia, including pharmacologic and surgical options, may be appropriate to discuss with youth and families when this condition does not resolve or is particularly distressing.</p>
                        <p>Gynecomastia, although a normal variant, is also present in relation to hormone imbalances due to thyrotoxicosis, cirrhosis, adrenal and testicular neoplasm, primary hypogonadism, chromosome abnormalities such as Klinefelter syndrome, and severe malnutrition. [2] In addition, prescription drugs such as ranitidine, omeprazole, ketoconazole, metronidazole, antiretrovirals, digoxin, spironolactone, phenothiazines, and some illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana, anabolic steroids, amphetamines, and alcohol) can cause gynecomastia. [3]</p>
                        <p>Breast development, an initial sign of secondary sexual development in males and females, is readily apparent to family members and peers, often eliciting unwanted comments as to presence or absence and size of breast tissue. Breast development is a common issue for teasing, bullying, and sexual harassment in middle school. The health care provider should be mindful that sexual harassment is a major issue for teens, often jeopardizing a teen's mental health and school performance. If the preteen or young adolescent seems particularly concerned or uncomfortable with the health history about breast development or the breast examination, gentle exploration of the issue by the provider, including queries as to teasing or bullying, or unwanted attention from family members, should be explored, and the adolescent should be referred for counseling if indicated.</p>

                        <p>Thelarche, or the beginning of female breast development, is usually the first sign of puberty in girls and occurs between 8 and 13 years of age, on average at the age of 11.2 years (Table 17.1 and Fig. 17.5). [1] Full breast development at SMR 5 signals the end of puberty in females. Breast development during puberty involves both multiple hormones and the binding of hormones to breast tissue. Estrogen, especially estradiol, influences ductal development, whereas progesterone influences additional lobular alveolar development. [2] Thyroxine and corticosteroids are also involved.</p>

                        <p>Up to 90% of newborns of both sexes commonly have a palpable nodule under the nipple and areola, which is thought to be related to exposure to estrogens through the placenta, and which generally regresses within 6 to 12 months. [2] Premature thelarche is defined as breast development without other signs of puberty, occurring before 7.5 years. Although isolated premature thelarche is usually benign and self-limited, the examiner should be sure to evaluate for other signs of precocious puberty. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion on endocrine-disrupting chemicals.) [2]</p>

                        <p>Mature female breast tissue at SMR stage 5 extends from the second or third rib to the sixth or seventh rib, and from the sternal margin to the midaxillary area with the nipple located centrally, surrounded by the areola. The breast is composed of glandular and fibrous tissue and subcutaneous and retromammary fat (Fig. 17.6). Fifteen to twenty lobes radiate around the nipple, and each lobe is divided into 20 to 40 lobules of milk-producing acini cells that empty into lactiferous ducts. [2] These cells are small and inconspicuous in the nonpregnant, nonlactating woman. A layer of subcutaneous fibrous tissue provides support for the breast, as do the suspensory ligaments. The muscles forming the floor of the breast are pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, external oblique, and rectus abdominis. Vascular supply comes from the internal mammary artery and the lateral thoracic artery. The lymph system drains to the anterior axillary, subscapular, and supraclavicular nodes.</p>
