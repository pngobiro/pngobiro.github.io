                        <p>Knowledge of lung development is critical when performing a respiratory assessment in early childhood, especially in a newborn infant who is born preterm. This information, along with an understanding of respiratory anatomy and physiology, will provide you with a foundation for interpreting pulmonary symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Lung development begins in utero at approximately 4 weeks' gestation. It occurs in five stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. During the embryonic phase, the lungs form from a sac on the ventral wall of the alimentary canal. Right and left branches form through budding and dividing. This is also the time when the vascular system begins to develop. During the pseudoglandular stage, branching of the lung bud occurs, as the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles are formed by 16 to 17 weeks' gestation. In addition, the intrapulmonary arterial system begins to branch, and cilia and cartilage begin to form. During the canalicular stage, branching of the bronchioles continues and alveoli begin to form. By approximately 25 weeks, the number of bronchial generations with cartilage is the same as the adult lung. This is also the period of capillary bed expansion. Growth of the pulmonary parenchyma and surfactant system occurs during the saccular phase. By 24 weeks the alveolocapillary membrane is ready to begin gas exchange. Maturation and expansion of the alveoli occur during the alveolar period and persist through early childhood. This is when the alveolocapillary membrane matures and the gas exchange surface area increases. Alveolization is complete by about 8 years of age. [1-3]</p>
                        <p>Breathing movements occur in utero. The movements are irregular and do not open the alveoli. Fetal gas exchange occurs via the placenta. At birth, the lungs fill with air for the first time and take on the role of ventilation and oxygenation. The fluid in the lungs moves into the tissues surrounding the alveoli and is absorbed into the lymphatic system. At this point, gas exchange occurs via diffusion across the alveolar-pulmonary capillary membranes. [1, 3]</p>

                        <p>The thorax is the bony cage that surrounds the heart, great vessels, lungs, major airways, and esophagus. [3] It is composed of the sternum and ribs (Fig. 9.1). The sternum is a flat, narrow bone made up of three parts: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. [4] The manubrium is somewhat triangular and attaches to the body of the sternum; the angle at which the manubrium and body meet is termed the manubriosternal angle or the angle of Louis. This angle is in line with the second rib and therefore serves as an important landmark. The xiphoid process is the small, thin, cartilaginous end of the sternum, which varies greatly in shape and prominence in infants and children because of the influence of heredity, intrauterine environment, and nutrition. It sits at the level of T9. [3-5] Pectus carinatum, pigeon breast, is the abnormal protrusion of the xiphoid process and sternum, and pectus excavatum, funnel chest, is the abnormal depression of the sternum (Fig. 9.2). [3, 4, 6, 7] The chest cavity is divided, with the middle portion known as the mediastinum.</p>

                        <p>There are 12 pairs of ribs; the first 7 pairs attach anteriorly via their corresponding costal cartilages to the sternum. Ribs 8, 9, and 10 are attached to the costal cartilage on the rib above them; ribs 11 and 12 do not attach anteriorly and are known as floating ribs. All 12 pairs of ribs attach posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. The diaphragm sits at the bottom of the rib cage and is the major muscle of respiration. There are 11 intercostal muscles anteriorly and posteriorly and 8 thoracic muscles, all of which help to increase the volume of the rib cage with inspiration and decrease the thoracic volume with expiration (Fig. 9.3). [3, 5]</p>

                        <p>The following landmarks are often used in describing the location of physical findings of the chest: the midsternal line (MSL), which runs down the middle of the sternum; the midclavicular line (MCL), located on the right and left sides of the chest, runs parallel to the MSL and through the middle of the clavicles (midway between the jugular notch and acromion) bilaterally. Laterally there are three lines on each side, the anterior axillary line (AAL), the midaxillary line (MAL), and the posterior axillary line (PAL). The AAL begins at the anterior axillary folds, the MAL begins at the middle of the axilla, and the PAL begins at the posterior axillary folds. Posteriorly is the vertebral line that runs down the middle of the spine and the scapular line, which runs down the inferior angle of each scapula (Fig. 9.4). [3-5, 7]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lower respiratory tract</h3>
                        <p>The respiratory system is divided into two parts: the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx and is reviewed in Chapter 14. The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar ducts and sacs, and alveoli (Fig. 9.5). The trachea is a tube that lies anterior to the esophagus. The distal end of the trachea splits into the right and left mainstem/primary bronchi. This bifurcation occurs at the level of T3 during infancy and childhood. By the time the child is an adult, this bifurcation occurs at T4 or T5. The right mainstem bronchus is shorter and more vertical than the left and, therefore, more susceptible to aspiration of foreign bodies in the young child. Beyond the bifurcation, the bronchi continue to branch into lobar/secondary bronchi. There are three branches on the right and two on the left; each branch supplies one of the lung lobes. These branches further divide into segmental/tertiary smaller bronchi to supply each segment of the lungs and finally the terminal bronchioles. Ultimately, the respiratory tract terminates with the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli, where gas exchange takes place. The bronchial arteries branch from the aorta and supply blood to the lung parenchyma. The blood supply is returned primarily by the pulmonary veins. [1, 3, 5]</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lungs</h3>
                        <p>The lungs are positioned in the lateral aspects of the thorax, separated by the heart and the mediastinal structures. The right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, and lower), and the left lung has two lobes (upper and lower). The apex is the top portion of the upper lobes, which extends above the clavicles. On the right side, the minor or horizontal fissure, located at the fourth rib, divides the right upper lobe (RUL) from the right middle lobe (RML). On the left side, there is a tongue-shaped projection that extends from the left upper lobe (LUL), called the lingula. Laterally, the right lower lobe (RLL) and the left lower lobe (LLL) occupy most of the lower lateral chest area. Only a small portion of the RML extends to the MAL, and it does not go beyond that point. Posteriorly, the vertebral column helps in identifying the underlying lung lobes. T4 marks the inferior portion of the upper lobes and the superior portion of the lower lobes. The base is the bottom portion of the lower lobes and is marked by T10 or T12, depending on the phase of respiration. [3] The principal function of the lungs is gas exchange between the atmosphere and the blood. Oxygen is carried into the lungs, and carbon dioxide is eliminated. The lungs play a significant role in acid-base balance.</p>
