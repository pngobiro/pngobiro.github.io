                        <p>Environment is a key determinant of health, and children are uniquely vulnerable to environmental hazards. Children's genetic predisposition, social milieu, and nutrition play an important role in their susceptibility to environmental hazards. [1] The burden of disease and cost of environmental hazards stems primarily from exposure to toxic chemicals and air pollutants, and the related health conditions affecting children include lead poisoning, exposure to mercury pollution, childhood cancers, asthma, autism, intellectual and learning disabilities, and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder. [2]</p>
                        <p>Toxic substances are those chemicals in the environment capable of causing harm. Toxicants are environmental hazards from chemical pollutants, and toxins are environmental hazards from biologic sources. Children have a larger ratio of surface area to body mass than adults which increases their susceptibility to pesticides and other environmental toxicants. Therefore, children absorb larger amounts of environmental toxins, kilogram for kilogram, than adults. Infants have three times as large a surface area and children have twice the surface area to body mass compared with an adult. [1] Young children breathe more air and drink more water per pound of body weight than adults. They have greater exposure to toxic chemicals and air pollutants for their body weight than adults, and they absorb toxic substances at a higher rate than adults. [3] The skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract in the child are particularly vulnerable to toxic substances and absorb them more readily and efficiently than those in the adult. The high gastric pH in children facilitates absorption of environmental toxins. The developing fetus and the young child are particularly vulnerable to the neurodevelopmental effects of environmental toxins because of their rapid periods of brain growth and development in the first 2 years of life.</p>
                        <p>Children also live and play closer to environmental hazards on the ground, which increases their concentration of inhaled toxic substances. The breathing zone of a child is lower than adults, and chemical pollutants such as lead or mercury and chemicals vaporizing from carpets, flooring, or nap mats affect children at a greater rate than adults. [1] Children's metabolic pathways are immature, and they metabolize toxic chemicals differently than adults because they lack the enzymes to break down and remove toxic chemicals from the body. [3] Their higher metabolic rate increases their oxygen consumption and production of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The increased CO<sub>2</sub> requires higher minute ventilation in infants and children and increases their exposure to particulate matter in the air. [1] The dose-response rate for exposure in children is far more rapid than in adults.</p>
                        <p>Environmental health is defined broadly; the long-term goal is to safeguard the children's health and improve the environments where children live, learn, and play. [3] It is critically important for pediatric health care providers to understand the impact of environmental hazards and exposures on the healthy growth and development of infants, children, and adolescents. Health care providers have a professional responsibility to identify and understand the environmental health risks present in the communities in which they work, to access available health risk data from community surveillance programs, and to report exposures to appropriate local and state authorities. Furthermore, providers are mandated to conduct appropriate screening tests and to educate children and families about toxic environmental health risks.</p>

                        <p>Children can encounter environmental hazards and be exposed to many different toxic substances in the home, car, school, child care setting, play environments, and community. Young children spend 80% to 90% of their time indoors, so environmental hazards in the home and child care environments are the primary sources of exposures. [1] Environmental health hazards include physical agents; chemical agents; outdoor and indoor air contaminants; water, soil, or dust contaminants; biologic irritants; allergens; toxins; and infectious agents. Box 5.1 presents common indoor and outdoor air pollutants, contaminants in water and soil, food contaminants, and hazardous substances that children may be exposed to through parental or family employment or hobbies.</p>

                        <p>Different developmental stages put children at risk for different types of exposures to environmental hazards. Prenatal exposure of the fetus to maternal smoking, substance use, and chemical or biologic agents increases the risk of absorption of toxicants and toxins. Toxicants such as illicit drugs, alcohol, cotinine from environmental tobacco smoke, mercury, and lead, all of which cross the placental barrier, contribute to low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, cognitive and developmental delays, and congenital birth defects. [4] In the newborn, particular attention should be given to toxicants in breast milk or infant formula, dermal contacts, and parental occupations.</p>
                        <p>Infants and toddlers have expanded mobility, giving them increased exposure to their environment. They are particularly vulnerable to oral exposures because of their hand-to-mouth activity and inhaled substances within the physical zone they occupy near the ground. Children in early and middle childhood become susceptible to toxicants in the school, child care settings, and playground environments. Occupational hazards are of particular concern in adolescents and young adults, as are harmful exposures that occur through experimentation with illicit drugs, alcohol, and intentional inhalation of other substances.</p>
                        <p>In addition to traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and hookahs are increasing in popularity among youth. E-cigarettes are batterypowered devices that deliver a nicotine-containing aerosol or vapor by heating a solution of nicotine, propylene glycol or glycerol used as a preservative, and a flavoring agent. [5] Exogenous nicotine exposure and cigarette use in adolescence has been associated with long-term structural and functional changes in the brain as cognitive maturation occurs throughout adolescence. Lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments, disrupted memory, selective attention, and reduced executive function and activity of the prefrontal cortex have been associated with early uptake of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. [6] Smoke from water pipes or hookahs appears to contribute to significantly more particulate matter than traditional cigarettes. There is as much as a 73-fold increase in nicotine in the urine following water pipe smoking and a significant increase in exposure to lung carcinogens. [7, 8]</p>

                        <p>Children are at risk for environmental toxins from dust in homes containing lead-contaminated soil, paint chips or peeling paint; industrial toxicants in or near neighborhoods, landfill sites, or waste treatment sites; pre-1989 plumbing with presence of lead pipes or lead solder; well water or contaminated tap water; and drinking water contaminated with lead. Children that play near high-traffic areas risk exposure to soil contaminated with old deposits from leaded gasoline. Children are also at increased risk for pesticide and organophosphate exposure, as they consume more fruits and vegetables per pound of body weight than adults. Children of farm workers are particularly vulnerable to pesticide and organophosphate exposure.</p>
                        <p>Children are at risk for indoor air pollutants such as environmental tobacco smoke, mold, pesticides in the home or school, products containing lead including pottery with lead glaze and imported pottery, and food products containing lead. Children's exposure to toxins may also occur through contact with a parent's workplace or work clothes and hobbies of family members and household contacts such as soldering or refinishing old cars and painted furniture can also put children at risk.</p>
                        <p>Children with asthma are at higher risk from exposure to outdoor air pollutants. Particulate matter in the air consists of extremely small particles and liquid droplets that can have adverse effects on developing lungs and respiratory function. Increased levels of particulate matter created by air pollution from gasoline and diesel engines and wood-burning stoves, release of known environmental toxins from industrial sources, and increased allergens due to extreme weather events can trigger and exacerbate childhood asthma. Children living in low-income communities are at highest risk for exposure to outdoor air pollutants and environmental toxins. Children living in low-income families with food insecurity are at risk for poor nutrition, resulting in iron or calcium deficiency, which may enhance the uptake of lead and lead toxicity in the body.</p>

                        <p>The concept of health risk communication is particularly important to assessing environmental health in children and is part of a holistic approach to working with families in the clinical setting. Health risk communication requires active listening to identify parental concern and the public health risks of exposure to indoor and outdoor hazardous substances in the surrounding community. It requires determining the presence of an environmental hazard, assessment of the health risk, the severity of the exposure or dose, acceptability of the health risk, the impact on the health of the child or adolescent, and communicating the health risk effectively to the family.

                        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently supported ending the use of the term level of concern in discussing blood lead levels (BLLs) in children because evidence indicates that no level of lead is safe; therefore all elevated levels of lead are of concern. [10] Health care providers should take the primary role in educating individual families and screening for risk of environmental exposure to lead. Lead screening in children is routinely performed in most pediatric health care settings at 1 year and 2 years of age. Health care providers should monitor the health status of children and infants with BLLs above the 97.5th percentile or greater than 2.0 &mu;g/dL until environmental investigation and mitigation have been implemented. [10] The risk of lead exposure must be reviewed with families at routine well-child health visits and in culturally and linguistically appropriate health education materials.</p>
                        <p>Immigrant and refugee children in the United States are at higher risk for elevate BLLs. Recent evidence indicates that the median age of immigrant and refugee children with elevated BLLs was 4.9 years, with an age range from 14 months to 13 years. [11] Since this age range is considerably older than the ages of recommended screening for most children in the United States, it is particularly important for health care providers to screen the pediatric immigrant population for lead toxicity. Malnutrition and food insecurity are a known risk factors for increased BLL, and immigrant children have an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia which predisposes them to the increased intestinal adsorption of lead. [11]</p>
                        <p>Infants and children can be exposed to lead contaminants from a variety of substances including household dust, household products, candies, and medications. Children living in immigrant families are particularly vulnerable to household and medicinal exposures to lead. Box 5.2 provides questions for assessing health risks for lead exposure in children and families. Table 5.2 presents common substances associated with elevated BLLs in immigrant and refugee children.</p>

                        <p>Children with excess lead levels usually show no unique features on physical examination. Environmental exposures are often insidious and affect the internal organs and brain. Untreated elevated BLLs in early and middle childhood are associated with reduced intelligence quotient (IQ). [4] Children with lead toxicity may present with one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue, malaise, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, constipation, irritability, headache, weakness, or clumsiness. Any signs of developmental delay, neurobehavioral disorders such as tics, persistent hand-tomouth activity such as pica, unexplained seizures, anemia, chronic abdominal pain, learning difficulties, or attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder warrant an in-depth environmental health history to relate positive exposure to environmental toxins and hazards. Fig. 5.1 illustrates the primary organs and body systems affected by exposure to environmental hazards.</p>
