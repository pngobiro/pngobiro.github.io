                        <p>Lymphatic malformation can occur during early embryonic development as a congenital defect of the lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic channels may become blocked, and lymphatic fluid collects in the vessels during embryonic development, forming a mass or cyst which is present at birth but may not be detected until later in the first year of life or in early childhood. Fetal ultrasound (US) may detect large congenital malformations noted at birth. A lymphatic cyst or mass generally occurs in the neck, mouth, or tissues around the ear and may be associated with other chromosomal abnormalities (Table 11.1).</p>

                        <p>The lymphatic system is one of the most sensitive indicators of infection and toxins in children. The lymphatic tissue plays a role in the immune system as a first responder to fight infection through phagocytosis, the destruction of harmful cells, and the production of lymphocytes and antibodies. The lymphatic system forms an extensive network throughout the body and is composed of capillaries, collecting vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs.</p>
                        <p>The bone marrow and thymus, which are the central lymphoid organs, provide the center for the production and maturation of the immune cells. [1] The peripheral lymphoid organs-the spleen, tonsils, appendix, and lymphatic tissue in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems-concentrate antigens or immunogens and promote the cellular interactions of the immune response throughout the body to seek out and destroy microbes. [1]</p>
                        <p>Lymph is a clear, colorless fluid filtered and collected through the lymphatic capillaries from the organs and tissues throughout the body. The fluid consists of white bloods cells and occasionally red blood cells. The collecting vessels or lymphatic vessels are small canals that lie near the blood vessels and carry lymph from the lymphatic capillaries to the lymph glands and back to the bloodstream. The lymph is deposited into the bloodstream through the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck. The lymphatic system also absorbs fat and fat-soluble substances from the intestinal wall. The lymph and fat are transported from the lymph glands to the larger ducts and through venous return to the heart. The lymphatic system plays a major role in the maintenance of fluid balance and filters fluid at the lymph nodes and removes bacteria. Obstruction of lymph flow or removal of lymph nodes causes lymphedema.</p>
                        <p>Lymph glands are small aggregates of lymphoid tissue lying along lymphatic vessels throughout the body and consist of outer cortical layers and an inner medullary layer. The terms lymph gland and lymph node are often used interchangeably, and both terms can be applied to the lymphatic system. A gland is an organ that produces a substance or secretion, and a node is a swelling or protuberance. The lymph nodes throughout the body are filters for the collection vessels. Each lymph node processes lymph from the surrounding anatomic area. Lymph nodes remove antigens and microbes from the lymph before it enters the bloodstream, serve as the site of the body's immune response, and aid in the maturation of lymphocytes and monocytes. The immune response within the lymph node ultimately leads to its increase in size. [2] Fig. 11.1 illustrates the lymph glands in the head and neck area and gives a view of the lymphatic chain in the body.</p>

                        <p>The T lymphocytes are responsible for cell-mediated immunity and aid in antibody production. They are activated in the cortex of the lymph nodes and proliferate to fight antigens. The B lymphocytes are essential for humoral immunity. They interact with the T lymphocytes and migrate to the medulla to mature before releasing antibodies. Many interactions in the immune system depend upon the secretion of chemical mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. Cytokines are soluble proteins secreted by cells of the immune system and mediate many functions within the cell. Chemokines are cytokines that stimulate the immune system and activate inflammatory cells systemically in acute and chronic conditions activating the lymphatic system. [1]</p>

                            <p>Occipital nodes are located high above the hairline in the infant and are often missed by the examiner palpating too low at the nape of the neck. Occipital adenopathy may be an indicator in the newborn of maternal infection during pregnancy or in the infant of an acute viral infection. They may be visible on inspection and are often noted by the parent of a young infant.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The tonsils and adenoids are organs of the lymphatic system. The buds of tonsillar tissue are present in the oropharynx at birth but are underdeveloped. As the immune system develops and reacts to respiratory triggers, such as viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and environmental toxins, the tonsils are the first line of defense. The tonsils harbor the immune cells needed to respond to the constant exposure of microorganisms. The adenoidal tissue is a mass of lymphoid tissue situated posterior to the nasal cavity. The adenoids are also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil. Significant hypertrophy of the adenoidal tissue can partially or completely block airflow through the nasal passages and impact the quality of the voice. Adenoiditis, the inflammation of the adenoid tissue, often accompanies tonsillitis and occurs mainly in childhood. Incidence decreases with age, due to atrophy of adenoid tissue after adolescence.</p>
                        <p>The thymus gland is embedded beneath the upper sternum above the heart and is a fully developed organ in the term infant. The thymus gland is prominent in the mediastinum of the newborn and infant in the first year of life, often shadowing the cardiac silhouette on radiographs (Fig. 11.2). In the infant the thymus begins to produce mature T lymphocytes and plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity. In puberty, when the immune system is well established, the thymus decreases in size and is gradually mostly replaced by adipose tissue. Thymus tissue persists in the adult but has no demonstrated function.</p>

                        <p>The spleen lies in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen protected by the rib cage. It is composed of lymphoid tissue and reticuloendothelial cells and is a densely vascular organ. The spleen acts to filter antigens in the bloodstream and responds to systemic infections. The spleen acts as a part of the immune system and hosts a sequence of activation events similar to the lymph nodes to fight blood-borne infection. In the infant and young child the spleen stores erythrocytes and filters the blood through the large presence of phagocytes. The spleen plays an important role in the immune system and the storage of erythrocytes, but it is a nonvital organ in the body.</p>

                        <p>In the newborn the amount of lymphatic tissue is small, but lymphadenopathy, enlargement of the lymph glands, can often be detected particularly in the occipital region as a result of perinatal infections. Lymphoid tissue increases throughout the first year of life, and cervical lymph nodes become more pronounced with respiratory infections by 12 months of age. In the young child, splenomegaly may also occur with episodic viral illness. By school age, tonsillar and adenoidal tissues are approximately the same size as in an adult, and then they increase in volume during pubertal development when tonsillar tissue becomes twice the adult size. During late adolescence the volume of lymphatic tissue begins to decrease and resumes an adult level, which is 2% to 3% of total body weight.</p>
                        <p>The variable size of the lymphoid tissue in early and middle childhood may be one of the contributing factors of obstructive sleep apnea or sleep-disordered breathing, but other common causes include congenital craniofacial abnormalities, chronic nasal allergy, recurrent respiratory infections, environmental irritants, and childhood obesity. All children and adolescents should now be screened for snoring. [2] It is important to differentiate primary snoring from snoring associated with disordered breathing. Pediatric sleep-disordered breathing is characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and intermittent obstructive apnea that disrupts normal sleep patterns. [3] The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is currently 1% to 3% in the pediatric population, and the prevalence of primary snoring is estimated to be 3% to 12%. [4]</p>
