                        <p>The female genital examination is a recommended yet an underperformed part of the routine physical for pediatric and adolescent girls. Routine performance of the female genital exam allows the health care provider to build skills and familiarity with normal variants in the genitourinary system and establish a baseline from which to monitor individual development and provide information and reassurance to children, youth, and parents or caregivers. However, many health care providers are underprepared to recognize normal genital findings in the prepubescent girl and are unfamiliar with common variations. [1]</p>
                        <p>With knowledge of normal development of the female reproductive anatomy, the health care provider can incorporate the routine examination of the genitalia into well-child care. The review of systems and genital exam offer an opportunity to foster a dialogue between parent and child concerning reproductive health. For religious and cultural reasons or personal preference, parents, children, and adolescents may be more likely to request female providers for the breast and female genital exam. In nonemergent situations, it is important to honor this request, either within the practice setting or by referral, and to respect privacy and confidentiality in performing the examination and discussing findings.</p>

                        <p>At 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, fetal gonads are bipotential, capable of differentiating into either a testis or an ovary. Both male and female embryos have one pair of primary sex organs, or gonads, and two pairs of ducts, wolffian ducts and müllerian ducts. During the sixth week the primordial germ cells migrate into the primary sex cords and begin to differentiate. Leydig and Sertoli cells appear in male embryos, producing testosterone and anti-müllerian hormone. In female embryos the gonads do not produce testosterone, and the gonads develop into ovaries. The wolffian ducts deteriorate, and the müllerian ducts develop into the uterus, upper vaginal tract, and fallopian tubes. The external genitalia differentiate at between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation (Fig. 18.1). Active mitosis continues and thousands of germ cells, oocytes, are produced. A newborn female may have 2 million primary oocytes at birth. However, after birth, no further oogonia occurs. [2]</p>

                        <p>In preterm neonates the labia majora may not cover the labia minora, and the clitoris will be prominent. Term newborns will have enlarged labia majora, which usually cover other external structures, a relatively large clitoris, and labia minora with dull pink epithelium, because of maternal estrogen effects (Fig. 18.2). A creamy white or slightly blood-tinged discharge is normal for up to 10 days after birth. The hymen is relatively thicker, pink-white, and redundant and may remain so up until 2 to 4 years of age (Fig. 18.3). [3]</p>

                        <p>Disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD) have their genesis in early fetal development and result from developmental variations in one or more of the three components of sex determination and differentiation: chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, and/or phenotypic sex. Manifestations of some types of DSD are evident at birth in the newborn with ambiguous genitalia, and infants with ambiguous genitalia should be referred in the neonatal period to a tertiary center with a comprehensive multidisciplinary team with an ethicist. [4] Other types of DSD may become evident only in early adolescence with variations in secondary sexual development (see Chapter 16 for further discussion).</p>
                        <p>In the absence of congenital anomalies, all female infants are born with a hymen, which can present in a variety of configurations. Commonly, the hymen is fimbriated, annular, or crescentic (Fig. 18.4). Annular hymens are more common at birth, whereas crescentic hymens are more common in girls older than 3 years. Fig. 18.5 illustrates hymen types that are rare-septate, cribriform, and imperforate. Table 18.1 presents congenital anomalies in development of the female genitalia.</p>

                        <p>After the newborn period and before menarche, the clitoris is approximately 3 mm in length and 3 mm in transverse diameter. The effects of estrogen can be seen in infants, with pinker and more redundant, or wavy hymens. In prepubertal preschool- and schoolage girls, hymens are thinner, redder and more sensitive to touch. The prepubertal vagina is rigid, nonelastic, and thin-walled, lined by columnar epithelium, which normally appears redder than the squamous epithelium lining the vagina of pubertal adolescents and adult women. During early puberty, the effects of increased circulating estrogens are seen on the vulva, including the hymen, as labia minora develop more fully and the hymen becomes thicker, pinker and more redundant.

The mean age of adrenarche in girls is 9 to 10 years of age but may occur as early as 7 to 8 years of age, particularly in African American girls (Fig. 18.6). Table 18.3 correlates development and sexual maturity rating (SMR), which includes breast development and pubic hair distribution in girls. The external genitalia and internal structures-labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vagina, ovaries, uterus-are developing under the influence of increasing estrogens, but they are not included as part of the SMR.</p>
