                        <p>The transition to extrauterine life marks a critical event for the newborn and requires readily adapting from a dependent state to one capable of newly expected independence. Important physiologic adjustments occur in pulmonary, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and immunologic adaptation to the external environment. [1] During fetal life with development of the respiratory system, pulmonary fluid occupies the evolving alveoli due to secretions from pulmonary epithelial cells necessary to ensure alveolar growth. Although production of this fluid normally decreases close to the time of delivery, residual fluid must be cleared to allow the lungs to expand with gas postnatally. Chemical stimuli such as decreased oxygen concentration and pH prompt respiratory center receptors to facilitate initiation of respirations. Paralleling these pulmonary changes are adaptations in circulatory patterns to redirect blood flow postnatally. In utero pulmonary blood vessels are constricted to facilitate flow away from unventilated lungs not yet meant to participate in oxygenation. A series of circulatory shunts, the ductus arteriosus, ductus venosus, and foramen ovale, facilitate optimized delivery of highly oxygenated blood from the placenta to the systemic circulation while bypassing the fetal lung (Fig. 6.1).

                        <p>Postnatally, the newborn must transition to sustained pulmonary ventilation by establishing adequate respirations for the exchange of gases. Postnatal changes in pulmonary and systemic pressure dynamics include closure of the fetal circulatory shunts to allow establishment of an adult circulatory pattern and may result in transient murmurs in some newborns. [2] The Apgar score reflects the transition of the newborn postnatally and is performed at 1 minute and 5 minutes of life. The score provides a summative assessment of reliable indicators of successful transition, including heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). Although not predictive of long-term perinatal or neurologic outcome, it remains the standard for assessing the newborn immediately after birth. [3]</p>

                        <p>Most often postnatally, the intricate transition to extrauterine life occurs rapidly and effectively. However, infants with system immaturity or other prenatal/birth complications or anomalies may not achieve adequate or complete transition. Approximately 10% of newborns will need some assistance to achieve successful pulmonary transition, although only 1% will require extensive respiratory support measures. [1, 3] Although tachypnea may be present during the first postnatal hours, from efforts to reabsorb alveolar fluid, persistence of this symptom may indicate poor transition. Clinical findings such as nasal flaring, expiratory grunting, or chest wall retractions may indicate respiratory distress needing intervention. [1]</p>
                        <p>Although most systems are anatomically complete by approximately 24 weeks gestation, many systems including the pulmonary system are functionally immature until closer to term. The pediatric health care provider must acknowledge the influences of gestational age, as well as circumstances of ongoing fetal environment, labor and/or delivery, and early postnatal life in assessing the newborn to determine the need for intervention to support adequate transition.</p>

                        <p>An important component of newborn assessment is establishing gestational age. Obtaining an accurate assessment of gestational age begins with the prenatal and birth history, and can assist the provider in anticipating conditions associated with preterm birth. Infants can be classified by gestational age as term infant, preterm infant, or postterm infant depending on the number of completed postmenstrual weeks. Gestational growth can be affected by maternal, placental, and fetal factors. [4] Term infants are born between the start of the 38th and completion of the 41st gestational week, whereas preterm infants are born prior to completing the 37th week and postterm infants are born following completion of the 41st week (Fig. 6.2). Infants born preterm and postterm are at increased risk for postnatal complications. Preterm infants are at risk for system immaturity, notably the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurologic systems. Especially at lower gestational ages, preterm infants may develop complications such as respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage that can substantially impact survival. Postterm infants are at risk for birth complications, such as shoulder dystocia, if they are also macrosomic, in addition to being at added risk for poor tolerance of labor, pulmonary complications such as meconium aspiration, and hypoglycemia. Accuracy in assessment of gestational age is thus essential for developing effective management plans. [2, 5-7]</p>

                        <p>Gestational age can be estimated based on prenatal assessments with calculated dates based on last menstrual period, or postnatally using a standardized assessment tool that considers neuromuscular and physical criteria. [6] The New Ballard Score (NBS) is the tool most commonly used to evaluate gestational age postnatally (Fig. 6.3 and Box 6.1). The NBS, consisting of six neuromuscular and six physical criteria, is validated to accurately estimate gestational age within 2 weeks when performed within the first 48 hours following birth. [2, 6] An increasing population to be aware of is the late preterm infant, defined as the infant whose postmenstrual age is 34 weeks 0/7 days to 36 weeks 6/7 days. These infants are not expected to be as physiologically competent as term infants and may have issues that prolong hospitalization, including jaundice, poor feeding, hypoglycemia, apnea, and thermal instability.

                            <p><strong>Posture.</strong> With infant quiet and in supine position, observe degree of flexion in arms, legs. Muscle tone and degree of flexion increase with maturity. Full flexion of the arms, legs = 4.</p>

Measure angle between base of thumb and forearm. Full flexion (hand lies flat on ventral surface of forearm) = 4.</p>
                            <p><strong>Arm recoil.</strong> With infant supine, fully flex forearms on upper arms, hold for 5 s; pull down on hands to fully extend and rapidly release arms. Observe rapidity and intensity of recoil to state of flexion. A brisk return to full flexion = 4.</p>
                            <p><strong>Popliteal angle.</strong> With infant supine and pelvis flat on firm surface, flex lower leg on thigh, then flex thigh on abdomen. While holding knee with thumb and index finger, extend lower leg with index finger of other hand. Measure degree of angle behind knee (popliteal angle). Angle of &lt;90 degrees = 5.</p>
                            <p><strong>Scarf sign.</strong> With infant supine, support head in midline with one hand; use other hand to pull infant's arm across shoulder so that infant's hand touches shoulder. Determine location of elbow in relation to midline. Elbow does not reach midline = 4.</p>
                            <p><strong>Heel to ear.</strong> With infant supine and pelvis flat on firm surface, pull foot as far as possible toward ear on same side.

                        <p>Congruence between growth measures and maturity is an important consideration in newborn assessment. When a newborn demonstrates expected growth at a given gestational age (if within 2 standard deviations [SDs] from the mean), [5] the infant is classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Infants whose growth exceeds standards for a given gestational age are considered large for gestational age (LGA), and conversely those whose growth is less than the standard for a given gestational age are classified as small for gestational age (SGA). [5, 6]</p>
                        <p>Newborns are also classified by birth weight, and the terms normal birth weight, macrosomic, low birth weight (LBW), very low birth weight (VLBW), and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are applied. Tables 6.3 and 6.4 present newborn weight and gestational age classifications. The etiologies of gestational age at birth and birth weight vary and may include maternal, placental, or fetal influences that can impact successful transition. Each of the gestational age and birth weight subgroups, especially at extremes, carries potential for neonatal complications.</p>

                        <p>Infants with birth weight below the 10th percentile for age are considered SGA. [6] The head may be microcephalic, or small in proportion to the body, and head circumference may be below the fifth percentile for age. Fetal growth restriction may be symmetrical with all growth parameters smaller than expected, or asymmetrical with head sparing. The etiology of fetal growth abnormalities varies. Symmetric growth restriction may be due to intrinsic fetal conditions such as chromosomal abnormalities, whereas asymmetric growth restriction is often due to impaired placental perfusion or nutrient deprivation during fetal development. [6] With adequate nutrition, SGA infants experience overall catch-up growth. Head circumference is normally the first growth parameter to show catch-up growth, followed by weight and then length.</p>
                        <p>Newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have restricted fetal weight, length, or head circumference (occipitofrontal head circumference [OFC]) due to a pathophysiologic process in utero (Box 6.3).

                        <p>LGA is defined as birth weight greater than the 90th percentile for age. [6] The increased weight may result from fetal factors, which include genetic and chromosomal disorders, or from maternal factors, such as obesity or diabetes. Maternal hyperglycemia exposes the fetus to increased levels of glucose, which increases fetal insulin secretion. Increased insulin levels increase fat deposits in the fetus and often result in macrosomia, birth weight greater than 4000 g. [4] Diabetic mothers who are insulin dependent and in poor control during the early trimesters of pregnancy have characteristically large infants (Fig. 6.4). LGA infants are at risk for birth trauma, neonatal asphyxia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. [4]</p>
