                        <p>The normal development of the nervous system provides the vital motor, sensory, and cognitive functions that sustain human life and comprise human behavior. For the pediatric health care provider, surveillance and monitoring the development of the nervous system is one of the most important aspects of assessment in infants and children. The nervous system contains the most complex and delicate pathways in the body and is the center of all vital bodily functions. The challenge is to assess not only the progress of gross motor and fine motor skills in infants and children, but also to assess cognitive development and subtle deficits in attention and information processing that may impact learning behavior.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The formation of the nervous system begins very early during the third week of embryonic life. Cell differentiation when the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm split to begin forming tubes which support organ growth. The ectoderm forms skin, hair, nails, brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. [1] The notochord, which becomes the spinal column, develops during this period and forms the neural plate and neural folds. Closure of the neural plate is complete by the fourth week of embryonic development, and the neural tube is formed. Any fetal insults that occur during this period can result in defects in the brain and spinal cord, such as anencephaly or spina bifida defects, which occur in 1 of 1000 live births. During the fifth week of fetal development, the anterior portion of the neural tube enlarges to form the segments of the brain. Brain growth proceeds, with the most rapid brain growth occurring between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation.</p>
                        <p>By 24 weeks of gestation, the fetus has developed most of the nerve cells, or neurons, needed for the formation of the neural pathways. The germinal cell matrix is highly vascular and is prone to hemorrhage in the preterm infant.</p>
                        <p>The neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system, and each neuron contains numerous dendrites and one axon (Fig. 20.1). Dendrites are the protoplasmic branches of the cell body. Neural impulses enter the cell body through the dendrites and leave through the single axon. They then connect by a series of synapses with another dendrite of the next axon. At the synaptic junction, neurons also release specific neurotransmitters (such as GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine) that regulate brain and body functions. Myelin, a lipoid material surrounding cell fibers, covers the axons and allows for rapid and smooth transmission of nerve impulses. However, only a portion of the axons contain myelin at birth.</p>

                        <p>Brain growth is rapid after birth, with 50% of postnatal brain growth achieved by 1 year of age. By 2 to 3 years of age, the brain is 80% of adult size. [1] Head circumference increases sixfold in the first year of life and is the best indication of normal brain growth. Myelination, the deposit of the protective fatty substance around the axons, continues in the brain throughout the first 2 years of life, and in the preterm infant continues into the third year of life. Myelination proceeds from head to toe, cephalocaudal, beginning with the spinal cord and cranial nerves and then from midline to fingertips, proximodistal, following with the brainstem, corticospinal tracts, and sensory pathways. Preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants may develop from toe to head, which is associated with persistent hypertonia in the lower extremities. The control of motor functions in infancy and early childhood is closely associated with the normal myelination of the nerve fibers. [1] The development of intelligence in infants depends on the normal progression through two primary developmental domains-problem solving and language.</p>
                        <p>The rapid increase in myelination in the brain in the first 2 years of life is followed by a decrease in brain growth and maturation during early childhood. The growth of the gray matter in the brain continues throughout childhood into adolescence and early adulthood in a nonlinear pattern. [2] Lifestyle habits such as sleep and adequate nutrition, as well as genetic factors, affect the volume of gray matter and brain growth. [2]</p>

                        <h4>Cerebrum</h4>
                        <p>The outermost part of the brain is the cerebral cortex, which is often referred to as the gray matter because the neurons are unmyelinated and give a gray rather than a white appearance. The outer layer of the brain is composed of fissures and grooves, or sulci, and the ridge between grooves is the gyrus. The newborn infant has fewer convolutional surfaces, or sulci, in the cerebral cortex and more pliable skull bones, which decrease the incidence of bruising and tearing of the cerebral cortex in the developing infant with minor head trauma. The sulci of the brain deepen throughout childhood and continue to mature into young adulthood.</p>
                        <p>The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is covered by the cerebral cortex. The cerebrum is divided into two hemispheres, the left and right hemispheres. The right hemisphere controls the functions of the left side of the body, and the left hemisphere controls the functions of the right side of the body. Depending on hand preference, one hemisphere is considered dominant due to the location of important speech and language centers. For right-handed people, the left hemisphere is dominant, and for lefthanded people, the right hemisphere or both hemispheres may be dominant. The hemispheres are connected by a bridge of myelinated axons, the corpus callosum, which lies between the fissures of the left and right hemispheres. [1] The corpus callosum controls and integrates motor, sensory, language, and higher intellectual functions. The right and left hemispheres are divided into four lobes-frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital-with arbitrary borders. Each lobe controls particular bodily functions and behaviors (Fig. 20.2).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Frontal lobe:</strong> Considered the "personality center" of the brain and is responsible for higher cognitive functions. Initiates movement control of the flexor muscles of hands and feet. Broca area in the frontal lobe controls the ability to articulate speech. Prefrontal area controls thought processes for anticipation and prediction of behavior, and the frontal region is involved in complex learning movement patterns and writing. Damage to the frontal region causes expressive aphasia, motor weakness or personality changes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parietal lobe:</strong> Controls processing and interpretation of sensory input-visual, auditory, smell, taste, and touch sensations, including pain and temperature; perceives where a stimulus or pressure is and on which part of the body, and provides proprioception, the sense of the position of the limbs of the body. It has an important role in language processing and symbol interpretation. Damage to the parietal region results in sensory loss, spatial disorientation, or receptive language deficits like agnosia, an inability to recognize or perceive the meaningfulness of an object, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporal lobe:</strong> Primary center for the perception and interpretation of sounds and auditory association and perception, and memory recall; also involved in integration of taste, smell, and balance. Wernicke area in the temporal lobe is related to spoken words and language comprehension. The temporal lobe also has a role with mood and emotional control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Occipital lobe:</strong> Primary visual cortex in the brain and is the center for receiving and interpreting visual data and depth perception.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_30_ed289eb835021d8ece2cg-612-1.jpg" alt="A diagram of the human brain showing the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex: the frontal lobe (responsible for reasoning and motor skills), the parietal lobe (processing sensory information), the temporal lobe (hearing and memory), and the occipital lobe (vision)." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>FIGURE 20.2 Regions of the cerebral cortex.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The basal ganglia are a cluster of neurons deep in the subcortical layer that process connections between the cerebral motor cortex and the upper brainstem. The maturation of the basal ganglia occurs in early childhood with the development of fine motor skills and, in childhood, process movement functions such as arm swinging during walking and running and throwing a ball overhand. The basal ganglia also have a role with behavioral control and are associated with disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Dopamine plays an important role in basal ganglia function. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia results in abnormal postural movement patterns as in cerebral palsy (CP), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington chorea.</p>

                        <h4>Cerebellum</h4>
                        <p>The cerebellum is located in the posterior cranium and maintains the body's equilibrium and coordinates both voluntary and involuntary movements of the limbs, trunk, head, larynx, and eyes. [1] The motor cortex in the cerebrum relays signals to the cerebellum, which results in the precise muscle movements requiring a high level of fine motor dexterity. It is the portion of the brain that processes the sensory input from the musculoskeletal system, as well as from the visual, auditory, and touch receptors, and it transmits signals to the motor system to direct reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and balance.</p>
                        <p>The cerebellum also has some role with cognitive functions, emotional control and speech. Damage to the cerebellum can cause ataxia, loss of coordination of motor movement, inability to perform rapid alternating movements, and a wide-based gait. Abnormal development or dysfunction of the cerebellum in preterm infants can result in hypotonia, nystagmus, and language deficits.</p>

                        <h4>Brainstem and cranial nerves</h4>
                        <p>The brainstem is in the central core of the brain and includes the pons, medulla oblongata, and midbrain (Fig. 20.3). The brainstem contains the sensory and motor tracts that connect the brain and spinal cord and is the location for most of the twelve cranial nerves. The pons acts as the neural transmission center from all parts of the central cortex and supports ascending and descending nerve fibers. It controls basic bodily functions-breathing, eating, and motor functions. Cranial nerve V (trigeminal nerve), cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) and cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) arise from the pons. Dysfunction or damage of the peripheral pons is associated with a loss of outward or lateral motion of the eye muscles causing strabismus and may also cause a loss of sensory or motor function of the facial and mouth area. The medulla oblongata, which lies between the pons and the cerebellum, is a continuation of the spinal cord. The medulla oblongata processes impulses from the hypoglossal, vagal, spinal accessory, glossophyarngeal, and the vestibular and acoustic cranial nerves. It also aids in the life functions of respiration and circulation, and controls involuntary reflexes such as coughing, sneezing, and yawning. Dysfunction or damage of the medulla causes weakness in the shoulder muscles, affects tongue muscles and salivary function, decreases gastrointestinal motility, alters swallowing and speech functions, causes nerve deafness, and diminishes cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The midbrain controls the integration of basic bodily functions, and contains the neural fibers of cranial nerve III (oculomotor) and cranial nerve IV (trochlear) that come from the spinal cord and merge into the thalamus and hypothalamus. The midbrain also contains the reticular activating system which regulates wakefulness and arousability.</p>

                        <p>The diencephalon (Fig. 20.4) is the extension of the brainstem and lies embedded in the cerebral cortex. It contains the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the pineal gland-an endocrine gland that produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleepwake cycle. Parts of the third ventricle and the nuclei of the cranial nerve II (optic nerve) and retina arise from the diencephalon.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Thalamus:</strong> Acts as the brain's relay station and receives input from the sensory and motor systems of the body and dispatches input from the pons and cerebellum to the cerebral cortex.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Controls and regulates the body's internal environment-body temperature, metabolic processes, and involuntary response activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pituitary gland:</strong> Responsible for hormonal control of growth and reproductive function and assists in regulating thyroid gland function, lactation, and metabolism. The posterior pituitary produces vasopressin, which regulates the balance of water and sodium in the body.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The limbic system is the group of subcortical structures in the diencephalon including the hypothalamus and hippocampus. This system regulates emotion and motivation and organizes memories. Aggression and fear also are regulated by the limbic system. Disruption that occurs during the development of the limbic system causes distorted perceptions and aggressive behavior. Maternal substance abuse early in pregnancy can disrupt the migration of neuron activity in the cerebral cortex, and later prenatal exposure disrupts neuronal synapses. Infants exposed to illicit drug use in utero often have disturbances in memory, learning, attention span, and oppositional behavior disorders during childhood.</p>

                        <h4>Ventricular nervous system</h4>
                        <p>The brain and spinal cord are lubricated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which provides support and protection for the brain and allows for the removal of waste products. CSF is produced by specialized tissue called choroid plexus, which line the ventricles of the brain and spinal cord. It flows from the lateral ventricles to the third and fourth ventricles through a series of foramens. The fourth ventricle, which lies in the medulla, contains three openings that allow the cerebrospinal fluid to pass into the subarachnoid space. Approximately 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid is produced daily in adolescence and young adults and is continually being reabsorbed in the brain. [1] Any disruption in the circulation or absorption of CSF causes a build-up in the ventricles, resulting in hydrocephalus.</p>
                        <p>The brain is covered by protective layers that cushion and lubricate the outer surface (Fig. 20.5). The dura mater lies just beneath the skull bone and periosteum and consists of layers of fibrous connective tissue. Adjacent to the dura mater is the arachnoid, the avascular, weblike membrane that cushions the cortex. The dura mater is separated from the arachnoid by the subdural space. The pia mater is the highly vascular area of the cortex that attaches directly to the gray matter or irregular surface of the brain. The subarachnoid area and a cushion of cerebrospinal fluid separate the arachnoid from the pia mater.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Spinal nerves</h4>
                        <p>There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves that innervate the upper and lower torso, extremities, skin, and muscles -8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal (Fig. 20.6). [1] These spinal nerves form complex nerve networks called plexuses. There are four major plexuses in the peripheral nervous system-the cervical, brachial, lumbar, and sacral plexuses-and the body surface that is innervated by the plexus of a spinal nerve is called a dermatome. Although dermatomes map specific segments of the body surface, spinal nerve sensation can be transmitted to adjacent dermatomes (see Fig. 20.6). The sensory pathways of the spinal nerves carry sensations of touch, temperature, and pain; the motor fibers activate reflexes and impulses that control skeletal muscles and the involuntary muscles of the viscera. The spinal nerves function as part of the lower motor neurons and become dysfunctional in the presence of spinal cord lesions.</p>

                        <p>The spinal cord is an extension of the medulla oblongata and is composed of gray and white matter extending to the lumbar region. The gray matter runs laterally along the spinal cord and protects the myelinated and unmyelinated fibers of the white matter. Proprioceptors, the specialized nerve endings in muscles, tendons, and joints, are located in the white matter and are sensitive to changes in the tension of muscles and tendons. Temperature, pain, touch, and equilibrium are transmitted through the proprioceptors to the brainstem.</p>
