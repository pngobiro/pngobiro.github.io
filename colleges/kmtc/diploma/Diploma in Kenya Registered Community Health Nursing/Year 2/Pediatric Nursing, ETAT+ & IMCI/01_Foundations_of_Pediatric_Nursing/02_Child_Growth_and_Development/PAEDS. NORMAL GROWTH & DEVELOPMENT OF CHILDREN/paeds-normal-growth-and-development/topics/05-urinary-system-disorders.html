                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is sudden inflammation of glomeruli within the kidney which results in acute renal failure. Glomerulus gets damaged, hence referred as intrarenal acute renal failure. It may affect glomerular capillaries or membrane.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Incidence/ Etiology</h3>
                        <p>Rare in children <3yrs and peaks at 7 years. More common boys to girls 2:1. Infectious agent is usually in the body 2-3 weeks before clinical manifestation. It could be bacterial (streptococcus group A - commonest) e.g. acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, or viral.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Viral or bacterial agents invade the body. The immune system produces antibodies against them. The antibody/antigen reaction in the kidney glomeruli forms immune complexes and inflammation occurs. The end result is scarred/damaged glomeruli. Membrane permeability is altered by the immune response - protein leaks into urine. Glomerular filtration rate decreases. Sodium and water are retained and oedema occurs.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h3>
                        <p>Hematuria, dependent & periorbital edema, diminished urinary output, proteinuria, increased BP, fatigue, decreased filtration, increased serum Na+ level & increase K+ levels, BUN & creatinine increase, low grade fever and urine becomes blood-tinged, smoky or tea coloured.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Based on clinical manifestations above, physical examination, immunologic tests to detect streptozyme and Serum complement.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic management</h3>
                        <p>Depends on the degree of kidney damage. The aim is to treat the source of inflammation, maintain fluid & electrolytes and maintain BP within the normal range.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note"><h4 class="callout-title">Note</h4><p>Do a thorough physical examination to know the source of inflammation.</p></aside>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a child with normal BP & urine outputs, you can manage at home.</li>
                            <li>Those with oedema, increased BP, oliguria, hematuria are hospitalized because acute renal failure may occur.</li>
                            <li>If there is generalized oedema diuretics need to be used.</li>
                            <li>Increased BP use antihypertensives.</li>
                            <li>Dietary restrictions based on degree of BP & edema eg Na+, K+, fluids.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should be put on complete bed rest in a warm well ventilated room until his/her temperature subsides, the blood pressure falls and no blood or protein is visible in the urine.</li>
                            <li>Vitals should be monitored regularly. BP should be taken lying down and standing to exclude postural hypotension.</li>
                            <li>The nurse should maintain input and output chart and report any negative balance.</li>
                            <li>Restrict the patient's fluid intake to 500 mls in 24 hrs plus the amount of urine passed during that period. The aim is to lessen kidney activity.</li>
                            <li>Urine should be tested four hourly for protein and blood. 24 hour urine collection to estimate the amount of protein lost in the urine may be sent to the laboratory.</li>
                            <li>The nurse should weigh the patient daily as a means of determining whether the edema is decreasing.</li>
                            <li>The nurse should pay particular attention to the hygiene of the skin, mouth and pressure areas.</li>
                            <li>Antipyretics are administered for pyrexia.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics usually penicillin V OR benzylpenicillin are recommended for sore throat or any other respiratory diseases.</li>
                            <li>Occupational therapy and psychological care are also important.</li>
                            <li>Finally while providing care to the patient, you should be aware of the main complications that may present, which in this case are chronic nephritis and acute or chronic renal failure.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A clinical entity characterized by massive proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia leading to edema and hyperlipidemia.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Idiopathic (primary)</strong> - due to glomerular disease of the kidney. The most common type.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary</strong> - renal malfunctioning due to systematic disease, drugs or toxins e.g. hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosis, lead poisoning, child cancer therapies - put stress on the renal system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology</h3>
                        <p>More common in males than females ie 2:1. It commonly affects those aged between 2-6 yrs. The idiopathic type is thought to be an immune response while the other is caused by infections, drugs and toxins as discussed above.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The inflammation process from an immune response or disease makes glomeruli to become permeable to proteins (proteinuria). Fluid shifts from intravascular to interstitial space which subsequently leads to edema/ascites, hypovolemia.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h3>
                        <p>Just as a child with renal failure, it will cause edema, anorexia, abdominal pain & tenderness due to inflammation of kidney, abdominal swelling and fatigue.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Dependent upon proteinuria. Urinalysis shows protein, red blood cells; serum albumin, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, hematocrit, platelet count.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic management</h3>
                        <p>The aim of management is to reduce protein loss, oedema and prevent infection.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids e.g. prednisolone which decrease inflammation and loss of proteins hence restoring oncotic pressure and promoting diuresis. The period of treatment is usually 4-8 weeks.</li>
                            <li>Relapse is a possibility. Immunosuppressants e.g. cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and cyclosporine are used. A weekly WBC is also necessary if a patient is on immunosuppressants.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotic may be required in case of infection due to excessive use of steroids.</li>
                            <li>Diuretics like frusemide can be used but because they can cause a decrease in Na+, K+ & hypovolemia, monitoring electrolytes closely is important. Or potassium sparing diuretic can be administered.</li>
                            <li>Decrease salt intake because of edema & increased blood pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing considerations</h3>
                        <p>Maintain fluid & electrolytes, administer medication and prevent infection and skin breakdown.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Acute Renal failure (ARF)</h3>
                        <p>Sudden onset of impaired renal function. Most children with ARF regain function. ARF is classified according to the part of the renal system affected, thus we have; pre-renal, intra-renal and post-renal failure.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology /Incidence</h4>
                        <p>ARF is uncommon but can be life threatening.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pre-renal</strong> - sudden decrease in renal blood flow or perfusion to kidney. Common causes include; dehydration, hypovolemia, shock, sepsis, renal artery obstruction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intra-renal</strong> is due to damage of kidney tissues. That is damage to the glomeruli or the kidney tubules. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common type of intrinsic ARF. Characteristics of ATN are intratubular obstruction, tubular back leak (abnormal reabsorption of filtrate and decrease urine flow through the tubule), vasoconstriction, and changes in the glomerular permeability. These processes result in decrease of GFR, progressive azotemia and fluid and electrolyte imbalance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Post-renal</strong> is due to obstruction of urine at some point between the kidney & urinary meatus. It's an outflow obstruction that causes "back-up" of urine and puts pressure on the endothelial lining & ultimately diminishing renal function.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pre-Renal Failure Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Volume depletion resulting from: hemorrhage, renal losses(diuretics, osmotic diuresis), gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhoea).</li>
                            <li>Impaired cardiac efficiency resulting from: myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock.</li>
                            <li>Vasodilation resulting from: sepsis, anaphylaxis, antihypertensive medications.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intrarenal Failure Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Myoglobinuria (trauma, crush injuries, burns).</li>
                            <li>Nephrotoxic agents such as aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin).</li>
                            <li>Infectious processes like acute pyelonephritis and acute glomerulonephritis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Post-Renal Failure Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urinary tract obstruction, calculi(kidney stones), benign prostatic hyperplasia, strictures, blood clots.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h4>
                        <p>Electro & fluid imbalance, metabolic acidosis, dehydration, Pallor, lethargy, anorexia, vomiting and seizures.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Through history, laboratory evaluation and physical examination.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urine output varies from scanty to a normal volume, hematuria may be present and the urine has a low specific gravity (compared to with the normal value of 1.010 to 1.025). One of the earliest manifestations of tubular damage is the inability to concentrate urine.</li>
                            <li>Patients with pre-renal azotemia have decreased amount of sodium in the urine (less than 20 mEq/L.)</li>
                            <li>Patients with intrarenal azotemia usually have urinary sodium levels greater than 40 mEq/l with urinary casts and other cellular debris.</li>
                            <li>The BUN level increases steadily at a rate dependent on the degree of catabolism (breakdown of protein), renal perfusion, and protein intake.</li>
                            <li>With decline in the GFR, oliguria and anuria, patients are at high risk for hyperkalemia. Protein catabolism results in the release of cellular potassium into the body fluids, causing severe hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can result in dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention of acute renal failure</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide adequate hydration to patients at risk for dehydration.</li>
                            <li>Prevent and treat shock promptly with blood and fluid replacement.</li>
                            <li>Monitor central venous arterial pressures and hourly urine output in critically ill patients.</li>
                            <li>Treat hypotension promptly.</li>
                            <li>Prevent and treat infections promptly; infections can cause renal failure.</li>
                            <li>Pay particular attention to wounds, burns and other precursors of sepsis.</li>
                            <li>To prevent infections from ascending in the urinary tract, give meticulous care to patients with indwelling catheters.</li>
                            <li>To prevent toxic drug effects, closely monitor dosage, duration of use, and blood levels of all medications metabolized or excreted by the kidneys.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic management</h4>
                        <p>The aim is to restore renal perfusion and correct electrolyte and fluid imbalance. Management modalities include: fluid & Na+ restriction if increased, dialysis if there is congestive heart failure or severe increase in blood pressure. Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia need to be corrected.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nutritional therapy</h4>
                        <p>ARF causes severe nutritional imbalances (because nausea and vomiting contribute to inadequate dietary intake), impaired glucose use and protein synthesis, and increased tissue catabolism. The patient is weighed daily and loses 0.2 to 0.5 kg daily if the nitrogen balance is negative (that is; caloric intake falls below caloric requirement). If the patient gains weight, fluid retention should be suspected. Use of high carbohydrate diet which will spare protein breakdown.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Monitoring fluid and electrolyte balance. Hyperkalemia is the most life threatening electrolyte imbalance in renal failure. The nurse should check for jugular vein distension, alterations in heart sounds and increased difficulty in breathing.</li>
                            <li>Reducing metabolic rate by giving complete bed rest.</li>
                            <li>Promoting pulmonary function - the patient is assisted to turn, cough and take deep breaths frequently to prevent atelectasis and respiratory infections.</li>
                            <li>Preventing infections - asepsis is essential with invasive lines and catheters to minimize the risk of infections and increased metabolism. Avoid Foley catheterization.</li>
                            <li>Providing skin care - the skin may be dry or susceptible to breakdown as a result of edema; therefore meticulous skin care is important.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chronic Renal failure (CRF)</h3>
                        <p>Progressive disease. Irreversible damage has taken place for 50% of renal function & the condition has lasted for at least several months. If considered permanent/ irreversible - end stage renal failure (ESRF) is diagnosed. Chronic renal failure first progresses to uremia (where toxic nitrogenous waste products, blood urea, creatinine build up in system) and if not reversed the patient will go to ESRF.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>
                        <p>It is associated with prematurity, nephrotoxic medications e.g. aminoglycosides, renal obstructions, glomerulonephritis, and pyelonephritis. Immunological dysfunction may also cause injury to the renal system. Pathophysiology is variable and depends on the cause.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical manifestation</h4>
                        <ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This infection occurs in infancy affecting both girls and boys equally. In the first years of life, however, more girls than boys are infected because the former tend to have a shorter urethra. Children tend to suffer more from lower urinary infections, that is, infections of the urethra and bladder. The micro-organisms commonly responsible for urinary tract infection are Escherichia coli (E. coli). They ascend from the vulva and urethra to the bladder. Occasionally, as the problem develops, the ureters and renal pelvis are involved resulting in pyelonephritis.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology</h3>
                        <p>There are many predisposing factors, but only a few are directly responsible for childhood urinary tract infections. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Congenital abnormalities of the renal tract, especially those that interfere with the flow of urine, for example, hypospadias and epispadias.</li>
                            <li>Meningomyelocele and paralysis of the urinary bladder, especially those associated with spinal injuries (paraplegia) are also common causes.</li>
                            <li>Unrecognized phimosis</li>
                            <li>Local infections due to injuries caused by children playing or inserting foreign bodies into their own genitalia may also be causal factors. LOL!!!!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common causative micro-organism but others may also be responsible. The infection begins in the lower portion of the urinary tract, causing inflammatory changes and involving the sphincter valve at the base of the bladder. This makes the valve incompetent and results in urinary reflux to the ureters. The reflux allows upper urinary tract infections to occur, causing a gradual dilatation of the renal pelvis. Recurrent bladder infections cause tissue irritation, which makes the patient have a desire to frequently micturate.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestation</h3>
                        <p>The patient with a urinary tract infection will present with some of the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There will be burning painful micturition (dysuria)</li>
                            <li>Lower abdominal pain and desire to pass urine more frequently</li>
                            <li>The patient is pyrexial and irritable</li>
                            <li>An unexplained persistent fever</li>
                            <li>Diarrhoea and/or vomiting</li>
                            <li>The child is usually restless and unable to sleep at night. They may cry frequently</li>
                            <li>Urine passed may have foul smell and be bloodstained</li>
                            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic procedures</h3>
                        <p>Commence by taking a concise personal history from the parents, guardians or older siblings. Carry out a physical examination and order a laboratory urinalysis for microscopy culture and sensitivity, blood and albumen.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Medical Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The following medication may be prescribed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Septrin (co-trimoxazole) syrup</strong> Dosage: Six weeks to five months - 120 mg BD x 14 days. Six months to five years - 240 mg BD x 14 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sulphadimidine mixture/tablets</strong> Dosage: 100 mg/kg per day six hourly x 14 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nitrofurantoin (furadantin)</strong> Dosage: 3-5 mg/kg tds up to 400 mg per day x 7 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other antibiotics</strong> Amoxycillin 50 mg/kg per day (in divided dose given qid). Ampicillin 50 mg/kg per day (in divided dose given qid). Ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and doxycycline.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unless the child looks very ill with high temperature, they should be managed at home as an outpatient.</li>
                            <li>If in hospital, the child should be nursed on bed rest until they are apyrexial. Temperature, pulse and respiration are taken and recorded four hourly.</li>
                            <li>You should report any abnormalities to the doctor as soon as possible. The child should be given plenty of oral fluids to flush the urinary system.</li>
                            <li>General skin hygiene, especially in the genital area should be emphasized.</li>
                            <li>A high protein diet should be encouraged. Oral toilet on a four hourly basis is also maintained.</li>
                            <li>In case there are indications of chronic urinary tract infections, an x-ray investigation of the renal system must be performed.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These conditions are similar in clinical manifestations and treatment. Inguinal hernia is a scrotal or inguinal swelling or both that include abdominal contents.</p>
                        <p>The incidence is 10-20: 1000 live births. Common in boys than girls 4:1. Incidence increases with prematurity & low birth weight. Those receiving peritoneal dialysis due to increased abdominal pressure are also at higher risk. Infantile Inguinal hernia is diagnosed in the first month of life. Hydrocele occurs in 6% of full term boys.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inguinal hernia occurs in the lower abdomen; a sac of peritoneum, containing fat or part of the bowel, bulges through the weak part (inguinal canal) of the abdominal wall.</li>
                            <li>Inguinal hernia occurs when abdominal contents exit the peritoneal cavity & protrude into the processus vaginalis (a fold of peritoneum that precedes the testicle as it descends through the inguinal canal into the scrotum).</li>
                            <li>An incomplete processus vaginalis at birth allows peritoneal fluid/ abdominal contents to enter the scrotum which results in a hydrocele/ hernia. Processus vaginalis follows the same descending pathway of the testes into the scrotum.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Common clinical manifestation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Inguinal hernia</strong> - cause bulge/swelling in scrotum/ groin - size increases with increased abdominal pressure.</li>
                            <li>Pain if strangulated - possible necrosis & perforation - irritability, vomiting, abdominal distension, tachycardia.</li>
                            <li><strong>If hydrocele is present</strong>: Scrotal swelling is painless & doesn't change in size/ shape when abdominal pressure increases with or by cough, cry. It is not reducible & easily transilluminated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The diagnosis is made through physical examination of the scrotum. Differentiated by: hernia is boggy, reduced by pressure & reducible (usually) while hydrocele is fluid filled, feels tense and is not reducible.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic management</h3>
                        <p>For inguinal hernia, a herniorrhaphy is done on an outpatient basis. For a hydrocele, it resolves spontaneously within 1 year of age. If not, it means a hernia is present & repair is done via hydrocelectomy.</p>
