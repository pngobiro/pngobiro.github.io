\section*{Learning objectives}

By the end of this lecture, the student will be able to:
- Define growth and development.
- Outline the principles of growth and development.
- Identify the importance of growth and development.
- Describe factors affecting growth and development.
- List types of growth and development.
- Identify the stages of development.

\section*{Introduction}
- Growth and development begins at conception and ends at maturation
- Growth; Increase in size and weight of the whole body or any of its parts due to increase in number and size of cells.
- It is simply a quantitative change in the child's body.
- Development; increase in complexity and capacity to function optimally in the society
- It is a qualitative change in the child's functioning
- Maturation; Increase in child's competence and adaptability
- It is the qualitative change in the child's overall growth and development

\section*{Differences between growth and development}

\section*{Growth}

Term used purely in physical sense, it generally refers to increase in size, length i.e. changes in the quantitative aspects.

Does not continue throughout life. It stops when maturity has been attained.

The changes produced by growth are the subject of measurement. They mav he

\section*{Development}

Implies overall change in shape, form or structure resulting in improved working or functioning, changes in the quality or character rather than the quantitative

It continues throughout life and is progressive.

Implies improvement in functioning and behavior and hence brings aualitative

\section*{Stages of growth and development}
- Pre- natal; conception- birth
- Germinal: conception - 2 weeks
- Embryonic: 2-8 weeks
- Fetal: 8-40 weeks
- Infancy
- Neonate: 0-28 days
- Infancy: 1 month-1 year
- Early childhood
- Toddler:1-3 years
- Pre-school: 3-6 years
- Middle childhood
- School age: 6-12 years
- Late childhood
- Adolescence
- 12 - app. 18 years.

\section*{Principles of growth and development}
- Continuous, occurs in a sequential process; predictable and follows a universal timetable
- Directional; skill development proceeds along different pathways;
- Cephalocaudal(head to toe)
- Proximal distal (inwardoutward)
- General to specific
- Simple to complex

- Wide individual difference in growth and development

\section*{Principles cont...}
- Hierarchical integration; Skills develop separately and independently thereafter, are integrated into more complex skills
- Growth and development is not uniform throughout life; there are periods of accelerated and decelerated growth (growth spurts).
- New skills pre-dominate; strong drive to practice and perfect new abilities, especially early in life.
- Rates and patterns of growth are specific to certain parts of the body; different body tissues and systems $m-+1 \ldots n$ diffnum+l,
Growth Patterns of Various
Systems

- Development is interrelated; physiological, psychosocial, cognitive and moral aspects of development are affected by one another
- Each stage of G\&D is affected by the preceding types of development

\section*{Importance of understanding growth and development to the nurses}
- Help the nurse provide screening for physical and emotional

problems.
- Gaining better understanding of the reasons behind illnesses.
- Helping in formulating the plan of care.
- Develop a rapport with the child to enhance the provision of health care;
- Anticipatory guidance and teaching to parents in order to achieve optimal growth \& development at each stage
- Provide education to the family to build a healthy lifestyle for the future.

\section*{Factors affecting growth and development:}
- Hereditary
- Environmental factors

Pre-natal environment
1. Factors related to mother during pregnancy:
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Obstetric disorders of pregnancy; Chronic medical conditions
- Exposure to radiation
- Torch infections
- Drug and substance use
2. Factors related to the fetus
- Mal-position in uterus
- Faulty placental implantation
- Multiple pregnancy

Post-Natal Environment External environment:
- socio-economic status of the family
- child's nutrition
- climate and season
- child's ordinal position in the family
- Number of siblings in the family
- Family structure (single parent or extended family ... )
- Cultural factors

Child's internal environment
- Child's health status
- Child's intelligence
- Hormonal influences
- Emotional factors

\section*{Types of growth and development}
- Types of growth:
- Physical growth (Ht, Wt, head \& chest circumference)
- Physiological growth (vital signs ...)
- Types of development:
- Motor development
- Cognitive development
- Emotional development
- Social development

\section*{Development assessment}
- Developmental assessment is an integral part of the pediatric examination and assessment
- Mainly done by assessing milestones; children accomplish maturation of different biological functions at anticipated age, with margin of a few months on either side
- Requires practice and skill.
- Systematic in approach to ensure all areas of development are covered
- Developmental assessment is divided into four major areas:
- Gross motor; control of child over his body
- Fine motor; coordination of eyes, hand-eye coordination, hand mouth coordination and skills for manipulation with hands
- speech and language,
- Social.

Delay in all four indicates intellectual disability, isolated delay in any one area is often not abnormal.

\section*{Finding your way around . . .}

\section*{Newborn growth \& development}

\section*{Physical growth}
- Birth weight; $2.700-4 \mathrm{~kg}$
- $1^{\text {st }}$ week of life: baby looses 5-7\% of birth weight which should be regained by $10^{\text {th }}$ day of birth. Weight loss is due to;
- Withdrawal of hormones from mother.
- Loss of excessive extra cellular fluid.
- Passage of meconium (feces) and urine.
- Limited food intake
- From $10{ }^{\text {th }}$ day- 1 month
- Growth rate for males- $40 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Growth rate for females- $35 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Gain $3 / 4 \mathrm{~kg}$ by the end of the $1^{\text {st }}$ month

\section*{Physical growth cont...}

\section*{Height}
- Boys average $\mathrm{Ht}=50 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Girls average $\mathrm{Ht}=49 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Normal range for both (47.5-53.75 cm)

\section*{Head circumference}
- $33-35 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Head is $1 / 4$ total body length
- Skull has 2 fontanels (anterior \& posterior)

\section*{Chest circumference}
- It is 30.5 to 33 cm (usually $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ less than head circumference).

\section*{Motor development}
- Gross motor development
- The newborn's movement are random, diffuse and uncoordinated. Reflexes carry out bodily functions and responses to external stimuli.
- Eyes follow bright moving objects.
- Lies awake on back.
- Responds to sounds of bell and other similar noises
- Fine motor development
- Holds hand in fist
- Immediately drops objects placed in hands.
- When crying, he draws arms and legs to body
- Reflexes
- Swallowing
- Gagging
- Sucking
- Grasp
- Rooting
- Step reflex

\section*{Cognitive development}
- Refers to the development of thinking, gaining and using knowledge.
- Reflexive
- Learning occurs through imitation and habituationability to decrease response to disturbing stimuli.
- Newborns at age 12 can be able to imitate facial and manual gestures of adults
- The newborn infant responds to sounds with either cry or eye movement, cessation of activity and / or startle reaction
- Sensitive to touch and handling; It is the most highly developed sense. It is mostly at lips, tongue, ears, and forehead.
- Responses are generally limited to tension states or discomfort.
- Gains satisfaction from feeding and being held, rocked, fondled, and cuddled.
- Taste; well developed as bitter and sour fluids are resisted while sweet fluids are accepted.
- Smell; only evidence in newborn infant's search for the nipple, as he smell breast milk.

\section*{Social Development}
- Intently regards face of mother
- Respond to auditory stimulus by turning head and looking at the source of the stimuli.

\section*{Infancy}
- It is the period which starts at the end of the first month up to the end of the first year of age.
- Infant's growth and development during this period is rapid
