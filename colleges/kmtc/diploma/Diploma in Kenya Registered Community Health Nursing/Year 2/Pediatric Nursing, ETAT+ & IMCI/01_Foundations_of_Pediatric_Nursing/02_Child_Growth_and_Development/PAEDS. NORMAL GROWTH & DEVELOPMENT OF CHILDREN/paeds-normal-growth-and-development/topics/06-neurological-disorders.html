                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Ventricles and CSF Flow</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The lateral ventricles</h4>
                        <p>They lie within the cerebral hemispheres, one on each side of the median plane just below the corpus callosum. They are separated from each other by a thin membrane, the septum lucidum, and are lined with ciliated epithelium. They communicate with the third ventricle by the interventricular foramen.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The third ventricle</h4>
                        <p>The third ventricle is a cavity situated below the lateral ventricles between the two parts of the thalamus. It communicates with the fourth ventricle by a canal, the cerebral aqueduct.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fourth ventricle</h4>
                        <p>The fourth ventricle is a diamond-shaped cavity situated below and behind the third ventricle, between the cerebellum and pons. It is continuous below with the central canal of the spinal cord and communicates with the subarachnoid space by foramina in its roof. Cerebrospinal fluid enters the subarachnoid space through these openings and through the open distal end of the central canal of the spinal cord.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)</h4>
                        <p>CSF is secreted into each ventricle of the brain by the choroid plexus. These are vascular areas where there is a proliferation of blood vessels surrounded by ependymal cells in the lining of ventricle walls. CSF passes back into the blood through tiny diverticula of arachnoid mater, called arachnoid villi (arachnoid granulations) which project into the venous sinuses.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hydrocephalus Explained</h3>
                        <p>In hydrocephalus, the volume of CSF is abnormally high and is usually accompanied by increased ICP. An obstruction to the CSF is the most common cause. It's described as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Communicating:</strong> when there is free flow of CSF from the ventricular system to the subarachnoid space. Interference is with the absorption of the cerebro-spinal fluid in the arachnoid villi. In this type, the obstruction is outside the ventricular system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-communicating:</strong> when there is not free flow; i.e., there is an obstruction in the system of ventricles, foramina or duct.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Congenital defect-developmental, for example, Arnold Chiari malformation and aqueduct stenosis.</li>
                            <li>Acquired defects, for example, cerebral abscess, compression of the aqueduct by either aneurysm or hematoma, brain tumor of either cerebellar haematoma, brain stem haematoma and/or colloid cyst.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A physical exam should be undertaken to ascertain the extent and seriousness of the condition, taking into account the infant's age and period of the onset.</li>
                            <li>The head circumference (occipital-frontal circumference) should be regularly measured.</li>
                            <li>Medical treatment with acetazolamide should be commenced to reduce production of CSF in mild cases of hydrocephalus.</li>
                            <li>Repeated lumbar puncture should be performed to maintain normal cerebral spinal fluid pressure.</li>
                            <li>Surgical intervention may be undertaken, depending on the severity of the condition. This consists of the removal of obstruction such as tumours, cysts and haemorrhage (hematoma).</li>
                            <li>When progression of hydrocephalus is established, surgical intervention should be considered. This consists in shunting the cerebral fluid past the obstruction. The best results are currently obtained by a ventriculo-atrial or ventriculo-peritoneal shunt with a pump and one-way valve.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Complications</h4>
                            <p>Complications of the shunt would include blocking of the tubes and infection, and will require removal of the foreign body as well as administration of antibiotics. Another procedure that may be performed is a ventriculostomy, which involves the destruction of the third and fourth ventricle or the choroid plexus.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse monitors the signs of increased intracranial pressure and reports to the surgeon any changes.</li>
                            <li>Nurse should continuously monitor the head circumference.</li>
                            <li>The nurse should palpate the fontanelles gently for possible separation of sutures and tension.</li>
                            <li>Vital signs should be taken and recorded (TPR/BP). Any deviation should be reported immediately.</li>
                            <li>The child's behavioural changes, including persistent cries should be recorded and reported.</li>
                            <li>Regularly change the child's position in bed to prevent bedsores (every 2 hours). The head should be supported when being moved.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The pre-op care should continue after surgery, in addition to routine postoperative care.</li>
                            <li>Immediately after surgery, vital signs should be monitored and recorded in one-hour intervals, paying particular attention to increasing intracranial pressure (blood pressure/ pulse rate, temperature and respiration rate carefully noted). Other neurological observations, for example, the assessment of the level of consciousness should also be continued.</li>
                            <li>The dressing on the operation site should be checked regularly.</li>
                            <li>You should always ensure that the child lies on the good side to prevent pressure on the shunt valve. Alternatively, he or she should lie flat on his or her back. Careful regular feeds should be given. Parental education should be continued from admission to discharge.</li>

                        <p>This is a congenital abnormality, which results from a defect in the formation of the skeletal arch enclosing the spinal cord. Although it may occur in any part of the spinal column and on the skull, it is more common in the lumbar region.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology</h3>
                        <p>The causes are not known, although the condition is associated with dietary deficiency of folic acid at the time of conception. This neural tube defect may be of genetic origin or due to environmental factors; e.g, irradiation, or maternal infection (rubella) at a critical stage in development of fetal vertebrae and spinal cord. The effects depend on the extent of the abnormality.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Spina bifida is a common developmental defect of the central nervous system occurring in 1-2 of every 1000 newborn infants. The posterior portion of the lamina of one or more vertebrae fails to fuse with or without defective development of the spinal cord, and tends to occur mostly in the lumbar or lumbo-sacral region.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Spina bifida occulta</h4>
                        <p>In the milder type (spina bifida occulta), there may be no need for any medical intervention while in the meningocele and meningomyelocele surgical intervention is called for.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Meningocele</h4>
                        <p>The skin over the defect is very thin and may rupture after birth. There is dilation of the subarachnoid space posteriorly. The spinal cord is correctly positioned.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Meningomyelocele</h4>
                        <p>The meninges and spinal cord are grossly abnormal. The skin may be absent or rupture. In either case there is leakage of CSF, and the meninges may become infected. Serious nerve defects result in paraplegia and lack of sphincter control causing incontinence of urine and faeces. There may also be mental impairment.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnostic Tests</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein):</strong> A simple blood test that measures how much AFP has passed into the mother's bloodstream from the unborn baby. A high level of AFP might mean that the baby has spina bifida. An AFP test might be part of a test called the 'triple screen' that looks for neural tube defects and other issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ultrasound</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Amniocentesis:</strong> a sample of amniotic fluid. High levels of AFP might mean that the baby has spina bifida.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>Since meningomyelocele occurs more commonly than the other two forms, and is more severe in its clinical presentation, surgery is indicated and should be performed at the earliest opportunity to prevent possible neurological damage.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pre/Post-op Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The objectives of care should be to prevent infection and injury to the sac, skin damage and urinary tract infection, which is likely to occur. These are achieved by performing aseptic technique dressing using warm normal saline until the operation is performed. The dressing should be changed at least four hourly.</li>
                            <li>You should continue with your assessment of the child's general condition, paying particular attention to the musculo-skeletal functions, which may occur due to exposure of the nerve fibres. The vital signs should be taken and recorded every two to four hours and any deviation from norms reported to the surgeon.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Maternal health:</strong> German measles, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus, herpes, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, exposure to toxins, zika virus infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fetal illness:</strong> breech births, complicated labor and delivery, low birth weight, multiple babies. Premature birth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contractures</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> swallowing or feeding problems can make it difficult for someone who has cerebral palsy, particularly an infant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental health problems:</strong> people with cerebral palsy may have mental health conditions, such as depression and isolation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lung disease.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> pressure on joints or abnormal alignment of joints from muscle spasticity may lead to early onset of painful degenerative bone disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Osteopenia:</strong> fractures due to low bone density can stem from several common factors such as lack of mobility, nutritional shortcomings and anti-epileptic drug use.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical examination</li>
                            <li>Brain scans like; <strong>MRI</strong> - an MRI uses radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed 3-D or cross-sectional images of child's brain.</li>
                            <li>Cranial ultrasound</li>
                            <li>Electroencephalogram</li>
                            <li>Lab tests to screen for genetic or metabolic problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapies</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> for muscle training and exercise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Occupational therapy:</strong> using alternative strategies and adaptive equipment, occupational therapies work to promote child's independence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speech and language therapy</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Recreational therapy.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgery</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Severing nerves:</strong> that supplies the spastic nerves a procedure called selective dorsal rhizotomy. This relaxes the muscle and reduces pain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orthopaedic surgery:</strong> children with severe contractures or deformities may need surgery on bones or joints to place arms, hips or legs in the correct order.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Medications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When spasticity is isolated to one muscle group, <strong>onabotulinumtoxinA injections</strong> (made from a bacteria that causes botulism; the botulism toxin blocks nerve activity in the muscles, causing temporary reduction in muscle activity) is given directly into the muscle, nerve or both.</li>
                            <li>For generalized spasticity - if the whole body is affected, oral muscle relaxants may relax stiff, contracted muscles. These drugs include; diazepam, dantrolene and baclofen.</li>
