                        <p>Health care workers especially doctors, nurses and social workers must be on the lookout at all times during their clinical practice for signs of child abuse or neglect. Although these problems are known to exist in the world, incidence has increased in terms of numbers and frequency.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, societies have become more open and it is now easier to expose cases of child abuse than ever before. The media have been increasingly vocal in pointing out incidents of child abuse. The health care worker must be constantly vigilant to be able to detect, investigate and report to the rightful authorities so that remedial activities can be taken before further injuries are inflicted to the helpless children. It may be argued by some that certain activities affecting children are merely cultural practices carried out in some African traditional societies to maintain their way of life. The problem is that the children's consent has never been sought.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is the most common form of child abuse, which is easily recognised by health care workers and lay persons alike. The child displays non-accidental injuries on their body. The majority of victims in this group are infants or preschool children.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>About 60-70% are below three years old in Europe and America, while in Africa the age goes up to five years.</li>
                            <li>The child's behaviour is abnormal, demanding too much attention, behaving aggressively or withdrawn.</li>
                            <li>The child may have a chronic illness or be physically disabled.</li>
                            <li>Some of these children may belong to single mothers who had unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and are unable to cope with the strains of motherhood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Various types of injuries may be observed. These include burns, cigarette burns, cuts, bruises, lacerations, fractures and bites. Some of these injuries may be in the healing stage while others may be fresh. This is an indication of repeatedly inflicted injuries. Injuries are predominantly seen in the genital areas, buttocks, back, limbs, face. Ruptured internal abdominal organs and fractured skull may also be identified.</p>
                        <p>Physical abusers may include individuals suffering from stress, alcoholics, mentally ill individuals, those who were themselves battered in childhood or drug addicts.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Once child abuse is detected or suspected, the child should be removed to a safer environment and involve the health care worker and children's departments.</li>
                            <li>The child needs to be hospitalised in order to undergo a thorough physical and mental assessment to detect other previous injuries that may have been sustained.</li>
                            <li>This detection is necessary in case of legal action being taken against the person who inflicted the injuries on the child.</li>
                            <li>When a child is admitted to hospital, an x-ray, physical examination, medical or surgical treatment should be carried out as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>The parents or guardians will require counselling especially if they are the ones causing injury to the child.</li>
                            <li>The child's nutritional status should be improved before being transferred to a children's home or a foster home.</li>
                            <li>These transfers are usually undertaken with the approval of the court of law, the Children's Department and Probation Office.</li>
                            <li>It is recommended that the offenders or abusers undergo corrective measures instead of a punitive corrective approach. Many, if not all, are referred to psychiatrists for assessment and assistance.</li>

                        <p>In African societies, this problem was unheard of until a few decades ago. This problem has been brought about by social changes, which have led to the gradual erosion of extended family ties. Children who are abandoned are usually malnourished and may have other diseases as a result of low resistance to infection.</p>
                        <p>A great number of factors have contributed to this social problem in developing countries.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Often both parents are economically unable to meet their basic needs due to poverty.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, some children are brought up by single parents, who may not be able to earn enough to support their family.</li>
                            <li>Perhaps the problem originates from the death of a spouse or a divorce, which leaves the remaining partner unable to provide for the family.</li>
                            <li>The children of physically and mentally handicapped mothers may be abandoned if they are unable to cope with the demands of motherhood.</li>
                            <li>In certain conditions, a child may be separated from the mother for a prolonged period as a result of imprisonment.</li>
                            <li>Similar problems may also be noted when a mother is an alcoholic.</li>

                        <p>A child needs love, accommodation and food.

                        <p>Child sexual abuse is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent abuses a child for sexual stimulation. Sexual abuse refers to the participation of a child in a sexual act aimed towards the physical gratification or financial profit of the person committing the act.</p>
                        <p>Forms of child sexual abuse include asking or pressuring a child to engage in sexual activities (regardless of the outcome), indecent exposure of the genitals to a child, displaying pornography to a child, actual sexual contact with a child, physical contact with a child's genitals, viewing of the child's genitalia without physical contact, or using a child to produce pornography.</p>

                            <li>Less than 10 percent of substantiated child abuse cases have physical findings on examination; therefore, the history is the most important part of the sexual abuse evaluation.</li>
                            <li>Documentation should include the child's exact words.</li>
                            <li>An examination should be done promptly if a child with suspected maltreatment complains of dysuria, anal and vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge or pain on defecation.</li>
                            <li>A thorough physical examination should be performed at the time of the initial interview if the reported incident occurred less than 72 hours.</li>
                            <li>Examination should be done by health care professionals familiar with forensic examinations (experienced primary care physicians, emergency department personnel, or sexual assault nurse examiners).</li>
                            <li>Examination under anaesthesia should be considered for acutely assaulted prepubertal girls with persistent vaginal and rectal bleeding or severe abdominal pain.</li>

                        <p>Emotional abuse may be the most difficult form of abuse to recognize in clinical practice. It develops as a result of repeated damaging interactions. The office on child abuse and neglect defines emotional abuse as abuse that results in demonstrable harm (e.g., impaired psychological growth and development) of a child.</p>
                        <p>Several sub-types of emotional abuse include; rejection, isolation, terrorism, ignorance, psychological unavailability, corruption and inappropriate expectations of or demands on the child. Patterns of behaviour that should raise concern about the possibility of emotional abuse include social withdrawal, excessive anger and aggression, eating disorders, failure to thrive, developmental delay and emotional disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety, fearfulness, history of running away from home).</p>
