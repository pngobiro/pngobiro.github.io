                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is where one segment of bowel telescopes/ invaginates into the lumen of an adjacent segment of intestines. It is the most frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in infants/ young children. It peaks between the 3rd - 9th month and is twice as common in boys as girls.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>
                        <p>Usually not identifiable. Sometimes a polyp or foreign body is the cause.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>The telescoping process is known as intussusception. The leading proximal segment (intussuscepted) almost always telescopes into the distal segment (intussuscipens). There may be a leading edge in the form of a polyp, inverted appendiceal stump or tumour.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_08_30_8c312395afba70235ef0g-08-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of Intussusception in the intestines" class="content-image">

                        <p>Bowel telescoping/ invagination causes walls of bowel to press on one another compromising blood flow. Involved intestines get inflamed, edematous and bleeding occurs and appear in stool. Later complete bowel obstruction occurs with subsequent abdominal distension and vomiting. If not treatment is instituted necrosis and perforation occurs.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h4>
                        <p>Four classical manifestations include: colic, intermittent abdominal pain (sudden), vomiting - early and red currant jelly- like stools. But these are present only in 50% of those with disease. Others present with a sausage-shaped mass felt in the right upper Quadrant. Later other symptoms set in: lethargic, weak, thready pulse, shallow respirations and increase body temperature.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>A barium enema (a barium solution that shows on x-ray is given as an enema) will show the tip of the obstructed intussusception; abdominal ultra sound and X-ray non specific but more show intra peritoneal air (perforation).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic Management</h4>
                        <p>Non - surgical hydrostatic reduction using barium, a water soluble contrast agent or air enema (air insufflations blowing air into a cavity). Air & H2O use is safer than barium because of bowel perforation risk. Air is 90% successful while water or barium is 65-85% successful. If there is perforation, peritonitis, shock occurs or if the above doesn't work; surgical intervention to reduce (manually) intussusceptions.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing Management</h4>
                        <p>Includes: NPO status, Monitor vital signs for worsening state, - reassure caregiver who may worry due to suddenness of disease onset. Surgical care pre-operative care. Family teaching: Caregiver to observe signs of intestinal obstruction/ recurrence eg abdominal pain, abdominal distension, blood in stools and bile stained vomiting.</p>

                        <p>Also called congenital aganglionic megacolon. It is a motility disorder due to absence of parasympathetic ganglion cells in the colon, hence no peristalsis & feces accumulate proximal to the defect - bowel obstruction. Most common cause of distal bowel obstruction in the newborn but may not be diagnosed until infancy or childhood. Common in males x 3-4 than females.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>
                        <p>Has some genetical link in 7% of cases. The aganglionic segment is located often in the recto-sigmoid area. Affected area is unable to transmit coordinated peristaltic movement/ waves. Proximal to the defect, fecal matter accumulates & distension occurs. This causes hypertrophy & dilation (megacolon).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h4>
                        <p>In newborns, failure to pass meconium within 24-48 hrs after birth, abdominal distension, bile starved vomiting, refusal to feed and intestinal obstruction. In infants & children you notice chronic constipation (initial) , abdominal distension, poor weight gain, episodes of explosive passage of stools, vomiting, ribbon - like or pellet shaped foul - smelling stools. The major danger is development of enterocolitis ie the inflammation of small and large intestines. Enterocolitis presents with: onset of foul-smelling diarrhea, abdominal distension, fever, may lead to perforation and sepsis. It is a major cause of death in hours - 30% of cases.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>History, physical examination ie rectal exam shows no stools in rectum & a tight sphincter. Rectal biopsy - absence of ganglionic cells confirms diagnosis. Barium enema can also be done.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic Management</h4>
                        <p>Client goes through two stages of operation. Temporary colostomy in normal bowel. In the second stage the aganglionic segment is resected & normal bowel anastomosed to the rectum. Temporarily colostomy is closed. The operation is done at 6-15 months of age. One stage correction has also been done with good results. Pre-op & post-operative care just like any other patient undergoing GIT surgery. Eg Pre-operative care-Clean bowel - saline enema, NPO, NG tube insertion and antibiotic to decrease flora. Post-operative care-NG tube care, Assess bowel sounds and observe abdominal distension.</p>

                        <p>Oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects a baby's oesophagus (the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach). The upper part of the oesophagus doesn't connect with the lower oesophagus and the stomach. It usually ends in a pouch, which means food cannot reach the stomach. It often occurs along with another birth defect called a tracheo-oesophageal fistula, which is a connection between the lower part of the oesophagus and windpipe (trachea). This causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach, and stomach acid to pass to the lungs.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>There is a continuous flow of saliva in the infant's mouth. This is coupled with attacks of coughing and cyanosis. Feeding the infant exacerbates the infant's condition.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic Investigation</h4>
                        <p>A fine rubber catheter is passed through the mouth into the esophagus and an opaque dye, known as lipidol, is injected. This is followed by an x-ray, which will reveal the presence of the pouch.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preoperative Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The saliva should be frequently aspirated.</li>
                            <li>The infant should be put on an intravenous infusion with glucose and other nutritional fluids such as aminosol (a solution that contains amino acids used for parenteral nutrition in patient who cannot get their nutrition through eating).</li>
                            <li>Start the infant on antibiotics such as penicillin to prevent respiratory infections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Intraoperative phase</h4>
                        <p>The operation is performed via the patient's neck or through thoracotomy. The blind ends are trimmed and anastomosis undertaken. In some cases a tube may be passed through the oesophagus into the stomach until the anatomized area heals. The tube may be used for feeding, but often a gastrostomy tube for feeding.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Postoperative Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The baby is best nursed in an incubator, which should have the facility for tipping the bottom end and to raise the head (top) during the feeding period.</li>
                            <li>The baby should be kept as quiet as possible.</li>
                            <li>Aspiration of saliva from the mouth and intravenous infusion should be continued.</li>
                            <li>Feed the infant through the gastrostomy tube and ensure maintenance of fluids and electrolytes.</li>
                            <li>Postural (involves posture) drainage should be carried out on a regular basis to prevent chest infections.</li>
                            <li>Analgesics and antibiotics should be administered as ordered.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Oesophageal Fistula</h3>
                        <p>This is an abnormal opening of the oesophageal wall. In some cases the fistula and atresia may occur together, involving the trachea. Fistulae tend to occur more often in low birth weight babies. A history of polyhydramnious (an excessive amount of amniotic fluid) during pregnancy is often a pre determinant. In this condition, the foetus normally swallows amniotic fluid. The commonest abnormalities met with in medical practice are a tracheo oesophageal fistula without associated atresia of the oesophagus and a tracheo oesophageal fistula with associated oesophageal atresia.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gastric reflux into the trachea will occur, causing inhalation of secretions and hydrochloric acid, resulting in ulceration of the mucous membrane.</li>
                            <li>The baby will persistently cough and choke due to aspiration of gastric content. This may lead to the development of pneumonia.</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis is present and respiration disturbed.</li>
                            <li>Management of the condition necessitates surgical repair.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preoperative Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The infant should be nursed in the incubator, kept warm and given highly humidified oxygen to relieve respiratory distress and liquefy secretion.</li>
                            <li>The infant's head should be slightly elevated and intermittent suction carried out both to the mouth, pharynx and proximal oesophageal pouch.</li>
                            <li>The catheter may have to be changed daily by the doctor or irrigated with normal saline.</li>
                            <li>At intervals the infant's head may be lowered to facilitate free drainage of secretion.</li>
                            <li>You should continue to take and record the vital signs and monitor respiration to analyse the effectiveness of these procedures.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics are administered prophylactically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Management</h4>
                        <p>As soon as the diagnosis confirms the presence of fistula, a gastrostomy should be performed to decompress the stomach and also serves as a way of feeding after surgery. The gastrostomy tube may be left open to permit the escape of air from the stomach. The fistulae are then repaired. Attempts should be made to prevent the gastric content entering the lungs. This is achieved by modifying the infant's position.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Postoperative Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All the preoperative nursing care given should be continued after the operation.</li>
                            <li>Any respiratory difficulties or distress should be reported immediately to the attending physician.</li>
                            <li>The gastrostomy tube should be allowed to drain freely by gravity until the second or third postoperative day. It can be used to feed the infant, beginning with glucose and then graduating to a milk formula.</li>
                            <li>As the condition improves, oral feeds should be introduced at which point the gastrostomy tube may finally be removed. The nurse should ascertain that the baby can swallow without any problem. Once the gastrostomy tube has been removed and the baby is feeding well orally, their discharge may be planned.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Follow Up</h4>
                        <p>In three to six weeks postoperatively an oesophagoscopy should be performed to inspect the status of the anastomosis. Oesophageal dilatation may have to be performed if a stricture is suspected. Advise the parents to monitor the child's progress, especially where difficulties with feeding and swallowing are noted, when the child must be returned to hospital immediately without delay.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is one of the main paediatric emergencies you may have to deal with. In young children, passage of three or more watery stools, with or without blood, in twenty four hours is referred to as diarrhoea, which is also known as gastro enteritis. The latter technically means inflammation of the stomach and small intestine. There are two types of diarrhoea: acute diarrhoea mostly caused by infectious agents such as viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens; and chronic diarrhoea caused by chronic conditions such as malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, immune disease, food allergy, lactose intolerance and chronic non specific diarrhoea or a result of inadequate management of acute infectious diarrhoea.</p>
                        <p>Diarrhoea is a very common disease, but cases can be quite easily reduced in simple ways, such as improving nutrition in young children and general standards of hygiene within the community. Additionally, providing adequate hydration early in diseases associated with the symptom is necessary. Lack of hydration is the main cause of death in young children if no urgent action is undertaken.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Abnormal loss of fluids and electrolytes from the intestines may occur as a result of gastrointestinal disturbance and this is explained by the following factors.</p>
                        <h5>First Factor</h5>
                        <p>The first factor is increased fluid secretion from the intestine. Some micro-organisms such as Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli produce toxins, which stimulate salt and water secretion from the absorptive villi cells of the intestine. The bacteria stick to the surface of villi cells without penetrating or destroying the cells. This secretory diarrhoea is very strong and accounts for the severe rise in watery stools and rapid dehydration that is seen in cholera and coli form diarrhoea in infants and children. The intestinal walls are still able to absorb foods and water when the child is given these orally.</p>
                        <h5>Second Factor</h5>
                        <p>The second factor is poor absorption (malabsorption). Depending on the child's age, about two to eight litres of fluid enter the intestine in twentyfour hours. One quarter of this fluid is ingested from the foodstuff and drinks. The digestive juice produces the rest. Only 50-200 mls of this fluid is absorbed or reabsorbed into the blood stream. The remainder is passed in the faeces. The stimulation or irritation of the intestine results in rapid passage of the bowel contents. This rapidity results in lack of intestinal enzymes to split sugar, which in turn passes to the large intestine. Here it draws water from the surrounding tissues, causing diarrhoea.</p>
                        <h5>Third Factor</h5>
                        <p>The third factor is exudation from the intestine. Some pathogenic micro-organisms such as Salmonella typhi normally cause diarrhoea by penetrating the intestinal mucosa, destroying the cells and sometimes gaining access to the bloodstream. Here the mucosa becomes inflamed and exudation (leakage) of fluids containing serum, pus cells, and blood occurs. In some very serious cases, the ulcers bleed heavily and may perforate causing peritonitis as in typhoid fever.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes of Diarrhoeal Diseases</h4>
                        <p>There are several causes of acute diarrhoea in children. You will now cover some of these causes in greater detail.</p>
                        <h5>Enteral Infections</h5>
                        <p>This group encompasses several micro-organisms and parasites gaining access to the intestinal tract. Some of these are non pathogenic and are usually present within the tract but may change with circumstances to cause diarrhoea. Some of the organisms and intestinal parasites in this category include escherichia coli (e.coli), schistosoma, crystosporidium associated with HIV, entamoeba histolytica, salmonella, vibrio cholerae, shigella. rotavirus and other types of viruses.</p>
                        <h5>Parenteral Infections</h5>
                        <p>Any fever in children, and infections which are unconnected to the gastro intestinal tract, can cause diarrhoea or diarrhoea and vomiting. The diseases which fall under the category of parenteral infections include urinary tract infection, pneumonia, otitis media, tonsillitis, malaria and measles.Diarrhoea may be associated with upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections and otitis media.</p>
                        <h5>Dietary</h5>
                        <p>These include overfeeding, introduction of new foods, reinstituting milk too soon after diarrhoeal episode, osmotic sugar from excess sugar in formula, excessive ingestion of sorbitol(complex) or fructose.</p>
                        <h5>Medications</h5>
                        <p>Medications such as antibiotics and laxatives may also result in diarrhoea.</p>
                        <h5>Toxics</h5>
                        <p>Resulting from ingestion of heavy metals such as lead and mercury and organic phosphates.</p>
                        <h5>Functional</h5>
                        <p>Especially Irritable bowel syndrome</p>
                        <h5>Other Factors</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here the cause may be known or unknown. Causes may include psychological factors, for example, a child who is fearful, anxious and lives under a tense environment may develop diarrhoea due to increased gastro intestinal activities.</li>
                            <li>Acute abdominal problems such as intussusception may result in diarrhoea and/or bloodstained stools.</li>
                            <li>The ingestion of poisonous substances, which include traditional herbal medicine administered in the community, may also be contributing factors.</li>
                            <li>Some children have diarrhoea of unknown origin. Physical and laboratory investigations do not reveal the cause, though if treatment attempts are made to control it just like any other form. Gastro enteritis is associated with feeding defects and vitamin A deficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a child has developed diarrhoea, investigations should be carried out to exclude parenteral and enteral infections. Dehydration tends to develop very rapidly in children and the degree of this should be carefully assessed. Any dehydration must be corrected.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The major goals in the management of acute diarrhoea include assessment of the fluid and electrolyte imbalance, rehydration, maintenance fluid therapy and reintroduction of adequate diet.</li>
                            <li>As the basis of treatment, the child's condition should be assessed and fluid replacement commenced according to the degree of dehydration.</li>
                            <li>Their nutritional requirements are maintained as soon as is practical.</li>
                            <li>Any parenteral and enteral infections are effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics or drug preparation, whether these infections are either suspected or confirmed.</li>
                            <li>The child should be kept warm, while their vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are monitored for positive improvement or deterioration of the child's condition.</li>
                            <li>The parents should be constantly reassured.</li>
                            <li>An accurate fluid balance chart should be maintained.</li>
                            <li>Pay particular attention to the child's urinary output.</li>
                            <li>The child's personal hygiene must be maintained.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the child has a daily bed bath, regular care of pressure areas and change of beddings when they are soiled.</li>
                            <li>The nurse in dispensaries and health centres should be on the look out for certain signs, which may dictate the need for referral to the main hospital for further management. These should include suspected surgical problems such as appendicitis or intussusception or acute dehydration that cannot be managed in a small health facility within 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>If a child has had continuous diarrhoea for more than three days where the actual cause cannot be identified, this child requires referral.</li>
                            <li>Likewise, any child with chronic diarrhoea or suspected HIV infection or lactose intolerance ought to be transferred to a well equipped health facility.</li>

                        <p>This is an obstruction at the pyloric sphincter caused by hypertrophy of the circular muscle fibres in the pylorus, resulting in gastric stasis and dilatation. The condition occurs soon after birth for unknown reasons. Pyloric stenosis is a common surgical condition of the gastro intestinal tract occurring in approximately 1 in 150 male infants and 1 in 750 female infants (this denotes a ratio of 1 male to 5 female infants). It also tends to occur more frequently in the first born children and in some families more than the others. The child is usually normal until three to four weeks old.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In pyloric stenosis, there is a diffuse hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the smooth muscle of the gastric antrum and sphincter, which becomes twice its normal size and is almost cartilaginous in its consistence.</li>
                            <li>This pathological change increases the size of the pyloric circulation muscle, which in turn, results in the narrowing of its orifice. This narrowing can be partial or absolute which leads to obstruction. The gastric contents cannot, therefore, flow freely through the constricted or blocked pylorus.</li>
                            <li>Vigorous peristalsis results in hypertrophy and dilatation of the stomach muscle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Persistent vomiting which gradually increases in severity until it becomes projectile</li>
                            <li>The infant becomes dehydrated and develops hypochlorhydric alkalosis (blood becomes more alkaline than usual because of diminished level of hydrochloric acid)</li>
                            <li>Gastritis with some bleeding from the gastric mucosa may also occur</li>
                            <li>Loss of weight and constipation may follow</li>
                            <li>On physical examination, visible peristaltic movement of the stomach is noticeable over the abdominal wall</li>
                            <li>On abdominal palpation a lump can be felt indicating thickened pylorus</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Investigations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any investigations should begin with history taking with reference to immediate projectile vomiting which follows feeds. Undertake a physical examination of the child. A radiological study, which may include barium meal, may also be required.</li>
                            <li>Blood tests should be carried out to determine serum chloride concentration as well as the pH, sodium and potassium level.</li>

                        <h5>Before Surgery</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to persistent vomiting, the feeds should be reduced radically. Gastric lavage should be performed at regular intervals using normal saline. An intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose normal saline should be put up and monitored.</li>
                            <li>You should also maintain a fluid balance chart.</li>
                            <li>The child's electrolyte balance should be monitored and any deficiencies identified should be replaced accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Muscle relaxant (antispasmodic) drugs, for example, atropine methonitrate (eumydrin) 0.6% alcohol solution, administered by a dropper or pipette direct on the tongue at the back of the mouth, may be prescribed to be given fifteen to twenty minutes prior to each feed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Surgical Management</h5>
                        <p>The only curative treatment is surgical intervention, known as pyloromotomy (Rammstedt's operation), which should be undertaken as soon as possible, in order to relieve the obstruction. The procedure is performed under general anaesthesia or local anaesthesia and involves making an incision through the hypertrophied circular muscle without severing the mucous membrane.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preoperative Nursing Care</h4>
                        <p>The infant is usually admitted to hospital and because of their lowered resistance to infections, they must be isolated in a cubical, kept warm and the reserve barrier nursing method employed. All the child's carers, including the parents, should be instructed to wear gowns and masks. In preparation for surgery, you must perform the following functions diligently:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regularly take and record vital signs. The temperature should be taken rectally.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the amount and characteristics of the vomitus and stool.</li>
                            <li>Observe for signs of hunger such as the infant sucking the fingers or fist as well as for signs of hyperperistalsis.</li>
                            <li>Collect specimens for laboratory analysis as requested by the surgeon.</li>
                            <li>Assist with other diagnostic procedures as required.</li>
                            <li>Withhold oral feeds, administer and monitor parentaral fluids as prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Perform gastric lavage with normal saline if ordered. In cases where naso-gastric tube is passed and left in situ, the nurse must ensure it is intact and aspiration is performed regularly, recording the content on the fluid balance chart.</li>
                            <li>If feeding is ordered preoperatively, the infant's head should be lifted up a bit to prevent regurgitation. Intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose alternating with normal saline, if ordered, must be given and monitored with a lot of care to prevent overloading the child's circulation.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a strict intake/output chart. The solution given replaces the deficit electrolytes such as sodium chloride and potassium. The amount to be given is determined by the metabolic alterations of the individual child.</li>
                            <li>The addictive electrolytes such as oral potassium should be administered correctly according to the dosages prescribed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Postoperative Nursing Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On return from the operating theatre, the care given before the child went in for surgery must be continued.</li>
                            <li>More attention should be paid to the provision of adequate fluid and nutritional intake. Intravenous fluids are sustained until the infant is able to take oral glucose, electrolyte solution or breast milk or formula milk. This is usually approximately six hours postoperatively, especially when no further vomiting occurs.</li>
                            <li>The infant's head should be slightly elevated after feeding and then should be placed on right lateral position.</li>
                            <li>Response to feeds must be recorded.</li>
                            <li>You should observe for signs of complications, paying special attention to pulse, skin colour and abdominal distension.</li>
                            <li>Before the baby is discharged to go home, the parents should be taught, and encouraged to get involved in, positioning, feeding, observing for vomiting and inflammation around the operation site.</li>
                            <li>When the time comes for discharge, the parents should be informed about where to go for follow up and review procedure.</li>
                            <li>Feeding the baby after surgery varies from one hospital to another and from one surgeon to another. The principles, however, remain the same. Below is the guideline, which may be applied in most health institutions.</li>
