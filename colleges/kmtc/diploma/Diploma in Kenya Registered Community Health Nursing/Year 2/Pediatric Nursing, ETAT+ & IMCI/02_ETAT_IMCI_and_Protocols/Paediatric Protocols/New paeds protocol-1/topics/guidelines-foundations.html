                        </h2>
                        <p>Worldwide 2.6 million babies die every year from causes that are preventable and manageable. Approximately 80 percent of newborn deaths are as a result of prematurity/low birth weight, complications related to labour and delivery, neonatal sepsis and congenital anomalies amongst others.</p>
                        <p>With Vision 2030 target of 12/1000 livebirths, Kenya's neonatal mortality is still high at 22 / 1000 live births and of great public health concern. The National Neonatal Guidelines for Hospitals has been structured in a format that outlines the management of major causes of neonatal mortality. It is to be used by hospital based healthcare practitioners, to improve their knowledge and skills and provide high-quality evidenced-based care for the achievement of the overall objective-reduction of new-born mortality and that every newborn has a chance to survive, thrive and transform.</p>
                        <p>These guidelines will continue to be updated periodically and /or when necessary depending on feedback from the all the users, hospitals, academia, teaching institutions, regulatory bodies and emerging research/evidence-based data.</p>

                            <li>The aims are for hospitals to diagnose key problems in providing care it- is essential that identifying problems is linked to suggesting who needs to act, how and by when to implement solutions. Then follow up on whether progress is being achieved with new audits. Identify new problems and plan new actions etc.</li>
                            <li>Hospitals should have an audit team comprising 4 to 8 members, led by a senior clinician and including nurses, admin, lab technicians and nutritionists etc. 1-2 people, usually MO or CO interns and nurses should be selected on a rotating basis to perform the audit and report back to the audit team and department staff.</li>

                            <li>Was care reasonable? Look for where improvements could be made in the system of care before the child comes to hospital (referral), on arrival in hospital (care in the OPD / MCH etc.), on admission to a ward, or follow up on the ward.</li>
                            <li>Look at assessments, diagnoses, investigations, treatments and whether what was planned was done and recorded. Check doses and whether drugs / fluids / feeds are correct and actually given and if clinical review and nursing observations were adequate - if it is not written down it was not done!</li>
                            <li>Look at several cases for each meeting and summarize the findings looking for the major things that are common and need improving. Then record the summaries and action points for reporting.</li>
