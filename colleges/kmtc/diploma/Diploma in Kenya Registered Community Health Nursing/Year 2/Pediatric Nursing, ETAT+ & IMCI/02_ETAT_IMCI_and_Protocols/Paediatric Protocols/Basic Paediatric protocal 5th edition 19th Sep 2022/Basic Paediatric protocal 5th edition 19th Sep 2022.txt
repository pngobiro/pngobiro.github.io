\section*{Foreword}

This pocket book consists of guidelines on triage, assessment \& classification of illness severity, criteria for admission, and inpatient management of the major causes of childhood morbidity \& mortality such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, severe acute malnutrition, meningitis, HIV, TB and neonatal conditions. The guidelines target management of the seriously ill newborn or child in the first 24-48 hours of arrival at a health facility.

The booklet is aimed at doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers responsible for the care of sick newborns and young children at all levels of care. It will also be useful for defining basic evidence-informed care to students in medical schools and other health training institutions. The guidelines presume health facilities that provide care should have the capacity to do essential investigations for common serious childhood illnesses and avail essential drugs for the care of seriously sick children.

The first edition was inspired by the WHO Book, "A Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children" (2005 Edition). It has subsequently been updated based on specific and up-to-date reviews of emerging new research evidence and technologies using the GRADE approach.

The simplified algorithms in this booklet can be enlarged and used as job aids in emergency rooms (casualty and outpatient departments), paediatric wards, delivery rooms and newborn units. These guidelines will undergo periodic revision to keep abreast with new developments and hence continue to deliver quality care to the children of this nation. Updates or additional materials can be found at the websites: https:// kenyapaediatric.org and www.guidelines.health.go.ke.

These protocols do not cover all common paediatric problems, therefore be on the lookout for the unusual conditions and seek advice or refer the child promptly.

\section*{Principles of Good Care}
1) Facilities must have basic equipment and drugs in stock at all times, and adequate staff skilled in paediatric care.
2) Sick children coming to hospital must be immediately triaged, assessed and if necessary, provided with emergency treatment as soon as possible.
3) Assessment of diagnosis and illness severity must be thorough and treatment must be carefully planned. All stages should be accurately and comprehensively documented.
4) The protocols provide a minimum standard and safe approach to most but not all common problems. Care needs to be taken to identify and treat children with less common problems rather than just applying the protocols.
5) All treatments should be clearly and carefully prescribed, usually based on a measurement of weight, on patient treatment sheets with doses checked by nurses before administration. (Please write dose frequency as 6 hrly, 8 hrly, 12 hrly etc. rather than QID, TID, etc.)
6) The parents / caretakers need to understand what the illness and its treatment are. They provide invaluable assistance in caring for the child. Being polite to parents considerably improves communication.
7) A child who requires inpatient management should not be discharged against medical advice but should be transferred to another facility to continue appropriate care.
8) The response to treatment needs to be assessed. Severely ill children must be reviewed within the first 6 hours of admission and progress documented.
9) Correct supportive care - particularly adequate feeding, use of oxygen and fluids - is as important as disease specific care.
10) Laboratory tests should be used appropriately and use of unnecessary drugs should be avoided.
11) An appropriate discharge and follow up plan needs to be made as the child leaves hospital.
12) Good hand hygiene practices and good hygiene in the patient's environment improves outcomes for all sick children.

\section*{Specific Policies}
- All children and newborns admitted to hospital requiring medical treatment should have their own inpatient number, and admission should be recorded using a standardized paediatric or newborn admission record form \& inpatient registers.
- Treatments, including supportive care, should be fully and clearly prescribed.
- Medical records are legal documents and entries should be clear, accurate and signed with a date and time of the entry recorded.
- All paediatric admissions should be offered HIV testing using HIV testing services and also be screened for TB.
- All newborn admissions aged $\leq 14$ days should receive Vitamin K unless it has already been given.
- Routine immunization status should be checked and missed vaccines given before discharge.
- Every child with condition(s) that cannot be managed effectively with the available resources receives appropriate, timely referral, with seamless continuity of care.
- Assess for abuse, neglect or any other form of maltreatment and refer to the social worker
- All infants and children should have a developmental assessment and those with special needs should be managed or referred appropriately.

\section*{Admission and assessment}
- All admitted children must have weight recorded and used for calculation of fluids / feeds and drug doses.
- Length / Height should be measured with weight for height (WHZ) recorded and used to assess nutritional status for children.
- Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) should be used for nutritional assessment for children > 6months of age.
- All vital signs should be taken and recorded including Temperature, Oxygen saturation, Pulse rates and Respiratory rates which must be counted for 1 minute, and Blood pressure.
- Consciousness level should be assessed on all children admitted using the AVPU scale or an alternative such as the GCS ( Glasgow coma scale) adapted for children.
- All sick children should have their blood glucose checked. If not possible and AVPU <A, treat for hypoglycemia.
- The sickest newborns / children in the ward should be near the nursing station (acute area) and prioritized for re-assessment / observations.

\section*{Infection prevention and control (IPC)}
- Good hand hygiene saves lives and can be achieved by handwashing with soap and running water OR hand rubbing with alcohol-based rub (70\%).
- Gloves do not protect patients and are not a substitute for hand hygiene
- If hands are visibly dirty, they must be cleaned first with soap and water.
- The alcohol hand-rub must be allowed to dry off to be effective.

\section*{The five moments of hand hygiene}

All equipment used for patient care should be decontaminated appropriately according to the current National IPC guidelines.

\section*{Clinical audit and use of the protocols}
1. Clinical audit is aimed at self-improvement and is not about finding who to blame.
2. Hospitals should have an audit team comprising 4 to 8 members, led by a senior clinician and including nurses, admin, lab technicians and nutritionists etc. 1-2 people, usually MO or CO interns and nurses should be selected on a rotating basis to perform the audit and report back to the audit team and department staff.
3. The aims are for hospitals to diagnose key problems in providing care. It is essential that identifying problems is linked to suggesting who needs to act, how, and by when to implement solutions. Follow up on whether progress is being achieved with new audits should be done to identify new problems and plan new actions etc.
4. Deaths and surviving cases should be audited weekly as per the facility audit and review cycle below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-010.jpg?height=598&width=869&top_left_y=628&top_left_x=75)
5. Use the audit framework tool (Table 1), to identify modifiable administrative factors, health worker related factors and patient oriented factors in collecting relevant information in step 2 of the audit review cycle.

\section*{Clinical Audit Protocols}

\section*{Table 1: Audit framework tool}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Administrative Factors & Health Worker Related Factors & Patient Orientated Factors \\
\hline & & $\square$ Poor accessibility to health facilities
Delay in seeking treatment for child
Refusal of treatment for child. \\
\hline Absence of guidelines to guide on diagnosis and management plan
Absence of guidelines on appropriate use of equipment \& supplies
Lack of medication
$\square$ Lack of transportation/ referral mechanisms and delay in transportation within and in-between facilities
$\square$ Inadequate Human Resource for Health capacity and high staff turnover & $\square$ Lack of knowledge in case management, interpretation of investigations etc.
Delay in executing management plan \& increased turnaround time for tests/investigations \& in reviewing of results
$\square$ Medical errors: incorrect medication, administration, poor monitoring practices
Poor communication across cadres, departments and with parents/caregivers
Poor documentation practice
Delay in decision for referral within facility \& Inbetween facilities. & ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-011.jpg?height=221\&width=196\&top_left_y=633\&top_left_x=725) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
6. Use an audit tool to compare care given with recommendations in these protocols and other guidelines (e.g. for TB, HIV/AIDS) and the most up-to-date reference materials for less common conditions.
7. Look at assessments, diagnoses, investigations, treatments and whether what was planned was done correctly and recorded. Check doses and whether drugs / fluids / feeds are correct and actually given and if clinical review and nursing observations were adequate - if it is not written down it was not done!
8. This data can be used to provide accountability for results and compel decision makers to pay due attention and respond to the problems identified.

\section*{Actions after ABCDE:}
- Take full history and examination
- Document all interventions given and the time they were done
- Continue observing patient as clerkship continues

\section*{Oxygen Therapy}

Hypoxeamia ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}<90 \%$ ) can be assessed through clinical signs, pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis. It often presents in sick children and is a major risk factor for death regardless of the diagnosis.

\section*{Any child presenting with any of the following:}
- Central cyanosis, head nodding, nasal flaring, grunting, severe lower chest-wall in-drawing, respiratory rate >70bpm
- Oxygen saturation $\left(\mathrm{SpO}_{2}\right)<90 \%$
- Convulsions
- Post resuscitation

\section*{GIVE OXYGEN}
- Start giving oxygen at accurate and safe levels (Check flow rate, delivery method and oxygen prescription instructions on page 29)
- Target saturation: 91-95\% for neonates, 90-95\% for older children and 94-98\% post resuscitation
- Titrate every $15-30 \mathrm{mins}$ by $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ until the target saturation is achieved

\section*{TARGET SATURATION ACHIEVED?}

\section*{NO}
- Increase flow rates to achieve targets $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$
- Change the oxygen delivery methods as appropriate
- Monitor the $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and work of breathing
- Treat any underlying medical problem
- Maintain the oxygen flow rate
- Monitor the $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and work of breathing
- Treat any underlying medical problem

\section*{YES}

TARGET SATURATION ACHIEVED WITH HIGHEST FLOW RATE?

\section*{PATIENT STABLE? \\ $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}>90 \%$; No increased WoB; No emergency signs}

\section*{NO}

NO

\section*{YES}
- Start weaning off oxygen by $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$

Refer patient for advanced care (high flow nasal cannula, CPAP or mechanical ventilation)
- Treat any underlying medical problem every 30 mins
- Monitor the $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and work of breathing
- Recheck $\mathrm{SpO}_{2} 1$ hour after stopping oxygen as late desaturation can occur

Discharge only if child has been stable with $\mathrm{SpO}_{2} \geq 90 \%$ on room air and no increased work of breathing for at least 24 hrs .

\section*{Prescribing Oxygen}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Oxygen Administration Device. & Flow rate & Fraction of inspired Oxygen ( $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ ) \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Nasal prong} & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular} & Delivers 80-95\% $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to patient \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
*Humidification is needed for all patients on high flow rates
*Check for abdominal distension regularly.
Always DOCUMENT the flow rate, delivery device, monitoring frequency and target oxygen saturation as part of the oxygen prescription.

\section*{Use of Intra-osseous Lines}

If IV access fails in a child in circulatiory compromise IO line is a rapid, safe \& reliable route for obtaining blood samples and administration of drugs, fluids \& blood.
- Size - use IO or bone marrow needle 15-18G if available or $16-21 \mathrm{G}$ hypodermic needle if not available
- Sterility - Clean after identifying landmarks then use sterile gloves and sterilize site
- Site - Middle of the antero-medial (flat) surface of tibia at junction of upper and middle thirds
- bevel to toes and introduce vertically $\left(90^{\circ}\right)$
- advance slowly with rotating movement
- Stop advancing when there is a 'sudden give' - then aspirate with 5 mls syringe
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-030.jpg?height=348&width=240&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=718)
- Slowly inject 3 mls Normal Saline looking for any leakage under the skin - if OK attach IV fluid giving set and apply dressings and strap down
- Give fluids as needed - a $20 \mathrm{mls} / 50 \mathrm{mls}$ syringe will be needed for boluses
- Watch for leg / calf muscle swelling
- Replace IO access with IV within 8 hours

\section*{Treatment of Convulsions Age > 1 month.}

For convulsions in the first month, refer to page 65
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-031.jpg?height=1021&width=885&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=75)
- DO NOT give more than 2 doses of diazepam in 24 hrs once phenobarbitone is used
- DO NOT give a phenobarbitone-loading dose to an epileptic on maintenance phenobarbitone
- Phenytoin, levetiracetam and IV sodium valproate (see doses in the formulary) are alternatives to phenobarbitone.

\section*{Malaria}

If a high quality blood slide is negative with signs of SEVERE malaria, start treatment BUT REPEAT 24 hourly up to 3 times and STOP treatment if 3rd test is negative
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-032.jpg?height=935&width=882&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=73)

\section*{Treatment failure:}
1. Consider other causes of illness / co-morbidity.
2. A child on oral antimalarials who develops signs of severe malaria (Unable to sit or drink, AVPU=V,U or P and / or respiratory distress) at any stage should be changed to IV artesunate (or quinine if not available).
3. If a child on oral antimalarials has fever and a positive blood slide after 3 days ( 72 hours) then check compliance with therapy and if treatment failure proceed to second line treatment.

\section*{Malaria treatment doses}

For drug preparation refer to page 34
- Artesunate is given IV / IM for a minimum of 24 hours.
- After the third injection of artesunate and the child can eat/drink then change to a full course of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) 8-12 hours after the last dose of artesunate (typically the 1st line oral anti-malarial, Artemether Lumefantrine)

Anti-malarial drug doses \\ (please check the IV or tablet preparation you are using, they may vary**)
}

\section*{Artesunate}

Artesunate typically comes as a powder together with a 1 ml vial of $5 \%$ bicarbonate that then needs to be further diluted with either normal saline or 5\% dextrose - the amount to use depends on whether the drug is to be given iv or im (see table below)
- DO NOT use water for injection to prepare artesunate for injection
- DO NOT give artesunate if the solution in the syringe is cloudy
- DO NOT give artesunate as a slow iv drip (infusion)
- YOU MUST use artesunate within 1 hour after it is prepared for injection

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline Preparing IV / IM Artesunate & IV & IM \\
\hline Artesunate powder (mg) & 60 mg & 60 mg \\
\hline Sodium Bicarbonate (mls,5\%) & 1 ml & 1 ml \\
\hline Normal Saline or $5 \%$ Dextrose (mls) & 5 mls & 2 mls \\
\hline Artesunate concentration (mg/ml) & $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ & $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Quinine}

For IV infusion typically 5\% or 10\% dextrose is used.
- Use at least 1 ml fluid for each 1 mg of quinine to be given
- DO NOT infuse quinine at a rate of more than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hour}$
- Use $5 \%$ Dextrose or normal saline for infusion with 1 ml of fluid for each 1 mg of quinine.
- The $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose therefore takes 4 hours or longer
- The $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ maintenance dose therefore takes 2 hours or longer For IM Quinine:
- Take 1 ml of the 2 mls in a 600 mg Quinine suphate IV vial and add 5 mls water for injection - this makes a $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ solution.
- For a loading dose this will mean giving $0.4 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$
- For the maintenance dosing this will mean giving $0.2 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$
- If you need to give more than 3 mls (a child over 8 kg for a loading dose or over 15 kg for maintenance doses then give the dose into two im sites - do not give more than 3mls per injection site.
- ** For oral Quinine 200 mg Quinine Sulphate $=200 \mathrm{mg}$ Quinine Hydrochloride or Dihydrochloride but $=300 \mathrm{mg}$ Quinine Bisulphate. The table of doses below is ONLY correct for a 200 mg Quinine Sulphate tablet.

Blood glucose level: $<4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ in child with diabetes

IV 10\% dextrose $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ bolus over 2-3 minutes

\section*{OR}

Glucagon IV, IM or SC (Contraindicated if prolonged fasting):
- 1 mg for children above 25 kg
- 0.5 mg for children below 25 kg

\section*{OR}

Place child in lateral position to prevent aspiration and smear glucose gel or a thick paste of glucose on the dependant cheek pad

\section*{Hypoglycemia}

\section*{NOT ALERT}

Give $0.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ of rapidly acting carbohydrates

Examples of 15g of carbohydrates: 3 glucose tablets, 3 teaspoons of sugar/ glucose dissolved in water, 175ml (3/4 cup) of juice, 3 teaspoons of honey.

After treatment, retest the blood sugar after 15 minutes.

If no response or an inadequate response, repeat oral intake as above.

Avoid chocolate, milk and other foods containing fat as glucose absorption will be delayed.

Once the hypoglycemia has been reversed, if next meal is >1 hr away, follow with 15 g of slower-acting carbohydrate such as bread, milk, biscuits, or fruit. Child should remain under observation for recurrence of hypoglycemia.

\section*{Measuring Nutritional Status}

Anthropometric measurements assess the nutrition status of a child to determine if there is wasting or stunting. MUAC is a simple and quick method to detect wasting. Weight and Height/Length measurements can be useful to detect wasting, stunting and for growth monitoring over time.

\section*{Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)}

MUAC is measured using a tape around the left upper arm. MUAC is used to quickly assess the nutritional status in emergency settings.

\section*{Weight, Height and Age}
- Weight for height (W/H) : Measure length lying if aged $<2 \mathrm{yr}$ to give weight for length. Low W/H (or W/L) = wasting, and indicates acute malnutrition.
- Weight for age (W/A): Low W/A does not distinguish acute from chronic malnutrition. W/A is thus not used for diagnosis of acute malnutrition, but can be used to monitor growth e.g. in the MCH booklet
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_659bf670f40a7d096280g-042.jpg?height=390&width=261&top_left_y=221&top_left_x=701)

In the diagnosis of acute malnutrition, we use W/H expressed as Z-scores. Z scores can be obtained from simple tables (page 80 to 97)
Visible Severe Wasting tends to identify only severest cases of SAM. It is better to use MUAC or WHZ score.

Kwashiorkor = severe malnutrition (at any age)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Classifying malnutrition (for WHZ values see page 80 to 97)} \\
\hline Acute Malnutrition (Severity) & MUAC (cm) & WHZ \\
\hline None & >13.5 & > - 1 \\
\hline At Risk & 12.5 to 13.4 & $>-2$ to $\leq 1$ \\
\hline Moderate & 11.5 to 12.4 & $>-3$ to $\leq-2$ \\
\hline \multirow{2}{*}{Severe} & < 11.5 & $\leq-3$ \\
\hline & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Kwashiorkor} \\

Exclude other medical conditions that can lead to wasting e.g CVS, GIT, endocrine

\section*{Algorithm for Early Infant Diagnosis of HIV}

Establish HIV exposure of Infants and Children < 18 months (including
0-6 week)
- Mother Known HIV positive
- HTS for mother with unknown HIV status
- Rapid antibody test on infant/child if mother's HIV status cannot be

HTS Settings At L\&D, MNCH/FP, OPD, IPD, A\&E, CCC \& Community established

Establish HIV infection for HIV Exposed Child at 6 weeks at first contact (includes child with negative DNA PCR result at birth)
- Collect a DBS for HIV DNA PCR test 1
- Start/continue infant ARV prophylaxis
- Start CPT

If Mother/infant HIV antibody test negative

\section*{Newborn Care Management guidelines}

\section*{Newborn $\boldsymbol{\geq} \mathbf{1 . 5 k g}$ : Feeding / Fluid requirements}
- Well baby - Immediate milk feeding -Table A. For first feed give 7.5 mls and each feed increase by this amount until full daily volume reached
- Day 1 - Unstable baby start with IV 10\% Dextrose for the first 24 hours. To stimulate the gut give $2 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of colostrum via NGT every 3hrs once ABC are stabilized - do not deduct this from IVF. Table B
- From Day 2, start feeding with EBM via NGT (unless baby is still unstable) at $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day EBM. Increase the EBM feeds by $30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{kg}$ day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume until IVF stopped ie until full 3 hourly feed volume achieved appropriate for weight and postnatal age in days. Increase total feeds (IVF + EBM) by $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day to $\max$ of $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Once no longer on IVF increase EBM to max of $180 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{day}$, but it may be possible to increase volumes further to as much as $200 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day but seek expert advice. Table C
- For IV fluids from Day 2, add Na+ $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ( $19 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of normal saline) and K+ $1-2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day $(0.5-1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day of $15 \% \mathrm{KCl}$ ) to $10 \%$ dextrose solution.
- Always feed with EBM unless contra-indicated
- Maximum fluid that can be given intravenously is $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$.

All babies $<1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ and well (without respiratory distress, who have not required BVM resuscitation, and do not have a congenital malformation as a contraindication to feeding) start feeds with EBM of 5 mls and increase by 5 mls each 3 hourly feed until full 3 hourly feed volume achieved ( $80 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day on day 1 and increasing by $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ each day)
Always use EBM for NGT feeds unless contra-indicated
Causes of failure to gain weight should be carefully investigated; if underlying causes have been excluded case by case decisions should be made on how best to support nutritional intakes to enable growth
Fortifiers are not routinely required but such babies should routinely receive recommended vitamin and mineral supplements at appropriate post-gestational ages.

\section*{Neonatal Convulsions}

In the absence of clinical seizures, neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy need not to be given prophylactic treatment with phenobarbitone

\section*{WHEN TO STOP ANTICONVULSANTS:}
1. In neonates with neurological examination and/or normal electroencephalography, consider stopping antiepileptic drugs if neonate has been seizures-free for more than 72 hrs ; the drug(s) should be reinstituted in case of reoccurence of seizures.
2. In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single antiepileptic drug, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without tapering of the doses.
3. In neonates requiring more than one antiepileptic drug for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one by one, with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn.

\section*{Neonatal Jaundice}
$\checkmark$ Assess for jaundice in bright natural light if possible. Check the eyes, the blanched skin on nose and the sole of the foot.
$\checkmark$ Refer early if there is jaundice in those aged $<24 \mathrm{hrs}$ and facility cannot provide phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion
$\checkmark$ If bilirubin measure is unavailable start phototherapy in the following:
- A well-baby with jaundice easily visible on the sole of the foot
- A preterm baby with ANY visible jaundice
- A baby with easily visible jaundice and inability to feed or other signs of neurological impairment and consider immediate exchange transfusion
$\checkmark$ Risk factors for bilirubin encephalopathy- dehydration, preterm births, respiratory distress, sepsis, hypoxia, seizures.
$\checkmark$ Stop phototherapy - when bilirubin levels 50 micromol/L lower than phototherapy threshold (see next page) for the baby's age on day of testing.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Phototherapy and supportive care - checklist \\
\hline 1. Shield the eyes with eye patches - Remove periodically such as during feeds \\
\hline 2. Keep the baby naked (except for a small sized diaper covering only the genital area for hygiene purposes \\
\hline 3. Place the baby at the centre at the cot - have one baby for every phototherapy machine \\
\hline 4. Using a light metre measure the irradiance required. Ensure the baby's head, hands and feet receive the desired irradiance \\
\hline 5. Do not place anything on the phototherapy devices including linen - lights and baby need to be kept cool so do not block Air vents / flow or light. Also keep device clean - dust can carry bacteria and reduce light. \\
\hline 6. Monitor vital signs especially temperature every 3 hrs and weight every alternate day \\
\hline 7. Do periodic ( $\mathbf{1 2}$ to $\mathbf{2 4 ~ h r s}$ ) plasma/serum bilirubin test. Visual testing for jaundice or transcutaneous bilirubin is unreliable. \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
8. Make sure that each light source is working and emitting light. Fluorescent tube lights should be replaced if: \\
- More than 6 months in use (or usage time >2000 hrs) \\
- Tube ends have blackened \\
- Lights flicker
\end{tabular} \\

\section*{Antibiotic prophylaxis}
- Antibiotic prophylaxis (Crystalline Penicillin and Gentamicin standard dose) should be given as soon as possible after birth to all newborns (term and preterms) with any one of the following risk factors:
- Prolonged Rupture of Membranes (PROM) >18 hours
- A mother with fever (Temperature $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ )
- Suspected or confirmed chorioamnionitis
- Mother being treated for sepsis at any time during labour or in the last 24 hours before and after birth.
- Treatment should be given for 48-72 hours (at least 4 doses of Penicillin +2 doses of Gentamicin) and may be stopped if the baby has remained entirely well during this period.
- Where possible initiate laboratory investigations immediately but DO NOT withhold antibiotics.
- If there are no risk factors then DO NOT initiate antibiotics treatment.
- A well baby born preterm $<37$ wks or Low birth weight with low risk factors does not require antibiotic treatment.

Ophthalmia Neonatorum:
Swollen red eyelids with pus should be treated with a single dose of:
$\checkmark$ Ceftriaxone $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM (Max 125 mg ) Or
$\checkmark$ Kanamycin or Spectinomycin $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (max 75 mg ) IM.

In the tables:
1. Locate the appropriate table for boys or girls
2. Locate the row containing the child's length/height in the left column
3. Note where the child's weight lies with the respect to the length recorded in this row
4. Look up the column to read the weight-for-length Z-Score of the child

Example: 5 months old Boy: length 48 cm , weight 2.5 kg . His weight-for-length is -2 SD .

\section*{Emergency Estimation of Child's Weight from their Age}

All babies and children admitted to hospital should be weighed and the weight recorded in the medical record and in the MCH.

Estimate the weight from the age only if immediate life support is required or the patient is in shock - then check weight as soon as stabilised.

All other children should have weight measured

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Child looks well nourished average size for age & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Estimated Weight (kg)} \\
\hline Age & \\
\hline 1-3 weeks & 3.0 \\
\hline 4-7 weeks & 4.0 \\
\hline 2-3 months & 5.0 \\
\hline 4-6 months & 7.0 \\
\hline 7-9 months & 9.0 \\
\hline 10-12 months & 10.0 \\
\hline $1-2 \mathrm{yrs}$ & 11.0 \\
\hline 2-3 yrs & 13.0 \\
\hline 3-4 yrs & 15.0 \\
\hline 4-5 yrs & 17.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

If child looks obviously underweight - find age but step back 2 age/ weight categories and use the weight appropriate for this younger age-group.

Eg. Child thin and age 10 months, use the weight for a 4-6 month well nourished child.

If there is severe malnutrition this chart will be inaccurate.
