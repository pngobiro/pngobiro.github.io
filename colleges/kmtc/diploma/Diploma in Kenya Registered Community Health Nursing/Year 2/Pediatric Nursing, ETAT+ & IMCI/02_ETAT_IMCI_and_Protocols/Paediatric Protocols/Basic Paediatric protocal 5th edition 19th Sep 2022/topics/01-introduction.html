                        <p>The development of this 5th edition of the Basic Paediatric Protocol marks an important milestone in the efforts of the health sector to ensure that quality health services are provided to children under five years in Kenya. Its use is expected to contribute to provision of the highest quality of health care service delivery as envisaged in the Constitution of Kenya.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Health expresses its gratitude to the members who made the original contribution to the protocol, and to the reviewers who have contributed to updating the guidelines in this protocol. The review was done through a long process of consultation, teamwork and information gathering. It was spear headed by Dr. Issak Bashir, Head of Department, Family Health and led by Dr. Caroline Mwangi, Head Division of Neonatal and Child Health in consultation with the various paediatric stakeholders.</p>
                        <p>We wish to thank everyone who reviewed most of the evidence and made recommendations to this protocol. Special thanks goes to Elsa Odira, Program Manager, Division of Neonatal and Child Health, and the core review team, Prof. Grace Irimu (University of Nairobi), Prof. Ambrose Agweyu (KEMRI), Dr. Joy Odhiambo (Kisumu), Dr. Maryanne Wachu (Bomet), Dr. Abdullahi Rashid (Wajir), Dr. Rachael Kanguha (Tharaka Nithi), Dr. Brenda Oeba (Nyamira), Dr. Emelda Manguro (Machakos), Alice Nyimbaye (Homabay), Jason Kiruja (KNH) and Beatrice Juma (Kisumu).</p>
                        <p>The Ministry of Health appreciates the financial and technical support given by WHO, UNICEF, PATH, MCGL, Save the Children, CHAI, KPA/KEPRECON, NCPD, KMTC, NASCOP and other development partners towards the review of this protocol.</p>

                        <p>This pocket book consists of guidelines on triage, assessment & classification of illness severity, criteria for admission, and inpatient management of the major causes of childhood morbidity & mortality such as pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, severe acute malnutrition, meningitis, HIV, TB and neonatal conditions. The guidelines target management of the seriously ill newborn or child in the first 24-48 hours of arrival at a health facility.</p>
                        <p>The booklet is aimed at doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers responsible for the care of sick newborns and young children at all levels of care. It will also be useful for defining basic evidence-informed care to students in medical schools and other health training institutions. The guidelines presume health facilities that provide care should have the capacity to do essential investigations for common serious childhood illnesses and avail essential drugs for the care of seriously sick children.</p>
                        <p>The first edition was inspired by the WHO Book, "A Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children" (2005 Edition). It has subsequently been updated based on specific and up-to-date reviews of emerging new research evidence and technologies using the GRADE approach.</p>
                        <p>The simplified algorithms in this booklet can be enlarged and used as job aids in emergency rooms (casualty and outpatient departments), paediatric wards, delivery rooms and newborn units. These guidelines will undergo periodic revision to keep abreast with new developments and hence continue to deliver quality care to the children of this nation. Updates or additional materials can be found at the websites: https:// kenyapaediatric.org and www.guidelines.health.go.ke.</p>
                        <p>These protocols do not cover all common paediatric problems, therefore be on the lookout for the unusual conditions and seek advice or refer the child promptly.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Facilities must have basic equipment and drugs in stock at all times, and adequate staff skilled in paediatric care.</li>
                            <li>Sick children coming to hospital must be immediately triaged, assessed and if necessary, provided with emergency treatment as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>Assessment of diagnosis and illness severity must be thorough and treatment must be carefully planned. All stages should be accurately and comprehensively documented.</li>
                            <li>The protocols provide a minimum standard and safe approach to most but not all common problems. Care needs to be taken to identify and treat children with less common problems rather than just applying the protocols.</li>
                            <li>All treatments should be clearly and carefully prescribed, usually based on a measurement of weight, on patient treatment sheets with doses checked by nurses before administration. (Please write dose frequency as 6 hrly, 8 hrly, 12 hrly etc. rather than QID, TID, etc.)</li>
                            <li>The parents / caretakers need to understand what the illness and its treatment are. They provide invaluable assistance in caring for the child. Being polite to parents considerably improves communication.</li>
                            <li>A child who requires inpatient management should not be discharged against medical advice but should be transferred to another facility to continue appropriate care.</li>
                            <li>The response to treatment needs to be assessed. Severely ill children must be reviewed within the first 6 hours of admission and progress documented.</li>
                            <li>Correct supportive care - particularly adequate feeding, use of oxygen and fluids - is as important as disease specific care.</li>
                            <li>Laboratory tests should be used appropriately and use of unnecessary drugs should be avoided.</li>
                            <li>An appropriate discharge and follow up plan needs to be made as the child leaves hospital.</li>
                            <li>Good hand hygiene practices and good hygiene in the patient's environment improves outcomes for all sick children.</li>

                            <li>Clinical audit is aimed at self-improvement and is not about finding who to blame.</li>
                            <li>Hospitals should have an audit team comprising 4 to 8 members, led by a senior clinician and including nurses, admin, lab technicians and nutritionists etc. 1-2 people, usually MO or CO interns and nurses should be selected on a rotating basis to perform the audit and report back to the audit team and department staff.</li>
                            <li>The aims are for hospitals to diagnose key problems in providing care. It is essential that identifying problems is linked to suggesting who needs to act, how, and by when to implement solutions. Follow up on whether progress is being achieved with new audits should be done to identify new problems and plan new actions etc.</li>
                            <li>Deaths and surviving cases should be audited weekly as per the facility audit and review cycle below.</li>
