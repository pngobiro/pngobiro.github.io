\section*{Foreword}

Worldwide 2.6 million babies die every year from causes that are preventable and manageable. Approximately 80 percent of newborn deaths are as a result of prematurity/low birth weight, complications related to labour and delivery, neonatal sepsis and congenital anomalies amongst others.
With Vision 2030 target of 12/1000 livebirths, Kenya's neonatal mortality is still high at 22 / 1000 live births and of great public health concern. The National Neonatal Guidelines for Hospitals has been structured in a format that outlines the management of major causes of neonatal mortality. It is to be used by hospital based healthcare practitioners, to improve their knowledge and skills and provide high-quality evidenced-based care for the achievement of the overall objective-reduction of new-born mortality and that every newborn has a chance to survive, thrive and transform.

These guidelines will continue to be updated periodically and /or when necessary depending on feedback from the all the users, hospitals, academia, teaching institutions, regulatory bodies and emerging research/evidence-based data.

\subsection*{1.0 INTRODUCTION}

\subsection*{1.1 HOW TO USE THESE GUIDELINES}

In the application of these guidelines irrespective of your qualifications you will be asking yourself some questions down a decision action pathway.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline KEY QUESTION & ACTION PATHWAY \\
\hline What is the problem? & Problem solving begins with understanding the problem. If you are sure of the diagnosis, you can proceed to the next question. If in doubt refer to the guidelines or consult and reappraise your diagnosis. If this does not help you, REFER to the next level. Remember that if you do not know the diagnosis (you do not know the problem you are dealing with) it may cost the baby's life. \\
\hline Given my knowledge, skills and the facilities available in my service delivery point, am I able to manage according to specific problem guidelines? & This question only applies if you are sure of your diagnosis. In which case refer to the guidelines and manage the patient as per recommendations if you have the facilities and skills to do so. If you do not have the facilities or doubt your competencies, refer the baby to the next level. Delay in referral in the absence of competencies or systems to support management of the baby may result in neonatal death. \\
\hline Is my management leading to success? & As you manage the baby continuously evaluate the result of your management. If it is effective, continue; otherwise refer to the guidelines for further information. In the absence of observable success with your management, consult or refer to the next level. Remember to judge your success against time taken to the next referral level in case a need arises. It is better to refer early than be faced with an unanticipated emergency which you have neither the competencies nor the facilities to manage. This delay may be fatal. \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{NB: Always remember that TIME is an important factor in the practice of neonatology. Referral must be timely. You must match the time against the DISTANCE to the next level and the URGENCY required given the problem encountered.} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{2.0 ELEMENTS OF QUALITY OF CARE}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline KEY QUESTION & ACTION PATHWAY \\
\hline Promotion and protection of health & People need to know about pregnancy and childbirth and to understand the danger signs. \\
\hline Accessibility and availability of services & Parents should be able to benefit from quality of care, understand the full range of services available for their newborns \& receive care at the lowest appropriate level of the system close to where they live. \\
\hline Technical competence of health care providers & Technical competence depends on regular training and retraining and on clear guidelines for clinical treatment \\
\hline Essential supplies and equipment & Necessary equipment, supplies, drugs at each level of care and their availability should be ensured. \\
\hline Quality of parentprovider interaction & Providers must treat parents with respect, be responsive to their needs and avoid judgmental attitudes. \\
\hline Parental orientation and visitation to the NBU & Parents should receive orientation to the unit and have unlimited access to their baby. \\
\hline Information and counselling for the parents & Parents should have the opportunity to talk to health care providers and should be offered guidance on any health problems identified. \\
\hline Involvement of parents in decision-making & Providers should see parents as partners in health care and should involve them in decision making as regards to care of their baby. Parents' participation in rounds improves parental satisfaction, patient care, and teamwork. \\
\hline Comprehensiveness of care and linkages to other services & These should be made as the need arises. Parents also can provide needed continuity with large and constantly changing care teams. \\
\hline Continuity of care and follow-up & Neonatal care should be part of continuing care comprising of antenatal, delivery \& neonatal care. Adequate follow up is essential. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Support to health care providers}
- For adequate \& happy function, health care workers need psychosocial support within their health care facility.
- Health Care providers at all levels need support of the State/County and the communities that they work in.

For levels 2 \& 3 neonatal care
- Nurse in charge of the SCNBU/NICU should have post-basic neonatal nurse training
- Nurse/patient ratio-Level 2: 1/3-4; Level 3: 1/1-2 in the NICU
- There should be a 24 hour cover by a medical officer or registrar in training. This doctor should not have other duties within the hospital
- Medical officer interns should not be allowed to cover in NICU

There must be access to equipment/service for:
- Resuscitation
- Transillumination by cold light
- Portable X-Rays
- X-ray viewing box
- Portable Ultrasound scanning \& echocardiography
- Electronic weighing scale accuracy 5g
- Blood gas analyser micromethod (Preferably available on the neonatal unit)
- 24-hour laboratory service with micromethod analysis.
- Screening and treatment for retinopathy of prematurity
- Screening for hearing loss.

There should be a budget for the purchasing, maintenance, replacement and upgrading of equipment for neonatal care, which complies with national standards. Such a policy should also include appropriate training of all personnel on the usage of equipment and quality assurance in keeping with good laboratory and clinical practice.

\subsection*{4.0 REFERRAL SYSTEM AND TRANSPORT}

It always preferable to have "in utero" transfer; it is safer and easier. If not then plan for baby as follows:

\section*{Referral to a more specialised unit}
- A baby requiring specialised care should be referred as soon as possible
- Before referral the receiving hospital should be informed
- Any baby being transferred must be stabilised before leaving the facility. WILL THS BABY SURVIVE DURING TRANSFER? evaluate the following:
+ Respiration - oxygen saturation, will you need to ventilate the baby during the journey?
+ Circulation-must be good, fluid status and vascular access
- Proper transport must be arranged
+ Temperature management during transfer: Ambulance preferably equipped with transport incubator. Can use kangaroo care if baby is breathing well
+ Emergency box with equipment \& drugs
- Take care of airway - Sufficient equipment to maintain respiration.
- Circulation as well prevention of hypoglycaemia Need to give feed or IV glucose infusion during transfer to prevent hypoglycaemia

\section*{+ Oxygen supply}
- The baby must be accompanied by a qualified health worker capable of dealing with any emergency that may arise during the journey
+ Trained \& up to date with newborn resuscitation
+ Able to handle any emergency
- Information to the receiving hospital should include adequate maternal \& baby history, investigations, X-rays and any imaging done should be sent, and treatment given before referral
- As much as possible the mother should be transferred with her baby

\section*{Referral back to original health facility: this is usually not an emergency but still should be planned}
- A baby who has stabilized or is recuperating should be transferred back to the original facility if necessary and the facility has adequate expertise to look after the baby
- Before referral back the receiving hospital should be informed
- A full medical report should be sent to the receiving hospital
- Proper transport must be arranged
- Arrangement for follow up will depend on the condition and whether the original health facility has the expertise.

\section*{Refusal for transfer}
- Parents have the right to accept or refuse health care for their babies
- The baby also has a right to adequate health care
- All efforts must be taken to inform and counsel the parents on the need for the specialised care.
- A signed refusal for transfer should be made and retained in the baby's hospital record

\subsection*{5.0 INFECTION CONTROL}

\subsection*{5.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INFECTION CONTROL}
- It is the responsibility of all health care personnel in the NBU to minimise infection
- Routine care of babies from birth onwards
- Consider everybody (mother, baby, personnel) potentially infected
- Protective clothing and gloves
- Aseptic technique
- Instruments \& equipment
- Cleaning of the neonatal unit
- Waste disposal
- Isolation or cohorting
- Overcrowding - spaces between cots \& incubators
- Adequacy of personnel
- Adequate feeding

\subsection*{5.2 HOUSEKEEPING AND WASTE DISPOSAL}

Regular and thorough cleaning will decrease micro-organisms on surfaces and help prevent infection.

\section*{Cleaning schedule for the newborn special care unit}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Frequency & Cleaning Guidelines \\
\hline Daily & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Wet-mop floors with a disinfectant and detergent solution. Do not sweep floors or use cleaning methods that increase dust. \\
- Wipe incubators and radiant warmers with a disinfectant solution. \\
- Humidifier chamber must be emptied and cleaned and filled with fresh distilled water.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Between Babies & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Wipe equipment, bassinets (cots), examination tables, weighing scales etc., with a cloth dampened with disinfectant solution. \\
- Clean incubators and radiant warmers between each use, including the mattress, with a disinfectant solution. Allow the incubator to dry completely before placing a baby inside. \\
- If same baby: After seven days, neonate should be shifted to another incubator and used incubator should be cleaned with antiseptic solution. \\
NB: Refer also to the manufacturer's manual for guideline on care of the incubator
\end{tabular} \\
\hline As needed & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Clean windows, walls, lamps, chairs, and to prevent accumulation of dust. \\
- Remove and destroy or clean contaminated waste containers. \\
- Remove and destroy the sharps-disposal container and replace with another suitable container. \\
- Clean spills of blood or body fluids with a disinfectant solution.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Guidelines for cleaning instruments and equipment}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Instrument & Cleaning Guidelines (after each use) \\
\hline Thermometers and stethoscopes & -Wipe with a disinfectant solution between each use, and particularly between use with different babies. \\
\hline Resuscitation bag and mask & \begin{tabular}{l}
-Wipe exposed surfaces with gauze pad soaked in disinfectant solution \\
-Wash the face mask with soap and water
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Oxygen head box & -Wash with soap and water \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{5.3 PEOPLE AS SOURCES OF INFECTION}
- Do not allow personnel with skin infections or lesions to come into direct contact with babies.
- Individuals handling the baby should observe hand hygiene
Note: Personnel can be infected by babies - rubella (women of child bearing age), CMV, hepatitis B

\section*{Clothing}
- Gowns hats and masks are not necessary when providing routine care for newborn babies.
- Personal clothing must not touch the baby. All sleeves must be above elbow
- White coats used in other parts of the hospital should be removed when entering a neonatal unit
- Can wear apron to prevent soiling

\section*{Gloves}
- Sterile as indicated by procedure
- Non sterile
- Heavy duty for cleaners and waste disposal
- Quality of gloves important
- Remember to change between patients
- Always decontaminate hands before and after use
- Some people have allergy to latex

\section*{ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE}

\section*{a. IV fluids \& investigations:}
- Minimise invasive procedures
- Adequate skin preparation when invasive procedure is
performed
- Sterile packs for IV insertion
- Pour antiseptic on the swabs rather than dip into the
container
- Clean the port with repeated use of the line
- Change sites $48-72 \mathrm{hrs}$
- Change infusion set after $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$ of use
- Remove line immediately after use
- Watch the site regularly during use and remove assoon as infection is detected
- Recommended antiseptics: tincture of iodine/
povidone iodine, 70-90\% alcohol
b. Respiratory therapy
- Aseptic technique during intubation, suctioning
- Disinfect all respiratory equipment
- Monitor colonisation by regular sputum cultures
c. Multiuse vials
- Use sterile needle \& syringe all the time
- Do not leave needle in the vial after use
- Storage according to manufacturer's direction
- Indicate date of opening
- Glass ampules - discard any left over

\subsection*{6.0 HAND HYGIENE}
Most effective and least expensive method of preventing infection but there is poor adherence/compliance. Adherence to hand washing practice is a requirement for all health care personnel. But the hospital must ensure adequate supply of what is needed to keep hands clean. Active surveillance is important. Help each other to practice good hand hygiene.

\section*{What do you use to wash/clean hands?}
Order from least to most effective:
- Plain soap and water. But must be done if hands are visible soiled
- Antiseptic soap and water
- Alcohol based hand rubs. Effectiveness in turn depends on:
- Type of alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl alcohol)
- Concentration
- Contact time
- Volume used
- Chlorhexidine alone or in combination with alcohol.

To wash hands (see hand hygiene)
- Thoroughly wet hands
- Wash hands (including wrists) for 10 to 15 seconds with plain or antiseptic soap and running water
- Allow hands to air-dry or dry them with a clean paper towel.
- Close tap with elbow or disposable paper towel after drying
To use alcohol-based hand rub:
- Apply enough hand rub to cover the entire surface of hands and fingers;
- Rub the solution into hands until they are dry. Dispenser system best if only one push is needed and the outlet must not be clogged.

Finger nails \& nail polish:
Avoid long nails or nail extensions
Nail polish must be freshly applied (not chapped as this harbours microbes)

Jewellery:
Rings high contamination some unit advise no rings at work
6.1 SKIN CARE

Vernix caseosa is antimicrobial - Do not wash it off.
Top tailing probably enough

Avoid damaging the skin eg use of excessive strapping.
Application of oil may help reduce infection
Allow baby to be colonised by maternal organisms by practicing Kangaroo care

\subsection*{6.2 CORD CARE}

Chorhexidine is the recommended antiseptic until the cord drops off

\subsection*{6.3 ISOLATION}

Isolate babies with respiratory, skin and diarrhoea diseases and necrotising enterocolitis

Cohorting - if there is an outbreak leave all exposed whether sick or not in one room and do not admitting new ones. When they are all discharged clean and fumigate before reusing the room. Preferably have a separate group of personnel who do not care for other infants to look after this group.

\subsection*{6.4 GOOD NUTRITION}

Ensure adequate nutrition in all babies irrespective of condition. Feeding reduces risk of infection and improves recovery from infection.
Do not forget the value of breastmilk. Keep in mind that formula is not sterile
All feeding utensils must be adequately sterilised

\subsection*{6.5 INFECTION SURVEILLANCES \& AUDITS}

Surveillance help to track changes in causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivity, detect epidemics
These should be ongoing all the time.
Regular discussions keep people up to date for all staff Take immediate action when you notice an outbreak

WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in health care 2009

\subsection*{7.0 CLINICAL AUDIT}
1. Clinical audit is aimed at self-improvement and is not about finding who to blame.
2. The aims are for hospitals to diagnose key problems in providing care it- is essential that identifying problems is linked to suggesting who needs to act, how and by when to implement solutions. Then follow up on whether progress is being achieved with new audits. Identify new problems and plan new actions etc.
3. Hospitals should have an audit team
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_cfde3c6d04d794060efdg-017.jpg?height=327&width=340&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=681)
comprising 4 to 8 members, led by a senior clinician and including nurses, admin, lab technicians and nutritionists etc. 1-2 people, usually MO or CO interns and nurses should be selected on a rotating basis to perform the audit and report back to the audit team and department staff.

Deaths and surviving cases can be audited Records of all deaths should be audited within 24 hours of death.
4. Use an audit tool to compare care given with recommendations in these guidelines (e.g. for TB, HIV/AIDS) and the most up to date reference materials for less common conditions.
5. Was care reasonable? Look for where improvements could be made in the system of care before the child comes to hospital (referral), on arrival in hospital (care in the OPD / MCH etc.), on admission to a ward, or follow up on the ward.
6. Look at assessments, diagnoses, investigations, treatments and whether what was planned was done and recorded. Check doses and whether drugs / fluids / feeds are correct and actually given and if clinical review and nursing observations were adequate - if it is not written down it was not done!
7. Look at several cases for each meeting and summarize the findings looking for the major things that are common and need improving. Then record the summaries and action points for reporting.

If chest compression is done then use a cycle of 1 breath per 3 cardiac compression

\subsection*{8.2 WHEN TO STOP RESUSCITATING}

Consider stopping if after 20-30 minutes of effective resuscitation the baby:
- Has no spontaneous respiration or has an occasional gasp
- Pupils are dilated and fixed
- Heart rate is slow or absent
- Colour is not improving with bagging

\section*{Explain to the mother that the baby has died}

POSTNATAL CARE - If resuscitation is successful see section Perinatal asphyxia

\subsection*{8.3 RESUSCITATION WITHIN NEWBORN UNIT}

Follow the same sequence as the newly born.

\subsection*{9.0 EXAMINATION OF THE NEWBORN AND GESTATIONAL ASSESSMENT}

\subsection*{1.1 HISTORY}

Take an adequate history covering antenatal, perinatal and postnatal periods depending on the age of the baby, family \& social history

\subsection*{9.2 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}

Minimise stress during the examination by avoidance of too much movement
Keep baby warm throughout the examination. Remember warm clean hands \& instruments
Take advantage of what the baby is doing eg look in the mouth if crying, observe limbs if there are spontaneous movements etc
Start with the lease stressful aspects and features that require a calm baby.
Note: this it can be combined with clinical gestational assessment

\section*{Immediate neonatal period assessment- aims to:}
- Establish that the baby is making appropriate transition to extrauterine life
- Detect congenital defects some of which need immediate/urgent care
- Establish baseline

\section*{The following order is suggested:}
1. Observation (without touching)
a. Colour: pink, pallor, cyanosis
b. Resting posture
c. Respiration (can include most signs of SilvermanAnderson Score if baby has respiratory distress)
d. Any spontaneous activity
e. Obvious malformations
2. Quiet examination (gentle touch minimal movement)
a. Circulation
b. Auscultation: Heart \& lungs
c. Palpation
I. Fontanelles \& sutures
ii. Abdomen
iii. Pulses
3. Head to toe
a. Colour-jaundice
b. Hydration status (if not newly born)
c. Nutrition status
d. Skin
e. Head \& face
f. Neck
g. Chest including breasts
h. Genitalia
I. Anus
j. Limbs - upper \& lower
k. Back
I. Neonatal reflexes \& head circumference

\subsection*{9.3 CLINICAL GESTATIONAL ASSESSMENT}

Do a Ballard score \& determine gestation; compare with maternal dates (see Appendix i)

At the end of the examination \& gestational assessment:
- Make a diagnosis including a differential
- Classify as appropriate (AGA) small (SGA), large (LGA) for gestational age \& specify if there is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (see Appendix ii \& iii)
Plan management

\subsection*{10.0 THERMOREGULATION}

\subsection*{10.1 INCUBATOR CARE}

Incubator is an apparatus used to maintain a neutral thermal environment for preterm/low birth weight and very sick babies The incubator temperature should maintain the baby's skin temperature at $36.0-36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or axillary/core temperature 36.5$37.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Indications for use:}
- Care of preterm/low birth weight babies,
- Hypothermic neonate
- Sick neonates requiring close observation.
- To transport babies from one place to another. Isolation of newborn babies from infection, unfavorable external environment and stimulation.

\section*{Types:}
1. Transport incubators: used to shift the newborn from one area/place
to another as needed. If not available other portable warm devices that use melted wax or other materials can be used.
2. Closed type most of these are double walled
3. Radiant warmers: (a) Resuscitaires (for short term use) or (b) intensive care type

Any of these incubators can be:
- Air mode: manually operated to maintain a constants air temperature

\section*{OR}
- Skin servocontrol where the probe is attached to the baby's skin Servocontrol is an electronic feedback system which functions as a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature at the site of a thermistor probe by regulating the heat output of an incubator or radiant warmer

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: A range is not given. For each temperature you can slightly go up or down according to the baby's response.

\section*{Procedure: Incubator}
- Warm the incubator according to baby's needs.
- Explain the needs of incubator care to the parents of neonate.
- Place baby in the incubator or on radiant warmer.
- Baby can be naked but preferably lightly covered.
- All procedures and care should be through the port holes
- Avoid opening the doors as much as possible.
- Record baby's and incubator temperature 3 hourly
- Adjust the incubation parameters according to baby's needs (see table)
- If baby is not maintaining normal body temperature adjust the incubator temperature accordingly and report to the doctor.
- Monitor malfunction. NO ALARM SHOULD BE IGNORED.

\section*{Procedure - Servocontrol: Incubator or radiant warmer}
- Place skin probe (see figure) secure firmly and protect the probe with a foil-backed shield
- Set baby's skin temperature at $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Read the skin temperature from the temperature gauge on the heater unit
- When the abdominal skin temperature reaches the chosen set point, check the axillary temperature.
- The probe must be in solid contact with the skin at all times
- Record incubator air temperatures at same time as infant skin and axillary temperatures
- NEVER PUT THE PROBE IN THE AXILLA, OR BACK OF BABY if baby is supine
Placement of temperature skin probe and leads

Skin probe placed on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and firmly secured.
Lead placement - 2 on upper chest near the clavicles, one on the lower left chest anterior axillary line.

If the baby cannot maintain body temperature:
- The environment is too cold or warm
- Baby is sick - usually sepsis
- The device is malfunctioning

\section*{WEANING BABIES OUT OF THE INCUBATOR}

While in incubator practice intermittent kangaroo care for all stable babies BUT preferably transfer to a kangaroo room

Babies that are stable, gaining weight and over 1500 g can be transferred to cot care

\section*{ROOM USED FOR INCUBATORS}
- Room temperature is constantly kept at $24-26^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (A wall thermometer installed to measure this)
- All windows should be closed to avoid draft
- If possible windows should be double walled to prevent heat loss to the outside

\section*{Cleaning and disinfection- (See section on infection control)}

Note:
1. Feed increase $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day help to reach full enteral volumes early
2. As babies lose weight in the first 7-14 days calculate intake using birth weight until current weight exceeds birth weight.
(see below section on monitoring)

\section*{When to start \& increment}

This depends on birth weight and whether the baby is well or sick.
For all babies: Aim to reach full enteral feed by 5-7 day. If not able to feed consider parenteral nutrition while offering trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeds).
11.1 NEWBORN $\geqslant 1.5 \mathrm{KG}$ :

Feeding / Fluid requirements
Well baby
Immediate milk feeding: If wt $1.5-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ begin with 7.5 mls , and if > 2 kg 10 mls . Increase by the same amount each feed until full daily volume reached
Sick baby
Day 1 - Sick baby start with 24 hrs IV 10\%D
From Day 2 start feeds: If wt $1.5-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ begin with 7.5 mls 3 hrly , and if $>2 \mathrm{~kg} 10 \mathrm{mls} 3 \mathrm{hrly}$. Increase feed by the same amount every day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume until IVF stopped
If too sick to tolerate the calculated enteral feed for the day, give trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeding) $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Drops of breastmilk into the mouth are better than nothing
11.2 NEWBORN < 1.5KG:

Feeding / Fluid requirements
Day 1 - start IV 10\%D for 24 hrs .
From Day 2 - start feeds with EBM at 5 mls , increase 3 hourly feed volumes by 5 mls each day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume. IVF stopped when full 3 hourly feed volume achieved appropriate for weight and postnatal age in days If too sick to tolerate the calculated enteral feeds for the day, give trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeding) $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Drops of breastmilk into the mouth are better than nothing.

\subsection*{11.3 WHAT MILK?}

Human milk recommended basis of nutrition for the all babies irrespective of birth weight.
If breastmilk is not available or contraindicated use preterm/standard formula. Do not exceed 180ml/kg/day when using formula.

Fortification of breastmilk may be necessary for:
- Infants born weighing less than 1.5 KG and not growing
- Infants less than 2 kg with growth failure
- LBW infants on fluid restriction

Start when baby is tolerating $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
If there is no fortifier available or fortifier is not tolerated - use hind milk. Larger volumes ( $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day) of EBM can also be used if the baby is able to tolerate it and is not on fluid restriction.

\section*{SUPPLEMENTS for all low birth weight}

Multivitamins: start when tolerating $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Vitamin D dose in these should be 400IU/day
Iron and folate: start 4 weeks after birth. Iron dose 2 mg elemental iron/kg/day
Note: these supplements should continue until baby is 12 months.

\subsection*{11.4 METHODS OF FEEDING}

Tube (nasogastric/orogastric): all <1500g or gestation < 32 weeks; any other baby too sick to suck irrespective of birth weight.
Cup \& breast: babies in kangaroo care and any other baby $>1500 \mathrm{~g}$ or >32 weeks gestation. In all babies initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible.

\subsection*{11.5 MONITORING FEEDS}

Daily: Record 24hr total intake and output
Do gastric aspirate 6 hourly for stable babies on tube feeding. Record volume and colour. (See table)

\section*{Feeding intolerance}

A gastric aspirate is significant if it is >50\% of the volume of feeds over the preceding three hours. This may be an early sign of illness (sepsis), electrolyte disturbance or complication of therapy (eg CPAP) or medication.

\section*{Clinical assessment}
- Abdominal examination - Distension or tenderness, bowel sounds increased or absent
- Gastric aspirate - increasing volume, or change in colour to green (bilious) or red (blood)
- Stool output - change in the frequency of stool output and presence of blood in stools
- Others - Increased episodes of apnoea and bradycardia, diminished oxygen saturation and lethargy
- Vomiting - single episode or recurrent
- Medications-methylxanthines (aminophylline, caffeine)

NB: In all cases exclude presence of intestinal obstruction or NEC

\section*{Handling the aspirates (See chart 11.6 Page 35)}

\section*{In all these circumstances}
- Check position of feeding tube
- Decrease feed to last tolerated volume rather than stop (See guideline for NEC \& intestinal obstruction)
- Investigate to establish the cause
- Do not give Histamine-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors
It is important to avoid withholding feeds for prolonged periods of time because lack of enteral feeding hastens the complications of parenteral nutrition and intestinal atrophy.

\subsection*{11.6 COLOUR OF GASTRIC ASPIRATE \& MANAGEMENT}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline APPEARANCE OF ASPIRATE & COLOUR & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{GUIDELINE} \\
\hline Milk or clear & $\square$ & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Milky with specks of brown sediment & ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_30_cfde3c6d04d794060efdg-035.jpg?height=152\&width=178\&top_left_y=390\&top_left_x=391) & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Milky with tinge of blood & & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Green & & Discard & Check position of tube. Exclude NEC or intestinal obstruction. \\
\hline Coffee ground & & Discard & Do not feed. Exclude NEC or bleeding disorder \\
\hline Frank blood & & Discard & Do not feed. Exclude NEC or bleeding disorder \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

If aspirated volume is larger than previous feed discard irrespective of colour and stop feeds \& investigate

\section*{Replacement of gastrointestinal losses}

Whatever is discarded needs to be added to IV fluids to prevent dehydration.
Measure losses every 6 hrs and replace in the next 6 hrs ml per ml using intravenous replacement fluid of Ringers lactate and if not available use $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride with 10 mmol potassium $/ 500 \mathrm{ml}$

\section*{Abdominal distension}
- Soft, non tender, bowel sounds present, normal colour passing stool - no consequence - continue feeding
- Persistent/increasing, tender/absent bowel sounds, not passing stool or blood in stool - investigate and treat
accordingly. Do not feed.

\section*{APNOEA:}
- Investigate and treat the cause
- One attack - continue feeding.
- Repeated attacks stop feeds for 6 hrs . If stable resume feeds at reduced feed volume or give smaller volume 1-2 hourly.
- If not tolerating enteral feeds give IV fluids

\subsection*{11.7 GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX}
(see also separate guideline below-11.9)
Common in preterm infants - recurrent vomiting

\section*{Management:}
- Put baby in left lying position after feeds
- Do not prop up
- Frequent Small volume feeds may help

\section*{Do not give Histamine-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors}

\section*{BIRTH ASPHYXIA}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Day 1 ( $\mathbf{1}^{\text {st }} \mathbf{2 4 h r s}$ ) & If very unstable start IV fluids at $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Pass a nasogastric tube and institute 3-6 hourly gastric aspiration. Monitor urine output as this will influence the volume of feeds to be given. \\
\hline Day 2 (24-48hrs) & Check bowel sounds if present and no gastric aspirate start enteral feeds and increase as tolerated according to baby's birth weight. If not able to tolerate calculated enteral feed for the day give trophic feeds. \\
\hline Day 3 (>48hrs) & Most babies will be ready to tolerate full enteral feeds \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Individualise according to severity.
Presence of convulsion or reduced consciousness is not a contraindication to enteral feeding

\section*{BABIES ON VENTILATORS}

Pass a nasogastric tube as soon as stabilized on the ventilator and do 3-6 hourly gastric aspiration. If no aspirate start trophic feeds preferably breastmilk. In all cases it recommended to
introduce minimal enteral feeds within 24-48hrs. If tolerating trophic feeds start increasing according to daily needs until full enteral feeds. If not able to tolerate enteral feed consider parenteral nutrition

\section*{MONITORING ALL BABIES}

Daily
- Assess hydration status
- Input/output

Growth
- Weight-3 times a week
- Head circumference and length weekly

\section*{GUIDE TO WEIGHT CHANGES IN THE FIRST 14 POSTNATAL DAYS}

\section*{$1^{\text {st }}$ week weight loss}

Term: $1-2 \%$ of birth weight per day, maximum 5-7\%. Regain birth weight by 7-10 days.
Preterm (LBW): weight loss $2-3 \%$ of birth weight per day, maximum 10-15\%. Regain birth weight by 10-14 days.

\section*{For all newborns: \\ First 7-14 days}
- Excess weight loss is most likely due to inadequate intake leading to dehydration.
- No weight loss or weight gain during this period indicates fluid retention

\section*{Thereafter signs that baby is receiving an adequate amount of milk}
- Baby is satisfied with the feed
- Weight loss is $<10 \%$ for term \& $<15 \%$ for preterm in the first week of life
- Weight gain term $20-30 \mathrm{~g} /$ day \& preterm $10-15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Baby passing adequate amount of urine
- Baby's stool is changing from dark to light brown or yellow by day 3

1. Wash hands
2. Measure from the nose to the tragus down to about 2 cm below the xiphoid.
3. Put an indelible mark to indicate the distance.
4. Gently insert the tube while watching for retching and respiration.
5. Confirm by either aspiration gastric content or auscultation as you push air into the stomach.
6. Secure the tube close to the nostril or angle of the mouth leaving the mark visible.
7. Teach the mother how to tube feed her baby- show her:
- The mark on the tube. She should make sure it is at the correct position before each feed.
- How to aspirate the stomach - and if any aspirate whether to return or discard (see enteral feeding guide)
- How feed by gravity
- How to record on the feeding chart

\section*{CAUTION: NEVER FORCE THE TUBE. FAILURE TO GO IN MAYBE DUE TO A CONGENITAL ANATOMICAL DEFECT THAT MUST BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE FEEDING}

\section*{General instructions:}
- Intravenous fluid volume should not exceed $150-160 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ unless there are continuing losses
- As babies lose weight in the first 7-14 days calculate intake using birth weight until current weight exceeds birth weight.
- In many instances IV fluids are combined with enteral feeds. As enteral feeds are tolerated the IV infusion is appropriately reduced.
- If you give adequate fluids, there is no need to add additional fluids for baby on phototherapy

\section*{Fluid restrictions}
- Congestive cardiac failure: Restrict to $100-120 / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{day}$. (See section on cardiac conditions)
- Renal impairment: according to degree of renal impairment (urine output) \& increase when diuresis occurs (See section on AKI)
- Babies with birth asphyxia Day 1: start with $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{day}$. Monitor renal function(urine output) closely and modify input accordingly

\subsection*{13.2 ELECTROLYTES PER DAY}

Sodium: $2-3 \mathrm{mmo} / \mathrm{kg}$ (VLBW may need up to $4-6 \mathrm{mmol}$ );
Potassium: $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$;
Chloride: $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$
Add to IV fluids from day 2 onwards

\section*{Calculation of infusate}
- Determine the total volume needed for the day
- Calculate electrolyte needs for the day \& subtract from total volume
- Give the remainder as glucose (see section glucose guide)
- If baby needs blood transfusion, count it as part of the total fluid intake. Do not give furosemide
- Calculate drip rate: wt x volume/kg = ml/minute
- Once you have the volume/minute calculate the number of drops per minute.
- Use a microsoluset (infusion giving set) which gives 60 drops/ml. or if available an infusion pump especially for very low or extremely low birth weight babies

\section*{Monitor the IV infusion very carefully:}
- Drip rate and volume infused every hour and record using a fluid chart
- Total intake 6 hrly to prevent over or under infusion
- Infusion site 3hrly to detect extravasation or infection
- Hydration status daily or more frequently if there are continuing losses
- Monitor input/output \& replace losses appropriately
- Weigh baby daily (best way of detecting over or under hydration)
- Introduce milk feeding by nasogastric/orogastric tube or breastfeeding as soon as it is safe to do so (see enteral feeding)
- Electrolytes daily until stabilised

\section*{Replacement of gastrointestinal losses (See chart Appendix vii)}
$\checkmark$ Whatever is discarded needs to be added to IV fluids to prevent dehydration
$\checkmark$ Measure losses every 6hrs and replace in the next 6hrs ml per ml using intravenous replacement fluid of or Ringer's lactate.

Calcium: $1.5-2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$; Phosphorus: $0.5- 1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Aim to provide:
- Amino acids from day 1
- Lipids by day 2
- Full nutritional requirements (Parenteral in addition to enteral)

\subsection*{14.3 FLUIDS USED TO CALCULATE INFUSATE}
- Glucose: 1g dextrose=3.4kcal. So 10\% dextrose provides $0.34 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{ml}$. (see section on Glucose Disorders)
- $10 \%$ lipid provides $0.9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{ml}$
- 20\% lipid provides 1.1kcal/kg (preferred for newborn)
- Protein: paediatric amino acid formulations ( $10 \%$ or $20 \%$ solution)
- Sodium: Normal saline provides $0.15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml} ; 3 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ provides $0.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml}$
- Potassium: $15 \%$ solution provides $2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml}$
- Calcium: $10 \%$ calcium gluconate
- Phosphorus: as potassium phosphate
- Paediatric parenteral multivitamins given to meet the
recommended daily requirements. If minimal feeds are tolerated vitamins can be given through enteral route

\subsection*{14.4 COMPOSITION OF INFUSATE}
(-) Calculate total fluid for 24 hrs
- Then calculate volumes of protein, lipids, and electrolytes (remember that some amino acid preparations contain electrolytes). Subtract this from the total fluid to get the volume of dextrose. Strength of dextrose is dictated by 1) total volume, 2) energy needs, 3) baby's blood glucose levels. (See section on glucose disorders)
- Calculate volume for each component as follows:

Amount of component = amount to be given / $\mathrm{kg} \times$ body weight in kg Strength of solution/ml

\section*{EXAMPLE}

TOTAL FLUID: ML/KG/DAY x WT IN KG
= $\qquad$ ml /24hrs
a. Amino acids: _g/kg/day $\times$ wt in kg = $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$ strength of solution
b. Lipids (fats): g/kg/day x wt in kg = $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$
Strength of solution (0.1 if 10\% or 0.2 if 20\%)
c. Sodium : $\quad \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} \times \mathrm{wt}^{\mathrm{in} \mathrm{kg} \times 6.6^{*} \quad=}$ $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$
*6.6 ml/kg of normal saline $=1 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{Na}$
d. Potassium: $\quad \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} \times 0.5^{*} \quad=$
= $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$ * 0.5 if using 15 KCl
e. Calcium gluconate ( $10 \%$ ) $8 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} \times \mathrm{wt}$ in kg
= $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$
SUB TOTAL $\quad a+b+c+d+e$
= $\qquad$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$

Dextrose Volume: TOTAL FLUID minus SUB TOTAL = $\qquad$ ml/24hrs

To provide a minimum of $4-6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ decide the strength of dextrose either 5\%, 10\% or more depending on baby's needs (See section on glucose guide)
Once you have the total volume calculate the flow rate for the lipids and the rest of the infusate.

NOTE: If baby needs blood transfusion count it as part of the total fluid volume

\subsection*{14.5 VASCULARACCESS}
- Umbilical artery or vein catheter (Confirm position by X-ray before use): use for not longer than 7 days
- Short peripheral vein catheter: use for short period \& dextrose not more than 12.5\%
- Central line catheter or peripherally inserted central venous catheter (Confirm position by X-ray before use): Can be used for longer than 7 days
Note: Lipids are not mixed with other infusates, i.e. given in a separate line

\subsection*{14.6 ENTERALFEEDS}

To prevent gut atrophy babies on parenteral nutrition should be given trophic (minimal enteral feeds) unless there is absolute contraindication eg NEC or gut atresia.

\section*{Weaning off parenteral nutrition}

When a baby is tolerating $30-50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day of enteral feed start reducing the parenteral nutrition. Once the baby tolerates full enteral feeds PN can be stopped

\subsection*{14.7 COMPLICATIONS}
1. Catheter related:
- Accidental displacement
- Occlusion
- Thrombosis \& thromboemblism
2. Infections

\subsection*{15.0 GLUCOSE DISORDERS}

\subsection*{15.1 BLOOD GLUCOSE}

Normal levels $2.2-5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
If baby is only on IV infusions maintain input by giving dextrose at a rate of $4-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$

\subsection*{15.2 HYPOGLYCAEMIA}

Definition: serum blood glucose $<2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
Serum glucose ranges in the first week of life, they dip in the first 24hours. Normal range is 2.6 to $7.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$. Blood level glucose (measured with reagent strips are approximately $0.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ lower than serum levers measured in the lab).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Asymptomatic: hypoglycaemia detected by screening infants at risk.
- Symptomatic: floppiness, lethargy, poor feeding, jitteriness, seizures, coma.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Prematurity
- Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
- Sick term neonate especially neonatal infections
- Birth asphyxia
- Infant of diabetic mother \& large for dates neonates
- Septicaemia
- Hypothermia
- Hypoxic ishaemic encephalopathy

\section*{Prevention}
- The best way to prevent and/or manage hypoglycaemia is by giving adequate enteral feeds
- To avoid rebound hypoglycaemia for all babies on IV dextrose reduce gradually as you increase enteral feeds

\section*{Management}

Screen at birth/admission then at $2,6,12 \& 24 \mathrm{hrs}$ thereafter 68 hrs depending on condition \& blood glucose levels.
Asymptomatic: Give feed $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ repeat blood glucose level after 1 hr . If still $<2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ start IV $10 \%$ dextrose as for the symptomatic. If $>2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ continue with feeds at $2-3 \mathrm{hrly}$ intervals.
Symptomatic: If glucose $<2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, give $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $10 \%$ dextrose over 5 minutes followed by continuous infusion 10\% dextrose at $6-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$. Check blood sugar after $30-60$ minutes. If blood sugar within normal range, monitor 6hrly.

Initiate feeds according to condition and weight.
Refractory hypoglycaemia / Persistent severe hypoglycaemia
Causes-hyperinsulinaemia:
- Idiopathic
- Asphyxia
- Beckwith-Weideman syndrome
- Nesiodioblastosis

Affected babies require higher concentration of dextrose (see table - Glucose Intake). Look for the cause and treat accordingly If hypoglycaemia unresponsive to maximum glucose infusion rates, IV glucagon can be used in consultation with an endocrinologist.

\subsection*{15.3 INFANT OF A DIABETIC MOTHER}

\section*{Neonatal metabolic complications include}
- Hypoglycaemia
- Hypocalcaemia
- Hypomagnesaemia
- Jaundice (See section 26)

Hypoglycaemia mostly within the first 24 \& occasionally up to 48 hrs
- Get baseline blood glucose level.
- Feed within 30-60 minutes of birth \& subsequently 2-3hrly
- Monitor blood glucose hourly for 4 hrs

NB: If blood glucose remains low treat as for symptomatic hypoglycaemia

\section*{1. Glucose intake}

Calculate total glucose intake by considering:
- Amount in IV fluid (see table) plus
- Enteral intake (breast milk \& formula: glucose $7 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$ )

If baby on IV 10\% dextrose change to 5\% dextrose.
- Monitor blood glucose 1-2hrly till stabilised then 6-8hrly
- Initiate enteral feeds as soon as possible, if tolerated gradually reduce IV infusion
- At all times make sure glucose intake does not exceed daily requirement.
- If glucose persistently $>10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ for 24 hrs consider insulin infusion.

\section*{2. Insulin}
- Before infusion prime the tubing with insulin for 20 minutes.
- Purge out then start the baby's infusion
- Start by giving 0.05 units $/ \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.
- Monitor blood sugar hourly till sugar level fall into normal range.
- Rate of fall should not exceed $3-4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{hr}$ and do not let blood glucose fall below $6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ while on insulin
- As the baby responds reduce insulin infusion by 0.01-0.02 units/hr
- Remember VLBW/ preterm infants are very sensitive to insulin Formula for calculation of glucose infusion

Commonest in the preterm /LBW <32week or <1500g

\section*{Diagnosis}

Clinical features:
Biochemical:
- Low serum phosphate $<1.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Alkaline phosphatise >800/900units/L
- Serum calcium usually normal
- Vitamin D3 levels normal or low
- Parathyroid hormone levels usually normal

Radiological: osteopaenia, widening of metaphyses, fractures.

\section*{Management}

\section*{Prevention:}

Early introduction as well as adequate enteral feeds and supplementation with breast milk fortifier. Daily supplementation vitamin D 400IU starting at 2weeks till age 12 months
In the absence of breastmilk fortification give phosphate $0.5 \mathrm{mmcl} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day and calcium $1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

\section*{Screen infants at risk of MBD}
- Infants <32weeks and/or <1500g and one of the following:
- >4weeks to attain full enteral feeds
- Infants on diuretics
- Post natal growth failure.

Monitor Ca, P \& ALP in all VLBW babies at 4 weeks and subsequently 2 weekly

\section*{Management MBD}
- Phosphorus 1 . $6-2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Calcium $2.2-2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Vitamin D 3000IU daily for 3 months or bolus 300,000IU orally/ IM.
Monitor Calcium, phosphate \& ALP every 2 weeks. When normal stop Ca \& P supplementation.
Note: too much calcium may lead to nephrocalcinosis

\subsection*{17.0 GASTROESOPHAGEALREFLUX DISEASE IN PRETERM}

Distinguishing reflux from normal regurgitation not easy as there are no specific tests to diagnose true reflux.

Suspect if:
- Recurrent vomiting
- Failure to thrive
- Development of complications - eg aspiration pneumonia

EXAMINE BABY CAREFULLY TO EXCLUDE UPPER GI OBSTRUCTION - HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS; DUODENAL OR JEJUNAL ATRESIA OR STENOSIS

\subsection*{11.1 MANAGEMENT}

Non pharmacological therapy is the treatment of choice.
What works:
- Place the baby on the left lateral side after feeds. Put a support at the back to prevent baby from rolling over.
- Prone position (however, not recommended outside hospital)

What does not work/not recommended:
- Propping up the baby
- Supine position
- Use of proton pump inhibitors (eg omeprazole), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (ranitidine) \& prokinetics (metoclopramide, erythromycin, and domperidone)

Early sepsis - mainly caused by pathogens that colonize birth canal, -Group B streptococcus, and gram negative enteric bacteria.
Late onset infections community acquired are predominantly gram positive or gram-negative bacteria.
Nosocomial infections (forms part of Late onset neonatal sepsis)A major cause of morbidity and mortality especially in NICU. Mainly caused by several microorganism (bacteria \& fungi) circulation in the newborn unit. These are commonly resistant to many antibiotics.
Other important bacterial pathogens include atypical bacteria especially Chlamydia trachomatis.

Viral causes of neonatal infections
1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquired prenatally or through breastfeeding
2. Others viruses include, Cytomegalovirus (CMV, Herpes simplex (HSV) Rubella, Varicella (VZV), Hepatitis B, Zika.

\subsection*{19.3 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS.}

The manifestation of neonatal septicaemia is subtle, vague and non -specific. The most common complaint concerning neonate's progress is 'failure to do well' or 'not looking right'
These signs and symptoms indicate the need for empiric antibiotics.

\section*{Systemic Signs}
- History of feeding difficulty
- History of convulsions
- Temperature =37.50C or <35.50C
- Fast breathing / respiratory rate $=60$ bpm
- Grunting

- Random blood sugar.
- Culture and sensitivity of: Blood, Urine, Pus swab etc
- Lumbar puncture and CSF Analysis for suspected meningitis.
- C- Reactive Protein (CRP) Levels $>5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is considered high. Increasing CRP levels over the next 6-8hrs is suggestive of sepsis. Therefore, repeat CRP levels should be done after 8hours.
- Procalcitonin levels. Levels $>2.4 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$. useful in late onset neonatal sepsis (after 7days)
- Imaging:
+ Chest radiography may be considered as in case of respiratory signs.

- Urea and Electrolytes

\subsection*{19.6 TREATMENT. \\ Supportive}
- Feeding - support breastfeeding where feasible (see section on feeding)
- IV fluids when feeding is not feasible, monitor input output charts
- Consider transfusion of blood or blood products where indicated.
- Oxygen therapy in case of respiratory compromise or as guided by pulse oximetry.

- Consider early transfer for NICU for the critically ill neonates requiring cardiopulmonary support.

\section*{Definitive treatment and duration}

Antibiotic prophylaxis: Babies with risk factors (see above) Benzyl penicillin and Gentamicin. Treatment should be given for 48 to 72 hours while awaiting investigations and may be stopped if the baby has remained entirely well during this period.
Severe sepsis or pneumonia: Penicillin and Gentamicin for 5-7 days depending on clinical response. If there is no response by 2-3 days repeat CRP and blood count and change to a cephalosporin or as guided by sensitivity pattern.

Neonatal meningitis should be treated for 14 days if due to gram positive bacteria and 21 days for gram negative meningitis preferably with ceftriaxone.

\subsection*{19.7 CONGENITALSYPHILIS}

Occurs when a baby is born to an infected mother especially if inadequately treated during pregnancy.
Some infants with congenital syphilis have features of sepsis in neonatal period plus generalized rash that involves palms and soles, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and limb pain/tenderness. Undetected infection may develop late features of congenital syphilis with long term developmental complications.
Investigations: VDRL \& confirmatory treponemal test, X-ray long bones, Bilirubin if needed, CSF- Serology
Treatment: Benzyl penicillin for 10 days. A single dose of I.M Benzathine penicillin should be given for asymptomatic neonates with normal blood tests. Ensure the infected mother is fully treated and her sexual contacts are traced and treated. (Refer to national STI treatment guidelines)

\subsection*{20.0 PERINATAL ASPHYXIA}

\subsection*{20.1 Definition}

A condition of prolonged impaired gas exchange usually during labour, but may also occur before or very rarely after delivery, leading to hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidemia and multisystem dysfunction in the baby. The immediate clinical manifestation at birth is the newborn's failure to initiate and sustain breathing

\subsection*{20.2 Broad Risk Factors}

- Kidneys: AKI with poor urine output
- Pulmonary: Respiratory distress due to meconium aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema or RDS
- Heart: Cardiac failure, Unstable blood pressure
- GI: Paralytic ileus with distension, Risk of NEC
- Hematologic: DIC, Thrombocytopenia
- Immunologic : Septicemia
- Metabolic : Hypoglycemia, Hypocalcaemia, Dilutional hyponatremia, Hyperkalaemia, Acidemia
- Liver: Bleeding tendencies, Jaundice

\subsection*{20.6 Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)}

\end{table}

\subsection*{20.8 MANAGEMENT}

Perform a full clinical evaluation at least once a day with regards to all organ function. Monitor especially first 3 days \& continue till normal or stablised
- Vital signs (3hrly)
- Blood glucose and maintain normal blood glucose levels
- Urine output (daily)
- Electrolytes(daily)
- Urea creatinine (start on day 3)
- CNS function Thomson score (daily) \& convulsions (frequently)
- Gastrointestinal function (6hrly)- gastric aspirates, passing stool and normal bowel sounds, signs of NEC
- Full blood count (as needed)
- CRP (as needed)
- Jaundice (daily)
- Coagulation screen (as needed)
- Arterial blood gas (as needed)
- Imaging
+ Echocardiography for persistent pulmonary hypertension
- Bedside cranial ultrasound (cUS) is useful in assessing focal brain injury in the first week of life. Assessment should be directed at the basal ganglia injury, presence of hemorrhage in or echogenic parenchyma, size of the lateral ventricles and flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.

GENERAL SUPPORTIVE CARE: (See appropriate sections for details)
Thermo-neutral environment according to gestation \& birth weight.
Aim at maintaining the baby's temperature at $37 \pm 0.5{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The term with HIE need cooling to minimize brain injury.

\section*{Respiratory support}

Aim at maintaining arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures within the normal range. Continuously monitor oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas as the need arises.
Administer oxygen plus mechanical ventilation as needed for:
- Respiratory distress with or without meconium aspiration
- Severe encephalopathy (Grade 3 HIE) need CPAP or mechanical ventilation
- Moderate encephalopathy (Grade 2)

\section*{Cardiovascular support}
- Aim at maintaining normal mean arterial pressure (MAP)
- Capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds may assist in estimating the adequacy of perfusion pressure, hypovolaemia orshock
- Treat hypvolaemia with infusion of $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ human albumin solution or blood
- Hypotension should be treated with infusion of dopamine at $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ until normal MAP is attained
- Screen and treat persistent pulmonary hypertension

\section*{Fluid and Electrolyte management}

Administer according to needs \& renal function

\section*{Renalfunction}
- Restrict fluid input to $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg} /$ day until urine flow is established
- Dialysis may be needed if AKI develops

\section*{Gastrointestinal function}

Feeding
- Delay enteral feeding as guided by bowels sounds (usually 2448 hrs in grade 3 HIE ). Use EBM as much as possible
- Give parenteral nutrition if not tolerating enteral feeds. Trophic feeds can be given if there are no signs of NEC

\section*{Blood glucose}

Maintain normal blood glucose levels preferably by enteral feeds or IV dextrose if needed

\section*{Haematology}
- Administer Vitamin K (1 mg IM) on admission
- Maintain normal hemoglobin
- Treat DIC with vitamin K 1 mg daily for 7 days, platelet transfusion if bleeding
Sepsis
Assume presence of sepsis until proven otherwise - treat

\section*{CNS function}
- Treat convulsions
- Therapeutic hypothermia as indicated
- Occupation therapy/physiotherapy: Refer \& Start therapy as soon as the baby has stabilised.

\section*{Enhancing Endogenous Protection (brain)}

This can be done by providing Therapeutic Hypothermia(TH) to babies with moderate or severe asphyxia within six hours of birth.

\section*{Requirements for TH}
- Gestation $\geq 36$ weeks
- Apgar score of $\leq 3$ at 5 minutes and need for resuscitation beyond 10 minutes after birth
- Acidosis with cord arterial blood pH of < 7.0 in the first hour of life (where available)
- Neurological signs - hypotonia, hypertonia, weak/absent suck, seizures, coma
- Age $\leq 6$ hours from birth
- Abnormal amplified EEG pattern (where available)
- Sarnat staging of moderate or severe asphyxia
- Ability to provide adequate supportive care and monitoring
- Absence of major congenital abnormalities

\section*{Modalities Used (Refer to the specific protocols on how to use each modality)}

The modalities found to provide adequate TH, in order of increasing cost, are:
- Phase Changing Material such as the MiraCradle
- CoolCap
- Tecotherm

\section*{Principles used in providing TH}
- Achieve rectal temperature of $33{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-34.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ within 3 to 4 hours
- Maintain rectal temperature steadily between $33{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $34.5{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
for 72 hours
- Rewarm the baby at a steady rate of $0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ per hour until a rectal temperature of $37 \pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is attained
- Monitor the baby closely until 80 hours
- Maintain adequate supportive care and close monitoring throughout the TH and continue intensive care after the TH

\section*{Monitoring Clinical Progression of Asphyxia}

Daily Thompson HIE Score is a useful tool for assessing the clinical progression of brain injury and adequacy of treatment. (See the Score Chart)

\section*{Supportive care}

Involve an occupational therapist as soon as the baby stabilise for feeding and motor function
Counsel parents: Start early and involve them in care as much as possible. Teach them how to recognize a convulsion. As the baby recovers plan for discharge and long term follow up according to complications
Planning for discharge
- Review ability to feed and advise accordingly
- Do a full neurological evaluation to plan for long term care
- Some may need to continue phenobarbitone

\subsection*{21.0 SEIZURES}

\section*{Diagnosis}

A high index of suspicion based on the history and being alert to any subtle repetitive movement, abnormal breathing or heartbeat. It may also be sudden unexplained brief repetitive drops in arterial oxygen saturation.

\section*{Investigations}
- Blood glucose
- Urea-Electrolytes
- Calcium, magnesium levels
- Full blood count, differential, platelets
- CRP
- Blood culture
- Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis
- Occasional ones: Brain scan, Metabolic screen, TORCHES screen and EEG

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Practice points}
- Treat the underlying cause!
- Poly pharmacy should be avoided if possible

If there are more than three episodes of seizure per hour or a single episode lasting for more than 5 minutes or seizure associated with prolonged low oxygen saturation, the baby should be treated.

Phenobarbitone: The first choice
- Loading dose of $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ can be IV given over $10-20$ minutes.
- Repeat at $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} 30$ minutes later if seizures continue.
- If seizures recur, repeat at $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (to a maximum of $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ within 24 hrs ), followed by a daily maintenance dose of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day as a single dose.

Phenytoin sodium: If seizure persist give
Dose $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading IV over 20 minutes.
Maintenance dose of $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day as a single dose
Other secondary drugs
Lorazepam (If phenobarbitone or phenytoin do not stop the seizure)
- As a bolus dose of $0.05-0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV in persistent seizures
- Causes deep sedation and secretions

Initial Management of Some Acute Electrolyte Derangements
(See specific sections)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Hypoglycemia & $2-3 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV of $10 \%$ Dextrose \\
\hline Hypocalcaemia & $10 \%$ Calcium gluconate $100-200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{IV}$ slowly \\
\hline Hyponatremia & \begin{tabular}{l}
$3 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ at $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ as IV infusion over 15 to 30 minutes (See \\
section fluid \& electrolytes)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Hypomagnesaemia & $12.5 \%$ magnesium sulphate $(125 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}) 50-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{iv}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Supportive Care
- Monitor the frequency of convulsions and neurological status.
- Observe respiration.
- Refer to the relevant sections for: Oxygen administration, Nutrition, Fluid and electrolyte maintenance, Environmental temperature (especially in asphyxia \& preterm)

\section*{Weaning off anticonvulsants}

If multiple drugs have been used phenobarbitone is the last one to be weaned off. Guided by neurological status and presence or absence of seizures. If neurologically normal stop all before discharge.

Plan for long term follow up depending on condition and associated problems.

\subsection*{22.0 ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY}

Definition: Acute kidney injury is defined as rapid decline in kidney function resultingin abrupt increase in serum creatinine or an abrupt decrease in urine output. Creatinine rises to greater than $25 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ or $50 \%$ increase from previous lowest, or absolute creatinine $>100 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ or urine output of $>1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.

e. Abdominal ultrasound kidney, ureters, bladder (KUB) to rule out obstructive uropathy

\subsection*{22.5 MANAGEMENT}
- The main aim in managing AKI is to maintain homeostasis while awaiting improvement in renal function, either spontaneously or while the underlying cause is being treated.
- Because of the availability and efficiency of dialysis, patients with AKI often succumb not due to AKI, but to other comorbidities.

\section*{1. Maintain adequate renal perfusion}
a. Unless contraindicated due to fluid overload or cardiac failure a baby with clinical evidence of hypovolemia and oliguria administer intravenous fluid challenge $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of crystalloid solution such as normal saline over 20 to 30 minutes. This can be repeated up to three times if the baby is still hypovolemic.
b. Restoration of adequate urine flow and improvement in renal function with fluid resuscitation is consistent with pre-renal disease.
c. If oliguria persists despite adequate correction of pre-renal factors, give:
- Intravenous furosemide $2-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose or infusion furosemide $0.1-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.
- If no response consider dialysis

\section*{2. Prevent fluid overload}
a. Fluid volume should be restricted to insensible water loss(IWL) calculated at $400 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m} 2$ per day or $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$, in addition to replacing urine, gastrointestinal and other losses. Use 5 or $10 \%$ dextrose for IWL and $5{ }^{\text {th }}$ normal saline for urine. Ensure adequate hydration.
b. Do a daily weight
3. Maintain normal electrolytes and acid-base status
- Hyperkalemia: (See section on fluid \& electrolytes)
- Sodium supplementation if there is renal salt wasting
- Correct severe metabolic acidosis where serum bicarbonate $<15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or pH $<7.2$ : (See Acid base balance)
- Hyperphosphatemia: restrict intake by using breastmilk and calcium-based phosphate binders. eg calcium carbonate
4. Ensure adequate nutrition
5. Dosage adjustment of medications
6. Avoid further nephrotoxic insults

\section*{Acute Renal Replacement Therapy (Refer baby to next level if not able to perform)}

\section*{1.indications}
a. Traditional indications:
- Severe hyperkalemia unresponsive to conservative therapy
- Uncontrolled acidosis that cannot be safely corrected because of sodium or volume overload
- Severe volume overload with uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary edema or cardiac failure
- Progressive uremia with deterioration in the general condition
- Hypercatabolic states with increase in blood urea by $>10$ mmol/L per day
a. Early institution of dialysis in the critically ill baby with AKI in order to maintain homeostasis and create enough volume space so that the nutritional and therapeutic needs may be met, as severe fluid restriction results in:
- Inadequate nutrition
- Propensity to hypoglycemia
- Insufficient volume space for blood products
- Difficulty in drug delivery, such as inotopic support and antibiotic infusions

\section*{Acute Peritoneal dialysis:}

This is the preferred form of renal replacement therapy in neonates due to ease of initiation and not needing very elaborate equipment and expertise as is required with haemodialysis.
Most hospitals can be able to initiate acute peritoneal dialysis and babies should be referred earlier to a centre which can if there is no capability.
Requirements for acute peritoneal dialysis:
- Catheter: A peritoneal catheter should be placed into the abdomen either by a surgeon or by the clinician by Seldinger technique.
- Catheters used include:
- Acute PD catheters like Cook catheters FR 8 placed by Seldinger Technique
- Tenckhoff Catheter ( paediatric size) placed surgically
o Haemodialyis catheters or central lines placed intraperitoneal gives options for improvisation
- If none of the above found any catheter with multiple holes can be placed
- Fluids: Peritoneal dialysis fluids used can be:
+ Commercially prepared PD fluids which come in
strengths of 1.5\%,2.5\% and 4.25\%
+ If not available, you can use Hartman's Solution and 50\% dextrose ( adding 15 ml of 50\% dextrose 500 ml of Hartman's solution gives 1.5\% solution)
+ Process: the process of acute peritoneal dialysis involves inflow of the peritoneal dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity, dwelling in the cavity to allow exchange and then outflow into a drainage bag.
- Prescription:
+ Fill volume: volume to be infused: start with $15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$
+ Inflow: usually about 10 minutes
+ Dwell time: start with 30 minutes
+ Outflow: time allowed to flow out: about 20 minutes
It is important to monitor renal function daily during dialysis. Once the indication for dialysis is achieved dialysis should be stopped. It is important to seek expert advise during the process of dialysis.

Follow up: arrange long term follow up for all babies

\subsection*{23.0 RESPIRATORY DISTRESS}

Definition: Tachypnoea >60 breaths/min, grunting, chest retraction with or without cyanosis

\section*{Causes of respiratory distress}

\section*{1. Pulmonary}
- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (surfactant deficiency)
- Pneumonia
- Aspiration syndromes (meconium, feeds)
- Pulmonary haemorrhage,

\section*{2. Airway}
- Laryngomalacia,
- Choanal atresia.
- Micrognathia

\section*{3. CNS}
- Seizures,
- Birth asphyxia,
- Intracranial haemorrhage

\section*{4. Metabolic:}
- Hypoglycaemia,
- Electrolyte derangements
- Temperature instability
5. Congenital heart diseases especially those with cardiac failure

\subsection*{23.1 MANAGEMENT}

Take history \& do thorough examination to identify the cause of distress
Assess the severity of the distress using the SilvermanAnderson score
Investigations:

\section*{For all babies}
- Chest X-ray
- Full blood count including a manual PBF
- CRP
- Blood gas analysis
- Blood sugar

Specific investigation according to suspected cause

\subsection*{23.2 SPECIFIC TREATMENT}

\section*{Treat the underlying cause}

Start antibiotics
Start IV fluids

\subsection*{23.4 Silverman Anderson Score and its interpretation}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{Interpretation}

Score 1-3 = Mild respiratory distress - $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by nasal prongs
Score 4-6 = Moderate respiratory distress - CPAP
Score>6 = Impending respiratory failure -mechanical ventilation
NB. This scoring has to be modified/interpreted with caution once the baby is on CPAP as the grunting and the nasal flaring are abolished.

\subsection*{23.5 MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Mild breathing difficulty (Score 1-3)}
- Monitor for respiratory distress using the SilvermanAnderson score
- Monitor oxygen saturation.
- Give expressed breast milk by gastric tube as soon as possible
- When oxygen is no longer needed, allow the baby to begin breastfeeding. If the baby cannot be breastfed, continue giving expressed breast milk by tube or cup
- If the breathing difficulty worsens at any time during the observation period: treat for moderate breathing difficulty or severe.
- Most babies with mild and transient respiratory distress do not need antibiotics.
- But, if there are risk factors, start antibiotics after taking a sepsis screen. Review after 48-72 hrs: if respiratory distress has settled-STOP ANTIBIOTICS

\section*{Moderate to Severe breathing difficulty (Score 4-6)}
(see Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) chart next page)

\section*{Con nuous Posi ve Airway Pressure (CPAP)}
(For maximum benefit start as soon as symptoms are identified)

\section*{SURFACTANT THERAPY}

As a general principle initially provide nCPAP to all patients with RDS. Intubate and administer surfactant to those with persistent severe respiratory distress (defined as requiring a fraction of inspired oxygen $\left[\mathrm{FiO}_{2}\right]$ of 0.40 or higher to maintain oxygen saturation above $90 \%$ ) or who are apneic.

\section*{INDICATIONS}

Prophylactic surfactant therapy (within 2 hr . of birth)
- Gestation <28 weeks/birth weight <1250gm

Early rescue treatment (within 12 hrs of birth)
- All other babies with evidence of RDS who require CPAP or ventilation and needing $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}>0.4$
Other babies that can be considered for surfactant therapy (after senior discussion)
- Ventilated babies with meconium aspiration syndrome who require $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}>0.5$
- Term babies with pneumonia and stiff lungs
- Sepsis with hypoxic failure

\section*{PROCEDURE}

\section*{Prepare}
- Sterile gloves
- End open hole tube size 5F (can use nasogastric tube)
- Prepare surfactant according to manufacturer's instruction
- Calculate dose of surfactant required
- Draw up required dose and warm to room temperature.
- Remaining surfactant should be placed back in the fridge to be used for next dose.

\section*{Intubate baby and:}
- Ensure correct endotracheal tube (ETT) position
- Check ETT length at lips/nose
- Listen for bilateral air entry and look for chest movement

\section*{Instillation}
- With baby supine, instill prescribed dose down tracheal tube in 2 to 4 boluses
- Wait for recovery of air entry/chest movement and oxygenation between boluses

\section*{Post-instillation care}
- Do not suction ETT for 8 hr .
- Adjust ventilator/oxygen settings in response to
changes in chest movement, tidal volume and oxygen saturation
Do a blood gas within 30 min
Additional information
- Non-intubated babies can be given surfactant while on CPAP
- Use the same dose \& size tube
- If needed 4 repeat doses of surfactant can be give at 12 hrly intervals within the $1^{\text {st }} 48 \mathrm{hrs}$

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Physiologic:}
- Apnea
- Mucus plugs
- Barotrauma resulting from increase in lung compliance following surfactant replacement and failure to change ventilator settings accordingly

\section*{Procedural:}
- Plugging of ETT by surfactant
- Hemoglobin desaturation and increased need for supplemental oxygen
- Bradycardia due to hypoxia
- Tachycardia due to agitation with reflux of surfactant into the ETT
- Pharyngeal deposition of surfactant
- Administration of surfactant to only one lung
- Administration of suboptimal dose secondary to miscalculation

\section*{ADDITIONAL CARE (for babies on CPAP)}

Insert an orogastric tube for stomach decompression and feeding. (Leave the tube open to allow gas to escape)
- After taking a sepsis screen including blood culture start antibiotics.

\section*{- Initiate enteral feeding by day 2-3:}
+ Give expressed breast milk by orogastric tube
+ If baby not tolerating full feed give trophic feeds
+ When oxygen is no longer needed, allow the baby to begin breastfeeding.
+ If the baby cannot breastfed, give expressed breast milk using a cup or tube

Observation \& / Documentation:

\section*{Weaning baby from CPAP}

As the score reduces/baby improves gradually reduce $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}$ by 5\%.
When $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}$ is $<30 \%$ discontinue CPAP to nasal prongs.
Continue monitoring RDS Score to ensure baby does not require re-introduction of CPAP
Continue monitoring $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturations till baby no longer needs $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

Confirm position by X-ray as soon as possible: Position $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ above carina/T2
Monitoring Ventilation
- Colour
- Capillary refill time (hydration status)
- Breath sounds
- Chest movement / tidal volume $4-6 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg}$
- Transcutaneous monitors $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- Oxygen Saturations
- Arterial blood gas analysis

Minimise movement to avoid displacement of the tube

\section*{Sudden deterioration of an intubated baby (DOPES)}
- Displacement of the tube
- Obstruction of ET tube
- Pneumothorax
- Equipment failure
- Stomach distension

Identify and rectify the problem urgently

\section*{Targets for ventilation}
- pH >7.25
- $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2} 5-7.5 \mathrm{kPa}(40-50 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- $\mathrm{Pa} \mathrm{O}_{2} 6-10 \mathrm{kPa}(40-80 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- Saturations 90\%-95\%

\section*{Failure to respond to ventilator manipulation may be due to:}
- Mechanical problems - check for leaks, blocked tube
- Metabolic disorders - glucose, uncorrected acid/base balance, electrolytes
- Blood pressure hypo or hypertension
- Low Hb
- Cardiac complications - PDA, persistent pulmonary hypertension
- Lung complications - oedema, haemorrhage, BPD
- Intracranial bleeds
- Sepsis

\section*{Weaning from ventilation - one ventilator setting at a time}

When stable for 24 hours:
- Start with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ decrease by $5-10 \%$ to levels < $40 \%$
- Then reduce PIP by $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ to a level of $8-10 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
- Then reduce respiratory rate by $1-5$ breaths/min till rate is 15-20breaths/min
- Frequent BGAs (every 6 hours) Maintain $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ \& $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ \& saturations within targets for ventilation
- Extubate when above levels attained and the blood gas done 2-4 hours later remains acceptable. Repeat a blood gas 4 hours after extubation (earlier if baby shows signs of deterioration).

\section*{EXTUBATION}

\section*{Preferably extubate onto CPAP}
- $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}<40 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$
- Stop feeds for 4 hours or empty stomach with NG tube
- No feed for 4 to 6 hours post extubation
- Load with caffeine citrate (or use aminophylline if caffeine is
not available) to reduce apnoea at least 4 hours prior to extubation.
- After 2 failed trials of extubation give dexamethasone 48 hours before and 24 hours after $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bd to reduce inflammation. Dexamethasone is also indicated for extubation of baby who has been intubated for > 5 days to reduce risk of failure ( 3 doses given 8 hrly at $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and extubate immediately after last dose).

\section*{Additional Care}
1. Maintain baby's $\mathrm{Hb} \geq 13 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
2. Chest Physiotherapy
a. This is NEVER routine
b. Keep baby's head steady during procedure (especially preterm babies)
c. Watch out for hypoxia during procedure (keep an eye on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation)
3. Suctioning

CAUTION: Saline \& suction removes surfactant. Saline drowns the baby. Every time suction is done there is decrease in alveolar recruitment SO SUCTION ONLY IF:
a. There is evidence of secretions
b. Alteration of vital signs suggesting a blockage
c. Alteration in saturation
d. Watch out for hypoxia during procedure (keep an eye on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation)
4. Feeding and fluid balance (Enteral feeding, fluids \& electrolytes, parenteral nutrition according to condition)
a. Pass orogastric/nasogastric tube
b. As soon as baby is settled on ventilator initiate trophic feeds (preferably EBM) and gradually increase as tolerated
5. Do a full clinical examination at least once a day or at any time when condition changes - paying attention to:
- Presence of pallor \& jaundice
- CNS function
- Hydration status
- Cardiac function
- Renal function
- GIT function
- Fluid \& electrolyte balance

\section*{FOLLOW UP}

Do eye check at 6 weeks for all preterm <34 weeks. Borderline preterm infants who have hard a stormy neonatal period especially with sepsis, PDA, and prolonged oxygen need may also require evaluation for ROP.

\subsection*{22.0 NEONATAL APNOEA}

\section*{Definition}

Apnea is a cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds.

\section*{Etiology /Risk factors}
- Intraventricular hemorrhage, drugs seizures, asphyxia
- Prematurity
- Sepsis and meningitis
- Hypotension and hypertension
- Hypoxaemia
- Anaemia
- Metabolic disorders-hypoglycaemia
- Unstable thermal environment (especially warming)
- Antepartum administration of magnesium sulfate or opiates to the mother
- Administration of opiates or general anesthesia to the infant
- Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
- Congenital anomalies of the upper airway

\section*{Clinical presentation}
- Cessation of breathing
- Cyanosis
- Bradycardia

\section*{Investigation}
- Complete blood count
- Blood culture
- Blood glucose
- Blood gas
- Electrolytes-K, Cl, Na ,Ca

\section*{Preventing apnoea of prematurity (All preterm <34 weeks gestation)}
- Monitor Preterm babies by pulse oximetry to detect apnoea and bradycardia
- Give preferably caffeine citrate per oral $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose followed 12 to 24 hours later with $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily maintenance dose.
- When caffeine is not available use aminophylline $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose per rectal or IV then continue with $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ 12 hourly maintenance IV or per rectal
- USE EARLY CPAP in preterm babies with repeated apnoeas bradycardcardia, and respiratory distress
- Environmental temperature control
- Maintain nasal patency
- Maintain head and neck in neutral position

\section*{Treatment}
- Stimulation
- Bag and mask ventilation (if apnoea not responding to stimulation)
- Administer oxygen (by nasal prongs, CPAP or high flow oxygen) as needed.
- If no response may need ventilation
- Slow IV caffeine citrate loading dose. If caffeine not available use IV or per rectal aminophylline (only in preterm)
- Correct the underlying disorder.

\section*{Monitoring after resuscitation}
- Heart Rate
- Respiratory rate
- Oxygen saturation

Initially every 15 minutes for the first hour. If stable, monitor every 30 minutes during the second hour and as the baby improves continue with routine monitoring.

\section*{Feeding enteral}
- One attack - continue feeding.
- Repeated attacks stop feeds for 6hrs. If stable resume feeds at reduced feed volume or give smaller volume 12 hourly.
- If not tolerating enteral feeds give IV fluids

\section*{Definitions:}

Acidaemia - An arterial pH below the normal range (less than 7.36).
Alkalaemia - An arterial pH above the normal range (greater than 7.44).
Acidosis: A process that tends to lower the extracellular fluid pH due to a fall in the serum bicarbonate or an elevation in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ Thus:
- Respiratory acidosis: $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}>6 \mathrm{kPa}$ ( $>45 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )
o Metabolic acidosis: $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}<22 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
Alkalosis: A process that tends to raise the extracellular fluid pH due to either an elevation in the serum $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ concentration and/or a fall in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. Thus:
- Metabolic alkalosis: $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}>26 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
o Respiratory alkalosis: $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}<4.7(<35 \mathrm{mmHg})$

\section*{CAUSES}

Respiratory acidosis (hypoventilation) due to:
- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
- Pneumonia with respiratory failure
- Central respiratory drive depression eg, drug induced

Respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) due to:
- Over ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients
- Cardiac anomalies causing hyperventilation
- Drug induced increase in respiratory drive

Metabolic acidosis - Altered tissue metabolism, gut disorders, and/or renal function divided into:
Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis:
- Diarrhoea,
- Post surgery NEC,
- Hypokalaemia,
- Hypoalbuminaemia

Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis
- Tissue hypoxia due to
a. Hypovolaemia - shock
b. Cardiac disease
c. Severe anaemia
- Altered metabolism in sepsis, starvation

Metabolic alkalosis due to:
- Loss of acid through vomiting in upper GI obstruction (eg pyloric stenosis) or prolonged gastric suction
- Renal loss through drugs use (diuretics, digitalis, corticosteroids)

Simple acid-base disorder - The presence of one of the above disorders with the appropriate respiratory or renal compensation for that disorder.

Mixed acid-base disorder - The simultaneous presence of more than one acid-base disorder

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
- Blood gas analysis (preferably arterial)
- Electrolytes: $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(use for anion gap calculation)
- Haemoglobin
- Blood glucose

\section*{Steps in Diagnosis of Acid -Base disorders}

Step 1: Establish the primary acid-base disorder (investigation)
Step 2: Assess the degree of compensation as defined above for the individual disorders.
Step 3: Determine whether or not the anion gap is elevated.

\section*{Step 4: Establish the cause through careful history \& examination}

\section*{PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

Appears after 48 hours of birth and resolves in 7-10 days or a little longer in the pre-term.
Baby looks and feeds well.
Management: Counsel mother to continue feeding.
Review after 3 days. Counsel mother to return earlier if jaundice deepens or development of danger signs

\section*{PHOTOTHERAPY}

Phototherapy according to age, gestation/weight and severity of jaundice (See table above \& chart in Appendix v)

\section*{Phototherapy and supportive care - checklist}
1. Shield the eyes with eye patches - Remove periodically such as during feeds. Check for eye discharge
2. Keep the baby naked but ensure neutral thermal environment
3. Place the baby close to the light source $30-45 \mathrm{~cm}$ distance the closer the better provided the baby is not overheating especially if rapid effect is needed.
4. Promote frequent breast feeding. Give IV fluids if not able to feed. Unless dehydrated, supplements or intravenous fluids are unnecessary. Phototherapy use can be interrupted for feeds; allow maternal bonding.
5. Periodically change position supine to prone - Expose the maximum surface area of baby to phototherapy; reposition after each feed.
6. Monitor
a. Temperature every 3 hrs
b. Vital signs 3hrly
c. Hydration status (Capillary refill time) 3hrly and weight every 24 hrs .
d. Feeding/fluid intake 6hrly(Input/output)
e. Pallor
7. Periodic (12 to $\mathbf{2 4}$ hrs) plasma/serum bilirubin test. Visual testing for jaundice or transcutaneous bilirubin is unreliable. If rising /no response to phototherapy consider exchange transfusion
8. Monitor for signs of bilirubin encephalopathy - if present plan for exchange transfusion
9. Cover lipid lines with light resistant, reflective tape to avoid peroxidation.
10. Make sure that each light source is working and emitting light. Fluorescent tube lights should be replaced
if:
a. More than 6 months in use (or usage time $>2000 \mathrm{hrs}$ )
b. Tube ends have blackened
c. Lights flicker
d. According to manufacturer's specifications

Potential complications
- Overheating-monitor neonate's temperature
- Water loss from increased loss through skin and diarrhoea
- Rash
- Retinal damage if eyes not covered
- 'Bronzing' of neonates with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia Family Centred Care
Explain to parents the need for:
- Phototherapy and how it works
- Adequate skin exposure to the phototherapy light and hence the need for baby to be nursed naked but in a neutral thermal environment.
- Protective eye coverings during phototherapy.

\section*{EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}

Highly sensitised Rh negative mothers should be delivered where there are facilities for exchange blood transfusion.

Rh negative mothers: Indications for immediate exchange blood transfusion (i.e. soon after birth)
- Cord blood Hb below $11 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{mls}$
- Cord blood bilirubin levels above $70 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Signs of congestive cardiac failure

Indications at other times (see graph in Appendix vi)
- Rate of rise of serum bilirubin and non/poor response to phototherapy
- Signs of bilirubin encephalopathy
- Additional risk factors

Type of blood used in exchange blood transfusion
- If Rh incompatibility use Rh negative but ABO compatible with baby
- If ABO incompatibility use Group O but Rh compatible with baby
- Whole blood or plasma reduced (PCV 50-60\%) especially with severe anaemia.
- Blood preferably<7 days
- Blood used must be cross matched with mother \& baby

Note:
- Plasma reduced is not the same as packed cells. Use of whole
blood (PCV 35-45\%) may result in $\mathrm{Hb}<12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ post exchange.
- Do not use blood from biological parents

\section*{Total volume twice baby's blood volume ie 85ml x $2 \times$ wt in kg}

\section*{Procedure for exchange transfusion}

Counsel mother and get signed consent for the procedure
Explain why the procedure is necessary, possible side effects and how they are minimised

\section*{This is a sterile procedure done in the newborn unit. \\ Preparation:}

All equipment must be sterile as in a theatre operation
- Sterile gown \& gloves for the person to carry out the procedure,
- Sterile drape with opening in middle for covering the baby during the procedure but exposing the umbilical area
- Sterile exchange transfusion pack containing: Scissors, artery forceps, cotton wool \& gauze, umbilical vein probe, scalpel, galipot, urine collection bag
- Umbilical venous catheter
- Sterile syringes sizes $5 \mathrm{ml}, 10 \mathrm{ml} \& 20 \mathrm{ml}$
- 3 way stopcock
- Surgical ligature \& needle
- Tubing to connect to waste blood to urine bag
- Blood giving set
- Specimentubes

\section*{Resuscitation equipment}

Means of immobilising the baby (usually shaped as cross)
Get the blood from the blood bank and check the blood as per blood transfusion procedure
Let the blood stand in room temperature for at least 1 hr before the procedure or use a blood warmer if available.
Do not feed for at least 3 hrs before - if not them pass a tube and empty the stomach

\section*{Procedure}

2 health care workers:
- A doctor to do the procedure
- A nurse to monitor the baby as well as calming the baby with glucose on a cotton swab as needed

\section*{Nurse:}
- Immobilise the baby
- Attach a monitor for respiration, heart rate and saturation
- Monitor baby \& baseline record findings before exchange transfusion
- Continue \& record findings every 15 minutes
- Record volume of blood in \& out during the procedure. Record total in \& out at end
Doctor:
- Put on mask \& scrub as for theatre and wear the sterile gown \& gloves
- Clean the entire abdomen \& umbilical cord
- Measure umbilical catheter from the cord stump to the xiphisternum plus length of cord stump
- Cover the abdomen exposing the umbilical area
- Put in an umbilical stitch loosely about $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ from umbilicus before cutting off the exposed part of the cord
- Connect the 3 way tap to catheter and syringe, Flush the catheter with normal saline then connect to blood \& outflow tubing. Ensure tight fit to avoid air in the system
- Identify umbilical vein \& use probe to open it up if needed
- Insert the catheter to measured length and gently aspirate blood into the catheter and tighten the ligature
- Slowly draw blood from the baby using aliquots of 5,10 , or 20 ml depending on the size of the baby (see aliquots below)discard - draw for blood to be used and slowly push into the baby.
- Repeat the process until the calculated amount is finished.
- Remove the catheter if not using it for fluid therapy

Caution:
To avoid fluctuations in blood pressure, the procedure should be performed slowly to last 1-2 hours
Stop exchange transfusion baby's condition suddenly deteriorates. Identify probable cause and correct as needed

\section*{Aliquots usually tolerated for exchange transfusion:}
- Less than $1500 \mathrm{~g}-5 \mathrm{ml}$
- $1500 \mathrm{~g}-2500 \mathrm{~g}-10 \mathrm{ml}$
- $2500 \mathrm{~g}-3500 \mathrm{~g}-15 \mathrm{ml}$
- Greater than $3500 \mathrm{~g}-20 \mathrm{ml}$

Note: The initial and final aliquots are sent to laboratory for: Hb , bilirubin, serum calcium and culture

\section*{Post exchange transfusion care:}
- Return baby to phototherapy immediately
- Nil by mouth for 3 hours. Thereafter enteral feed if condition
allows
- Give IV fluids
- Monitor
- Vital sign half hourly for 6 hrs if normal then observe as usual procedure
- Blood glucose hourly for 6hrs \& manage according to findings
- Bleed from umbilical stump
- Bilirubin levels at 12 hrs then 24 hrly

\section*{FOLLOW UP}

All babies with pathological jaundice should be followed up to detect and manage long term complications

\section*{PROLONGED NEONATAL JAUNDICE}

Definition: Neonatal jaundice persisting beyond 2 weeks

\section*{Common causes}
- Intra-uterine infection
- Congenital hypothyroidism
- Biliary tract disorders
- Neonatal hepatitis

Aim to diagnose causes of liver dysfunction that will benefit from early diagnosis \& treatment and thus prevent complications:
- Surgery for extra hepatic biliary atresia must be done before 6 weeks of age
- Treatment for hypothyroidism must start as early as possible

\section*{Initial Investigations for prolonged neonatal jaundice}
- Bilirubin total \& direct ( if direct is >20\% of total bilirubin is diagnostic of cholestasis)
- Transaminases (ALT \& AST), gamma GT (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase
- Prothrombin time/INR
- Albumin
- Thyroid function T4 \& TSH
- Abdominal ultrasound (after a 4hr fast)
- Congenital infections screen if clinical suspicion high.

\section*{LIVER FUNCTION TESTS \& INTERPRETATION}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline TEST & Normal & INTERPRETATION \\
\hline Alanine aminotransferase (ALT0 & 5-44 U/L & Raised in acute liver cell injury. Liver specific \& highly sensitive index \\
\hline Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) & $35-140 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$ & Raised in acute liver cell injury but not as specific as AST \\
\hline Gamma glutamyl transpepidase (GGT) & Cord blood 37-196U/L 0-1mo 13-147U/L & Raised in obstruction or hepatic inflammation \\
\hline Alkaline phosphatase & $145-420 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$ & Raised in obstruction or hepatic inflammation. Not specific \\
\hline Bilirubin & Conjugated >34micromol/l or >10-205 of total & Liver cell disease or obstruction \\
\hline Albumin & Preterm $25-49 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ Term $28-49 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ & Hepatic synthetic function. Reduced markedly in liver disease \\
\hline Prothrombin time (PT) & $10-15 \mathrm{sec}$ & Hepatic synthetic function Raised in liver disease and may be unresponsive to vitamin K in severe liver disease \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Be guided by gastroenterologists and other specialists as required
Refer as soon as possible (see flow chart)
Specific treatment according to the cause

\section*{CHOLESTATIS}

\section*{Nutrition}
- Breastfeed
- If failing to thrive give high calorie diet ( $120-150 \%$ above normal requirement) using medium chain fatty acid. Use coconut oil $2.5-5 \mathrm{mls}$ daily
- Prescribe fat soluble vitamins as follows
+ Vitamins A 5000 units daily
+ Vitamin D 4000 units daily
+ Vitamin E: 50-400IU per day
+ Vitamin K: $1-2 \mathrm{mg} /$ day

\subsection*{25.0 TRANSFUSIONS IN NEWBORN}

Haemoglobin changes in the first month
Birth $14-23 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$;
2 wks $14-19 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$;
4 wks term $13-14 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, preterm $7-9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{ANAEMIA}

Definition: $1^{\text {st }}$ week $\mathrm{Hb}<13 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$; after $1^{\text {st }}$ week $\mathrm{Hb}<10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{Prevention}
- Minimise iatrogenic blood loss by appropriate use of tests. Hospitals should have microtechnique laboratory facility for neonates
- Preterm babies:
- Give prophylactic iron \& folate. Start 4 wks till age 1year
- Erythropoietin can also be used

\section*{Causes:}

\section*{1. Early onset - $\mathbf{1}^{\text {st }} \mathbf{2}$ days postnatal age}
- Haemorrhage: birth trauma, internal haemorrhage, cord accidents, foetal-maternal, twin-twin
- Haemolysis: blood group incompatibility, congenital infection

\section*{Management}

Haemorrhage: Assess for signs of acute blood loss - shock. If present, give normal saline $15-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 10 minutes as you organise for blood transfusion. Repeat if signs persist. Transfuse as soon as blood is available $20-30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 2 hrs . If no signs of shock transfuse with $20-30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over $2-3 \mathrm{hrs}$. At the end of the transfusion before you discard the pack re-evaluate to see if baby needs more blood. Do not give furosemide. Use whole blood

Haemolysis: Do blood group mother \& baby, Coombs test, reticulocyte count, bilirubin. Treat the cause; may need exchange transfusion. Give furosemide with the transfusion. Use packed cells

\section*{2. Late onset $\mathbf{> 2}$ days postnatal age}
- Blood loss:
- latrogenic - Repeated laboratory investigations
- Haemorrhagic disorders including DIC due to infections
- Haemolysis
- Anaemia of prematurity (Usually 2-6 weeks of age)

\section*{Management}

Investigate:
- Full blood count including a peripheral blood film (PBF)for
red cell morphology
- Reticulocyte count
- Coagulation screen if suspect DIC

Indications for RBC transfusion
- $\mathrm{Hb}<13 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ if:
- Baby < 24 hrs
- NICU/ventilation with high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ needs
- $\boldsymbol{H b}<\mathbf{1 1 g} /$ dl \& chronic $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dependence
- Signs of anaemia:
- Unexplained apnoea,
- Tachycardia (rate $>160 / \mathrm{min}$ for $>48 \mathrm{hrs}$ ),
- Poor weight gain ( $<10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ) with adequate feed intake \& environmental temperature for 7 days,
- Signs of CCF.

Anaemia of prematurity
Do not transfuse if $\mathrm{Hb} 7-8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and the baby is stable and growing.
Transfuse if:
- Age <28 days: on respiratory support (ventilation or CPAP) $\mathrm{Hb}<12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Age $>28$ days: on respiratory support (ventilation or CPAP) $\mathrm{Hb}<8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Requires $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{Hb}<8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Well in room air $<7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
'Top up' transfusions for any neonate
- Use ABO \& Rh D compatible with mother and baby. (If mother or baby is Rh negative always use Rh negative blood)
- Blood < 35 days
- Use packed cells as much as possible

Give:
- $10-15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of packed red blood cells over $2-4$ hours. (Rate $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ but if baby in CCF $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ )
- If baby on IV fluids only count blood as part of the day's needs in which case furosemide will not be needed.

\section*{BLEEDING DISORDERS}

Normal values
Prothrombin time (PT) is 12-13 seconds and platelet count is $150-450 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ as in adult. Babies who are not given vitamin K at birth will have a slightly prolonged PT in the first week Activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) up to 3wks 40-42 sec in term \& up to 50sec in preterm thereafter 28-39sec as in adult

\section*{Prevention:}

\section*{ALL NEWBORNS SHOULD BE GE GIVEN IM VITAMIN K 1MG AT BIRTH OR SOON AFTER.}

\section*{Causes (common)}

Prolonged APPT alone: inherited individual factor deficiency
Prolonged PT alone/INR: vitamin K deficiency
Prolonged APPT \& PT: Liver disease
Prolonged APPT, PT \& low platelets (or prolonged PT \& low platelets): DIC

\section*{Management}

\section*{Investigations}
- Full blood count including a PBF
- Coagulation screen

\section*{Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)}

\section*{Indication for transfusion:}

Clinically significant bleeding due to coagulation defects in following conditions
- Severe liver disease
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Vitamin K deficiency bleeding

Dose: $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over $2-4 \mathrm{hrs}$
Use ABO compatible with recipient's RBCs
Treat the cause if treatable.
Vitamin K deficiency bleeding: give IV vitamin K $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ IM/IV.

\section*{Platelet transfusions}

Platelet count is the same for all ages
Thrombocytopaenia is common in neonates with respiratory distress or sepsis.

\section*{Indication for transfusion:}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Platelet count x10 ${ }^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{BLEEDING} \\
\hline & Yes & No \\
\hline <30 & Transfuse & \multirow{2}{*}{\begin{tabular}{l}

- Requires surgery
\end{tabular}} \\
\hline 30-49 & Transfuse & \\
\hline 50-99 & Transfuse & Do not Transfuse \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\footnotetext{

\subsection*{26.0 HEART DISEASES IN THE NEWBORN}

\section*{CRITICAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASES}

Definition: a congenital heart defect that will require intervention within the first year of life. Some of these require urgent intervention within the first few days of life. Thus early detection associated with early intervention will reduce morbidity and mortality
Presentation can be as:
- Congestive Heart Failure
- Cyanosis
- Heart Murmurs
- Arrhythmias
- Poor feeding
- Sudden collapse
- Poor circulation

Clinical assessment focuses on:
- Colour
- Pulses radial \& femoral
- Circulation
- Blood pressure in upper and lower limbs

\section*{Evaluation by Pulse Oximetry}

Perform as follows:
- Use a paediatric pulse oximetre
- Baby should be quiet alert \& warm
- Attach to the RIGHT HAND - record saturation reading
- Do another reading on the foot either simultaneously or soon after the hand reading
Use the flow chart to determine a PASS or FAIL TEST
A FAIL TEST indicates critical congenital heart disease. REFER to Cardiologist urgently for further cardiac evaluation or (perform an echocardiography if trained to do so).

Other conditions which give a fail oximetre test:
- Respiratory conditions
- Sepsis
- Hypothermia

- Check that two (2) or three (3) correct identification bands are on the baby.
- Pass nasal/oral gastric tube \& empty the stomach before taking to theatre
- Ensure a patent airway to prevent respiratory compromise
- Oxygen administration if required.
- Keep neonate warm in a neutral thermal environment i.e. in an incubator or use radiant warmer.
- Neonate's head should be placed in a lateral position to facilitate drainage in cases of oesophageal atresia.
- Correct acid base and electrolyte imbalance if present.
- Monitor input and output and record on the care chart, replace losses with Ringer's lactate
- Assess infant's associated anomalies/syndromes and malformation.
- Ensure continuous monitoring and hourly record of the following is maintained:
+ Cardiorespiratory - pulse, respiration
+ Blood pressure
$+\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$
+ Temperature
- Ensure arterial blood gas/capillary gas, FBC, RBS, group \& cross-match, and U\&E's are taken as ordered.
- Ensure baby is nil by mouth prior to surgery:

- Administer IV fluids as prescribed.
- Monitor input/output and record accurately, ensure patient is well hydrated.
- Assess bowel sounds to determine readiness to feed.
- Administer parenteral nutrition until feeding is tolerated.
- Observe wounds for signs of bleeding. Report excessive bleeding.
- Ensure aseptic technique in cleaning operated site during dressing to prevent infection.
- Ensure pain relief is administered as prescribed to promote comfort.
- Administer antibiotics as prescribed.
- Ensure stress for the family is minimized:
+ Explain all procedures and treatment to parents.
+ Parents need to be kept informed of baby's condition and progress and given the opportunity to see their baby as well as speak with the surgeon/doctor/nurse.
+ They also need to be supported through the often long recovery process.

\subsection*{29.0 PAIN MANAGEMENT}

\section*{GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PAIN PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PAIN IN NEWBORNS}
- Pain in newborns is often unrecognised and undertreated.
- Pain experienced in the newborn period has long-term effects of painful stimulation.
- If a procedure is painful in adults it should be considered painful in newborns, even if they are preterm.
- A lack of behavioural responses especially preterm neonates (including crying and movement) does not necessarily indicate a lack of pain.
- Sedation does not provide pain relief and may mask the neonate's response to pain.
- Pain increases the risk of clinical complications and mortality.

\section*{Painful procedures commonly performed}
- All invasive procedures that use a needle
- Tube and catheter insertions and removals
- Removal of adhesive tapes
- Tracheal intubation/extubation
- Mechanical ventilation
- Chest physiotherapy
- Eye examination
- All surgical procedures

\section*{Recognition and scoring of pain (See tables \& figure next page)}

Table 1: Pain assessment should be included in every vital signs assessment.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Interpretation}
- Deep sedation; Score of -10 to -5
- Light sedation: Score of -5 to -2
- A negative score without the administration of opioids/sedatives may indicate the following:
- Infant's response to prolonged or persistent pain/stress
- Neurologic depression, sepsis or other pathology

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{PREVENTION}
- Anticipate and provide analgesia before/during any painful procedure
- Reduce number of painful procedures as much as possible
- Plan to do concurrent procedures whenever possible
- Use non-pharmacological interventions to minimise pain during procedures

\section*{After scoring determine the management using the flow}
diagram below

\section*{Non pharmacological strategies to reduce pain include:}
- Swaddling, Nesting, kangaroo care
- Use of nonnutritive sucking
- Use of sucrose on cotton wool
- Lowering noise levels in the NICU
- Avoiding exposure to bright lights
- Promoting of day/night light cycles

These can be used for most of the painful procedure in the NBU

\section*{Pharmacologic measures: Analgesia \& sedation}

\section*{Non Opioids}

Paracetamol $20-25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ stat then $10-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} 8$ hrly Ibuprofen $4-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose $6-8 \mathrm{hrly}$

\section*{Opioids}

Morphine $0.05-0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose $4-6$ hrly or infusion $10- 15 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ over 4-6hrs for ventilated babies Fentanyl $0.3-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose or infusion $0.3-5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ over $30-$ 60 minutes

\section*{Benzodiazepines}

Midazolam $0.05-0.15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose over 5 minutes, $2-4 \mathrm{hrly} / \mathrm{PRN}$ useful for agitated ventilated babies

\section*{Watch out for respiratory depression with opioids \& benzodiazepines}

\subsection*{30.0 IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE FOR THE PRETERM INFANT}

Based on the evidence available, preterm infants should be vaccinated following the standard vaccination schedules should be based on their chronological age and not on actual weight.
The doses used for term infants are the same for preterm infants.
But: Consider booster vaccination doses, especially for DTP, Hib, Polio, Pneumococcus, Measles after the age of one year - usually at 12,15 and 18 months.

\subsection*{22.1 ADVERSE REACTIONS/SIDE EFFECTS}

The adverse reactions/side effects reported in preterm infants following vaccination with the standard scheduled antigens are similar to those reported in term infants. Hence there is no increased risk in vaccinating preterm infants based on their chronological age and following the standard vaccination schedules.

\subsection*{22.2 IMMUNIZATION SCHEDULE FOR THE PRETERM INFANT}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{NOTES}
i. There is good response to both ROTARIX and ROTATEQ vaccines
ii. Vitamin A should be given every six (6) months from the chronological age
of six months to the chronological age of five years

\subsection*{31.0 PRETERM/LOW BIRTH WEIGHT CARE: SUMMARY}

\section*{DELIVERY}
- Delay cord clumping unless requires resuscitation
- Prevent hypothermia: Practice skin to skin or have a warmer
- Transfer to newborn as soon as possible keep warm \& watch breathing during transfer
- If needs resuscitation: As much as possible avoid $100 \%$ oxygen

\section*{LATE PRETERM/BIRTH WEIGHT $\geq 2000 \mathrm{G}$}
- Observe in the postnatal ward - ensure adequate breastfeeding before discharge.
- Show mother how to practice kangaroo care at home
- Give multivitamins from 2 weeks of age till 1 yr
- Give iron supplement from 4 weeks of age till 1yr

\section*{PRETERM <34 WEEKS/BIRTH WEIGHT <2000G}

Admit to newborn unit
- Assess \& determine current problem
- Respiratory distress: Do a Silverman-Anderson score and treat accordingly
- Prevent apnoea of prematurity: give caffeine from birth till gestation of 34weeks
- Initiate IV dextrose/feeding immediately according to size and condition
- Monitor blood glucose regularly especially if on prolonged IV fluids and delayed enteral feeds

\section*{PHYSICAL MATURITY}
Six external fealures are examired. The baby has to be fumed over to examine the amount of lanugo. If the baby is too sick to be turned over, then the amount of lanuga is not scored.
SKIN: Examine the skin over the front of the chest and abdomen, and alsa look at the limbs. More rra ture babies h ave thicker skin.
LANUGO: This is the flne, ‚Ä°ufly hair that is seen overthe back of small babies. Exceptfor very immature babies that have no lariugo, the amount of lanugo decroases with maturity.
PLANTAR CREASES: Use you thumbs to stretch the skin on the bottom of the baby's foot. Very fine winkles, that disappear with sinetching, are not important. More malure bablies have more creases.
BREAST: Both the appearance of the breast and the size ofthe breast bud areconsidered. Palpate for the breast bud by gertly feeling under the nipple with your index finger and thumb. More mature babies have a bigger areok and breast bud.
EAR: Both the shape and thickness of the external ear areconsidered. With icreasing maturity the edge of the ear curts in. In addition, the cartilage in the ear thickens with modurily sothat the earsprings back into the normal position after it is folded against the baby's hoad.
GENIIALIA: Male and female genitalia ane scored differently. With ma turity the testes descend in the male and the scrotum becomes wrinkled. In females the labia majora increase in size with maturity.
