                            <p>Prenatal (gestational), perinatal, postnatal, past, and family histories should be obtained.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Maternal infection:</strong> Rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy commonly results in PDA and PA stenosis (rubella syndrome, see Table 1-1). Other viral infections early in pregnancy may be teratogenic. Viral infections (including human immunodeficiency virus) in late pregnancy may cause myocarditis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Maternal medications:</strong> The following is a partial list of suspected teratogenic drugs that cause CHDs.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Amphetamines (VSD, PDA, ASD, and TGA), phenytoin (PS, AS, COA, and PDA), trimethadione (fetal trimethadione syndrome: TGA, VSD, TOF, HLHS, see Table 1-1), lithium (Ebstein's anomaly), retinoic acid (conotruncal anomalies), valproic acid (various noncyanotic defects), and progesterone or estrogen (VSD, TOF, and TGA) are highly suspected teratogens.</li>
                                        <li>Warfarin may cause fetal warfarin syndrome (TOF, VSD, and other features such as ear abnormalities, cleft lip or palate, and hypoplastic vertebrae) (see Table 1-1).</li>
                                        <li>Excessive maternal alcohol intake may cause fetal alcohol syndrome (in which VSD, PDA, ASD, and TOF are common) (see Table 1-1).</li>
                                        <li>Cigarette smoking causes intrauterine growth retardation but not CHD.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li>Maternal diabetes increases the incidence of CHD (TGA, VSD, and PDA) and cardiomyopathy (see Table 1-1).</li>
                                        <li>Maternal lupus erythematosus and collagen diseases have been associated with congenital heart block in the offspring.</li>
                                        <li>History of maternal CHD may increase the prevalence of CHD in the offspring to as much as 15%, compared with 1% in the general population (see Appendix, Table A-2).</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li>Poor weight gain and delayed development may be caused by CHF, severe cyanosis, or general dysmorphic conditions. Weight is more affected than height.</li>
                                <li>Cyanosis, squatting, and cyanotic spells suggest TOF or other cyanotic CHD.</li>

                                <li><strong>Tachycardia, tachypnea, and puffy eyelids</strong> are signs of CHF.</li>
                                <li><strong>Frequent lower respiratory tract infections</strong> may be associated with large L-R shunt lesions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Decreased exercise tolerance</strong> may be a sign of significant heart defects or ventricular dysfunction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Heart murmur.</strong> The time of its first appearance is important. A heart murmur noted shortly after birth indicates a stenotic lesion (AS, PS). A heart murmur associated with large L-R shunt lesions (such as VSD or PDA) may be delayed. Appearance of a heart murmur in association with fever suggests an innocent heart murmur.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chest pain.</strong> Ask if chest pain is exercise-related or nonexertional. Also ask about its duration, nature, and radiation. Nonexertional chest pain is unlikely to have cardiac causes (except for pericarditis). Cardiac causes of chest pain are usually exertional and are very rare in children and adolescents. The three most common causes of noncardiac causes of chest pain in children are costochondritis, trauma to chest wall or muscle strain, and respiratory diseases (see Chest Pain in Chapter 20).</li>
                                <li><strong>Palpitation</strong> may be caused by paroxysms of tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, single premature beats; rarely hyperthyroidism or MVP (see Chapter 22).</li>
                                <li><strong>Joint pain.</strong> Joints that are involved, presence of redness and swelling, history of trauma, duration of the pain, and migratory or stationary nature of the pain are important. History of recent sore throat and rashes and family history of rheumatic fever are frequent in acute rheumatic fever. History of rheumatoid arthritis is also an important clue to the diagnosis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Neurologic symptoms.</strong> Stroke may result from embolization of thrombus from infective endocarditis, polycythemia, or uncorrected or partially corrected cyanotic CHD. Headache may be associated with polycythemia or rarely with hypertension. Choreic movement may result from rheumatic fever. Fainting or syncope may be due to vasovagal responses, arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, epilepsy, or other noncardiac conditions (see Syncope in Chapter 21).</li>
                                <li><strong>Medications,</strong> cardiac and noncardiac (name, dosage, timing, and duration).</li>
                                <li><strong>Syndromes and diseases</strong> of other systems with associated cardiovascular abnormalities are summarized in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, respectively.</li>

                            <p>Every child should have blood pressure (BP) measurement as part of the physical examination whenever possible. To determine if the obtained BP level is normal or abnormal, BP readings are compared with reliable BP standards. Unfortunately, there have been problems and confusion regarding the correct method of measuring BP and the reliable normative BP values for children. Arm length-based BP cuff selection methods recommended by two earlier NIH Task Forces (1977 and 1987) are scientifically unsound, and they have contributed to the lack of reliable normative BP standards for decades. Although the Working Group of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) has recently corrected the BP cuff selection method, their normative BP data are scientifically and logically unsound (see the following).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The following are currently recommended BP measurement techniques.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>The width of the BP cuff should be $40\%$ to $50\%$ of the circumference of the arm (or leg) with the cuff long enough to completely or nearly completely encircle the extremity.</li>
                                        <li>The NHBPEP recommends Korotkoff phase 5 ( K 5 ) as the diastolic pressure but this is debatable. Earlier studies indicate that K4 agrees better with true diastolic pressure for children $\leq 12$ years.</li>
                                        <li>Averaging of 2 or more readings should be obtained.</li>
                                        <li>The child should be in sitting position with the arm at the heart level.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>BP Standards Recommended by the NHBPEP.</strong></li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The normative BP standards recommended by the Working Group are not as good as was suggested. The readers should be aware of a few major flaws in the NHBPEP's normative values.</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>First of all, BP data presented in the NHBPEP standards are not obtained by using the same methodology as the Program has recommended. They are obtained using the arm length-based cuff selection method, which has been abandoned because of its unscientific nature. These values are also from single measurement, rather than the averages of multiple readings, as currently recommended. They also are not from a nationally representative population.</li>
                                <li>Expressing children's BP levels by age and height percentiles is statistically and logically unsound. Height has no statistically important role in children's BP levels.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Partial correlation analysis done in the San Antonio Children's Blood Pressure Study (SACBPS) shows that, when auscultatory BP levels were adjusted for age and weight, the correlation coefficient of systolic BP with height was very small ( $r=0.068$ for boys; $r=0.072$ for girls), whereas when adjusted for age and height, the correlation of systolic pressure with weight remained high ( $r=0.343$ for boys; $r=0.294$ for girls). These findings indicate that the contribution of height to BP levels is negligible. The apparent correlation of height to BP levels may be secondary to a close correlation that exists between height and weight ( $r=0.86$ ).</li>
                                        <li>A similar conclusion was reached with oscillometric BP levels in the same study. Thus, we have recommend children's BP value be expressed as a function of age only, as has been done earlier by NIH Task Forces.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Recommending additional computations and using scientifically unsound complex BP tables on such highly variable office BP readings is unreasonable and counterproductive. Analyzing unscientifically obtained data by additional computation does not improve the worth of the data.</li>
                                <li>The NHBPEP does not point out that the auscultatory and oscillometric BP readings are not interchangeable. SACBPS, in which both auscultatory and oscillometric methods were used, found that oscillometric systolic pressures are significantly higher than auscultatory BP readings (see below for further details).</li>
                                <li>The NHBPEP does not emphasize the important contribution of "white coat phenomenon" in office BP readings. White-coat phenomenon is probably the most common cause of high blood pressure readings in pediatric practice.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <ol start="3">
                                <li><strong>Reliable normative BP standards.</strong> Which normal BP standards should be used and why?
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>The NIH Task Force BP standards (of 1987) are no longer acceptable because they were obtained by using the arm length-based BP cuff selection method.</li>
                                        <li>The BP standards of the NHBPEP are riddled with major flaws as outlined in the preceding section. These standards reflect violation of basic scientific principles. Although not acceptable as reliable pediatric BP standards, the NHBPEP's normative values are presented in Appendix B for the sake of completeness (Tables B-1 and B-2, Appendix B).</li>
                                        <li>Normative BP percentile values from the San Antonio Study (SACBPS) are recommended as better BP standards than the NHBPEP's standards until nationwide data using the currently recommended methods become available. These are the only available BP standards that have been obtained according to the currently recommended method. In the SACBPS, BP levels were obtained in over 7000 tri-ethnic school children enrolled in kindergarten through the 12th grade in the San Antonio, Texas, area. Both the auscultatory and oscillometric (model Dinamap 8100) methods were used in the study. The data are the averages of three readings. Auscultatory BP data were expressed according to age and gender. These BP standards are normally distributed from the mean value and thus the effect of obesity is not a problem in using the standards (Figs. 1-1 and 1-2). Percentile BP values for these figures are presented in Appendix B (Tables B-3 and B-4).</li>
                                        <li>When BP is measured using an oscillometric device, one should use a device-specific normative BP standards. SACBPS found that the readings by auscultatory method and by Dinamap 8100 are significantly different and thus are not interchangeable. Percentile BP values by an oscillometric method (Dinamap 8100) are presented in Appendix B (Tables B-5 and B-6).</li>

                                        <li>The accuracy of indirect BP measurement by an oscillometric method (Dinamap Model 1846) has been demonstrated. One caution is that not all oscillometric devices in clincal use have been validated for their accuracy. Accuracy of oscillometric BP does not mean that BPs obtained by the oscillometric method should agree with those obtained by the auscultatory method. Auscultatory BP method is another indirect BP measurement method using a different detection device; only direct intraarterial BP measurement is the gold standard.</li>
                                        <li>SACBPS found that BP levels obtained by the Dinamap (Model 8100) were on the average 10 mm Hg higher than the auscultatory</li>

                                        <li>BP measurement is important in newborns and small children to diagnose COA, hypertension, or hypotension. In contrast to the recommendations of the NHBEP, the auscultatory method is difficult to apply in newborns and small children because of weak Korotkoff sounds in these age groups, and thus normative auscultatory BP standards are not reliable. Therefore, the oscillometric method is frequently used instead. The same BP cuff selection method as used in older children applies to this age group; i.e., the cuff width approximately 50% of the circumference of the extremity.</li>

The peripheral systolic pressure, obtained by either direct or indirect method, is not always the same as the central aortic pressure. In fact, arm systolic pressures are in general higher than central aortic pressures, and are much higher in certain situations. This phenomenon is called peripheral amplification of systolic pressure (see Fig. 1-3). The systolic amplification increases as</li>

                                        <li>Classification of systolic murmurs. A systolic murmur occurs between S1 and S2. Systolic murmur was initially classified by Aubrey Leatham in 1958 into two types, ejection or regurgitant, depending on the timing of the onset, not the termination, of the murmur in relation to the S1. Recently Joseph Perloff proposed a new classification according to the time of onset and termination into 4 types: midsystolic (ejection), holosystolic, early systolic, and late systolic.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Ejection systolic murmur (also called stenotic, diamond-shaped or Perloff's midsystolic) has an interval between S1 and the onset of the murmur and is crescendo-decrescendo. The murmur may be short or long (Fig. 1-6, $A$ ). These murmurs are caused by flow of blood through stenotic or deformed semilunar valves or increased flow through normal semilunar valves and are therefore found at the base or over the midprecordium. These murmurs may be pathologic or innocent.</li>
                                                <li>Regurgitant systolic murmur begins with the S1 (no gap between the S1 and the onset of the murmur) and usually lasts throughout</li>

                                <figcaption><strong>FIGURE 1-6</strong><br>Ejection and regurgitant systolic murmurs. $\boldsymbol{A}$, An ejection systolic murmur is audible in pulmonary valve stenosis (and other conditions). With mild stenosis the apex of the diamond is in the early part of systole (top). With increasing severity of obstruction to flow, the murmur becomes louder and longer and its apex moves toward S2 (middle). In severe PS , the murmur may last beyond A 2 and the P 2 is sometimes too soft to be audible (bottom). B, Regurgitant systolic murmur starts with S1. Most regurgitant systolic murmur in children is due to VSD and is holosystolic, extending all the way to S2 (top). In some children, especially those with small VSDs, and some neonates with VSD, the regurgitant systolic murmur may be decrescendo and ends in middle or early systole (not holosystolic) (middle bottom), but never crescendo-decrescendo.</figcaption>

                                <li>Location. In addition to the type of murmur (ejection vs. regurgitant) the location of maximal intensity of the murmur is of great importance in determining the origin of the murmur. Figure 1-7 illustrates systolic murmurs that are audible maximally at the various locations. Tables 1-4 through 1-7 summarize other clinical findings (e.g., physical examination, chest radiography, and ECG) that may aid diagnosis according to the location of a systolic murmur.</li>
                                <li>Transmission. A systolic ejection murmur at the base that transmits well to the neck is likely to be aortic, and one that transmits well to the sides of the chest and the back is likely to arise in the pulmonary valve or pulmonary artery.</li>
                                <li>Quality. Ejection systolic murmurs of AS or PS have a rough, grating quality. A common innocent murmur in children (Still murmur) has a characteristic vibratory or humming quality.</li>

Best heard with the bell of the stethoscope, these murmurs are caused by anatomic or relative stenosis of the mitral or tricuspid valve. MS murmurs are best heard at the apex (apical rumble), and TS murmurs are heard along the LLSB.</li>

                                <li><strong>Innocent murmurs.</strong> Over $80 \%$ of children have innocent murmurs of one type or other sometime during childhood, most commonly beginning at about 3 or 4 years of age. All innocent heart murmurs are accentuated or brought out in high-output states, most importantly with fever. Clinical characteristics of these murmurs are summarized in Table 1-8.</li>

                        <p>One normal cardiac cycle is represented by successive waveforms on an ECG tracing: the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave (Fig. 2-1, A). These waves produce two important intervals, PR and QT , and two segments, PQ and ST .</p>
                        <p>In normal sinus rhythm the sinoatrial (SA) node is the pacemaker for the entire heart; the SA node impulse depolarizes the right and left atria by a contiguous spread, producing the P wave (Fig. 2-1, $A, B$ ). When the atrial impulse arrives at the AV node, it passes through the node much more slowly than any other part of the heart, producing the PQ interval. Once the electrical impulse reaches the bundle of His, conduction becomes very fast and spreads simultaneously down the left and right bundle branches to the ventricular muscle through the Purkinje fibers, producing the QRS complex. The repolarization of the ventricle produces the T wave, but the repolarization of the atria is not usually visible on the ECG tracing. The ST segment represents phase 2 (plateau) of the action potential during which no net ionic movement occurs because the outward current (carried by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions) and inward current (carried by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions) are in competition.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Vectorial Approach to the ECG</h3>
                        <p>A scalar ECG, which is routinely obtained in clinical practice, shows only the magnitude of the forces against time. The vectorial approach views the standard scalar ECG as three-dimensional vector forces that vary with time. When leads, which represent the frontal and horizontal projection, are combined, one can derive three-dimensional information on the direction of the electromotive force from scalar ECG. The limb leads (i.e., leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF) provide information about the frontal projection, while the precordial leads (V4R, and V1 through V6) provide information about the horizontal plane (Fig. 2-2). The vectorial approach clarifies the meaning of the ECG waves and the concept of axes, such as the $P$ axis, QRS axis, and T axis. It is important for the readers to become familiar with the orientation of each scalar ECG lead.</p>

                            <li><strong>The hexaxial reference system.</strong><br>The hexaxial reference system is composed of six limb leads (leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF). It gives information about the left-right and superior-inferior relationships (Fig. 2-2, A). The positive pole of each lead is indicated by the lead labels (and + signs). The positive deflection (i.e., the R wave) is the force directed toward the positive pole, and the negative deflection (i.e., the $S$ wave) is the force directed toward the negative pole. Therefore, the R wave in lead I represents the leftward force and the $S$ wave in lead I the rightward force. The $R$ wave in aVF</li>

                        <p>Chest radiography was an essential part of cardiac evaluation before the echocardiographic (echo) studies became widely available to cardiologists. This simple test remains very useful to physicians who do not have access to the echocardiograph.

                            <li><strong>Heart size:</strong> The cardiothoracic (CT) ratio is obtained by dividing the largest transverse diameter of the heart by the widest internal diameter of the chest (Fig. 3-1). The CT ratio is calculated by the following formula.

                            <p>A CT ratio of more than 0.5 is considered to indicate cardiomegaly. However, the CT ratio cannot be used with any accuracy in neonates and small infants, in whom a good inspiratory chest film is rarely obtained.</p>

In the neonate, however, a typical normal cardiac silhouette as shown in Figure 3-2 is rarely seen because of the presence of a large thymus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abnormal cardiac silhouette:</strong> The overall shape of the heart sometimes provides important clues to the type of cardiac defect (Fig. 3-3).

An enlargement of the LA may produce a double density on the posteroanterior view.

                                    <li><strong>Right atrial enlargement (RAE):</strong> In the posteroanterior projection an enlargement of the RA results in an increased prominence of the right lower cardiac border (Fig. 3-5).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Right ventricular enlargement (RVE):</strong> RVE is best recognized in the lateral view by the filling of the retrosternal space (Fig. 3-5).</li>

                        <p>One of the major goals of radiologic examination is the assessment of pulmonary blood flow.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Increased pulmonary vascular marking (PVM)</strong> is present when the pulmonary arteries appear enlarged and extend into the lateral third of the lung field, where they are not usually present, and there is an increased vascularity to the lung apices where the vessels are normally collapsed.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Increased PVM in an acyanotic child suggests a left-to-right shunt lesion such as ASD, VSD, PDA, ECD, PAPVR, or any combination of these.</li>
                                    <li>In a cyanotic infant, an increased PVM may indicate TGA, TAPVR, HLHS, persistent truncus arteriosus, or single ventricle.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>A <strong>decreased PVM</strong> is suspected when the hilum appears small, the remaining lung fields appear black, and the vessels appear small and thin. Ischemic lung fields in cyanotic patients suggest critical stenosis or atresia of the pulmonary or tricuspid valves or TOF.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulmonary venous congestion,</strong> which is characterized by a hazy and indistinct margin of the pulmonary vasculature, is seen with HLHS, MS, TAPVR, cor triatriatum, and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Normal pulmonary vasculature</strong> is present in patients with mild to moderate PS and in patients with small L-R shunt lesions.</li>

                        <p>The interpretation of chest radiographs should include a systematic routine to avoid overlooking important anatomic changes relevant to cardiac diagnosis.</p>

                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>The cardiac apex should be on the same side as the stomach or opposite the hepatic shadow.</li>
                                    <li>When there is heterotaxia, with the apex on the right and the stomach on the left, or vice versa, the likelihood of a serious heart defect is great.</li>
                                    <li>A midline liver is associated with asplenia (Ivemark's) syndrome or polysplenia syndrome.</li>

                                    <li>Rib notching is a specific finding of COA in a child usually older than 5 years, generally seen between the fourth and eighth ribs.</li>

                                    <li>When the descending aorta is seen on the left of the vertebral column, a left aortic arch is present.</li>
                                    <li>When the descending aorta is seen on the right of the vertebral column, a right arch is present. A right aortic arch is frequently associated with TOF or persistent truncus arteriosus.</li>

                                    <li>The thymus is prominent in healthy infants and may give a false impression of cardiomegaly.</li>
