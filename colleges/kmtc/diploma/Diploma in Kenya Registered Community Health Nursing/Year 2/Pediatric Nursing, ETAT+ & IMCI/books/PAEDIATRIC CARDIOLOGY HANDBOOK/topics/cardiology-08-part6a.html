                                <li>A P wave is present in front of each QRS complex with a regular PR interval. (The PR interval may be prolonged, as in first-degree AV block).</li>
                                <li>The P axis is between 0 and +90 degrees, often a neglected criterion. This produces upright P waves in lead II and inverted P waves in aVR (see Figs. 2-6 and 2-7).</li>

                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The rhythm is regular and the rate is normal for age. Two characteristics of sinus rhythm (as described previously) are present (Fig. 16-1).</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> This rhythm is normal at any age.</li>

                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The characteristics of sinus rhythm are present. A rate above 140 beats/min in children and above 170 beats/min in infants may be significant. In sinus tachycardia, the heart rate is usually lower than 200 beats/min (Fig. 16-1).</li>
                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Anxiety, fever, hypovolemia, circulatory shock, anemia, CHF, catecholamines, thyrotoxicosis, and myocardial disease are possible causes.</li>

                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Sinus bradycardia may occur in trained athletes. Vagal stimulation, increased intracranial pressure, hypothyroidism, hypothermia, hypoxia, and drugs such as digitalis and $\beta$-adrenergic blockers are possible causes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Some patients with marked bradycardia do not maintain normal cardiac output.</li>

                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> There is a phasic variation in the heart rate, increasing during inspiration and decreasing during expiration, and the two characteristics of sinus rhythm are maintained (Fig. 16-1).</li>
                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> This normal phenomenon is due to a phasic variation in the firing rate of cardiac autonomic nerves with the phase of respiration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> There is no hemodynamic significance.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> In sinus pause, there is a momentary cessation of sinus node pacemaker activity, resulting in the absence of the P wave and QRS complex for a relatively short duration (see Fig. 16-1). Sinus arrest lasts longer and usually results in an escape beat (such as junctional escape beat).</li>
                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Increased vagal tone, hypoxia, digitalis toxicity, and sick sinus syndrome (see next section). Well-conditioned athletes may have bradycardia and sinus pause of greater than 2 seconds due to prominent vagal influence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Sinus pause of less than 2 seconds is normal in young children and adolescents. Sinus pause usually has no hemodynamic significance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Treatment is rarely indicated except in sick sinus syndrome and digitalis toxicity.</li>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sinoatrial Exit Block</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> A P wave is absent from the normally expected P wave resulting in a long RR interval. The duration of the pause is a multiple of the basic PP interval. An impulse formed within the sinus node fails to propagate normally to the atria.</li>
                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Excessive vagal stimulation, myocarditis or fibrosis involving the atrium, and drugs such as quinidine, procainamide or digitalis</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It is usually transient and has no hemodynamic significance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> The underlying cause is treated.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sinus Node Dysfunction (Sick Sinus Syndrome)</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Description:</strong> The sinus node fails to function as the dominant pacemaker of the heart or performs abnormally slowly, producing a variety of arrhythmias. The arrhythmias may include profound sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest with junctional (or nodal) escape, and ectopic atrial or nodal rhythm. When these arrhythmias are accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness or syncope, sinus node dysfunction is referred to as sick sinus syndrome. Long-term ECG recording (such as Holter) is usually required in documenting overall heart rate variation and the prevalence of abnormally slow or fast rhythm.</li>
                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Extensive cardiac surgery involving the atria (e.g., the Fontan operation), arteritis, myocarditis, antiarrhythmic drugs, hypothyroidism, CHD (such as sinus venosus ASD, Ebstein anomaly), and occasionally idiopathic occurring in an otherwise normal heart.</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Bradytachyarrhythmia is the most worrisome rhythm. Profound bradycardia following a period of tachycardia (overdrive suppression) can cause syncope and even death.</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Severe bradycardia is treated with atropine (0.02-0.04 mg/kg, IV, q2-4 hr) or isoproterenol (0.05-0.5 mcg/kg, IV) or both.</li>
                                        <li>Temporary transvenous or transesophageal pacing can be used until a permanent pacing system can be implanted.</li>
                                        <li>Chronic medical treatment with various drugs has not been uniformly successful.</li>
                                        <li>Permanent pacemaker implantation is the treatment of choice in symptomatic patients. Most patients receive atrial demand pacing. Patients with any degree of AV nodal dysfunction receive dual-chamber pacemakers.</li>

                                        <li>In PAC the QRS complex occurs prematurely with abnormal P wave morphology. There is an incomplete compensatory pause; i.e., the length of two cycles including one premature beat is less than the length of two normal cycles.</li>
                                        <li>An occasional PAC is not followed by a QRS complex (i.e., a nonconducted PAC) (see Fig. 16-2).</li>
                                        <li>A nonconducted PAC is differentiated from a second-degree AV block by the prematurity of the nonconducted P wave (P' in Fig. 16-2). The P' wave occurs earlier than the anticipated normal P rate, and the resulting PP' interval is shorter than the normal PP interval for that individual. In second-degree AV block, the P wave that is not followed by the QRS complex occurs at the anticipated time, maintaining a regular PP interval.</li>

                                        <li>The P axis is different from that of sinus rhythm (Fig. 16-2). When the ectopic focus is near the sinus node, the P axis may be the same as in sinus rhythm.</li>
                                        <li>The usual heart rate in older children is between 110 and 160 beats/min, but the tachycardia rate varies substantially during the course of a day, reaching 200 beats/min with sympathetic stimuli. Holter monitoring may demonstrate a characteristic gradual acceleration of the heart rate, the so called "warming up" period, rather than abrupt onset and termination seen with re-entrant AV tachycardia.</li>
                                        <li>It represents about 20% of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). This arrhythmia is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the re-entrant AV tachycardia and thus it is included under "supraventricular tachycardia."</li>

                                <li><strong>Causes:</strong> This arrhythmia originates from a single focus in the atrium. It is believed to be secondary to increased automaticity of nonsinus atrial focus or foci. Myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, atrial dilatation, atrial tumors, and previous cardiac surgery involving atria (such as Fontan procedure) may be the cause. Most patients have a structurally normal heart (idiopathic).</li>
                                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> CHF is common with chronic cases. There is a high association with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> It is refractory to medical therapy and cardioversion.

                                        <li>Drugs that are effective in re-entrant atrial tachycardia (such as adenosine) do not terminate the tachycardia. Cardioversion is ineffective because the ectopic rhythm resumes immediately.</li>
                                        <li>The goal may be to slow the ventricular rate (using digoxin or $\beta$-blockers) rather than to try to convert the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm.</li>
                                        <li>Intravenous amiodarone may achieve rate control relatively quickly.</li>
                                        <li>Long-term oral antiarrhythmic drugs (such as flecainide or amiodarone) are the mainstay of therapy in patients not undergoing radiofrequency ablation.</li>
                                        <li>Radiofrequency ablation may prove to be effective in nearly 90% of cases. In children, the foci are found in the LA near the pulmonary veins and the atrial appendage (in contrast to the RA found in adults).</li>

                        <p>Atrioventricular (AV) block is a disturbance in conduction between the normal sinus impulse and the eventual ventricular response. The block is assigned to one of three classes, according to the severity of the conduction disturbance.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>A pacemaker is a device that delivers battery-supplied electrical stimuli over leads to electrodes in contact with the heart. The electrical leads are inserted either directly over the epicardium or transvenously; the latter is the method of choice. Electronic circuitry regulates the timing and characteristics of the stimuli. The power source usually is a lithium-iodine battery. Battery life varies from 3 years to 15 years depending on the type of the device, which determines the amount of battery use. New pacemakers are capable of closely mimicking normal cardiac rhythm (physiologic pacemakers), and most of them are small enough to be implanted in an infant.</p>
                            <p>Physicians encounter an increasing number of children with either temporary or permanent pacemakers. Basic knowledge about the pacemaker and the pacemaker rhythm strip is essential in taking care of these children.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. ECGs of Artificial Cardiac Pacemakers</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Rhythm strips of artificial pacemakers:</strong> The need to recognize rhythm strips of artificial pacemakers has increased in recent years, especially in intensive care and emergency room settings. The position and number of the pacemaker spikes on the ECG rhythm strip are used to recognize different types of pacemakers.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>When the pacemaker stimulates the atrium, a P wave follows an electronic spike. The resulting P wave demonstrates an abnormal P axis.</li>
                                        <li>When the pacemaker stimulates the ventricle, a wide QRS complex appears after the electronic spike.</li>
                                        <li>The ventricle that is stimulated (or the ventricle on which the pacemaker electrode is placed) can be identified by the morphology of the QRS complexes. With the pacing electrode on the RV, the QRS complex resembles an LBBB pattern; with the pacemaker placed on the LV, an RBBB pattern results.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Examples of pacemaker ECGs:</strong> Three examples of pacemaker ECGs are shown in Figure 18-1.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li><strong>Ventricular pacemaker (ventricular sensing and pacing).</strong> This mode of pacing is recognized by vertical pacemaker spikes that initiate ventricular depolarization with wide QRS complexes (Fig. 18-1, A). The electronic spike has no fixed relationship with atrial activity (P wave). The pacemaker rate may be fixed as in the figure, or it may be on a demand (or standby) mode in which the pacemaker fires only after a long pause between the patient's own ventricular beats.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Atrial pacemaker (atrial sensing and pacing).</strong> The atrial pacemaker is recognized by a pacemaker spike followed by an atrial complex. When atrioventricular (AV) conduction is normal, a QRS complex of normal duration follows (see Fig. 18-1, B). This type of pacemaker is indicated in patients with sinus node dysfunction with bradycardia. When the patient has high-degree or complete AV block in addition to sinus node dysfunction, an additional ventricular pacemaker may be required (AV sequential pacemaker, not illustrated in the figure). The AV sequential pacemaker is recognized by two sets of electronic spikes, one before the P wave and another before the wide QRS complex.</li>
                                        <li><strong>P-wave triggered ventricular pacemaker (atrial sensing, ventricular pacing).</strong> This type of pacemaker can be recognized by pacemaker spikes that follow the patient's own P waves at regular PR intervals and with wide QRS complexes (see Fig. 18-1, C). The patient's own P waves are sensed and trigger a ventricular pacemaker after an electronically preset PR interval. This type of pacemaker is the most physiologic and is indicated when the patient has advanced AV block but a normal sinus mechanism. Advantages of this type of pacemaker are that the heart rate varies with physiologic need and the atrial contraction contributes to ventricular filling and improves cardiac output.</li>

                                        <li>Symptomatic bradycardia (with symptoms of syncope, dizziness, exercise intolerance, or congestive heart failure). In children, significant bradycardia with syncope or near syncope results most commonly from extensive surgery involving the atria (such as the Fontan operation).</li>
                                        <li>The bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (due to overdrive suppression after a period of tachycardia).</li>

                                <li>Another noncontroversial indication is surgically acquired heart block that lasts more than 7 days after surgery.</li>
                                <li>Temporary pacing is indicated for (1) patients with advanced second-degree or complete heart block secondary to overdose of certain drugs, myocarditis, or myocardial infarction and (2) certain patients immediately after cardiac surgery.</li>
