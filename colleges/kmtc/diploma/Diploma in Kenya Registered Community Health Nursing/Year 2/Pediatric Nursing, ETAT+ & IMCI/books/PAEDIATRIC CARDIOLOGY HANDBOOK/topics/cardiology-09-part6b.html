                        <p>Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body to meet its needs, to dispose of systemic or pulmonary venous return adequately, or a combination of the two.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Causes</h3>
                        <p>The heart failure syndrome may arise from diverse causes. By far the most common causes of CHF in infancy are CHDs. Beyond infancy, myocardial dysfunction of various etiologies is an important cause of CHF. Tachyarrhythmias and heart block can also cause heart failure at any age.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Congenital heart disease</strong>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Volume overload lesions such as VSD, PDA, and ECD are the most common causes of CHF in the first 6 months of life.</li>
                                    <li>In infancy, the time of the onset of CHF varies predictably with the type of defect. Table 19-1 lists common defects according to the age at which CHF develops.</li>
                                    <li>Large L-R shunt lesions, such as VSD and PDA, do not cause CHF before 6 to 8 weeks of age because the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) does not fall low enough to cause a large shunt until this age. CHF may occur earlier in premature infants (within the first month) because of an earlier fall in the PVR.</li>
                                    <li>Note that children with TOF do not develop CHF and that ASDs rarely cause CHF in the pediatric age group, although they can cause CHF in adulthood.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Acquired heart disease.</strong> Acquired heart disease of various etiologies can lead to CHF. Common entities (with the approximate time of onset of CHF) are as follows.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Viral myocarditis (in toddlers, occasionally in neonates with fulminating course).</li>
                                    <li>Myocarditis associated with Kawasaki disease (1 to 4 years of age).</li>
                                    <li>Acute rheumatic carditis (in school-age children).</li>
                                    <li>Rheumatic valvular heart diseases, such as MR or AR (older children and adults).</li>
                                    <li>Dilated cardiomyopathy (at any age during childhood and adolescence).</li>
                                    <li>Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (months to years after chemotherapy).</li>
                                    <li>Cardiomyopathies associated with muscular dystrophy and Friedreich's ataxia (in older children and adolescents).</li>

                        <p>The diagnosis of CHF relies on several sources of clinical findings, including history, physical examination, chest radiographs, and echo studies. There is no single laboratory test that is diagnostic of CHF in pediatric patients.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Poor feeding of recent onset, tachypnea, poor weight gain, and cold sweat on the forehead suggest CHF in infants. In older children, shortness of breath, especially with activities, easy fatigability, puffy eyelids, or swollen feet may be presenting complaints.</li>
                            <li>Physical findings can be divided by pathophysiologic subgroups.
                                <ol type="a">

                                    <li>Signs of pulmonary venous congestion (left-sided failure) include tachypnea, dyspnea on exertion (or poor feeding in small infants), orthopnea in older children, and rarely wheezing and pulmonary crackles.</li>
                                    <li>Signs of systemic venous congestion (right-sided failure) include hepatomegaly and puffy eyelids. Distended neck veins and ankle edema are not seen in infants.</li>

                            <li>Echo studies confirm the presence of chamber enlargement or impaired LV function and help determine the cause of CHF.</li>

Plasma levels of these peptides are normally elevated in the first weeks of life.</li>

                                    <li>Nutritional supports are important. Infants in CHF need significantly higher caloric intakes than recommended for average children. The required calorie intakes may be as high as 150 to 160 kcal/kg/day for infants in CHF.</li>
                                    <li>Increasing caloric density of feeding may be required and it may be accomplished with fortification of feeding (see Box 19-1). Frequent small feedings are better tolerated than large feedings in infants.</li>
                                    <li>If oral feedings are not well tolerated, intermittent or continuous nasogastric (NG) feeding is indicated. To promote normal development of oralmotor function, infants may be allowed to take calorie-dense oral feeds throughout the day and then be given continuous NG feeds overnight.</li>
                                    <li>For older children with heart failure, salt restriction (<0.5 g/day) and avoidance of salty snacks (chips, pretzels) and table salt are recommended. Bed rest remains an important component of management. The availability of a television and computer games for entertainment assures bed rest in older children.</li>

                            <li>Clinically, it is common to use multiple classes of agents (usually a combination of inotropic agents, diuretics, and vasodilators) to produce both increased cardiac output and decreased filling pressure.</li>

Use of digoxin in infants with large L-R shunt lesions (e.g., large VSD) is controversial because ventricular contractility is normal in this situation. However, studies have shown that digoxin improves symptoms in these infants, perhaps because of other actions of digoxin, such as parasympathomimetic action and diuretic action.</li>
