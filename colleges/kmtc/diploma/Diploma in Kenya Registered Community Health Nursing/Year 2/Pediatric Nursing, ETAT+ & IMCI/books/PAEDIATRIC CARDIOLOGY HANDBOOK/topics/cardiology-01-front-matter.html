                        <p>Since the publication of the fourth edition of The Pediatric Cardiology Handbook, important advances have been made in both the diagnosis and treatment of children with congenital and acquired heart diseases. These advances make it necessary to update the handbook. Although extensive updating and revisions have been made throughout the book, the handbook maintains its original goal of providing readers with fundamental and practical information in the management of children with cardiac problems.</p>
                        <p>Although every topic and chapter has been updated, certain congenital heart defects received more extensive revision, including infective endocarditis, cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias, and long QT syndrome. A major revision has been made in dyslipidemias with inclusion of the new recommendations on lipid screening for children. Sections on blood pressure and systemic hypertension have been extensively rewritten. Normative blood pressure standards for auscillometric and oscillometric methods obtained in the San Antonio Children's Blood Pressure Study are recommended because they are the only standards obtained by the currently recommended methods. For the chapter on electrocardiography, normative data used are from the recently revised fourth edition of my book How to Read Pediatric ECGs. The two-dimensional echocardiographic section has been expanded and detailed normative values of echocardiography are included in Appendix D. In the area of cardiac surgery, new approaches such as hybrid procedures have been updated and the recommended timing of some procedures has been updated.</p>
                        <p>I wish to acknowledge the contributions of the following individuals in the revision. Dr. Mehrdad Salamat, MD, Attending Cardiologist at the Driscoll Children's Hospital and Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, has updated two chapters in the "Cardiac Surgical Patients" section. Dr. Salamat was also instrumental in updating drug dosages with the addition of newer drugs that are used in the practice of pediatric cardiology. Paula Scott, PhD, MLS, and Cindy Munoz, BA, librarians at the Driscoll Children's Hospital, helped me with literature search throughout the project. Linda Lopez, a cardiac sonographer (and the manager of Driscoll's McAllen Cardiology Clinic) provided me with valuable suggestions on the echocardiographic illustrations. Most of all, I thank my wife, Issun, for her understanding during my long period of preoccupation with the project.</p>
                        <p>I believe this handbook will be an important companion to cardiology fellows, pediatricians, family practitioners, house staff, and medical students. This handbook will also serve well any health care providers who deal with children, including physician assistants, nurse practioners, and nursing students. This handbook may prove to be a very useful compendium even for practicing cardiologists because it makes basic and advanced information in the practice of cardiology available instantly.</p>
