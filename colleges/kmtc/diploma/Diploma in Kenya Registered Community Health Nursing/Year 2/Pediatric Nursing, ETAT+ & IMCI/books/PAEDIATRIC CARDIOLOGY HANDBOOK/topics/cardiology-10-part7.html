                        <p>The current trend is to carry out total repair of CHDs at an early age whenever such repair is technically possible. Early total repair may obviate the need for palliative procedures. This may also prevent pulmonary vascular disease or permanent damages to the cardiovascular system, which is known to develop in certain CHDs. However, recommendations for the timing and type of operation vary from institution to institution. The improved results currently seen with pediatric cardiac surgery are in part attributed to improved operative techniques and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) methods. In addition, the coordinated multidisciplinary approach has contributed to significant decrease in perioperative morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Open heart procedures use CPB with some degree of hypothermia and a varying duration of low flow or circulatory arrest. Open procedures are required for repair of intracardiac anomalies (e.g., VSD, TOF, TGA). Closed procedures do not require CPB; they are performed for repair of extracardiac anomalies (e.g., COA, PDA) or palliative procedures (e.g., B-T shunt procedures or PA banding). The following sections outline some basic aspects of pre- and postoperative management of cardiac patients for pediatricians.</p>

                            <p>Good preoperative preparation including complete delineation of cardiac anatomy and assessment of hemodynamics is mandatory for a smooth operative and postoperative course. Some infants require preoperative stabilization with prostaglandin E1 (continuous IV drip at 0.01-0.1 mcg/kg/min) to maintain ductus arteriosus patency while others may need inotropic and lusitropic support. Patients with TGA and restrictive PFO may require balloon atrial septostomy.</p>

                                <li><strong>General care:</strong> Successful postoperative management requires accurate monitoring and documentation of the patient's vital signs, medication administration, and laboratory results. Vital signs including heart rate, arterial or noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate are monitored closely (e.g., every 15 to 60 min). Urine and chest tube outputs, end-tidal or transcutaneous CO2, central venous pressure, and, at times, right and left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures are recorded meticulously. All administered medications, enteral or parenteral fluids, and blood products are documented. Fluid balance is monitored continuously. Laboratory results and their trends are charted for review electronically.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pulmonary system</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Arterial blood gases are in the acceptable normal range.</li>
                                        <li>Chest radiography shows no evidence of pneumothorax, atelectasis, pleural effusion, or elevation of hemidiaphragm.</li>

                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Warm skin, full peripheral pulses with brisk capillary refill, normal blood pressure (BP), and an adequate urine output (at least 1 ml/kg/hr) are clinical evidence of good cardiac output. Decrease in expected systemic venous saturation is a sensitive predictor of low cardiac output. A normal systemic arterial-to-venous oxygen saturation difference of less than 30% is indicative of good cardiac output.</li>
                                        <li>Mild arterial hypertension is present in the early postoperative period following CPB (due to increased levels of catecholamines, plasma renin, or angiotensin II).</li>
                                        <li>Cardiac rhythm should be sinus and the heart rate relatively high. Ranges of heart rate (beats/min) in normally convalescing postoperative patients are as follows:</li>

                                        <li>Less than 6 months: 110 to 190</li>
                                        <li>6 to 12 months: 100 to 170</li>
                                        <li>1 to 3 years: 90 to 160</li>

                                <li><strong>Renal system:</strong> Adequate urine output (i.e., above 1 mL/kg/hr) and evidence of adequate solute excretion (e.g., serum K+ below 5 mEq/L; BUN below 40 mg/dL; creatinine below 1 mg/dL) are signs of normal renal function.</li>
                                <li><strong>Metabolic system</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Retention of water and sodium and depletion of whole-body potassium are commonly seen following open heart surgeries. They result in mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia, and a 5% weight gain. In anticipation of fluid overload, mechanical ultrafiltration is performed in selected cases intraoperatively.</li>
                                        <li>Mild metabolic acidosis (with a base deficit of -4 mEq/L) associated with mild lactic acidemia is common in the first few hours after CPB and does not usually require treatment.</li>
                                        <li>Varying degrees of fever are nearly always present during the first few days, and extensive workup for infection is not indicated. Causes of fever include reaction to CPB, reaction to homologous blood, atelectasis, pleural effusion, low cardiac output, infection, and brain stem damage.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li><strong>Gastrointestinal system:</strong> As the splanchnic circulation receives over 25% of total cardiac output avoidance of low cardiac output syndrome is the principal strategy to avoid gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Feedings are started after the patient becomes hemodynamically stable and are advanced as tolerated. Daily caloric count and its adjustment are crucial. H2-receptor antagonists (ranitidine, 1 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 to 8 hours) or protein pump inhibitors (e.g., esomeprazole 0.5-1 mg/kg/dose IV every 24 hours, maximum pediatric dose 20 mg/day) are initiated for gastric protection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hematologic system:</strong> Clotting studies should be normal, and hemoglobin should be at least 9.5 g/dL or higher depending on the patient's age, cardiac anatomy, and surgical procedure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Neurologic system:</strong> The patient should respond appropriately for the level of sedation without evidence of neurologic defects (e.g., hemiplegia, visual field defects) or seizures. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for transcranial cerebral oximetry is a noninvasive method to monitor frontal lobe oxygen metabolism. Cerebral oxygen saturation, measured by NIRS, is a composite of the oxygen saturation in combined cerebral arterial and venous vascular bed (arterial and venous blood flow ratio of ≈ 25:75, with negligible capillary blood). It is a helpful method to detect cerebral hypoxia during low cardiac output states.</li>

                            <p>A small amount of fluid is present in the pleural cavity. The reabsorption of this pleural fluid is mainly through the venous system and to some degree through the lymphatic system. Any increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure as a result of disrupted systemic venous hemodynamics (e.g., Fontan surgery, right ventricular failure) may result in accumulation of transudates in the pleural cavity. Trauma to the lymphatic system as is caused by cutting large tributaries of the thoracic duct causes buildup of chyle in the pleural space. Both conditions create a management problem.</p>
                            <p>Duration of persistent pleural effusion, as a result of increased systemic venous pressure which is common after Fontan operation, may be shortened by intraoperative creation of baffle fenestration. Symptoms may include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. Diagnosis is usually made by chest radiography (frontal, lateral, and decubitus films). Thoracentesis (with ultrasonographic guidance) may be necessary for determination of etiology and/or for treatment. Transudates can be differentiated by amount of protein (less than 3 g/100 mL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (less than 200 IU/L) from exudates (protein of more than 3 g/100 mL and LDH of more than 200 IU/L) which are caused by increased capillary permeability and may be a sign of infection. In addition, transudates have fewer leukocytes (less than 10,000/mm³) and have a serous appearance compared to exudates, which are cloudy and have significantly more leukocytes (more than 50,000/mm³). Furthermore, fluid-to-serum ratios of LDH (more than 0.6) and protein (more than 0.5) are further clues to the exudative nature of the fluid.</p>
                            <p>A small amount of pleural effusion can be tolerated well. It usually responds to medical management with diuresis, afterload reduction, and inotropic support. However, significant amounts of pleural effusion will cause cardiorespiratory compromise and will require more aggressive management strategies, including chest tube drainage, pleurodesis with a sclerosing agent (e.g., talc), or even Fontan revision. When the drainage is large, appropriate replacement of fluid, electrolytes, and protein is essential.</p>
                            <p>Chylothorax, an accumulation of chyle in the pleural cavity, may be caused by trauma to peritracheal lymphatics or transmission of increased systemic venous pressure to the thoracic duct, or a combination of both. It may be seen after surgery (up to about 6% of cases) such as COA repair, B-T shunt, or cavopulmonary anastomosis (e.g., Glenn or Fontan operation), or, rarely, after ligation of PDA. Occasionally, chylothorax occurs in combination with chylopericardium.</p>
                            <p>Chyle may or may not have a creamy appearance, depending on the nutritional status of the patient (consumption of fat results in creamy appearance), but a triglyceride level above 110 mg/dL is highly probable for the diagnosis whereas a triglyceride concentration of less than 50 mg/dL almost rules out chylothorax. The fluid is usually sterile and is abundant of lymphocytes (2000-20,000/mm³).</p>
                            <p>Treatment, apart from medical management described previously, is directed at drainage of chylothorax (chest tube placement) and reducing the flow of lymph (by limiting physical activity to reduce lymph flow from the extremities).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In most cases, chest tube drainage is all that is necessary. If chylothorax develops after chest tube removal, needle aspiration every 3 to 4 days usually constitutes adequate treatment. The drainage slows or stops within 7 days in most cases.</li>
                                <li>Careful attention to the nutrition of the patient is important. Either parenteral hyperalimentation or a diet with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) as the fat source is called for. As MCT oil does not contribute in chylomicron formation, it is absorbed by the portal system and not by the lymphatic system. Serum albumin should be followed closely and replaced if necessary.</li>
                                <li>In some case reports, continuous IV octreotide (0.5-10 mcg/kg/hr), a somatostatin analog, has been used effectively.</li>
                                <li>If the drainage persists, surgical intervention may be considered because continuous loss of chyle results in lymphocyte depletion and subsequent immunocompromise. Indications for the intervention may include (1) average daily loss above 1000 mL, or, in children, 100 mL/year of age for 5 days, (2) the chyle flow not slowing after 2 weeks, or (3) imminent nutritional complications.</li>
                                <li>Thoracic duct ligation with or without chemical pleurodesis has been used successfully. During pleurodesis, the introduced chemicals cause inflammation between the parietal and visceral pleura. This reaction causes adhesions between the layers and prevents further fluid accumulation. The procedure may be painful and cause fever and nausea.</li>
