                            <p>TGA constitutes 5% of all CHD. It is more common in boys (3:1).</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathology and Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The aorta (AO) and the pulmonary artery are transposed, with the AO arising anteriorly from the RV, and the PA arising posteriorly from the LV. The end result is complete separation of the two circuits, with hypoxemic blood circulating in the body and hyperoxemic blood circulating in the pulmonary circuit (Fig. 9-1). The classic complete TGA is called d-transposition, in which the aorta is located anteriorly and to the right of the PA; hence, d-TGA. (When the transposed aorta lies to the left of the PA, it is called l-transposition.)</li>
                                <li>Defects that permit mixing of the two circulations, such as ASD, VSD, and PDA, are necessary for survival. A VSD is present in 40% of cases. In about 50% of the patients no associated defects are present other than PFO, small ASD, or small PDA.</li>
                                <li>LVOT obstruction (subpulmonary stenosis), either dynamic or fixed obstruction, occurs in about 5% of patients without VSD. PS occurs in 30% to 35% of patients with VSD.</li>
                                <li>In neonates with poor mixing of the two circulations, progressive hypoxia and acidosis result in early death, requiring an early intervention.</li>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cyanosis and signs of CHF develop in the newborn period. Severe arterial hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen inhalation and acidosis are present in neonates with poor mixing. Hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia are occasionally present.</li>
                                <li>Auscultatory findings are nonspecific. The S2 is single and loud. No heart murmur is audible in infants with intact ventricular septum. When TGA is associated with VSD or PS, a systolic murmur of these defects may be audible.</li>
                                <li>The ECG shows RAD and RVH. An upright T wave in V1 after 3 days of age may be the only abnormality suggestive of RVH. BVH may be present in infants with large VSD, PDA, or PS.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs show cardiomegaly with increased PVMs. An egg-shaped cardiac silhouette with a narrow superior mediastinum is characteristic.</li>
                                <li>Two-dimensional echo study is diagnostic.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>It fails to show a "circle-and-sausage" pattern of the normal great arteries in the parasternal short-axis view. Instead, it shows two circular structures.</li>
                                        <li>Other views show the PA arising from the LV and the aorta arising from the RV.</li>
                                        <li>Associated defects (VSD, LVOT obstruction, PS, ASD, and PDA) can be imaged.</li>
                                        <li>The status of atrial communication, both before and after balloon septostomy, is best evaluated in the subcostal view.</li>
                                        <li>The coronary arteries can be imaged in most patients in the parasternal and apical views.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Natural history and prognosis depend on anatomy.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Infants with intact ventricular septum are the sickest group, but they demonstrate the most dramatic improvement following PGE1 infusion or the Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy.</li>
                                        <li>Infants with VSD or large PDA are the least cyanotic group but are most likely to develop CHF and PVOD (beginning as early as 3 or 4 months of age).</li>
                                        <li>Combination of VSD and PS allows considerably longer survival without surgery, but repair surgery carries a high risk.</li>
                                        <li>Cerebrovascular accident and progressive PVOD, particularly in infants with large VSD or PDA, are rare late complications.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                <li>Metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypocalcemia should be treated if present.</li>
                                <li>PGE1 infusion is started to raise arterial oxygen saturation by reopening the ductus.</li>
                                <li>Administration of oxygen may help raise systemic arterial oxygen saturation by lowering PVR and increasing PBF, with resulting increase in mixing.</li>
                                <li>A therapeutic balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure) may be performed. The balloon procedure is needed when (a) there is inadequate atrial mixing through the PFO (evidenced by a high Doppler flow velocity of >1 m/sec) and/or (b) immediate surgical intervention is not ready or planned. Occasionally, blade atrial septostomy may be performed for older infants and those for whom the initial balloon atrial septostomy is not successful.</li>
                                <li>Treatment of CHF with diuretics (and digoxin) may be indicated.</li>

                                <li>As a definitive surgery, the right- and left-sided structures are switched at the atrial level (Senning operation), at the ventricular level (Rastelli operation), or at the great artery level (arterial switch operation).

                                        <li>Intraatrial repair surgeries (e.g., Senning operation) are no longer performed, except in rare cases, because of undesirable late complications (such as obstruction to the pulmonary or systemic venous return, TR, arrhythmias, and depressed systemic ventricular (i.e., RV) function.</li>
                                        <li>Rastelli operation, which redirects the pulmonary and systemic venous blood, is carried out at the ventricular level. It may be carried out in patients with VSD and severe PS. A valved conduit or a homograft is placed between the RV and the PA (Fig. 9-2). This procedure is less popular because of late complications and a high surgical mortality rate (10% and 29%). Two alternative procedures are now available: REV procedure and Nikaidoh procedure (see the following for discussion of these procedures).</li>
                                        <li>Arterial switch operation (ASO) is the procedure of choice (Fig. 9-3). This procedure provides anatomic correction with infrequent complications. For this procedure to be successful, the LV pressure should be near systemic levels at the time of surgery, and therefore should be performed before 3 weeks of age. Possible complications include coronary artery occlusion, supravalvar PS, supravalvar neoaortic stenosis, and AR.</li>
                                        <li>REV procedure (réparation à l'étage ventriculaire) may be performed for patients with associated VSD and severe PS (Fig. 9-4). The procedure comprises the following: (1) infundibular resection to enlarge the VSD,</li>

                                <li>Visceroatrial relationship is normal (the RA on the right of the LA). The RA empties into the anatomic LV through the mitral valve, and the LA empties into the RV through the tricuspid valve. For this to occur, the LV lies to the right of the RV (i.e., ventricular inversion). The great arteries are transposed, with the aorta arising from the RV and the PA arising from the LV. The aorta lies to the left of and anterior to the PA (hence L-TGA). The final result is a functional correction in that oxygenated blood coming into the LA goes out the aorta (Fig. 9-8).</li>
                                <li>Theoretically, no functional abnormalities exist, but unfortunately most cases are complicated by associated defects. VSD (occurring in 80%) and PS (in 50%) with or without VSD are common, resulting in cyanosis. Regurgitation of the systemic AV valve (tricuspid) occurs in 30% of the patients. Varying degrees of AV block, which are sometimes progressive, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are also frequent.</li>
                                <li>The cardiac apex is in the right chest (dextrocardia) in about 50% of patients.</li>

                                <li>The S 2 is single and loud. A grade 2 to 4/6 harsh holosystolic murmur along the LLSB may indicate a VSD or the systemic AV valve (tricuspid) regurgitation. A grade 2 to 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the ULSB or URSB may indicate PS.</li>
                                <li>Characteristic ECG findings are the absence of Q waves in V 5 and V 6 and/or the presence of Q waves in V4R or V1. Varying degrees of AV block, including complete heart block, may be present. Atrial and/or ventricular hypertrophy may be present in complicated cases.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs may show a characteristic straight left upper cardiac border (formed by the ascending aorta). Cardiomegaly and increased PVMs suggest associated VSD. Dextrocardia is frequent (50%).</li>
                                <li>Two-dimensional echo is diagnostic of the condition and associated defects.

                                <li>The VSD is a perimembranous defect with extension into the infundibular septum.

The pulmonary valve is atretic in 10% of the patients.

Most infants with TOF are symptomatic, with cyanosis, clubbing, dyspnea on exertion, squatting, or hypoxic spells. Patients with acyanotic TOF may be asymptomatic.</li>
                                <li>A right ventricular tap and a systolic thrill at the MLSB are usually found. An ejection click of aortic origin, a loud and single S 2, and a loud (grade 3 to 5/6) systolic ejection murmur at the middle and upper LSB are present (Fig. 9-11). Occasionally a continuous murmur representing PDA shunt may be audible in a deeply cyanotic neonate who has TOF with pulmonary atresia. In the acyanotic form, a long systolic murmur resulting from VSD and infundibular stenosis is audible along the entire LSB, and cyanosis is absent.</li>
                                <li>The ECG shows RAD and RVH. BVH may be seen in the acyanotic form.</li>
                                <li>In cyanotic TOF, chest radiographs show normal heart size, decreased PVMs, and a boot-shaped heart with a concave MPA segment. Right aortic arch is present in 25% of the cases. Chest radiographs of acyanotic TOF are indistinguishable from those of a small to moderate VSD.</li>

The anatomy of the RVOT, pulmonary valve, pulmonary annulus, and main PA and its branches is imaged in the parasternal short-axis view.

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>General description.</strong> Hypoxic spell (also called cyanotic spell or "tet" spell) is characterized by (1) a paroxysm of hyperpnea (rapid and deep respiration), (2) irritability and prolonged crying, (3) increasing cyanosis, and (4) decreased intensity of the heart murmur. A severe spell may lead to limpness, convulsion, cerebrovascular accident, or even death. It occurs in young infants, with peak incidence between 2 and 4 months of age. Hypoxic spell requires timely recognition and prompt appropriate treatment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pathophysiology of hypoxic spell:</strong> In TOF, the RV and LV can be viewed as a single pumping chamber, as there are large VSD equalizing pressures in both ventricles (see Fig. 9-12). Lowering the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) or increasing resistance at the RVOT will increase the R-L shunting, and this in turn stimulates the respiratory center to produce hyperpnea. Hyperpnea results in an increase in systemic venous return, which in turn increases the R-L shunt through the VSD, as there is an obstruction at the RVOT. A vicious circle becomes established (Fig. 9-13).</li>
                                <li><strong>Treatment of hypoxic spell:</strong> The aim of the treatment is to break the vicious circle of hypoxic spell (as shown in Fig. 9-13). One or more of the following may be employed in decreasing order of preference:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Pick up the infant and hold in a knee-chest position.</li>
                                        <li>Morphine sulfate, 0.1 to $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{SC}$ or IM , suppresses the respiratory center and abolishes hyperpnea.</li>
                                        <li>Treat acidosis with sodium bicarbonate, $1 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV. This reduces the respiratory center-stimulating effect of acidosis.</li>
                                        <li>Oxygen inhalation has only limited value, because the problem is a reduced PBF, not the ability to oxygenate.</li>

                                <li>With these treatments the infant usually becomes less cyanotic and the heart murmur becomes louder, indicating improved PBF. If not fully responsive with the above measures, the following may be tried.
