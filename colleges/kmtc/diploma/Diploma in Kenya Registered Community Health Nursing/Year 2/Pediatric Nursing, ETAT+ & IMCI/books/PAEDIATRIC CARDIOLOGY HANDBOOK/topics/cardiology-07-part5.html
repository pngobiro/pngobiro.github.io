                        <p>Primary myocardial disease affects the heart muscle itself and is not associated with congenital, valvular, or coronary heart disease or systemic disorders. Cardiomyopathy has been classified into three types based on anatomic and functional features: (1) hypertrophic, (2) dilated (or congestive), and (3) restrictive (Fig. 11-1). Recently two new classifications have been added: arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular noncompaction. Different subtypes of cardiomyopathy are functionally different from one another, and the demands of therapy are also different.</p>

                            <p>In about 30% to 60% of cases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) appears to be genetically transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, and in the remainder, it occurs sporadically. HCM is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in teens and young adults, especially among athletes.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathology and Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A massive ventricular hypertrophy is present. Although asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH), formerly known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), is the most common type, a concentric hypertrophy with symmetric thickening of the LV sometimes occurs. Occasionally an intracavitary obstruction may develop during systole, partly because of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve against the hypertrophied septum, called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).</li>
                                <li>So-called apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a variant of HCM in which hypertrophy is confined to the left ventricular apex, without intracavitary obstruction (and with giant negative T waves on the ECG). This subtype is present in about 25% of patients with HCM in Japan and less than 10% in other parts of the world.</li>
                                <li>The myocardium itself has an enhanced contractile state, but diastolic ventricular filling is impaired because of abnormal stiffness of the LV. This may lead to LA enlargement and pulmonary venous congestion, producing congestive symptoms (exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea).</li>
                                <li>About 80% of LV stroke volume occurs in the early part of systole when little or no obstruction exists, resulting in a sharp upstroke of arterial pulse.</li>

                                <li>A unique aspect of HOCM is the variability of the degree of obstruction from moment to moment.

                                        <li>The obstruction to LV output worsens when LV volume is reduced (as seen with positive inotropic agents, reduced blood volume, lowering of SVR, and so on).</li>
                                        <li>The obstruction lessens when the LV systolic volume increases (negative inotropic agents, leg raising, blood transfusion, increasing SVR, and so on).</li>

                                <li>10% to 20% of infants of diabetic mothers develop a transient form of HCM with or without LVOT obstruction. Children with LEOPARD syndrome commonly have HOCM (see Table 1-1).</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Some 30% to 60% of cases are seen in adolescents and young adults with positive family history. Easy fatigability, dyspnea, palpitation, or anginal chest pain may be the presenting complaint.</li>
                                <li>A sharp upstroke of the arterial pulse is characteristic. A late systolic ejection murmur may be audible at the middle and lower LSB or at the apex. A holosystolic murmur (of MR) is occasionally present. The intensity and even the presence of the heart murmur vary from examination to examination in patients with HOCM .</li>
                                <li>The ECG may show LVH, ST-T changes, abnormally deep Q waves with diminished or absent R waves in the left precordial leads (LPLs), and arrhythmias. Occasionally "giant" negative T waves are seen in the LPLs in patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs may show mild LV enlargement with globular heart.</li>
                                <li>Echo studies may demonstrate the following.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>LV hypertrophy can be seen as concentric hypertrophy, localized segmental hypertrophy, asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH), or localized to the apex.</li>
                                        <li>ASH is present when the septal thickness is 1.4 times or greater than the posterior LV wall thickness.</li>
                                        <li>In obstructive type, systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve may be demonstrated. Doppler peak gradient in the LVOT of $\geq 30 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg indicates an obstructive type.</li>
                                        <li>In adults, LV diastolic wall thickness $\geq 15 \mathrm{~mm}$ (or on occasion, 13 or 14 mm), usually with LV dimension <45 mm, is accepted as HCM. For children, z-score of 2 or more relative to BSA is compatible with the diagnosis.</li>
                                        <li>Highly trained athletes may show LV hypertrophy, but the LV wall thickness $\geq 13 \mathrm{~mm}$ is very uncommon. In addition, it is always associated with an enlarged LV cavity (with LV diastolic dimension >54 mm, with ranges of 55 to 63 mm). Therefore, trained adult athletes with LV wall thickness >16 mm and a nondilated LV cavity are likely to have HCM.</li>
                                        <li>The Doppler examination of the mitral inflow demonstrates signs of diastolic dysfunction with a decreased E velocity, an increased A velocity, and a decreased E/A ratio (usually <0.8) (Fig. 11-2). These abnormalities are, however, nonspecific for HCM; they are also seen with dilated cardiomyopathy.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li>Obstruction may be absent, stable, or progressive (especially in genetically predisposed individuals).</li>
                                        <li>Sudden death may occur during exercise, especially in those with episodes of ventricular tachycardia.</li>
                                        <li>Atrial fibrillation may cause stroke.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The goals of management are to (1) reduce LVOT obstruction (by reducing LV contractility and by increasing LV volume), (2) increase ventricular compliance, and (3) prevent sudden death (by preventing or treating ventricular arrhythmias). However, most therapeutic modalities used do not significantly reduce mortality rate.</li>
                                <li>General care.

                                        <li>Patients with HCM should avoid strenuous exercise or competitive sports, regardless of age, gender, symptoms, LVOT obstruction, or treatment.</li>

These drugs reduce the degree of obstruction, decrease the incidence of anginal pain, and have antiarrhythmic actions.

                                        <li>A combination therapy with atenolol and verapamil may be considered in those patients with excessive LV hypertrophy and severe LVOT obstruction.</li>
                                        <li>In small children, propranolol is the drug of choice due to liquid formulation and low side-effect profile. The dosage is 2 to 5 mg/kg/day given in 3 divided doses, with the heart rate goal of 80 to 100 beats per minute.</li>
                                        <li>In older children, atenolol is typically used.</li>
                                        <li>In infants of diabetic mothers, $\beta$-adrenergic blockers are used when the LVOT obstruction is present. In most of these infants, LV hypertrophy spontaneously resolves within the first 6 to 12 months of life.</li>

                                <li>Prophylactic therapy with either $\beta$-adrenergic blockers or verapamil is controversial in patients without LVOT obstruction. Some favor prophylactic use of these drugs even in the absence of LVOT obstruction; others limit prophylactic drug therapy to young patients with a family history of premature sudden death and those with particularly marked LVH.</li>
                                <li>The following drugs are contraindicated: digitalis, other inotropic agents, and vasodilators tend to increase LVOT obstruction; diuretics may reduce LV volume and increase LVOT obstruction (but may be used in small doses to improve respiratory symptoms).</li>
                                <li>Morrow's myotomy-myectomy or percutaneous alcohol ablation may be considered for drug-refractory patients with LVOT obstruction.

                            <p>Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) affects 0.5:1000 to 1:1000 hospital patients, excluding those with postoperative endocarditis.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathology and Pathogenesis</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Two factors are important in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (IE): (1) structural abnormalities of the heart or great arteries with a significant pressure gradient or turbulence, with resulting endothelial damage and platelet-fibrin thrombus formation, and (2) bacteremia, even if transient, with adherence of the organisms and eventual invasion of the underlying tissue.</li>
                                <li>Those with a prosthetic heart valve or prosthetic material in the heart are at particularly high risk for IE because these promote deposition of sterile thrombus.</li>
                                <li>Almost all patients who develop IE have a history of congenital or acquired heart disease. Drug addicts may develop endocarditis in the absence of known cardiac anomalies.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Microbiology</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In the past, Streptococcus viridans, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were responsible for over 90% of cases of IE. In recent years, this frequency has decreased to 50% to 60%, with a concomitant increase in cases caused by fungus and HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella).</li>
                                <li>Alpha-hemolytic streptococci (S. viridans) are the most common cause of IE following dental procedures or in those patients with carious teeth or periodontal disease.</li>
                                <li>Enterococci are the organisms most often found after genitourinary or gastrointestinal surgery or instrumentation.</li>
                                <li>The organisms most commonly found in postoperative endocarditis are staphylococci.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Most patients are known to have an underlying heart disease. The onset is usually insidious with prolonged low-grade fever ($101^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ and $103^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$) and various somatic complaints.</li>
                                <li>Heart murmur is almost always present and splenomegaly is common (70%).</li>
                                <li>Skin manifestations (50%) may be present in the following forms:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Petechiae on the skin, mucous membranes, or conjunctivae are frequent.</li>
                                        <li>Osler nodes (tender, pea-sized red nodes at the ends of the fingers or toes) are rare in children.</li>
                                        <li>Janeway lesions (small, painless, hemorrhagic areas on the palms or soles) are rare.</li>
                                        <li>Splinter hemorrhages (linear hemorrhagic streaks beneath the nails) also are rare.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Embolic or immunologic phenomena in other organs are present in 50% of cases.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Pulmonary emboli or hematuria and renal failure may occur.</li>
                                        <li>Seizures and hemiparesis (20%) may occur.</li>
                                        <li>Roth spots (oval, retinal hemorrhages with pale centers located near the optic disc) occur in <5% of patients.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li>Positive blood cultures are obtained in more than 90% of patients in the absence of previous antimicrobial therapy.</li>
                                        <li>Anemia and leukocytosis with a shift to the left are common.</li>
                                        <li>The sedimentation rate is increased unless there is polycythemia.</li>
                                        <li>Microscopic hematuria is found in 30% of patients.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Echocardiography. Although standard transthoracic echo (TTE) is sufficient in most cases, transesophageal echo (TEE) may be needed in obese or very muscular adolescents.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>The following echo findings are included as major criteria in the modified Duke criteria: (1) oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitation jets or on implanted material; (2) abscesses; (3) new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve; and (4) new valvular regurgitation.</li>
                                        <li>The absence of vegetations on echo does not in itself rule out IE. False negative diagnosis is possible if vegetations are small or have already embolized.</li>
                                        <li>Conversely, a false positive diagnosis is possible. An echogenic mass may represent a sterile thrombus, sterile prosthetic material, normal anatomic variation, an abnormal uninfected valve (previous scarring, severe myxomatous changes), or improper gain of the echo machine. Echo evidence of vegetation may persist for months or years after bacteriologic cure.</li>
                                        <li>Certain echo features suggest a high-risk case or a need for surgery: (1) large vegetations (greatest risk when the vegetation is >10 mm), (2) severe valvular regurgitation, (3) abscess cavities, (4) pseudoaneurysm, or (5) valvular perforation or dehiscence.</li>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is challenging. The modified Duke criteria are used in the diagnosis. There are three categories of diagnostic possibilities using the modified Duke criteria: definite, possible, and rejected. A diagnosis of "definite" IE is made either by pathologic evidence or fulfillment of certain clinical criteria (see Box 12-1). Box 12-2 shows definitions of major and minor clinical criteria.</p>

                        <p>Valvular heart disease is either congenital or acquired. Many congenital valvular abnormalities are associated with other major defects. A relatively isolated form of valvular heart disease is rheumatic in origin, which still occurs in some parts of the world. Among rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve involvement occurs in about three fourths and aortic valve involvement in about one fourth of the cases. Rheumatic involvement of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves almost never occurs. Although the cause of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is not entirely clear, it is discussed in this chapter.</p>

                            <p>MS of rheumatic origin is rare in children (because it requires 5 to 10 years from the initial attack to develop the condition), but it is the most common valvular involvement in adult rheumatic patients in areas where rheumatic fever is still prevalent.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathology and Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In rheumatic MS, thickening of the leaflets and fusion of the commissures dominate the pathologic findings. Calcification with immobility of the valve results over time.</li>
                                <li>A significant MS results in the enlargement of the LA, pulmonary venous hypertension, and pulmonary artery hypertension with resulting enlargement and hypertrophy of the right side of the heart.</li>
                                <li>In patients with severe MS, pulmonary congestion and edema, fibrosis of the alveolar walls, hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles, and loss of lung compliance result.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Children with mild MS are asymptomatic. With significant MS, dyspnea with or without exertion is the most common symptom in older children. Orthopnea, nocturnal dyspnea, or palpitation is present in more severe cases.</li>
                                <li>Neck veins are distended if right-sided heart failure supervenes. A loud S1 at the apex and a narrowly split S2 with accentuated P2 are audible if pulmonary hypertension is present (Fig. 13-1). An opening snap (a short snapping sound accompanying the opening of the mitral valve) and a low-frequency mitral diastolic rumble may be present at the apex. A crescendo presystolic murmur may be audible at the apex. Occasionally, a high-frequency diastolic murmur of PR (Graham Steell murmur) is present at the ULSB in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</li>

                                <li>The ECG may show RAD, LAH, and RVH (caused by pulmonary hypertension). Atrial fibrillation is rare in children.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs show enlargement of the LA and RV . The main PA segment is usually prominent.

                                <li>Most children with mild MS are asymptomatic but become symptomatic with exertion.</li>
                                <li>Atrial flutter or fibrillation and thromboembolism (related to the chronic atrial arrhythmias) are rare in children.</li>
                                <li>Hemoptysis can develop from the rupture of small vessels in the bronchi as a result of long-standing pulmonary venous hypertension.</li>

                                <li>Mild to moderate MS is managed with diuretics.</li>
                                <li>Balloon dilatation is an effective and safe option for children with rheumatic mitral stenosis.</li>
                                <li>If atrial fibrillation develops, propranolol, verapamil, or digoxin may be used to slow the ventricular rate. Intravenous procainamide may be used for conversion to sinus rhythm in hemodynamically stable patients.</li>
                                <li>For patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with warfarin should be started 3 weeks before cardioversion to prevent systemic embolization of atrial thrombus. Anticoagulation is continued for 4 weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm. Quinidine may prevent recurrence.</li>
                                <li>Varying degrees of restriction of activity may be indicated.</li>
                                <li>Recurrence of rheumatic fever should be prevented with penicillin or sulfonamide (see Acute Rheumatic Fever).</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Indications. The ACC/AHA 2006 Guidelines for surgical indications are as follows:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients (NYHA functional class III or IV) and mean Doppler MV gradient >10 mm Hg. Symptoms may include angina, syncope, or dyspnea on exertion.</li>
                                        <li>Surgery is reasonable in mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA functional class I) and mean Doppler MV gradient >10 mm Hg.</li>
                                        <li>Surgery is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with pulmonary artery pressure $\geq 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and mean MV gradient $\geq 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Procedures and mortality
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>For rheumatic MS, if balloon dilatation is unsuccessful, closed or open mitral commissurotomy remains the procedure of choice for those with pliable mitral valves without calcification or MR. The operative mortality rate is <1%.</li>
                                        <li>Mitral valve replacement. A prosthetic valve (Starr-Edwards, Bjork-Shiley, St. Jude) is inserted either in the annulus or in a supraannular position. The surgical mortality is 0 to 19%. All mechanical valves require anticoagulation with warfarin. Bioprostheses (porcine valve, heterograft valve) do not require anticoagulation therapy but require low-dose aspirin. Bioprostheses tend to deteriorate more rapidly due to calcific degeneration in children.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                <li>Regular checkups every 6 to 12 months with echo and Doppler studies should be done for possible progression of the disease or dysfunction of the repaired or replaced valve.</li>
                                <li>After replacement with a mechanical valve with no risk factors, warfarin is indicated to achieve an INR of 2.5 to 3.5. Low-dose aspirin is also indicated.</li>
                                <li>After replacement with a bioprosthesis with risk factors (which may include atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, LV dysfunction, and hypercoagulable state), warfarin is also indicated. When there are no risk factors after bioprosthesis placement, antiplatelet dose of aspirin alone is indicated.</li>

                            <li>The most common location of rhabdomyoma is in the ventricular septum or free wall.</li>
                            <li>The size ranges from several millimeters to several centimeters.</li>
                            <li>More than 50% of the cases have tuberous sclerosis (e.g., with adenoma of the sebaceous glands, mental retardation, seizures).</li>
                            <li>Tumors regress in size or number or both in most patients younger than 4 years of age. Spontaneous complete regression may occur.</li>
                            <li>They may produce symptoms of obstruction to blood flow, ventricular arrhythmias, SVT associated with WPW preexcitation, or sudden death.</li>

                            <li>The size of the tumor varies from several millimeters to centimeters.</li>
                            <li>The tumor may obstruct blood flow, disturb atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction, or cause arrhythmias.</li>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Description</h3>
                            <p>DiGeorge syndrome occurs in both males and females. Approximately 90% of patients have a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11.2) detectable with the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. Currently the term "22q11 deletion syndrome" is used.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                            <p>Clinical features are collectively grouped under the acronym of CATCH-22 (cardiac, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia resulting from 22q11 deletion).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cardiac.</strong> The great majority of patients (85%) with the syndrome have serious CHDs. The common ones include TOF (25%), interrupted aortic arch (15%), VSD (15%), persistent truncus arteriosus (9%), and isolated aortic arch anomalies (5%).</li>
                                <li><strong>Abnormal facies:</strong> hypertelorism, micrognathia, short philtrum with fish-mouth appearance, antimongoloid slant, telecanthus with short palpebral fissures, and low-set ears, often with defective pinna.</li>
                                <li><strong>Thymic hypoplasia</strong> or aplasia, with mild to moderate decrease in T-cell number.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cleft:</strong> anomalies in the palate (70-80%) with speech and feeding disorders.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hypocalcemia</strong> (60%) is due to hypoparathyroidism.</li>
                                <li><strong>General.</strong> Short stature, mental retardation, and hypotonia in infancy are frequent. Occasionally, psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) develop.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li>Correction of cardiac malformation is required; cardiac defects are major causes of early death.</li>
                                <li>Irradiated, cytomegalovirus-negative blood products must be administered because of the risk of graft versus host disease with nonirradiated products.</li>
                                <li>Monitoring of serum calcium levels and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D are important.

                                        <li>Calcium gluconate (Kalcinate), 500-750 mg/kg/day, PO, QID, or calcium carbonate (Oscal, Titralac, Oystercal, Caltrate), 112.5-162.5 mg/kg/day, given QID.</li>
                                        <li>Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), 25,000-200,000 U PO QD.</li>

                                <li>Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients with DiGeorge syndrome and in household members because of the risk of shedding live organisms.</li>
