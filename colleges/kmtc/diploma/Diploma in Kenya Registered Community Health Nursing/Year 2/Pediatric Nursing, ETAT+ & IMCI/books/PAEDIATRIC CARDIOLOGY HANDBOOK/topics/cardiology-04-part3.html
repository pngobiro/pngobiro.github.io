                                <li>Three types of atrial septal defects (ASDs) occur in the atrial septum (Fig. 7-1).

                                        <li>Secundum ASD is in the central portion of the septum and is the most common type (50% to 70% of ASDs).</li>
                                        <li>Primum ASD (or partial endocardial cushion defect [ECD]) is in the lower part of the septum (30% of ASDs).</li>
                                        <li>Sinus venosus defect is near the entrance of the SVC or IVC to the RA (about 10% of all ASDs). PAPVR is common with a sinus venous defect.</li>

                                <li>An L-R shunt occurs through the defect, with a volume overload to the RA and RV and an increase in pulmonary blood flow.</li>

                                <li>The patients are usually asymptomatic.</li>
                                <li>A widely split and fixed S 2 and a grade 2 to 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the ULSB are characteristic of moderate-size ASD (Fig. 7-2). With a large L-R shunt, a mid-diastolic rumble (resulting from relative TS) may be audible at the LLSB. The typical auscultatory findings are usually absent in infants and toddlers, even in those with a large defect, because the RV is not compliant enough to result in a large L-R shunt in these patients.</li>
                                <li>The ECG shows RAD (+90 to +180) and mild RVH, RBBB, or IRBBB with an rsR' pattern in V1.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs show cardiomegaly (with RAE and RVE), increased PVM, and a prominent MPA segment when the shunt is moderate or large.</li>

                                        <li>An ASD with a diameter >8 mm rarely closes spontaneously. Spontaneous closure is not likely to occur after 4 years of age. The defect may reduce in size in some patients.</li>

Surgery is usually delayed until 2 to 4 years of age, unless CHF develops. Open repair with a midsternal incision or minimally invasive cardiac surgical technique (with a smaller skin incision) is used. The surgical mortality rate is less than $1 \%$. High PVR ($\geq 10$ units $/ \mathrm{m}^{2}$) is a contraindication to surgery.</p>

                            <p>VSD is the most common form of CHD, accounting for $15\%$ to $20\%$ of all CHDs, not including those occurring as part of cyanotic CHDs.</p>

                                <li>The ventricular septum consists of a small membranous septum and a larger muscular septum. The muscular septum has three components: the inlet, infundibular, and trabecular (or simply muscular) septa (Fig. 7-4).</li>
                                <li>A membranous VSD often involves a varying amount of muscular septum adjacent to it (i.e., perimembranous VSD). The perimembranous defect is more common (70%) than the trabecular (5% to 20%), infundibular (5% to 7%), or inlet defects (5% to 8%). In the Far Eastern countries, the infundibular defects account for about $30 \%$. The perimembranous VSD is frequently associated with PDA and COA.</li>
                                <li>The VSD seen with TOF is a large nonrestrictive perimembranous defect with extension into the subpulmonary region.</li>
                                <li>The inlet VSD is typically seen with endocardial cushion defects.</li>
                                <li>In subarterial infundibular or supracristal VSD, the aortic valve may prolapse through the VSD, with resulting AR and reduction of the VSD shunt. The prolapse may occasionally occur with the perimembranous VSD.</li>
                                <li>In VSDs with small to moderate L-R shunts, volume overload is placed on the LA and LV (but not on the RV). With larger defects the RV is also under volume and pressure overload, in addition to a greater</li>

With a large VSD, pulmonary hypertension results. With a long-standing large VSD, pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD) develops, with severe pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis resulting from an R-L shunt. At this stage, surgical correction is nearly impossible.</p>

With large VSDs, delayed growth and development, repeated pulmonary infections, CHF, and decreased exercise tolerance are relatively common. With PVOD, cyanosis and a decreased level of activity may result.</li>
                                <li>With a small VSD, a grade 2 to 5/6 regurgitant systolic murmur (holosystolic or less than holosystolic) maximally audible at the LLSB is characteristic (Fig. 7-5). A systolic thrill may be present at the LLSB. With a large defect, an apical diastolic rumble is audible, which represents a relative stenosis of the mitral valve due to large pulmonary</li>

                                <li><strong>ECG findings:</strong> Small VSD, normal; moderate VSD, LVH and LAH ($\pm$); large VSD, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH) and LAH ($\pm$); PVOD, pure RVH.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chest radiographs</strong> reveal cardiomegaly of varying degrees with enlargement of the LA, LV, and possibly the RV. Pulmonary vascular markings (PVMs) are increased. The degree of cardiomegaly and the increase in PVMs are directly related to the magnitude of the L-R shunt. In PVOD, the heart is no longer enlarged and the MPA and the hilar pulmonary arteries are notably enlarged, but the peripheral lung fields are ischemic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Two-dimensional echo studies</strong> provide accurate diagnosis of the position and size of the VSD. LA and LV dimensions provide indirect assessment of the magnitude of the shunt. Figure 7-7 shows diagrams of 2D echo views of different parts of the ventricular septum, which helps identify different types of VSDs. The Doppler studies of the PA, TR (if present), and the VSD itself are useful in indirect assessment of RV and PA pressures (see Doppler echocardiography in Chapter 4).</li>

                                <li>PS may be valvular (90%), subvalvular (infundibular), or supravalvular (i.e., stenosis of the main PA). Stenosis of the PA branches is presented in Chapter 10.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>In valvular PS, the pulmonary valve is thickened, with fused or absent commissures and a small orifice. A poststenotic dilatation of the MPA usually develops with valvular PS.</li>
                                        <li>Dysplastic pulmonary valve (with thickened, irregular, immobile tissue) is frequently seen with Noonan syndrome.</li>
                                        <li>Infundibular PS is usually associated with a large VSD as seen in TOF. The poststenotic dilatation is not seen with subvalvular stenosis.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>In so-called double-chambered RV, abnormal muscular bands (running between the ventricular septum and the anterior wall) divide the RV cavity into a proximal high-pressure chamber and a distal low-pressure chamber.</li>
                                <li>Depending on the severity of PS, a varying degree of RVH develops. The RV is usually normal in size, but in newborns with critical PS, the RV is hypoplastic.</li>
                                <li>In general, three pathophysiologic changes occur in obstructive lesions such as PS (or AS). They are (1) systolic ejection murmur on auscultation, (2) hypertrophy of the responsible ventricle, and (3) poststenotic dilatation (Fig. 8-1).</li>

                                <li>Usually asymptomatic with mild PS. Exertional dyspnea and easy fatigability may be seen in moderately severe cases, and CHF occurs in severe cases. Neonates with critical PS are cyanotic and tachypneic.</li>
                                <li>An ejection click is present at the ULSB with valvular PS (Fig. 8-2). The S2 may split widely, and the P2 may be diminished in intensity. A systolic ejection murmur (grade 2 to 5/6) with or without systolic thrill is best audible at the ULSB and transmits fairly well to the back and axillae. The louder and longer the murmur, the more severe is the stenosis. Neonates with critical PS may have only a faint heart murmur, if any.</li>
                                <li>The ECG is normal in mild PS. RAD and RVH are present in moderate PS. RAH and RVH with "strain" pattern are present in severe PS.</li>
