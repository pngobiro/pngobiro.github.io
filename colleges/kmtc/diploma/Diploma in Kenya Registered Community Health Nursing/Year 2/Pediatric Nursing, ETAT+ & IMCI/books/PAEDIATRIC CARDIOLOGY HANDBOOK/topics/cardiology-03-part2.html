                        <p>A number of special tools are available to the cardiologist in the evaluation of cardiac patients. Noncardiologists have the opportunity to be exposed to some noninvasive tools, such as echocardiography, exercise stress test, and ambulatory ECG (e.g., Holter monitor). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are other noninvasive tools that have become popular in recent years. Cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography are invasive tests. Although catheter intervention procedures are not diagnostic, they are included in this section because they are usually performed with cardiac catheterization.</p>

                            <p>Echocardiography (echo) is an extremely useful noninvasive test used in the diagnosis and management of heart disease. An echo study currently begins with real-time two-dimensional echo, which produces high-resolution tomographic images of cardiac structures and their movement, and vascular structures leaving and entering the heart. With the support of Doppler and color flow mapping, echo studies provide reliable anatomic and quantitative information such as ventricular function, pressure gradients across cardiac valves and blood vessels, and estimation of pressures in the great arteries and ventricles.</p>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Two-Dimensional Echocardiography</h3>
                            <p>Routine two-dimensional echocardiography (2D echo) is obtained from four transducer locations: parasternal, apical, subcostal, and suprasternal notch positions. Abdominal and subclavicular views are also useful. Figures 4-1 through 4-9 illustrate selected standard 2D echo images of the heart and great vessels. A brief description of the standard 2D echo views follows.</p>
                            <p>Selected normal dimensions of cardiac structures and the great arteries are presented in Appendix D. These tables are frequently used in practice of pediatric cardiology. They include M-mode measurements of the LV (Table D-1); stand-alone M-mode measurements of the RV, aorta, and LA (Table D-2); aortic root and aorta (Table D-3); pulmonary valve and pulmonary arteries (Table D-4); and atrioventricular valves (Table D-5). Normal dimensions of coronary arteries are shown in Table D-6.</p>

                            <p>Most dimensions are measured during diastole, coincident with the onset of the QRS complex; the LA dimension and LV systolic dimension are exceptions (see Fig. 4-10). Normal values are shown as a function of growth (see Appendix D).</p>

                            <p>LV systolic function is evaluated by the fractional shortening (or shortening fraction) or ejection fraction.</p>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li><strong>Fractional shortening (or shortening fraction)</strong> is derived by the following formula:
                                <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{FS}(\%)=\mathrm{Dd}-\mathrm{Ds} / \mathrm{Dd} \times 100$$</div>
                                <p>where FS is fractional shortening, Dd is end-diastolic dimension of the LV, and Ds is end-systolic dimension of the LV. This is a reliable and reproducible index of LV function, provided there is no regional wall-motion abnormality and there is concentric contractility of the LV.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Mean normal value of FS is $36 \%$, with $95 \%$ prediction limits of 28% to 44%.</li>
                                        <li>Fractional shortening is decreased in a poorly compensated LV regardless of cause (e.g., pressure overload, volume overload, primary myocardial disorders, and doxorubicin cardiotoxicity).</li>
                                        <li>FS is increased in some volume-overloaded ventricle (e.g., VSD, PDA, AR, and MR) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).</li>
                                        <li>If the interventricular septal motion is flat or paradoxical, the shortening fraction will not accurately reflect ventricular ejection.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Ejection fraction</strong> relates to the change in volume of the LV with cardiac contraction. It is obtained by the following formula:
                                <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{EF}(\%)=(\mathrm{Dd})^{3}-(\mathrm{Ds})^{3} /(\mathrm{Dd})^{3} \times 100$$</div>
                                <p>where EF is the ejection fraction and Dd and Ds are end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, respectively, of the LV.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Normal mean ejection fraction is $66 \%$ with ranges of $56 \%$ to $78 \%$.</li>
                                        <li>The ejection fraction is a derivative of the fractional shortening and offers no advantages over the fractional shortening. In the above formula, the minor axis is assumed to be half of the major axis of the LV; this assumption is incorrect in children.</li>
                                    </ol>

                            <p>A color-coded Doppler provides images of the direction and disturbances of blood flow superimposed on the echo structural image. In general, red is used to indicate flow toward the transducer and blue is used to indicate flow away from the transducer. A turbulent flow appears as light green. This is useful in the detection of shunt or valvular lesions. Color may not appear when the direction of flow is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam.</p>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">D. Doppler Echocardiography</h3>
                            <p>A Doppler echo combines the study of cardiac structure and blood flow profiles. Doppler ultrasound equipment detects frequency shifts and thus determines the direction and velocity of blood flow with respect to the ultrasound beam. By convention, velocities of red blood cells moving toward the transducer are displayed above a zero baseline; those moving away from the transducer are displayed below the baseline. The Doppler echo is usually used with color flow mapping to enhance the technique's usefulness.</p>

                                        <li>The simplified Bernoulli equation is used to estimate the pressure gradient across a stenotic lesion, regurgitant lesion, or shunt lesion. One of the following equations may be used.
                                        <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned} & P_{1}-P_{2}(m m H g)=4\left(V_{2}^{2}-V_{1}^{2}\right. \\ & P_{1}-P_{2}(m m H g)=4(V \max )^{2} \end{aligned}$$</div>
                                        <p>where ($P_{1}-P_{2}$) is the pressure difference across an obstruction, $V_{1}$ is the velocity ($\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$) proximal to the obstruction, and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ is the velocity ($\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$) distal to the obstruction in the first equation. When $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ is less than $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, it can be ignored, as in the second equation. However, when $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ is more than $1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, it should be incorporated in the equation to obtain a more accurate estimation of pressure gradients. This is important in the study of the ascending and descending aortas (for possible coarctation) where flow velocities are often more than $1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$. Ignoring $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ may significantly overestimate pressure gradient in patients with aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta.</p>

                                        <li>The pressure gradient calculated from the Bernoulli equation is the peak instantaneous pressure gradient, not the peak-to-peak pressure gradient measured during cardiac catheterization. The peak instantaneous pressure gradient is generally larger than the peak-to-peak pressure gradient. The difference between the two is more noticeable in patients with mild to moderate obstruction and less apparent in patients with severe obstruction.</li>

                                <li><strong>Estimation of Intracardiac or Intravascular Pressures.</strong> The Doppler echo allows estimation of pressures in the RV, PA, and LV using the flow velocity of valvular or shunt jets. The following are some examples of such applications.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>RV (or PA) systolic pressure (SP) can be estimated from the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet, if present, by the following equation:
                                        <div class="equation">$$\text { RVSP }(\text { or PASP })=4(V)^{2}+R A \text { pressure }$$</div>
                                        <p>where V is the TR jet velocity. For example, if the TR velocity is 2.0 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$, the instantaneous pressure gradient is $4 \times (2.0)^{2}=4 \times 4.0 =16 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Using an assumed RA pressure of 10 mm Hg , the RV systolic pressure (or PA systolic pressure in the absence of pulmonary stenosis) is 26 mm Hg . The upper limit of normal Doppler-estimated PA systolic pressure is about 37 mmHg .</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>RV (or PA) systolic pressure can also be estimated from the velocity of the VSD jet by the following equation:
                                        <div class="equation">$$\text { RVSP }(\text { or PASP })=\text { Systemic SP }(\text { or arm SP })-4(V)^{2}$$</div>
                                        <p>where V is the VSD jet. For example, if the VSD jet flow velocity is $3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$, the instantaneous pressure drop between the LV and RV is $4 \times 3^{2}=36 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. That is, the RV systolic pressure is 36 mm Hg lower than the LV systolic pressure. If the arm systolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg (which is close to but usually higher than the LV systolic pressure), the RV pressure is estimated to be 90 - $36=54 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In the absence of PS, the PA systolic pressure will be approximately 54 mm Hg .</p>

                                <li><strong>Diastolic Function.</strong> Signs of diastolic dysfunction may precede those of systolic dysfunction. As discussed earlier in this chapter, using mitral inflow velocities obtained in the apical four-chamber view, LV diastolic function can be evaluated. LV diastolic dysfunction is easy to find but it is usually nonspecific and does not provide independent diagnostic information. Two well-known patterns of abnormal diastolic function are a decreased relaxation pattern and a "restrictive" pattern (see Figure 11-2).</li>

                            <p>Although the conventional echo study remains the mainstay of noninvasive evaluation of cardiac patients, it has limitations. In addition to being operator dependent, echocardiography may not provide optimal quality of images of cardiovascular (CV) structures due to postoperative scars, chest wall deformities, overlying lung tissue, large body size in adolescents, and obesity. In particular, extracardiac structures such as the pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and aortic arch cannot always be adequately imaged by echo study due to acoustic window limitations. As for the coronary arteries, only the proximal portion can be adequately imaged by echo studies.</p>

                            <p>Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide images of CV structures and other intrathoracic structures that are not usually imaged by echo studies. However, one of the radiologic techniques may be better than the other in its capability and its practicality. Physicians and cardiologists often must decide which noninvasive technique to use to best serve their patients. This section provides some insights into the advantages and disadvantages of MRI and CT (summarized in Box 4-1).</p>

                        <p>Besides noninvasive imaging tools, there are other noninvasive investigational tools that are frequently used in the evaluation of cardiac patients. They include exercise stress testing, long-term ECG monitoring, and ambulatory BP monitoring.</p>

                            <p>Exercise stress testing plays an important role in the evaluation of cardiac symptoms by quantifying the severity of the cardiac abnormality and assessing the effectiveness of management. Although some exercise laboratories have developed bicycle ergometer protocols, the treadmill protocols, such as the Bruce protocol, are well standardized and widely used because most hospitals have treadmills.</p>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Monitoring During Exercise Stress Testing</h3>
                            <p>During exercise stress testing, the patient is continually monitored for symptoms such as chest pain or faintness, ischemic changes or arrhythmias on the ECG, oxygen saturation, and responses in heart rate and blood pressure.</p>

                                <li><strong>Endurance time.</strong> There is a high correlation between the maximum oxygen consumption ($\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{max}$) and endurance time. Thus endurance time is the best predictor of exercise capacity in children. The endurance data reported by Cummings et al in 1978 have served as the reference for several decades. Two recent reports from the U.S. (Chatrath et al, 2002; Ahmed et al, 2001) indicate that the endurance time has been reduced significantly since the 1970s. It is concerning that endurance times reported from two other countries (Italy in 1994; Turkey in 1998) are similar to those published by Cummings et al and are significantly longer than those reported in the two U.S. reports. This may be an indication that U.S. youth are less physically fit than the youth from other countries, which may lead to increased risk of coronary artery disease and stroke in the U.S. population. A new set of endurance data from a recent U.S. study is presented in Table 5-1.</li>

                            <p>Exercise in cold or dry air typically induces airway obstruction in asthmatic patients. Bronchial reactivity is measured while a subject exercises for 5 to 8 minutes on a treadmill at an intensity of $80\%$ maximum capacity.</p>

                                <li>Within 6 to 8 minutes of exercise or by the time the heart rate increases to 180 beats per minute, symptoms of airway obstruction develop.</li>
                                <li>Spirometry is repeated immediately after exercise and again at minute 5,10 , and 15 of recovery. Most pulmonary function test nadirs occur within 5 to 10 minutes after exercise.</li>

                            <p>Long-term ECG recording is the most useful method to document and quantitate the frequency of arrhythmias, correlate the arrhythmia with the patient's symptoms, and evaluate the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Indications</h3>
                            <p>Ambulatory ECG monitoring is obtained for the following reasons:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To determine whether symptoms such as chest pain, palpitation, or syncope are caused by cardiac arrhythmias</li>
                                <li>To evaluate the adequacy of medical therapy for an arrhythmia</li>
                                <li>To screen high-risk cardiac patients (such as those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those in postoperative status after operations known to predispose to arrhythmias (e.g., Fontan-type operation)</li>
                                <li>To evaluate possible intermittent pacemaker failure in patients who have an implanted pacemaker</li>
                                <li>To determine the effect of sleep on potentially life-threatening arrhythmias</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">B. Types of Long-Term ECG Recorders</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Holter recording</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>The Holter monitoring records the heart rhythm continuously for 24 hours, using ECG electrodes attached on the chest. The heart rhythm is recorded on a cassette tape or a flash card and then processed at a heart center. Two simultaneous channels are usually recorded to help distinguish artifacts from arrhythmias. The monitor has a built-in timer that is used with the patient's diary to allow subsequent correlation of symptoms and activities with arrhythmias. This type of recording is useful when the child has symptoms almost daily.</li>
                                        <li>The following are suggested formats of interpretation of a 24-hour Holter recording.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Describe the basic rhythm and the range of the heart rate.</li>
                                                <li>If there is bradycardia, describe its rate, rhythm, and duration (or number of beats) and the presence of escape beats, etc.</li>
                                                <li>For extreme tachycardia, describe the rate, rhythm, mode of initiation and termination, and its duration.</li>
                                                <li>Describe any abnormalities in AV conduction.</li>
                                                <li>Describe any arrhythmias, including their characteristics, duration, and frequency.</li>
                                                <li>Correlate the arrhythmias with the patient's activities and symptoms.</li>
                                                <li>If the patient complained of anginal pain, correlate ST segment changes with activities.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Event recorders:</strong> Event monitors are devices that are used by patients over a longer period (typically one month). The monitor is used when symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia occur infrequently. Two general types of cardiac event monitors are available:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li><strong>Looping memory (presymptom) event monitor.</strong> Two electrodes are attached on the chest. The monitor is always on but will store the patient's rhythm only when the patient or caregiver pushes the button. Most monitors will save the rhythm for 30 seconds before the device is activated.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nonlooping memory (postsymptom) event monitor.</strong> It does not have electrodes that are attached to the chest. This device is used to record symptoms that last longer than 45 to 60 seconds. It is a small device that has small metal discs that function as the electrodes. When symptoms occur, the device is pressed against the chest to start the recording. The device records and stores the events in solid-state memory. It can store up to 6 such events before it is necessary to transmit the information.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Implantable loop recorder:</strong> This device is indicated in patients with very infrequent symptoms, such as once every 6 months. Implantable loop recorders, about the size of a pack of chewing gum, are implanted beneath the skin in the upper left chest. The patient uses a hand-held activator to record and permanently store the cardiac rhythm when symptoms occur. The device can be "interrogated" through the skin to determine what the heart was doing when the symptoms occurred.</li>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Blood pressure is not a static variable; it changes not only from daytime to nighttime but also from minute to minute. In some patients, there is a transient elevation of BP when BP is measured in a health care facility (i.e., "white-coat hypertension"). This could lead to an overdiagnosis of hypertension and to unnecessarily aggressive and costly diagnostic studies and treatment. This test helps identify those with "white-coat hypertension." Some researchers advocate the use of ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in all patients with casual BP elevation.</p>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Method of Ambulatory BP Monitoring</h3>
                            <p>In ABPM, BP is measured multiple times with a preapplied BP cuff, usually using the oscillometric method for a 24-hour period while children participate in their normal daily activities, during both awake and sleep periods. Typically, BP measurements are programmed to occur every 15 to 30 minutes during awake periods and every 20 to 60 minutes during expected sleep periods. The use of ABPM is usually limited to children 5 to 6 years of age or older. Although the advantages of ABPM are clear, there are still some technical difficulties and problems with normative ambulatory BP levels in children.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">B. Evaluation of Ambulatory BP Data</h3>
                            <p>There are three basic calculations of ABPM.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The <strong>mean BP value</strong> can be determined for the entire 24-hour period or for awake and sleep periods separately. Mean normative ambulatory BP levels for children are shown in Table B-8 for boys and Table B-9 for girls in Appendix B.</li>
                                <li>Alternatively, the <strong>BP load</strong> can be calculated. BP load is the percentage of BP readings for a given period that exceeds the 95th percentile of normal for the individual patient. BP load in excess of $25\%$ to $30\%$ is typically considered elevated. Loads in excess of 50% may be predictive</li>

                        <p>There are two kinds of invasive procedures that are used in the practice of pediatric cardiology: diagnostic cardiac catheterization (including angiocardiography) and catheter intervention procedures (therapeutic cardiac catheterization).</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography are the definitive diagnostic tests for most cardiac patients. They are carried out under sedation or anesthesia.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Indications</h3>
                            <p>Accurate diagnosis of most CHDs does not require diagnostic catheterization. With improved capability of noninvasive imaging tools such as echo and color flow Doppler studies and radiologic techniques such as cardiac MRI and cardiac CT, many cardiac problems are adequately diagnosed and managed without cardiac catheterization studies. Indications for these invasive studies vary from institution to institution and from cardiologist to cardiologist. In most centers, two thirds of the cardiac catheterizations are for interventional purposes and only one third are for diagnostic purposes. The following are some circumstances that suggest the need for diagnostic catheterization.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To perform balloon procedures for angioplasty (with or without stent placement), valvuloplasty, or balloon atrial septostomy in patients with lesions amenable to these procedures</li>
                                <li>To determine accurate pressure gradients in combined lesions of AS and AR or PS and PR , or multiple levels of obstruction</li>
                                <li>To assess pulmonary hypertension and its responsiveness to vasodilator therapy</li>
                                <li>To calculate pulmonary vascular resistance in the setting of low-flow lesions, such as seen in patients after bidirectional Glenn operation or after complete Fontan operation</li>
                                <li>To determine details of pulmonary vascular supply, the aortopulmonary collateral supply, and the coronary artery anatomy in patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum or pulmonary atresia with complex ventricular anatomy</li>
                                <li>To find answers to postoperative problems such as excessive desaturation after a B-T shunt or bidirectional Glenn operation, or when excessive aortopulmonary collateral is suspected</li>
                                <li>To assess post-transplantation vasculopathy and to obtain endomyocardial biopsy for rejection identification in cardiac transplantation patients</li>
                                <li>To assess cardiomyopathy or myocarditis</li>
                                <li>To assess coronary circulation in some cases of Kawasaki disease</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">B. Sedation</h3>
                            <p>The following sedatives have been used singly or in combination by different institutions with equally good success rates. In general, smaller doses of sedatives are used in cyanotic infants.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>General anesthesia is often used in newborns and cyanotic infants.</li>
                                <li>For infants less than 10 kg , a combination of chloral hydrate, $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (maximum 2 g ) PO, and diphenhydramine, $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (maximum $100 \mathrm{mg})$ PO, has been used with good results.</li>
                                <li>For older children, Demerol compound, a solution containing $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ of meperidine (Demerol), $12.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ of promethazine (Phenergan), and $12.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of chlorpromazine (Thorazine), is popular. The dose of the Demerol compound is $0.11 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM. Some centers exclude chlorpromazine from the mixture. In cyanotic children, the dose is reduced by one third. For children with severe CHF, the dose is reduced by half.</li>
                                <li>A combination of meperidine $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and hydroxyzine (Vistaril) $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM, or of fentanyl $1.25 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ and droperidol $62.5 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM gives an equally good result.</li>
                                <li>Ketamine, $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or 1 to $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV, may be used, but it can change the hemodynamic data because it increases the systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.</li>
                                <li>Morphine 0.1 to $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ administered subcutaneously has been used in cyanotic infants to prevent or treat hypoxic spells.</li>
                                <li>If more sedation is required during the study, intravenous diazepam (Valium), $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, or morphine, $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$, is used.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">C. Hemodynamic Values and Their Calculations</h3>
                            <p>Pressure and oxygen saturation values for normal children are shown in Figure 6-1. During cardiac catheterization, cardiac output, cardiac shunt, and vascular resistance are routinely calculated.</p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_04_6f8a339a45ef7ea9650dg-103-1.jpg" alt="FIGURE 6-1: Diagram showing average pressure and oxygen saturation values in normal children." class="content-image">
                                <figcaption><strong>FIGURE 6-1</strong><br>Average values of pressure and oxygen saturation in normal children. AO, aorta; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; M, mean pressure; PA, pulmonary artery; PV, pulmonary vein; RA, right atrium; RV, right ventricle; VC, vena cava.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Flows (cardiac output)</strong> are calculated by the Fick formula:
                                <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned} & \text { Pulmonary flow }(Q p)=\frac{V O_{2}}{C_{P V}-C_{P A}} \\ & \text { Systemic flow }(Q s)=\frac{V O_{2}}{C_{A O}-C_{M V}} \end{aligned}$$</div>
                                <p>where flows are in liters per minute, $\mathrm{VO}_{2}$ is oxygen consumption in milliliters per minute, and C is oxygen content in milliliters per liter at the various positions: the pulmonary vein (PV), pulmonary artery (PA), aorta (AO), and mixed systemic venous blood (MV).</p>
                                <p>Oxygen consumption is either directly measured during the procedure or estimated from a table (see Appendix, Table A-6). Oxygen content (milliliters per 100 mL of blood) is derived by multiplying oxygen capacity by percent saturation. Oxygen capacity (milliliters per 100 mL of blood) is the total content of oxygen that hemoglobin contains when it is $100\%$ saturated ($1.36 \times$ hemoglobin in grams per 100 mL). Normal systemic flow (or pulmonary flow in the absence of shunt) is $3.1 \pm 0.4 \mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (i.e., cardiac index).</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>The <strong>magnitude of the shunt</strong> is calculated as follows:
                                <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned} & \text { Left-to-right }(\mathrm{L}-\mathrm{R}) \text { shunt }=\mathrm{Qp}-\mathrm{Qs} \\ & \text { Right-to-left }(\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{L}) \text { shunt }=\mathrm{Qs}-\mathrm{Qp} \end{aligned}$$</div>
                                <p>In pediatrics, the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow (Qp/Qs), which does not require an oxygen consumption value, is often used. The ratio provides information on the magnitude of the shunt. Patients with an L-R shunt greater than 2:1 are usually candidates for surgery.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Vascular resistances</strong> are calculated by using formulas derived from Ohm's law ($R=\Delta P / Q$).
                                <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned} \mathrm{PVR} & =\frac{\text { Mean PA pressure }- \text { mean LA pressure }}{\mathrm{Qp}} \\ \mathrm{SVR} & =\frac{\text { Mean aortic pressure }- \text { mean RA pressure }}{\mathrm{Qs}} \end{aligned}$$</div>
                                <p>The normal systemic vascular resistance (SVR) varies between 15 and 30 units $/ \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The normal pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high at birth but reaches near-adult values (1 to 3 units $/ \mathrm{m}^{2}$) after 2 to 4 months. The normal ratio of PVR/SVR ranges from 1:20 to 1:10.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">D. Selective Angiocardiography</h3>
                            <p>A radiopaque dye is rapidly injected through a cardiac catheter into a certain site in the cardiovascular system, and angiograms are obtained, often on biplane views. Nonionizing contrast media with low osmolality (e.g., Isovue, Omnipaque) are widely used because of their low incidence of side effects. The dose of angiographic dyes for an angiogram ranges from 1 to $2 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight, depending on the nature of the defect.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">E. Risks</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The risk of cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography varies with the age and illness of the patient, the type of lesion, and the experience of those doing the procedure. Serious complications can occur, including (rarely) death. The reported rate of fatal complications varies from less than $1\%$ to as high as $5\%$ in neonates. About $3\%$ to $5\%$ of patients have significant nonfatal complications.</li>
                                <li>Complications include serious arrhythmias, heart block, cardiac perforation, hypoxic spells, arterial obstruction, hemorrhage, infection, reactions to the contrast material, intramyocardial injection of the contrast, and renal complications (hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, and anuria). Hypothermia, acidemia, hypoglycemia, convulsions, hypotension, and respiratory depression are more likely in the newborn infant.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">F. Preparation and Monitoring</h3>
                            <p>Adequate preparation of the patient and careful monitoring during the procedure can minimize complications and fatality from the invasive studies. The following areas are particularly important.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Avoiding hypothermia when an infant is being studied, by increasing temperature in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, using a warming blanket, and monitoring rectal temperature.</li>
                                <li>Monitoring oxygen saturation transcutaneously, checking arterial blood gases and pH, and correcting acidemia and hypoxemia; correcting hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia before the start of the procedure.</li>
                                <li>Administering oxygen, if indicated, during the procedure.</li>
                                <li>Intubating or readiness for intubating in infants with respiratory difficulties, and having emergency medications (e.g., atropine, epinephrine, bicarbonate) drawn up and ready.</li>
                                <li>Initiating prostaglandin infusion in cyanotic infants who appear to have a ductus-dependent lesion.</li>
                                <li>Whenever possible, having another physician or an anesthesiologist available to monitor the patient.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Catheter interventional procedures can save lives of critically ill neonates and may eliminate or delay the need for elective surgical procedures. Blood vessels and heart valves that are too small can be enlarged using balloon catheters and/or implantable stents. Too small an opening in the atrial septum can be enlarged by using balloon or blade catheters. An opening can be created in an intact atrial septum for left-to-right or right-to-left shunt to occur. Abnormal connections within the heart (such as ASD and VSD) can be closed using innovative devices. Abnormal blood vessels (PDA or collaterals) can also be closed using coils or plugging devices. In recent years, percutaneous valve replacement in the aortic or pulmonary position has seen wider use.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Atrial Septostomy</h3>
                            <p>In balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind's procedure), an opening is created or enlarged in the atrial septum, using a special balloon-tipped catheter, to improve shunting at the atrial level in patients with serious CHDs (such as TGA, pulmonary atresia, tricuspid atresia, TAPVR, etc.). In infants older than 6 to 8 weeks of age, the atrial septum may be too thick to allow an effective balloon septostomy. In such cases, the atrial septum can be opened using a blade catheter (i.e., Park blade). The opening can then be torn further with a balloon catheter.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">B. Balloon Valvuloplasty</h3>
                            <p>The balloons used in this interventional procedure are made of special plastic polymers and retain their predetermined diameters.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Pulmonary valve stenosis.</strong> Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is the treatment of choice for valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) in children and, to a large extent, has replaced the surgical pulmonary valvotomy. Balloon valvuloplasty may be indicated in patients with a resting systolic pressure gradient of $\geq 40$ mm Hg under sedation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aortic valve stenosis.</strong> This procedure is more difficult and carries a higher complication rate than does pulmonary valvuloplasty, especially for infants. The gradient reduction is less effective than for the pulmonary valve. Balloon valvuloplasty may be indicated in children with isolated valvular AS with a resting peak-to-peak systolic gradient of $\geq 50$ mm Hg (without significant AR) by cardiac catheterization. The procedure is also indicated in newborns with isolated critical valvular AS that is ductal dependent. Complications include production or worsening of AR, iliofemoral artery injury and occlusion, ventricular arrhythmias, and even death in small infants.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mitral stenosis.</strong> Balloon dilatation valvuloplasty has been effective for rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) but less effective for congenital MS.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stenosis of prosthetic conduits and valves within conduits.</strong> The balloon dilatation procedure may reduce the transconduit gradient across stenotic areas of prosthetic conduits and across valves contained within conduits.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">C. Balloon Angioplasty</h3>
                            <p>Balloon catheters similar to those used in balloon valvuloplasties are used for the relief of stenosis of blood vessels. This procedure has been used for coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary artery branch stenosis, and stenosis of the systemic veins. Following the balloon procedure, some blood vessels recoil and do not maintain the dilated caliber of the vessel. Endovascular stents are sometimes used to maintain vessel patency after balloon angioplasty of any vascular structure. After stent placement, the vascular endothelium grows over the struts of the stent over several months, functionally incorporating the stent into the vessel wall. Occasionally, however, the endothelialization may go awry, resulting in a thick neointimal layer causing a functional stenosis.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Recoarctation of the aorta.</strong> Balloon angioplasty has become the procedure of choice for patients with postoperative residual obstruction of coarctation of the aorta. Some centers use a stent to prevent restenosis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Native (or unoperated) coarctation of the aorta.</strong> Balloon angioplasty for native unoperated coarctation is controversial. The rate of recoarctation following the balloon procedure appears higher than that following surgery in infants. The complication rate is $17\%$, with aortic aneurysm formation (both acute and late) occurring in 6% of the patients. The long-term effects of the procedure on aneurysm formation are unknown. Some centers use cutting balloons or low-profile stents in very sick infants, which may reduce aneurysm formation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Branch pulmonary artery stenosis.</strong> Surgical treatment of peripheral PA stenosis is often impossible. Hypoplastic and stenotic branch PAs are seen with postoperative TOF, pulmonary atresia, and HLHS. The immediate success rate of the balloon procedure is about $60\%$, but restenosis occurs in a significant number of patients, and aneurysm formation occurs in approximately 3% of patients. High-pressure balloons appear to improve the effectiveness. Vessels resistant to high-pressure balloon respond to either cutting balloon angioplasty alone or followed by high-pressure ballooning. Cutting balloons have 3 or 4 microsurgical blades with a cutting depth of 0.15 mm, which are activated when the balloons are inflated. Use of an intravascular stent has also improved immediate results and may improve the long-term success rate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Systemic venous stenosis.</strong> The balloon procedure may be performed for obstructed venous baffles after the Senning operation for TGA.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">D. Closure Techniques</h3>
                            <p>Various closure devices have been used for nonsurgical closure of ASD, PDA, and muscular VSD in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Atrial septal defect.</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>There are several devices available, some approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and others in clinical trial stages. In the United States, currently the Amplatzer septal occlude (AGA Medical) and Helex septal occlude (W. LO. Gore and Associates) are approved for closure of secundum ASD.</li>
                                        <li>The use of the closure device may be indicated to close a secundum ASD measuring 5 mm or more in diameter (but less than 32 mm for the Amplatzer device and less than 18 mm for the Helex device), and there must be at least a 4 mm rim of atrial septal tissue around the defect. After the device closure, patients take a baby aspirin daily for 6 months until endothelialization of the device is complete.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Ventricular septal defect.</strong> Successful closure of a muscular VSD, which is remote from cardiac valves, has been reported by using the double-umbrella clamshell device and others.</li>
                                <li><strong>Patent ductus arteriosus.</strong>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Most transcatheter PDA closures are now performed using Gianturco vascular occlusion coils. They are small, coiled wires coated with thrombogenic Dacron strands that open like a small "pigtail" when placed in the vessel. Good candidates for the coil occlusion are those children weighing 6 kg and larger with the ductus 4 mm and smaller.</li>
                                        <li>For larger PDA (but less than 12 mm in diameter), specialized devices such as the Amplatzer duct occluder are available for catheter-based closure. The devices are implanted antegrade from the femoral vein. There is a $\geq 98\%$ closure rate at 6 months with minimal complications and no mortality. Very large ducti in small infants are still probably best treated surgically.</li>

                                <li><strong>Occlusion of collaterals and other vessels.</strong> This technique closes aortopulmonary collaterals (often seen with TOF), systemic arteriovenous fistulas, pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas, or surgically placed shunts that are no longer needed. The Gianturco coil and the White balloon are examples. Peripheral embolization of the coil or balloon into the PAs or the aorta is a major risk.</li>

                            <p>Since Bonhoeffer and his colleagues first replaced pulmonary valves by percutaneous techniques in 2000, this technique has gained increasing experience. Candidates for this technique are typically those patients who received surgery for tetralogy of Fallot and late development of severe pulmonary regurgitation. This technique is expected to reduce the need for repeated cardiac surgeries by replacing surgically placed conduits. Most of the reported cases used the Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). The Edwards SAPIEN valve (Edwards Lifescience, Irvine, CA) is a new valve with which experience is very limited.</p>
