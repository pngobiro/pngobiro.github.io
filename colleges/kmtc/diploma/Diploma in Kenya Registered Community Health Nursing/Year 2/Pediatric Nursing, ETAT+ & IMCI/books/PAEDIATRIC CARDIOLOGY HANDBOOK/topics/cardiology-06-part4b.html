Different types of systemic-to-pulmonary (S-P) shunts have been performed (Fig. 9-14).

                                <li>Total repair of the defect is carried out under cardiopulmonary bypass. The procedure includes patch closure of the VSD, widening of the RVOT by resection of the infundibular muscle tissue, and usually placement of a fabric patch to widen the RVOT (see Fig. 9-15). Some centers advocate placement of a monocusp valve at the time of initial repair, and other centers advocate pulmonary valve replacement at a later time if indicated.</li>
                                <li>Surgery for TOF with anomalous anterior descending coronary artery from the right coronary artery requires placement of a conduit between the RV and PA, which is usually performed after 1 year of age. A B-T shunt may be necessary initially to palliate the patient. Alternatively, when a small conduit is necessary between the RV and the PA, the native outflow tract should be made as large as possible through an atrial approach, so that a "double outlet" (the native outlet and the conduit) results from the RV.</li>

                                        <li>RV function is best investigated by MRI; if MRI is contraindicated due to the presence of metallic objects or cardiac pacemaker, a CT can be used.</li>

                                <li>Surgical valve replacement. The following are suggested criteria for surgical valve replacement in patients with moderate to severe PR.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>RV regurgitation fraction as the primary determinant. In the presence of RV regurgitation fraction $\geq 25\%$, the presence of 2 or more of the following criteria is considered an indication for the procedure (Geva T, 2006): RV end-diastolic volume $\geq 160 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (normal, <108 ml/m$^{2}$); RV end systolic volume $\geq 70 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ (normal, <47 ml/m$^{2}$); LV end-diastolic volume $\geq 65 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$; RV ejection fraction $\geq 45\%$; RV outflow tract aneurysm; and clinical criteria such as exercise intolerance, syncope, presence of heart failure, sustained ventricular tachycardia, or QRS duration $\geq 180$ milliseconds.</li>
                                        <li>RV volume index as the primary determinant. The presence of RV end-systolic volume index $\geq 80 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ or RV end-diastolic volume index $\geq 163 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ by MRI (Lee C, 2012) is an indication for pulmonary valve replacement. The former index is more important than the latter.</li>
                                        <li>The presence of moderate to severe TR, residual ASD or VSD, or severe AR may trigger valve replacement even if the above criteria are not met.</li>
                                        <li>If the PR is associated with the stenosis of the main or branch PAs (natural or secondary to shunt operations), the PA stenosis should be relieved first by balloon and/or stent procedure, which may improve PR.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li>Nonsurgical percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation. This technique developed by Bonhoeffer et al has been used successfully, marketed as the Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis). Further experiences with this technique may lower the threshold of indication (listed above) for pulmonary valve replacement.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li>Varying levels of activity limitation may be indicated.</li>
                                <li>Some children develop late arrhythmias. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be treated aggressively because they may result in sudden death.</li>

                            <p>About 10% of patients with TOF.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathology and Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In this extreme form of TOF, the intracardiac pathology resembles that of TOF in all respects except for the presence of pulmonary atresia.</li>
                                <li>The PBF is more commonly through a PDA (70%) and less commonly through multiple systemic collaterals (30%), which are called multiple aortopulmonary collateral arteries (or MAPCAs). Both PDA and collateral arteries may coexist as the source of PBF. The ductus is small and long and descends vertically from the transverse arch ("vertical" ductus) and connects to the PAs which are usually confluent. The subgroup of MAPCAs is usually associated with nonconfluent PAs, and this subgroup is designated as pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect.</li>
                                <li>The central and branch PAs are hypoplastic in most patients but more frequently in patients with MAPCAs than in those with PDA. Incomplete arborization (distribution) of one or both PAs is also more common in patients with nonconfluent PAs than those with confluent PAs.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The patient is cyanotic at birth; the degree of cyanosis depends on whether the ductus is patent and how extensive the systemic collateral arteries are.</li>
                                <li>Usually no heart murmur is audible, but a faint, continuous murmur of PDA may be audible. The S2 is loud and single.</li>
                                <li>The ECG shows RAD and RVH.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs show normal heart size, often with a boot-shaped silhouette and a markedly decreased PVM ("black" lung field).</li>
                                <li>Echo studies are diagnostic of the condition, but angiocardiogram is necessary for complete delineation of the pulmonary artery anatomy and the collaterals. Alternatively, MRI may be used for complete anatomic delineation of the aortic collaterals and PA branches.</li>

                                <li>Intravenous PGE1 infusion is started to keep the ductus open for cardiac catheterization and in preparation for surgery (see Appendix E for the dosage).</li>
                                <li>Emergency cardiac catheterization or MRI is performed to delineate anatomy of the pulmonary arteries and systemic arterial collaterals.</li>

                                <li>Primary surgical repair (closure of the VSD, conduit between the RV and the central PA) is possible only when a central PA of adequate size exists and the central PA connects without obstruction to sufficient regions of the lungs (at least equal to one whole lung). The overall hospital mortality varies between 5% and 20%.</li>
                                <li>Staged repair consists of an initial procedure that increases PBF and induces the growth of the central PA (before 1 or 2 years of age) followed by additional surgical procedure(s) at a later time.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>When there is a confluence of central PAs, either a B-T shunt or a PA homograft placement can be performed.
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>A B-T shunt procedure often results in an iatrogenic stenosis of the PA branch. For a very small confluent central PA, a central end-to-side shunt (Mee procedure) can be performed.</li>
                                                <li>Initial RVOT reconstruction with a small homograft conduit may need to be replaced with a larger one later. Anastomosis of collateral arteries to the central artery is carried out later. In this case, the VSD may be left open, or closed with a fenestrated patch to maintain an increased PBF (see Fig. 9-16, top row).</li>

Later, a conduit between the RV and a newly created central PA can be made.</li>

Bottom Row (Nonconfluent PA and Multiple Collaterals): A, Absent central pulmonary artery and multiple aortic collaterals are shown. $\boldsymbol{B}$, A small pulmonary homograft (6-8 mm internal diameter, shown in shade) is used to establish RV-to-PA connection with some collaterals connected to it (unifocalized) (performed at 3 to 6 mo ). Some collaterals are not unifocalized at this time. C, The homograft conduit has been replaced with a larger one. Remaining collateral arteries are anastomosed to the pulmonary homograft to complete the unifocalization procedure. VSD is closed with or without fenestration, usually at 1 to 3 years.

                            <p>Approximately 2% to 6% of patients with TOF.</p>

                                <li>The pulmonary valve leaflets are either absent or rudimentary, and the pulmonary annulus is stenotic, usually in association with TOF. A massive aneurysmal dilatation of the PAs develops during fetal life and compresses the lower end of the developing trachea and bronchi. Postnatally, this produces signs of airway obstruction and respiratory difficulties. Pulmonary complications (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia), rather than the intracardiac defect, are the usual cause of death when managed medically. In some patients the ductus arteriosus is absent, with a more severe aneurysmal dilation of the PAs.</li>
                                <li>Since the annular stenosis is only moderate, a bidirectional shunt is initially present but it becomes predominantly an L-R shunt beyond the newborn period.</li>

                                <li>Mild cyanosis may be present in the neonate, but cyanosis disappears and signs of CHF may develop when the PVR falls.</li>
                                <li>A to-and-fro murmur ("sawing-wood sound") at the upper and middle LSB (resulting from PS and PR) is characteristic of the condition. The S2 is loud and single, and RV hyperactivity is palpable.</li>
                                <li>The ECG shows RAD and RVH.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs reveal a markedly dilated MPA and hilar PAs. The heart size is either normal or mildly enlarged, and PVMs may be slightly increased. The lung fields may show hyperinflated or atelectatic areas.</li>
                                <li>Echo studies reveal a large, subaortic VSD with overriding of the aorta (as seen in TOF), distally displaced pulmonary annulus (with thick ridges instead of fully developed pulmonary valve leaflets), and gigantic aneurysm of the PA and its branches. The RV is markedly dilated, often with paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. Doppler studies reveal evidence of stenosis and regurgitation at the annulus.</li>
                                <li>Most infants with severe pulmonary complications (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia) die during infancy if treated only medically. The surgical mortality of infants with pulmonary complications is as high as 40%. Therefore, surgery should be performed in early infancy before pulmonary complications develop.</li>

                                <li>Symptomatic neonates should have corrective surgery on an urgent basis. Even asymptomatic infants should have elective primary repair surgery in early infancy. Some use a homograft valve at the pulmonary valve position, and others do not.</li>
                                <li>Alternatively, a two-stage operation can be performed. A tight PA banding is performed to eliminate excessive pulsation of the PA along with a B-T shunt, and a complete repair at a later time (at 2 to 4 years of age).</li>

                            <p>The left coronary artery (LCA) arises abnormally from the main PA. Postnatal decrease in the PA pressure results in ineffective perfusion of the LCA, producing ischemia and infarction of the LV that is normally perfused by the LCA.</p>

                                <li>The newborn patient is usually asymptomatic until the PA pressure falls to a critical level. Symptoms appear at 2 to 3 months of age and consist of recurring episodes of distress (anginal pain), and signs of CHF. Heart murmur usually is absent.</li>
                                <li>Chest radiographs show cardiomegaly. The ECG shows anterolateral myocardial infarction pattern consisting of abnormally deep and wide Q waves, inverted T waves, and ST segment shift in leads I, aVL, and most precordial leads (V2 through V6).</li>
                                <li>Two-dimensional echo with color flow mapping is diagnostic and has replaced cardiac catheterization. The absence of normal LCA arising from the aorta raises the possibility of the condition. Instead, the LCA is seen to connect to the main PA. Color Doppler examination may show retrograde flow into the main PA from the LCA. The right coronary artery may be enlarged. The left ventricle may enlarge with reduced LV systolic function. Increased echogenicity of papillary muscles and adjacent endocardium suggests fibrosis and fibroelastosis.</li>

                                <li>Palliative surgery (simple ligation of the anomalous LCA close to its origin from the PA) may be performed in very sick infants to prevent steal into the PA. This should be followed later by an elective bypass procedure.</li>
                                <li>Most centers prefer definitive surgery unless the patient is critically ill, but the optimal operation remains controversial. One of the following two-coronary system surgeries may be performed.
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Intrapulmonary tunnel operation (Takeuchi repair). Initially a 5- to 6-mm aortopulmonary window is created between the ascending aorta and the MPA at the level of the takeoff of the left coronary artery (LCA). In the posterior wall of the MPA, a tunnel is created that connects the opening of the aortopulmonary window and the orifice of the anomalous left coronary artery. The mortality rate is near 0% but a rate as high as over 20% has been reported. Late complications of the procedure include supravalvar PA stenosis by the tunnel (75%), baffle leak (52%) causing coronary-pulmonary artery fistula, and AR.</li>
                                        <li>LCA implantation. In this procedure, the anomalous coronary artery is excised from the PA along with a button of PA wall, and the artery is reimplanted into the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta. The early surgical mortality rate is 15% to 20%.</li>
                                        <li>Tashiro repair. A narrow cuff of the main PA, including the orifice of the left coronary artery, is transected. The upper and lower edges of the cuff are closed to form a new left main coronary artery, which is anastomosed to the aorta. The divided main PA is anastomosed end-to-end.</li>
                                        <li>Subclavian-to-left coronary artery anastomosis. In this technique, the end of the left subclavian artery is turned down and anastomosed end-to-side to the anomalous LCA.</li>
