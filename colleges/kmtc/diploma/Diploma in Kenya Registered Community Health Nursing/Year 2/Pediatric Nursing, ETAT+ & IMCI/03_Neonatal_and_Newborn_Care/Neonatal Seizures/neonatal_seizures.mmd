\section*{LEARNING OUTCOME}
- Diagnose \& manage neonatal seizures

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- Define neonatal seizures
- State the significance
- Outline the types
- Outline the manifestation
- State the aetiology
- Outline the management

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Neonatal seizures are paroxysmal alterations in neonatal behaviour initiated by hypersynchronous activity of neurones in the brain
-Significance
-Usually relate to significant illness
- If untreated they interfer with important supportive measures
-Can cause brain injury
-Subtle seizures -most common
-C/F are often overlooked
-Are identified as seizures because of accompaning EEG correlates \& sensation with anticonvulsants
-Eyes -fixed staring, occular movements, repeatative blinking, horizontal deviation of the eyes
-Mouth -chewing, drooling, sucking, laughing
-R/S - Apnoea
-Motor -boxing, swimming, pedaling, stepping movements of upper \& lower limbs
-Autonomic -- $\uparrow$ BP \& Heart rate
-CNS - crying
-Tonic seizures -are generalized with tonic extension of lower limbs
-Multifocal clonic- clonic m'vnt of one limb that migrates to another body part in unordered manner
-Occurs in term infants
-Focal clonic -well localized clonic jerky mov'nts without loss of consciousness
-Myoclonic --rare,
-Consists of single or multiple jerks of flexion of lower or upper limbs

\section*{AETIOLOGY}
1. HIE-Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
- Follow neonatal asphyxia
- Occurs within 24 hrs
-2. intracranial haemorhage
$-1^{\circ}$ subarachnoid haemorhage
- Periventricular haemorhage \& intraventricular
- Subdural haematoma
- Hypoglycaemia- SGA, infants of DM mothers
- Hypocalcaemia \& hypomagnesaemia (asphyxia, LBW, infants of DM mothers
- Local anaesthetic intoxicationparacervical \& pudental block
- Metabolic -hyponatreamia \& hypernatreamia
- Peridoxime deficiency
- Intrcranial infections - bacterial \& non bact..
- Developmental defects, drug withdrawal-
- Familial

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
oFull haemogram
-U/E
oBlood sugar
-X-ray skull
-EEG
oCranial U/S
-CT scan
-CXR, L.P, septic screening

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Dx-hx, PE, Investigations
-Supportive Rx
-Adequate ventilation, perfusion, nutrition, \& hydration
-Anticonvulsants-phenobarbitone Im $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose is the drug of choice
-Maintenance - $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day im/ po
-12hrs after loading. X1-2 mo or 1wk seizure free
-Or phenytoin 1 v only $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in absence of phenobarb ( causes tissue necrosis)
Diazepam -rarely used in neonatal seizures
- Has poor maintenance
- Can cause circulatory collapse \& resp failure
- Can prespitate jaundice
-Therapeutic dose is variable

\section*{SPECIFIC TREATMENT}
-Hypoglycaemia -2mls/kg 10\% dextrose
Hypocalcaemia -ca gluconate $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ stat
Hypomagnesaemia -0.2mls/kg of 50\% soln
Pyrodoxime deff-- iv $50-100 \mathrm{mg}$
Prevention -prevent specific cause

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
oCerebral palsy
-Mental retardation
-Epilepsy
${ }^{\circ}$ Rx --Rehabilitation of the above
