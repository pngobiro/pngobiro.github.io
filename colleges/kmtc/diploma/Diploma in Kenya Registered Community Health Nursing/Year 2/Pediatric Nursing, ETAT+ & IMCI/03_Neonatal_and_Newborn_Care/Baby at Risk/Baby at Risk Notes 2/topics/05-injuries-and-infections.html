                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Birth injuries refer to trauma that a foetus sustains during birth. The structures commonly involved are: muscles, nerves, bones, visceral organs, and skin.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES OF BIRTH INJURIES</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Internal organ injury:</strong> spleen, liver, adrenal glands</li>
                            <li><strong>Nerve injury:</strong> mostly brachial plexus leading to Erb's paralysis, klumpke's</li>
                            <li><strong>Soft tissue injury:</strong> genitalia, eyes</li>
                            <li><strong>Intracranial injuries:</strong> intracranial haemorrhage, skull fractures</li>
                            <li><strong>Extracranial injuries:</strong> cephalohaematoma, caput succedaneum.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Predisposing factors to birth injuries</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prematurity</li>
                            <li>Large for dates babies</li>
                            <li>Cephalopelvic disproportion</li>
                            <li>Malpresentation eg brow, breech, face etc</li>
                            <li>Congenital malformations eg hydrocephalus</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A) HEAD TRAUMA</h3>
                        <p>Trauma to the head and scalp that occurs during the birth process is usually benign but occasionally results in more serious injuries. There are three main types of extracranial haemorrhage:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>CAPUT SUCCADENIUM:</strong> Is an oedematous swelling due to accumulation of serum fluid under the foetal scalp. The swelling is self limiting and disappears within 36 hours of life.</li>
                            <li><strong>CEPHALOHAEMATOMA:</strong> Is accumulation of blood between the periosteum and the skull bone. It is caused by friction between the foetal skull bones and pelvic bones eg. CPD.</li>
                            <li><strong>SUBGALEAL OR SUBAPONEUROTIC HAEMORRHAGE:</strong> Is bleeding into the subgaleal compartment. It is commonly associated with vacuum extraction.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">B) NERVE TRAUMA/ INJURIES</h3>
                        <p>The most common are the facial nerve and brachial plexus injuries.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Facial Nerve Injury:</strong> This is due to damage of the facial nerve. The eye of the affected side remains open & the mouth is drawn to the normal side. Spontaneous improvement should be seen in 7-10 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brachial Plexus Injuries:</strong> These are caused by stretching or disruption of the nerve at the apex of the axilla. There are three main types: Erb's palsy, Klumpke's palsy, and Total branchial plexus palsy.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">C) FRACTURES</h3>
                        <p>A fracture can occur during delivery. Most common are fractures of the skull, clavicle, humerus and femur bones.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>SKULL FRACTURES:</strong> These are rare and the majority are linear and asymptomatic.</li>
                            <li><strong>CLAVICLE FRACTURE:</strong> This occurs due to shoulder dystocia and in breech delivery. A stable union usually occurs within 7-10 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>FRACTURED HUMERUS:</strong> This may occur in shoulder dystocia or in extended arms in breech presentation. Stable union occurs in 3-4 weeks.</li>
                            <li><strong>FRACTURE FEMUR:</strong> May occur during delivery of extended legs in breech presentation. Treatment is simple splinting for 2-3 weeks.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">D) MUSCLE INJURIES (TORTICOLIS)</h3>
                        <p>This results from injury to the sternomastoid muscle during birth when the muscle is either torn or its blood supply is impaired.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">E) SOFT TISSUE INJURIES IN THE NEWBORN</h3>
                        <p>Soft tissue injuries usually occur when there is some degree of disproportion between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion). Bruising with excoriation can occur in breech and face presentation and usually fades spontaneously within a few days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General management of birth injuries</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intrapartally, predisposing factors should be diagnosed and managed early.</li>
                            <li>Observe the baby closely for skin colour, twitching, rolling of eyes, convulsions.</li>
                            <li>Keep the baby warm.</li>
                            <li>Administer vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m as they are predisposed to haemorrhage.</li>
                            <li>Provide intermittent oxygen therapy when necessary (PRN).</li>
                            <li>Give fluids eg. 10% dextrose for the first 24 hours then introduce oral feeds if the condition improves.</li>
                            <li>Administer anticonvulsants eg. Phenobarbital prophylactically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Musculoskeletal deformities</li>
                           <li>Brain damage</li>
                           <li>Respiratory distress</li>
                           <li>Hyperbilirubinaemia (jaundice)</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection with or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life. It encompasses various systemic infections of the newborn such as septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vulnerability Of The Newborn To Infection</h3>
                        <p>The defense mechanisms of the newborn infant are imperfectly developed. Skin and mucus membranes are thin and easily damaged. There is decreased cellular immunity and phagocytosis is less efficient. Immunoglobulins are deficient, with only IgG transported across the placenta.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Modes of acquiring infections</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Across the placenta:</strong> e.g. Rubella virus, HIV, syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV).</li>
                            <li><strong>Intrapartum transmission:</strong> herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B, candida albicans, Ophthalmia neonatorum, pneumonia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infections acquired after birth:</strong> from the environment, contaminated equipment, or people handling the baby.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION OF NEONATAL SEPSIS</h3>
                        <p>Neonatal sepsis can be classified into two major categories depending on the onset of symptoms:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Early Onset Sepsis (EOS):</strong> Presents within the first 72 hours of life. The source of infection is generally the maternal genital tract. Risk factors include low birth weight, maternal febrile illness, foul-smelling liquor, and prolonged rupture of membranes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Late Onset Sepsis (LOS):</strong> Usually presents after 72 hours of age. The source of infection in LOS is either nosocomial (hospital-acquired) or community-acquired. Risk factors for nosocomial sepsis include prematurity, invasive procedures, and mechanical ventilation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical features of neonatal sepsis</h3>
                        <p>The earliest signs of sepsis are often subtle and nonspecific, such as hypothermia or fever, lethargy, poor cry, refusal to suck, poor perfusion, and respiratory distress.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Antibiotic treatment</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>FIRST LINE:</strong> Penicillin or Ampicillin and Gentamicin</li>
                            <li><strong>SECOND LINE:</strong> Ampicillin or Cloxacillin and Gentamicin or Amikacin</li>
                            <li><strong>THIRD LINE:</strong> Cefotaxime or Piperacillin-Tazobactam</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention of neonatal sepsis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Preconception:</strong> Rubella vaccination, general health of mother should be observed.</li>
                            <li><strong>During pregnancy:</strong> Antenatal profile, early detection and treatment of any infections.</li>
                            <li><strong>During labour and delivery:</strong> Hand washing, clean and safe delivery, minimization of vaginal examination.</li>
                            <li><strong>After delivery:</strong> Early and exclusive breast feeding, cord care using chlorhexidine, application of tetracycline eye ointment, neonatal immunization.</li>
