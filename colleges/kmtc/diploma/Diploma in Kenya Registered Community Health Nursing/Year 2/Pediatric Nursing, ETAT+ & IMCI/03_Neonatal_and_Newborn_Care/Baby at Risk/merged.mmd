\subsection*{1.0 INTRODUCTION}

\subsection*{1.1 ADMISSION CRETERIA INTO THE NEWBORN UNIT}

The new born unit does not only admit babies at risk but also offers accommodation to normal neonates due to unstable condition or death of the mother.

Reasons for admitting a baby into the nursery include the following:
- Pre-maturity
- Asphyxia neonatorum
- Haemorrhagic disease of the new born
- Ophalmia neonatorum
- Birth injuries
- Congenital abnormalities e.g hydrocephalus
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Infants of diabetic mothers(risk of hypoglycaemia)
- Maternal death
- Unstable maternal condition

\subsection*{1.2 INFECTION CONTROL IN THE NEW BORN UNIT}

Due to low immunity of the babies in the NBU, infection control is critical to protect the babies from infection during their stay in the unit. This is necessitates high infection control measures within the unit.

The following are some ways of ensuring infection control in the nursery.
- Keep the unit clean, free from dust. The windows should remain closed at all times to prevent flowing in of dusty air.
- Daily dump dusting and cleaning of the incubator and cots
- Isolation of infected babies for barrier nursing.
- Restriction of visitors to ensure adequate control of human traffic into the nursery. Visitors should see the babies through the window glass.
- Washing hand before and after handling the baby for any procedure.
- Strictly observing aseptic technique while performing procedures.
- Feeding utensils should be rinsed, decontaminated, cleaned thoroughly in soapy water and kept in presept till the next feed.
- Staff working in isolation room should not move into other nurseries
- Cleaning of incubators upon discharge or death of a baby, before the next baby is put.
- Mothers changing clothes whenever they come to feed the babies.
- Health educating the mothers on the importance of personal hygiene and care of the baby. (Myles; $2{ }^{\text {nd }}$ Edition by Diane M. Fraser ,Margaret A. Cooper , and Anna G. w. Nolte ).

\subsection*{1.3 FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE BABY}

This is a routine procedure done after third stage of labour in labour ward but is also done in the nursery as part of admission procedure. The aims are;
- To rule out congenital abnormalities
- To rule out birth injuries
- To assess maturity of the baby

\section*{Head}
$\checkmark$ measure the head circumference (average is 35 cm
$\checkmark$ Check for the moulding of the foetal skull
$\checkmark$ Width of the fontannelles and sutures, bilging of fontanel and wide sutures may indicate hydrocephalus

$\checkmark$ Bleeding from the umbilical cord
$\checkmark$ Abdominal abnormalities e.g. hernia

\section*{Genitalia}
$\checkmark$ For males check for the testis to rule out undescended testis

\section*{Hip joint}
$\checkmark$ Rule out congenital hip dislocation

\section*{Limbs}
$\checkmark$ Check if arms and hands are moving freely
$\checkmark$ Rule out dislocation, fractures and Erb's paralysis

\section*{Anus}
$\checkmark$ While taking rectal temperature, check for imperforate anus
$\checkmark$ Bruises on the skin or rashes

\section*{Check for the following reflexes:}
- Sucking reflexes - full term infant sucks the small finger
- Moro reflex - tested by gently lifting the baby up by its fingers from a flat surface and suddenly releasing it. It will respond byspreading its hands then move them together as though hugging.
- Rooting reflex - the baby turns in search of the nipple
- Grasping reflex - it will grasp your finger if you put it in its palm.
- Stepping reflex - when held on a flat surface in standing position, it makes stepping movement.

\subsection*{2.0 NORMAL NEONATE}

This refers to a baby born at term or as near term as possible after 37 weeks of gestation and has no complications.

Upon birth the infant has to undergo physiological changes in order to adapt to life outside the uterus to have independent existence.

\subsection*{2.1 PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AT BIRTH}
1. Respiration occurs due to:
- Low oxygen and high carbon- dioxide stimulates respiratory center and respiration begins
- Compression of the chest wall during second stage creates a vaccum and aid respiration
- External stimuli e.g handling the baby, cold extra uterine environment makes the baby gasp and respiration starts
- Baby is encourage to cry initially by flicking the sole of the foot for it allows complete aeration of the lungs
- Presence of surfactant factor aids expansion of the lungs (lecithin:sphingomyelin=2:1 and is an indicator of lung maturity detectable on amniocentesis)

The normal respiration rate at birth is $40-50 / \mathrm{min}$
Irregular breathing may be due to the following factors:
$\checkmark$ Prematurity (inadequate surfactant factor)
$\checkmark$ Depression of the respiratory centre by drugs e.g pethedine or strong uterine contractions
$\checkmark$ Excessive carbondioxide (hyperpnoea)
$\checkmark$ Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
2. Circulatory system
- Extrauterine circulation is established and the baby is able to divert deoxygenated blood to the lung for deoxygenation. This accounts for the pink colour of an infant.
- In utero the Hb is high $18-20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and high RBC to transport sufficient oxygen to the foetus. After birth the Hb drops to $14 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and some of the RBC are broken down by the liver cells to bilirubin and may lead to physiological jaundice.
- Normal heart rate in utero is 120-160 beats per minute but upon birth it drops to 100-120 beats / min

\section*{3. Temperature regulation}
- Temperature in utero is $38^{*} \mathrm{C}$ but the baby's rectal temperature is $37^{*} \mathrm{C}$. The temperature drops due to evaporation, conduction, convection and radiation.
- Temperature is not adequately regulated due to low metabolic rate and insufficient heat regulating center in the hypothalamus. They are at risk of overheating as well as chilling.
- They have thin subcutaneous layer which provides poor insulation and heat is lost. They have brown adipose tissue to mobilize heat resources.

\section*{4. Digestive system}
- Sucking and swallowing reflexes are present and they feed on colostrums and pass meconium (initially green then turns yellow)
- They open bowels 3-4 times a day.

\section*{5. Liver}
- Stars functioning in utero although negligible. Its function remains depressed for a few days yet it has to handle excess Hb thus there is accumulation of bilirubin leading to physiological jaundice.

\section*{6. Urinary system}
- A kidney start functioning in utero and the foetus passes urine but has no ability to concentrate urine thus excretes chlorides and phosphates.
- The baby should pass urine within the first 48 hours of birth.

\section*{7. Weight}
- Average birth weight is $2.5-3.5 \mathrm{kgs}$ but is affected by factors such as period of gestation, placental function, nutritional status of the mother, size of the parents, type of pregnancy i.e. single or multiple and sex of the baby.
- In the first three days the baby looses $1 / 10$ of its weight (physiological weight loss) due to limited intake, loss of meconium and loss of tissue fluid. The weight is gained within 7-10 days then it gains 250-500 g weekly.

\subsection*{2.2 CHARACTERISTIC OF NORMAL NEONATE}

Weight is $2.5-3.5 \mathrm{kgs}$.
Length from vertex to heel is $45-52 \mathrm{~cm}$
Head circumference is 35 cm and increases by $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ during the first month
Fontannelles and sutures are patent. Anterior fontanel closes at 18-24 months while the posterior closes at 6-8 weeks.

Skin is covered by vernix caseosa, a secretion of the sebaceous gland that helps in heat retention and acts as a lubricant during delivery.

Umbilical cord shrivels by necrosis and falls off in 7 days. The remaining part forms abdominal ligaments. Hernia may develop but usually disappears spontaneously.

Reflexes are fully developed.
Senses are developing.

\subsection*{3.0 PRE TERM BABY}

This refers to a baby born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy. Some of them may have growth retardation and therefore be small while others may be excessively large for gestational age (macrosomia)

Low birth weight baby is one with less than 2500 g

\section*{3.1 predisposing factors}
1. Maternal factors - maternal age eg. Primigravida below 17 years or above 35 years
2. Maternal disease in pregnancy such as anaemia, hypertension, pre-eclampsia.
3. Foetal factors -congenital abnormalities; multiple pregnancy and polyhydromnous due to over distension of the uterus; rhesus incompatibility interfering with foetal viability
4. Placental factors -APH due to placenta praevia and placenta abruption
5. Social factors -strenuous exercises, excessive drinking of alcohol and smoking, previous history of miscarriage, physiological stress.

\section*{3.2 clinical features}
- Small stature with low birth weighs less than 2500 g
- Thin and sparsely distributed hair on the head.
- Skin is reddish with plenty of lanugo
- Widely open sutures
- Eyes closed most of the time
- Pinnae of the ears are soft and fold easily on pressure and slow to uncoil
- Narrow sinuses and the nose a bit flat
- Swallowing and sucking reflexes absent or very weak
- Weak cry and there are no tears
- Chest is small, soft with underdeveloped breast tissue
- Poor muscle tone and the baby lies inactive most of the time
- In females, labia majora are widely separated and labia minora is protruding in between
- In males, scrotal muscles are smooth and testis are undescended
- Palmer and planter creases are absent
- Grasp reflex are absent

\section*{3.3 physiology of the pre term baby}
1. Immunity is low due to:
- Low gamma globulins responsible for immunity.
- Delicate skin that is vulnerable to injuries and infection
- Lack of passive immunity which usually develops around 38 weeks gestation
2. Blood system
- Has poor peripheral circulation with high tendency to hemorrhage because of weak vascular walls.
- Prone to hemorrhage due to lack of clotting factors(vitamin A is administered to promote clotting)
- Unable to store iron hence at risk of iron deficiency anemia.
- They have very few blood cells and may develop non pitting anemia
3. Weight
- Initially they lose up to $10 \%$ of their birth weight and start gaining and reach birth weight 23 weeks post delivery.
4. Temperature regulation is poor due to:
- Immature heat regulatory centre
- Limited food intake and low metabolic rate
- Inability to shiver and generate heat
- Excessive heat loss due to little or no subcutaneous fat. The brown fat is usually in baby's body by 36 weeks gestation.

\section*{5. Respiratory system}
- Under developed respiratory centre leading to difficulty in initiation of respiration.
o Frequent apnoeic attacks with irregular respiration.
- Abdominal movements more than chest movements.

\section*{6. Renal system}
- Immature kidneys are unable to concentrate urine hence they excrete chlorides and phosphates.

\section*{7. Digestive system}
- Absence of swallowing and sucking reflexes lead to poor feeding
- Regurgitation after feeds due to underdeveloped cardiac sphincter

\section*{8. Nervous system}
- All regulatory centres are under developed.

\subsection*{3.3 NURSING MANAGEMENT}
$\checkmark$ Delivery of a preterm baby should be conducted in a warm room and subsequently nursed in a preterm incubator.
$\checkmark$ Temperatures of the incubator should be maintained within normal range of about36-37 ${ }^{*} \mathrm{c}$
$\checkmark$ Perform first examination of the baby to assess maturity.
$\checkmark$ Fix NG tube and the baby with breast milk and substitute only where breast milk is not available.
$\checkmark$ Feed the baby using the oral feeding regime:
- Baby is given $60-65 \mathrm{mls}$ per kg of body weight in 24 hrs in 8 divided doses e.g. 2.5 kg baby will have $2.5 \times 60 / 8=18.99 \mathrm{mls}$ per feeding thus should be fed 3 hourly.
- If the baby tolerates, the feed can be increased
- If the baby can't tolerate the oral feeds, give IV fluids e.g. $10 \%$ dextrose
- Introduce cup and spoon feeding gradually as the baby gains weight
- Aspirate the gastric content to rule out indigestion.
- Close observation to include:
-vital signs TPR
- Respiratory rhythm to note apnoeic attack
- Umbilical stump for signs of infection
-vomitting or retaining food
- general activity and emotional status
$\checkmark$ Provide care of IV line i.e. securing, cleaning and dressing.
$\checkmark$ Give nutritional supplements e.g. iron, folic acids, vitamin from the second week.
$\checkmark$ Administer broad spectrum antibiotic prophylactically for prevention of infection
$\checkmark$ Take weight on alternate days to monitor the progress.
$\checkmark$ Discharge the baby at 2000-2500g
$\checkmark$ Give BCG vaccine on discharge or advice the mother to go for it.
$\checkmark$ Advice mother on family planning so that she gets another baby by choice and not by chance.

\subsection*{3.5 COMPLICATIONS}
1. Hypothermia neonaterum
2. Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
3. Respiratory distress syndrome
4. Retrolental fibroplasias
5. Failure to thrive
6. Jaundice
7. Infections
8. Anaemia
9. Rickets

\subsection*{4.0 SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE}

This term refers to a baby whose birth weight is below $10^{\text {th }}$ percentile of his gestational age commonly referred to as low birth weight but this includes preterm babies.

They are susceptible to various problems including:
$\checkmark$ Congenital abnormalities
$\checkmark$ Foetal hypoxia that may lead to intrapartal death
$\checkmark$ Birth asphyxia due to inadequate perfusion, meconium aspiration leading to airway obstruction.
$\checkmark$ Hypothermia due to little subcutaneous tissues
$\checkmark$ Apnoeic attacks hypoglycemia

\subsection*{4.1 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS}
$\checkmark$ Mostly they are born after 37 weeks.
$\checkmark$ Pale, dry loose skin with wrinkles and have little or no lanugo
$\checkmark$ Subcutaneous fat is minimal
$\checkmark$ Shows features of retarded growth
$\checkmark$ The abdomen appears sunken
$\checkmark$ Sutures and fontanel appear normal
$\checkmark$ Eyes are alert and has mature facial expression
$\checkmark$ Skull bones are hard and allow little mobility
$\checkmark$ Have strong cry
$\checkmark$ Umbilical cord is thin
$\checkmark$ Swallowing and sucking reflexes are present so they feed well
$\checkmark$ Normal muscle tone are active

\subsection*{4.2 NURSING MANAGEMENT}
- The baby is predisposed to the risks similar to those of preterm baby thus the management principles are the same.
- Management should start in labour by closely monitoring foetal condition for signs of foetal distress.
- In case of foetal distress in the first stage, administer oxygen to the mother and start IV drip of 10\% dextrose as you prepare the mother for emergency caesarian section. If in second stage, the delivery is hastened by giving generous episiotomy.
- Since the baby is prone to hypoglycaemia, it should be stared on breastfeeding as soon as possible.
- Gastric lavage should be done with warm dextrose before breastfeeding.
- Substitutes are given if there is no breast milk. The feed is calculated at $90 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight in 24 hrs in 8 divided doses i.e. 3 hourly feeding.
- Closely observe vital signs TPR and signs of infection.
- The baby should be nursed in a warm environment to prevent hypothermia although it has temperature regulating mechanism.
- Closely monitor blood sugar to rule out hypoglycaemia.
- Weigh the baby on alternate days to monitor the progress. Usually weight loss is minimal and it gains weight more rapidly and steadily than preterm.
- Teach the mother how to take care of the delicate skin that may be dry, cracked or peeling.

\subsection*{4.3 COMPLICATIONS}
- Hypoglycaemia
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Brain damage

\subsection*{5.1 ASPHYXIA NEONATORUM}

This is a term which refers to a condition in which the baby fails to breath at birth.

\subsection*{5.1 TYPES OF ASPHYXIA}

The degree of asphyxia is determined by Apgar score in which the following features are observed and score 0-2
- Appearance (colour of the body)
- Pulse (heart rate)
- Grimace (response to stimuli)
- Activity (muscle tone)
- Respiration /respiratory effort

A score between 8-10 does not show asphyxia. There are three types of asphyxia namely:
1. Mild asphyxia - Apgar score is 6-7. It requires clearing of the airway and application of external stimuli to in initiate breathing
2. Moderate asphyxia - Apgar score is 4-5. It requires resuscitation, administration of oxygen and drugs to initiate breathing.
3. Severe asphyxia - Apgar score is 0-3. It requires intensive resuscitative measures and intubation to survive.

\subsection*{5.2 PREDISPOSING FACTORS}
$\checkmark$ Any condition causing foetal distress e.g. cord prolapse, prolonged labour,APH, intrauterine hypoxia due to placental insufficiency, post maturity, placenta abruption.
$\checkmark$ Anaemia, Pre- eclampsia
$\checkmark$ Pre- maturity due to under development of the respiratory centre.
$\checkmark$ Blockage of the airway by mucus or liquor amnii at birth.
$\checkmark$ Birth injuries e.g. intracranial injury
$\checkmark$ Severe maternal disease in pregnancy e.g. sickle cell anaemia, cardiac disease
$\checkmark$ Depression of respiratory center due to drugs e.g. GA and narcotics

\subsection*{5.3 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS}

\section*{MILD AND MODERATE ASPHYXIA}
1. Apex beat (pulse rate) $100 / \mathrm{min}$ or less
2. Skin colour is pink with blue extremities
3. Response to stimuli may be present
4. Cry may be weak or strong
5. Makes effort to breath and may gasp with irregular respiration

\section*{SEVERE ASPHYXIA}
1. No attempt to breath and may gasp periodically
2. it does not cry
3. Entire body skin is blue i.e. cyanosed-central.
4. No response to stimuli
5. Pulse rate very low or absent
6. Poor muscle tone

\subsection*{5.4 NURSING MANAGEMENT}
$\checkmark$ Clear the airway as soon as possible.
$\checkmark$ Nurse the baby in an incubator for at least 48 hrs to keep it warm at body temperature.
$\checkmark$ Resuscitation may be needed to promote ventilation and ensure effective circulation to prevent acidosis, hypoglycaemia and intracranial hemorrhage
$\checkmark$ Do suctioning whenever necessary
$\checkmark$ Closely observe the baby for skin colour, TPR.
$\checkmark$ Administer oxygen by mask, ambu bag or nasal catheter whenever there is an apnoeic attack
$\checkmark$ Give IV fluids for rehydration.
$\checkmark$ Aspirate mucus to unblock the airway or may intubate the baby.
$\checkmark$ Give fluids with electrolytes to maintain fluid - electrolyte balance.
$\checkmark$ If the mother was given narcotics during labour, administer its antidote naloxone thro the umbilical vein.
$\checkmark$ Administer the following drugs:
- Sodium bi- carbonate $1-2 \mathrm{mls}$ to combat acidosis.
- Vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m to prevent haemorrhagic disorders.
- Aminophylline to improve respiration.
- Calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles.
$\checkmark$ Maintain accurate input output chart to prevent over hydration and under hydration
$\checkmark$ When the baby is stable pass NG tube and start feeding.
$\checkmark$ Observe aseptic technique to prevent cross infection.
$\checkmark$ Administer broad spectrum antibiotic prophylactically.

\subsection*{5.4 PREVENTION OF ASPHYXIA}
$\checkmark$ Proper screening of mothers to detect those mothers at risk and advice on hospital delivery for proper management.
$\checkmark$ Pelvic assessment should be done at 36 weeks gestation to rule out pelvic inadequacy e.g. CPD.
$\checkmark$ Proper management of maternal diseases in pregnancy.
$\checkmark$ Drugs that depress respiratory center e.g. sedatives, GA and narcotics should be avoided in late first stage.
$\checkmark$ Early detection and management of foetal distress.
$\checkmark$ Clearing baby's airway as soon as the head is born.
$\checkmark$ Avoiding instrumental deliveries but rather prepare for caeserian section.

\subsection*{5.5 COMPLICATIONS}
1. Brain damage
2. Cardiac arrest
3. Respiratory distress syndrome
4. Respiratory acidosis.

\subsection*{6.1 RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME}

This is a condition that occurs due to lack of or inadequate surfactant in the lung tissue. Mature lungs have adequate surfactant factor that lower the surface tension in the alveoli, stabilizes the alveoli and prevents them from adhering together and collapse. This leads to breathing with ease. Surfactant is produced slowly from 20 weeks gestation and reaches a surge at 30-34 weeks gestation and another surge at onset of labour.
The premature infant lack this function thus the alveola walls pressure rises as he breaths out and alveoli collapse leading to severe difficulty in breathing.
Other names are:
- Hyaline membrane disease
- Pulmonary syndrome of the newborn
- Developmental respiratory distress

It is a disease of prematurity and self limiting with recovery phase or death.

\subsection*{6.1PREDISPOSING FACTORS}
$\checkmark$ RDS may be a complication of asphyxia and develops within 48 hrs of birth
$\checkmark$ Prematurity due to inadequate surfactant factor
$\checkmark$ Perinatal hypoxia e.g due to APH which reduces surfactant synthesis
$\checkmark$ Perinatal hypoxia
$\checkmark$ Profound hypothermia -leads to injury of cells that produces surfactant
$\checkmark$ Congenital heart disease

\subsection*{6.2CLINICAL FEATURES}
$\checkmark$ difficulty in breathing- dyspnoea
$\checkmark$ flaring of the alae nasi
$\checkmark$ tachypnoea with respiration of above 60/min
$\checkmark$ hypothermia
$\checkmark$ generalized cyanosis
$\checkmark$ costal and sterna retraction
$\checkmark$ grunting expiration (prevent atelectasis)
$\checkmark$ reduced or increased heart rate
$\checkmark$ chest X-ray shows collapsed alveoli
$\checkmark$ the baby has poor muscle tone and is motionless
$\checkmark$ poor digestion due to diminished bowel movement
$\checkmark$ resolves or death occurs within 3-5 days

\subsection*{6.3 NURSING MANAGEMENT}

Management is symptomatic until the disease resolves.
If RDS is anticipated, inform the paediatrician to resuscitate the baby.
Nurse the baby in an incubator to prevent hypothermia by controlling the body temperature.
Administer oxygen or do artificial ventilation to prevent hypoxia.
Closely monitor the blood PH to prevent acidosis and support pulmonary circulation because high carbon dioxide level leads to constriction of pulmonary arterioles leading to poor pulmonary blood flow.

In case there is acidosis, sodium bicarbonate is added to $10 \%$ dextrose drip.
Keep the baby nil per oral till the distress resolves.
Administer IV fluids eg.10\% dextrose and add calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles; sodium bicarbonate to ensure fluid electrolyte balance.

Check heamocrit (PCV) and if less than $40 \%$ transfuse with blood.

Maintain the normal BP with volume expanders eg. n/saline.
Position the baby to provide greatest air entry(prone position with extended head)
Suction and do postural drainage to remove secretion and keep the airway patent.
Close observation to monitor the progress whether improving or deteriorating i.e. the heart rate, respiration, chest in- drawing, grunting respiration, and cyanosis.

When the condition resolves, introduce oral feeds. In case the baby develops abdominal distention due to ingestion, stop the oral feeds and start IV fluids.

NB: principles followed during care of babies with respiratory problems are observation, oxygenation, positioning, nutrition and hydration.

\subsection*{6.4 PREVENTION}
$\checkmark$ Early detection and management of high risk pregnancies to prevent premature delivery
$\checkmark$ Conditions such as diabetic mellitus should be properly managed so that delivery can be prolonged to 36-38 weeks. The mother is given Dexamethasone 4 mg tds 48 hrs before c/s to stimulate lung maturity.
$\checkmark$ Prevent prenatal hypoxia by ensuring there is no intracranial injury at birth.
$\checkmark$ Effective resuscitation at birth of high-risk babies.
$\checkmark$ Assessment of gestational age and lungs maturity through amniocentesis so that elective $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ or delivery can be delayed if lungs are not mature enough

\subsection*{6.5 COMPLICATIONS}
$\checkmark$ Retrolental fibriplasia
$\checkmark$ Hypothermia
$\checkmark$ Hypoglycaemia
$\checkmark$ Patent ductus arteriuosus
$\checkmark$ Abdominal distension
$\checkmark$ Hypocalcaemia
$\checkmark$ Intracranial
$\checkmark$ Infection

\subsection*{7.0 HYPOGLYCAEMIA}

This is a metabolic disorder in which the blood glucose level falls below $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. At term, the baby's glucose level is almost equal to that of the mother but gradually drops within $3-4 \mathrm{hrs}$ after birth. This is why the baby has to be fed within four hours of life. The baby's maintain their energy requirements as long as they are kept warm.

This condition is common in infants of diabetic mothers. Due to excess glucose, the large babies (macrosomia). At birth the glucose level falls rapidly while insulin levels remain relatively high so the baby is at risk of hypoglycemia . this is why such babies are admitted to the NBU.

Prolonged hypoglycaemia can lead to mental retardation, permanent neurological damage anddeath due to respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

\subsection*{7.1 PREDISPOSING FACTORS}
$\checkmark$ Low birth weight
$\checkmark$ Prematurity
$\checkmark$ Birth injuries
$\checkmark$ Maternal diabetes mellitus
$\checkmark$ Asphyxia

$\checkmark$ Encourage the mother to breastfeed the baby
$\checkmark$ Feed through NG tube or cup and spoon expressed breast milk.
$\checkmark$ If the hypoglycemia is severe, put up 10\% dextrose infusion and give $65-85 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight in 24 hrs .
$\checkmark$ Give bolus dose of $25 \%$ dextrose $2 \mathrm{wmls} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight iv slowly for 30 min .
$\checkmark$ Closely monitor the glucose levels 1 hourly until the general condition is stable or normal levels have been achieved.
$\checkmark$ Once the normal levels have been achieved, wean off the dextrose and observe closely for changes in the condition.

\subsection*{7.4 PREVENTION}
$\checkmark$ Taking blood glucose levels at birth and introducing glucose feeds e.g. dextrose or breastfeeding within 1hr of life.
$\checkmark$ Prevent hypothermia.
$\checkmark$ Monitoring glucose level 2hrly for the first 6-8 hours.
$\checkmark$ Infants of diabetic mothers should be admitted into NBU and blood glucose level regularly checked.

\subsection*{7.5 COMPLICATION}
$\checkmark$ Hypothermia
$\checkmark$ Convulsions
$\checkmark$ Brain damage
$\checkmark$ Neonatal death as an outcome.

\subsection*{8.0 NEONATAL HYPOTHERMIA}

This is a condition in which the neonates body temperature falls below $36{ }^{*} \mathrm{C}$.the baby losses heat through radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation.

\subsection*{8.1 PREDISPOSING FACTORS}
$\checkmark$ Prematurity
$\checkmark$ Asphyxia neonatorum
$\checkmark$ Maternal diabetes mellitus
$\checkmark$ Respiratory distress syndrome
$\checkmark$ Cold environment

\subsection*{8.2 CLINICAL FEATURES}
$\checkmark$ Rectal temperatures is below $36^{*} \mathrm{C}$
$\checkmark$ Baby feels cold on touch
$\checkmark$ Paleness of extremeties and face
$\checkmark$ Very weak cry
$\checkmark$ Low respiration rate
$\checkmark$ Baby not eager to feed (poor feeding)

\subsection*{8.5COMPLICATIONS}
$\checkmark$ Convulsions
$\checkmark$ Hypoglycaemia
$\checkmark$ Brain damage

\subsection*{9.0 OPTHALMIA NEONATORUM}

This is a condition that occurs in neonates within 21 days of life and is characterized by purulent discharge from the eyes. It is common in infants of mothers who had vaginal discharge e.g. gonnorrhoea during pregnancy. Syphilis does not predispose an infant to opthalmia neonatorum but it causes congenital syphilis that is characterized by gross congenital malformation.

\subsection*{9.1CAUSATIVE ORGANISMS}
$\checkmark$ neisseria gonorrhoeae
$\checkmark$ chalmydia trachomatis
$\checkmark$ staphylococcus aureus
$\checkmark$ Escherichia coli
$\checkmark$ Haemophilus influenza
$\checkmark$ Streptococcus pneumonia
$\checkmark$ Pseudomonas .spp
$\checkmark$ Klebsiella

\subsection*{9.2 CLINICAL FEATURES}
$\checkmark$ Eyes have sticky watery discharge
$\checkmark$ Eyes are slightly red
$\checkmark$ Oedematus eyelids
$\checkmark$ Yellow purulent discharge if the infection is by N.gonorrhoeae
$\checkmark$ Inflamed conjunctiva

\subsection*{9.3 NURSING MANAGEMENT}
$\checkmark$ All perinatal mothers presenting with vaginal discharge suggestive of gonnorrhoae should be treated before delivery.
$\checkmark$ Correctly swab the baby's eye at birth.
$\checkmark$ Instill 1\% tetracycline ointment (TEO) to all babies prophylactically.
$\checkmark$ All infected babies should be isolated
$\checkmark$ Take eye swab for culture and sensitivity
$\checkmark$ Administer drugs such as;
- Gentamycin eye drops
- TEO but not systemic tetracycline
- Penicillin eye drops
- Kanamycin eye drops
$\checkmark$ Swab the eyes with warm saline 3 times a day from inside outwards
$\checkmark$ Administer some broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic but not tetracycline because it deposits in bone leading to depressed bone growth.

\subsection*{9.4 COMPLICATIONS \\ Partial or permanent blindness}

\subsection*{10.0 NEONATAL JAUNDICE}

This is condition in neonates characterized by yellow discoloration of the skin, sclera and mucous membrane. It develops when there is an excessive bilirubin level in the blood stream. When there is increased rate of haemolysis of RBC or decreased conjugation, there are high amounts of free bilirubin in circulation leading to jaundice.

\subsection*{10.1BILIRUBIN METABOLISM}

When RBC's are broken down by haemolysis, they produce heme and globulin. The heme part produces bilirubin and iron. Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble hence has to be converted to water soluble form (conjugated/ direct bilirubin) by process of conjugation for it to be excreted. Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver and thus it has to be transported to the liver by binding to transport protein, albumin. On arrival to the liver, bilirubin detaches itself from the albumin.

Conjugation is done by glucoronly transfares in which bilirubin is added to glucoronic acid to become bilirubin Diglucoronide that is water soluble. Excretion of the bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestine. While in the intestine, it is converted to stercobilinogen by the gut normal flora and excreted in stool. Some of it is absorbed from the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine.

If conjugation process is interfered with, there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyper bilirubinaemia and jaundice. This bilirubin may cross the BBB and cause brain damage, a condition known as kernicterus that is characterized by seizure, hyper-tonicity, lethargy, and stiff neck with hyper extended head.

\subsection*{10.2TYPES OF JAUNDICE}

\subsection*{10.2.1 PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

This type of jaundice affects both preterm and term babies in the first few days of life. It is apparent with the signs on the third day when the unconjugated bilirubin levels in serum is $25-125 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. In term babies, it never appears before 24 hrs of life but it can be in pre terms and the serum levels never exceeds $200 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. it is also self limiting in term babies.

\section*{Causes}
$\checkmark$ Excessive haemolysis of RBCs greater than conjugation rate.
$\checkmark$ Glucoronyl transferase enzyme deficiency
$\checkmark$ Increased enterohepatic reabsorption
$\checkmark$ Decreased albumin binding capacity thus less bilirubin is transported to the liver for conjugation.

\section*{Nursing management}
$\checkmark$ Admit the baby into NBU and assess the general condition.
$\checkmark$ Start early and frequent breastfeeding for it provides glucose to the liver cells and also encourages bowel colonization with normal flora which is important in formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool. It also leads to increased gut motility leading to faster excretion of bilirubin. Feeding also enhances enzyme production and conjugation.
$\checkmark$ Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hrs interval.
$\checkmark$ If bilirubin levels takes time to clear, put the baby on phototherapy.

\subsection*{10.2.2 PATHOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

This type of jaundice appears within 24 hrs of life and is not self- limiting thus may persist for long. There is rapid rise in serum bilirubin. It includes both obstructive and haemolytic jaundice.

\section*{Causes}

They include pathological disorders that increase bilirubin production, reduces transportation to and fro the liver or reduced rate of conjugation.
1. Increased haemolysis -Rhesus and ABO incompatibility, G6PD enzyme deficiency, bacterial septicaemia.
2. Non- haemolytic causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin -CNS hemorrhage, cephalo haematoma, polycythaemia, exaggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to fuctional ileus.
3. Decreased rate of conjugation -Criggler Nagar syndrome, Gilbert's syndrome
4. Hepatotoxic drugs
5. Billiary obstruction that prevents transport of conjugated bilirubin to GIT for excretion
6. Reduced bilirubin binding sites to the albumin.
7. Malnutrition
8. Increased reconversion of conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin if it stays in the GIT for long.

\section*{Nursing management}
$\checkmark$ Assess the baby to determine the degree of jaundice.
$\checkmark$ Do investigation on serum bilirubin levels and Hb .
$\checkmark$ Start the baby on phototherapy.
$\checkmark$ Order for blood exchange transfusion if necessary.

\subsection*{10.3Complication of neonatal jaundice}
$\checkmark$ Retinal damage due to lights used in treatment
$\checkmark$ Anemia
$\checkmark$ Hyperthermia associated with phototherapy.
$\checkmark$ Hypocalcaemia
$\checkmark$ Kernicterus
NB:read more on obstructive and haemolytic jaundice

\subsection*{10.4 TREATMENT MODALITIES OF NEONATAL JAUNDICE}

There are three main modalities namely;
* Phototherapy
* Blood exchange transfusion
* Protoporphyrins

\subsection*{10.4.1 phototherapy}

Phototherapy prevents bilirubin levels from going high enough to cross BBB and cause kernicterus

\section*{Mechanism of action}

Blue florescent light at a given wave length is absorbed by the unconjugated bilirubin in the skin and superficial capillary and is converted into conjugated bilirubin which is water soluble and can be excreted in stool and urine.

\section*{Indications}
* Pre term with jaundice appearing after 48 hrs and bilirubin levels are $260-265 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
* Pre term with weight less than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are $85-114 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
* Pre term with weight more than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are $114-165 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$

\section*{Care of the baby on phototherapy}
$\checkmark$ Expose the whole body of the baby to increase surface area exposed to light
$\checkmark$ Keep turning the baby 2hrly to expose all parts to the fluorescent light.
$\checkmark$ Ensure the airway of the baby is patent by extending the head.
$\checkmark$ Cover the eyes of the baby to prevent damage by direct ray of lights.
$\checkmark$ When breastfeeding the eyes are unpadded to encourage eye contact with the mother.
$\checkmark$ Provide intermittent phototherapy i.e. 6 hrs on and 6 hrs off but may be continous.
$\checkmark$ Give phototherapy for 2-3days and assess the serum bilirubin levels twice or three times a day NB. Greatest reduction in bilirubin levels will be in the first 24 hrs of phototherapy.
$\checkmark$ Observe the eyes for weeping or discharge.
$\checkmark$ If phototherapy is continous, give extra fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain accurate input output charts.
$\checkmark$ Change linen frequently because opening of bowels is increased(loose stool)
$\checkmark$ Observe the feeding and sleeping behavior of the baby.
$\checkmark$ Observation e.g. temperature to rule out hyperthermia and skin colour to monitor the progress.
$\checkmark$ Top tail the baby to maintain hygiene.

\section*{Side effects}
* Loose stool due to rapid instinal transit
* Dehydration
* Hyperthermia
* Visual deprivation
* Poor feeding
* Fragility
* Lethargy
* Irritability
* Hypocalcaemia

\subsection*{10.4.2 BLOOD EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}

This is a treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donor's blood. It is used as a definitive treatment when bilirubin concentrations are approaching toxic levels. The baby has haemolytic disease or low Hb. The transfusion has the following benefits
-it helps in increasing the baby's Hb
-excessive bilirubin and unwanted antibodies are washed from the babys circulation.
The donor's blood used for the transfusion should be rhesus negative so that it does not alter the babys blood group and to ensure that no antigen ios introduced into the baby's circulation that may lead to antibodies production. It should also be fresh and ABO compactible.

\section*{Indications}
$\checkmark$ Infants with haemolytic disease.
$\checkmark$ Preterms with bilirubin levels of 300-400 mol/l
$\checkmark$ Babies whose birth weight was less than 1500 g and have bilirubin levels of $255 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
$\checkmark$ Term babies with bilirubin levels above $100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ at birth or later $400-500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$

\section*{Care of the baby post transfusion}
$\checkmark$ Put the baby back to phototherapy to continue with it.
$\checkmark$ Closely observe the baby for bleeding from the umbilical cord.
$\checkmark$ If the baby was on infusion, continue for some time.
$\checkmark$ Reassure the mother and involve her in the care of the baby.

\section*{Complications}
$\checkmark$ Circulatory collapse
$\checkmark$ Incompatibility reactions
$\checkmark$ Acquired infections e.g. HIV, hepatitis B.

\subsection*{10.4.3 PROTOPORPHYRINS}

These are heme oxygenase inhibitors which are administered to inhibit the breakdown of heme thus reduce bilirubin production.

They are usually used in combination with phototherapy and/or blood exchange transfusion.

\subsection*{10.4.4 Nursing diagnosis of children undergoing phototherapy}
*Deficient fluid volume
* Imbalanced nutrition less than body requirements
* Impaired skin integrity
* Risk for injury
* Ineffective thermoregulation

\subsection*{11.0 HAEMORRHAGIC DISEASE OF THE NEWBORN}

This bleeding occurs during the first fews days of life due to vitasmin $K$ deficiency. Vitamin $K$ is synthesized by the bowel normal flora and its role is to convert clotting factors such as prothombin, thrombokinase, thromboplastin. To prevent HDN the neonates are given vitamin $\mathrm{K} 0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m.

\section*{11.1 predisposing factors}
- Hereditary factors- clotting factor defect e.g. haemophilia
- Prematurity
- Birth trauma
- Treatment with antibiotics
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)
- Birth asphyxia
- Mothers who are on drug such as warfarin, heparin and Phenobarbital

\subsection*{11.2 Clinical features}
- Continuous oozing of blood from the umbilical cord
- There is a spontaneous bleeding from various parts of the body
- Bleeding in the mucous membrane of GIT and may present with maleana stool or haematemesis
- Continuous bleeding from any punctured blood vessel or injection site thus when looking for venous access avoid puncturing femoral or jugular veins which are the largest veins in the body
- Haematuria or omphalorrhagia

\subsection*{11.3 Nursing management}
- Upon admission into NBU, administer vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m
- Preserve all linen soiled by blood for estimination of blood loss
- Administer vitamin K $1-2 \mathrm{mg}$ to arrest bleeding immediately
- Observe vital signs TPR $1 / 4$ hrly
- If bleeding is severe, transfuse fresh blood or frozen plasma at $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight
- Obnserve for signs of shock and if present transfuse with packed cells and fresh whole blood at $75-100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight if the baby is term
- General management is like any other baby in the unit

\subsection*{11.4 Complications}
- Anaemia
- Hypovolaemic shock
- Brain damage

\subsection*{12.0 BIRTH INJURIES}

Birth injuries refer to trauma that a foetus sustains during birth. The structures commonly involved are muscles, nerves, bones, visceral organs and skin.

\section*{12.1types of birth injuries}
1. Internal organ injuries - spleen, liver, adrenal glands
2. Nerve injury -mostly brachial plexus leading to Erb's palsy
3. Soft tissue injury -intracranial haemorrage, skull fractures
4. Extracranial injuries -cephalohaematoma,caput succadenium.

\section*{12.2 predisposing factors}
- Prematurity
- Large for dates
- Cephalo pelvic disproportion
- Malpresentation
- Congenital malformation e.g. hydrocephalus

\section*{CAPUT SUCCADENIUM AND CEPHALOHAEMATOMA}

Caput succadenium - is an oedematous swelling due to accumulation of serum fluid under the foetal scalp. It results from pressure between the foetal skull and pelvic bones during delivery that leads to reduced venous blood and lymphatic drainage and part of the serum escapes into the tissues. The swelling is self - limiting and disappears within 36 hours of life.

Cephalohaematoma -is accumulation of blood between the periosternum and the skull bone. It is caused by friction between the foetal skull bones and the pelvic bones e.g. in CPD

\section*{Caput succadenium}

\section*{Cephalohaematoma}

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Present at birth & Appears after 12 hrs of life \\
Disappears within 36 hrs & May persist for weeks \\
Diffuse and pits with pressure & Circumscribed; doesn't pit on pressure \\
May cross a suture line & Never crosses a suture line
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Double suture line is unilateral & Double cephalohaematoma is bilateral \\
Tends to grow less with time & Tends to grow larger with time
\end{tabular}

\section*{INTRACRANIAL INJURIES AND HAEMORRHAGE}

This refer to the damage of structures within the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Various structures may be injured leading to different types of haemorrhage:
* Cerebral tissue - injury to cerebrum leading to cerebral haemorrhage
* Cerebral hemisphere and basal ganglia -supra tentorial haemorrhage
* Veins of gallen and tentorium - subarachnoid haemorrhage
* Falx cerebri (fold of dura mater and tentorium cerebelli) -subdural haemorrhage

NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE NEWBORN

On leaving the intrauterine environment, the baby's basic needs are to:
establish respiration and subsequently adequate nutrition
maintain normal body temperature
avoid contact with infection.

\section*{NEWBORN REFLEXES}

Moro Reflex - Support the child with your hand and forearm. Then gently but swiftly, tilt the child backwards. In normal circumstances, the child should outstretch their arms (and legs). This is a positive moro reflex.
Rooting reflex - when you gently touch next to the baby's mouth, the baby will turn their head and try to suckle.

Grasp reflex - place your finger in the baby's palm. The baby should grasp with a firm grip
Stepping reflex - holding upright above the bed, and then gently brush the bed against the baby's feet / shins. The baby should step. They may also be able to support some of their own weight.
Others???
a. To continue assessment of the newborn throughout hospital stay:
(1) Observe and record the infant's vital signs.
(2) Monitor weight loss or gain
(3) Monitor bowel and bladder function.
(4) Monitor activity and sleep patterns.
(5) Monitor interactions and bonding with parents.
b. To provide safeguards against infection.
c. To initiate feedings.
d. To provide guidance and health instruction to parents.
- Resuscitate and maintain an airway
${ }^{1}$ Keep the newborn warm and avoid unnecessary hypothermia or cold stress
4) Encourage early breast feeding, and feed high-risk newborns more frequently
¹ Maintain hygiene during delivery and cord cutting; treat infections promptly
9) Ensure the newborn infant stays close to its mother, and mothers have open access to their newborn infant if he or she requires special care

\section*{IMMEDIATE CARE AND ASSESSMENT}

Observe infection prevention practices Deliver baby onto the mother's abdomen Dry the baby and keep warm Assess baby's breathing, skin color and tone
Wipe eyes
Clamp, tie and cut umbilical cord at 2 and 5 cm from the abdomen
Initiate breastfeeding within one hour

\section*{APGAR}

Respiration

\section*{RESUSCITATION OF THE NEWBORN}

Resuscitation is an emergency measure taken to sustain life or to revive when life has just ceased. The aim is to establish the heart and lung function following cardiopulmonary arrest.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Preparation
Check and arrange equipment/supplies at all times (use equipment checklist) as follows:
- A firm stable surface
- Source of heat e.g. heater, heater lamp or resuscitaire
- Adequate lighting
- Source of oxygen, flow meter, tubing and key
- Suction equipment i.e. suction machine, suction catheters sizes F6, 8, 10
- Ambu bag (500mls)
- Face masks sizes 0 and 1, preferably round
- Wall clock
- At least two pieces of warm dry linen
- Syringes and needles/swabs, (preferably $1 \mathrm{ml}, 2 \mathrm{ml}$ and 10 mls )
- Stethoscope
- Artificial Airways
- Nasal prongs
- Nasogastric tubes
- Scissors and tape

\section*{THE DRUG TRAY}
should contain the following :
Sodium bicarbonate 8.4\% or 7.5\% for correction of metabolic acidosis.
Fifty percent dextrose for correction of hypoglacemia (survival of the newborn infant correlates with glycogen stores).
Adrenaline if the heart rate is falling after several minutes of vigorous resuscitative efforts; it may be given directly by cardiac puncture and then external cardiac massage started. This drug is also a vaso-dilator.

Aminophylline in small doses is given to aid in respiration if distress is present ( $3 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{body}$ weight intravenously). This drug is a vaso-dilator and also stimulates the respiratory centre.
Calcium gluconate can be administered intravenously and slowly to a baby who displays tetany due to calcium deficiency. It is also a cardiac muscle stabliliser.
Source of oxygen to be administered after clearing the airway.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF RESUSCITATION}

ABCDO of resuscitation:
Airway should be cleared either by suction or positioning the infant.
(1)

Breathing, that is, establish respiration if not breathing.
Circulation should be noted through pulse, color of mucus membrane and heart beat. Start cardiac massage if there is no heart beat or pulse.
Drugs
Observations to make a diagnosis.

\section*{NEONATAL RESUSCITATION PROCEDURE}

Temperature:
Dry the baby, remove wet clothing and wrap baby in dry warm clothes. At the same time observe the baby's breathing, color and activity
Place the baby on a firm warm surface or under a radiant heat warmer

Position baby's head in a neutral position (slightly extended position) to open airway.
Open airway
Suction -If there is meconium stained fluid and baby is not crying and moving limbs (Do not suck for more than 3 seconds)
- Suck only what you can see
- Suck the mouth and then the nose
- Suck only while withdrawing the catheter
Place mask to cover chin, mouth and nose
Form a seal
Squeeze bag attached to the mask with two fingers or whole hand about 30 to 50 times per minute
Watch chest for movement, do not over inflate, allow baby to breathe out. If chest is not rising:
- Reposition the head
- Check mask seal
- Squeeze bag harder
Start ventilation immediately using room air (bag and mask). If the baby does not improve then use oxygen

Pull the jaw forward towards the mask with the third finger of the hand holding the mask. Do not hyperextend the neck.

\section*{Circulation}

Assess and count heart rate.

\section*{Chest compression}

Using two fingers method, or thumb method compress the chest ( 1 cm below the line connecting the nipples and the sternum) pushing down 1.5 cm .
Give 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths per minute (3 compressions for every breath).

\section*{OVERVIEW}
- Respiratory distress syndrome

Asphyxia neonatorum

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}
Explain the science behind RDS
Be able to identify who is at risk of RDS
State the signs of increased work of breathing
Outline other causes of respiratory distress in a new born baby
Discuss management of a baby with RDS

\section*{RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME}

Also called the hyaline membrane disease This is a developmental disease of the preterm infant.
pathophysiology - in RDS the alveolar and the ducts are filled with a sticky exudate, a hyaline material that prevents aeration.

This could be due to lack of surfactant that reduces alveolar ventilation and promotes atelectasis.
Reduction in alveolar surfactant may occur due to:-
Immature cells lining the alveoli
Decreased rates of production due to early neonatal stress
Inadequate release of surfactant from the alveolar cells
Death of cells producing surfactants.

\section*{SIGNS OF RDS.}
Increased work of breathing
Grunting
Respiratory rate >60
Cyanosis/low saturations
Recession: subcostal, intercostal, sternal
Head bobbing
Nostrils flaring
Apneas
Symptoms typically worsen over first 48-72h
Investigations:
Full hemogram / full blood count
Blood culture
Blood sugar
X-ray where possible

\section*{TREATMENT}
Oxygen
Intubation and ventilation
Surfactant administration directly to the lungs
Feeding support with NG feeds or IV fluids
Antibiotics (incase respiratory distress due to infection)

\section*{NURSING CARE}
Administer oxygen using the appropriate delivery method
If secretions are present use suction for brief periods using intermittent pressures
Weigh the infant daily and monitor laboratory values as ordered
For IV lines change tubing every 24 hrs
Provide adequate calories per kg body weight
Prepare to administer surfactant replacement therapy (instilled into the endotracheal tube).

\section*{NURSING CARE CONT...}
Provide nutrition
Support bonding
Provide realistic information to the parents
Observe and report any signs of complications

\section*{PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO RDS.}
Prevent preterm labour if possible
Give dexamethasone to the mother at least 48 hours before delivery
Prevention of hypothermia at birth
Prevention of perinatal asphyxia
Adequate resuscitation

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Respiratory pneumothorax ,bronchopulmonary dysplasia
C.V.S - hypotension, PDA,
CNS - cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, renal failure

\section*{BIRTH ASPHYXIA}

Asphyxia means lack of oxygen
Means that baby's organs don't get enough oxygen before, during or right after birth

\section*{WHERE CAN THE BABY SUFFER FROM ASPHYXIA?}

In Utero
During Delivery
After Birth

\section*{CAUSES OF ASPHYXIA}

Decreased placental flow e.g. cord prolapse
Decreased placental gas exchange e.g. placental abruption, uterine rupture and placenta previa.
Decreased placental perfusion
Maternal hypoxia e.g. maternal seizure
Inadequate postnatal cardiopulmonary circulation e.g. blocked airway
Poor APGAR SCORE mostly indicates asphyxia and the infant goes into apnea.
Poor placenta function that may occur with high blood pressure or in post-term pregnancies.

ASPHYXIA NEONATORUM

\section*{OVERVIEW}

Definition
Pathophysiology
Types of asphyxia
Signs and symptoms
Predisposing factors

\section*{DEFINITION}

\section*{[}
$\square$
Defined as the impaired respiratory gas exchange accompanied by the development of acidosis
According to WHO, it is as a failure to initiate breathing at birth

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
1. Anaerobic metabolism
2. Profound metabolic acidosis
3. Persistence of apgar score of 0 to 3 beyond 5 minutes
4. Clinical neurologic sequelae caused by Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
5. Multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period

\section*{TYPES OF ASPHYXIA}

The degree of asphyxia is determined by apgar score.
An apgar score between 8-10 does not show asphyxia
There are three types:
1. Mild asphyxia apgar score: 6-7 (at 5 minutes). It requires clearing of airway and application of external stimuli to initiate breathing.
2. Moderate asphyxia: apgar score 4-5. it requires rescuscitation, administration of oxygen, and drugs to initiate breathing
3. Severe asphyxia: apgar score 0-3. requires intensive resuscitative measures and intubation to survive

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Apnea
- Bradycardia
- Altered respiratory patterns (grunting,

Gasping)
- Cyanosis
- Pallor
- Hypotonia

Unresponsiveness
1. Mild and moderate asphyxia Apex beat (pulse) 100 / min or less Skin color is pink with blue extremities Response to stimuli may be present Cry may be weak or strong Makes effort to breathe and may gasp with irregular respiration
2. Severe asphyxia

No attempt to breathe and may gasp periodically
It does not cry
Entire body skin is blue i.e. cyanosed
No response to stimuli
Pulse rate very low or absent
Poor muscle tone

\section*{PREDISPOSING FACTORS}

Depression of the central nervous system of the fetus is the most common basic cause for failure to breathe at birth. However there are also maternal and fetal factors
Maternal causes:
Medical conditions e.g. chronic hypertension
Antenatal conditions e.g. abnormal uterine contractions, antepartum hemorrhage, prolapsed cord, malpositions etc.
Drug abuse
Fetal causes:
Multiple pregnancies,
Big baby with C.P.D
Fetal anomalies e.g. anomalies of the lungs

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
1. Clear the airway as soon as the baby is born
2. Nurse the baby in an incubator for at least 48 hours to keep it warm at body temperature
3. Resuscitation may be needed to promote ventilation and ensure effective circulation to prevent acidosis, hypoglycemia and intracranial hemorrhage
4. Do suctioning whenever necessary
5. Closely observe the baby for skin color, TPR
6. Administer oxygen by mask, ambu bag or nasal catheter whenever there is an apneic attack.
7. Give iv fluids for rehydration
8. Aspirate mucus to unblock the airway or may intubate the baby
9. Give fluids with electrolytes to maintain fluid electrolyte balance
10. If the mother was given narcotics during labor, administer its antidote, naloxone, through the umbilical vein
11. Give anticonvulsants to control convulsions if present
12. Maintain accurate input output charts to prevent overhydration or underhydration
13. When the baby is stable, pass NG tube and start feeding
14. Observe aseptic technique to prevent cross infection
15. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically

\section*{Drug administration}

\section*{Sodium bicarbonate $1-2 \mathrm{mls}$ to combat acidosis}
d.

Vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m to prevent hemorrhagic disorders
Aminophylline to improve respiration
Calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles
Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically

\section*{PREVENTION OF ASPHYXIA}

Proper screening of mothers to detect those at risk and advise on delivery in the hospital for proper management Pelvic assessment should be done at 36 weeks to rule out CPD
Proper management of maternal diseases in pregnancy

Drugs that depress respiratory centre e.g. sedatives, General anesthesia and narcotics should be avoided in late first stage.
Early detection and management of fetal distress
Clearing baby's airway as soon as the head is born
Avoiding instrumental deliveries but rather prepare for c/s

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Renal abnormalities (50\%), e.g. azotemia, elevated creatinine levels, acute tubular necrosis
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
Brain damage
Cardiac arrest
Respiratory distress syndrome
Respiratory acidosis

THE PREMATURE INFANT (PRETERM)

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

A preterm infant is a baby born before the 37th completed week of gestation.
This is most often due to the early over distension of the uterus, which leads to the fetus being born prematurely.
Premature births also occur more frequently in low socio economic and illiterate groups in the population, largely as a result of the poor nutritional intake of the pregnant mother.
Additionally, they tend to be more common when there is concurrent maternal metabolic or systemic disease, for example, hypertension and Diabetes.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PRETERM}
WHO Classification is based on gestational age:
Extremely preterm ( < 28 weeks)
Very preterm ( 28 to < 32 weeks)
Moderate to late preterm (32 to <37 weeks)

\section*{PREDISPOSING FACTORS TO PREMATURITY}

\section*{Fetal factors}

Polyhydramnios which causes over distension
Congenital malformation of the fetus
Rhesus incompatibility interfering with fetal viability.
Multiple births (twins or more), which causes early distension of the uterus hence early birth

\section*{Maternal factors}

Hypertension associated with the pregnancy leading to early induction of labor, for example, preeclampsia and eclampsia
Premature rupture of membranes due to physical or psychological stress

Chronic infections or diseases in the mother, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, chronic nephritis, cardiac disease, diabetes and thyroid disease, may lead to premature labor
Acute infections in the mother, like pneumonia, influenza, rheumatic fever and malaria could induce premature labor
Strenuous exercise, excessive drinking of alcohol, smoking

Physical stress caused by non obstetric surgery may lead to premature labor if the mother has this procedure while pregnant Habitual abortion owing to incompetent cervical OS or uterine malformation Placental factors

Antepartum hemorrhage due to placentae praevia and placenta abruptio

\section*{PREVENTION OF PREMATURE BIRTH}
1. Early and continued prenatal care with stress on dietary and general hygiene education to the expectant mother.
This will also ensure immediate treatment of those complications of pregnancy likely to cause, or be associated with, premature labor.

\section*{PREVENTION CONT...}
2. postpone or inhibit uterine contractions in some cases of premature labor through the use of certain pharmaceutical agents such as:
Those that act by preventing the release or synthesis of a known uterine stimulant, for example, prostaglandin inhibitors e.g. . non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like aspirin, indomethacin, diclofenac
Those that act by the direct effect on the myometrial cells, for example, beta adrenergic receptor stimulants like retodrine, fenoterol, salbutamol

\section*{PREVENTION CONT...}
3. Prolonged bed rest should be encouraged, especially where the mother has any of the conditions that predispose to preterm labor
4. Use of sedatives during preterm labor to ensure complete bed rest
5. Avoidance of strenuous exercise and calming the mother, because any strain or stress may aggravate preterm labor

\section*{PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PREMATURE INFANTS}

\section*{General:}
the baby may appear pink or dark red, hands and feet may be cyanosed and may be jaundiced early.
Posture: flattened, abducted hips, flexed knees
Swallowing and sucking reflexes absent or weak

\section*{Skin and Appendages}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Sedatives of opium derivatives should not be used during premature labor
Shorten the duration of second stage by performing an episiotomy. As this will reduce the possibility of intracranial injury
Clear the airway using a fine mucus extractor/catheter
Administer oxygen at 1 litre per minute till respiration is well established and color is satisfactory

Put the infant in an incubator or cover with warm towels and transfer to a special baby care unit as soon as practicable
Once immediate steps have been taken to ensure the well being of the premature infant, further management aims at:
- Maintenance of respiration
- Provision of warmth
- Prevention of infection
${ }^{-}$Ensuring good progress and growth
- Promotion of parent-infant attachment

Ensuring baby gets adequate nutrition

If the baby cant tolerate feeds give iv fluids e.g. 10\% dextrose
Give nutritional supplements e.g. iron, folic acids, calcimax, multivitamin from 2 weeks, vitamin D at 1 month.
Take weight on alternative days to monitor their progress
Introduce cup feeding gradually as the baby gains weight

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF PREMATURITY}
Cyanotic attacks
Cerebral hemorrhage
Heart failure and pulmonary edema
Jaundice
Anemia
Infection
Poor mental and intellectual development in later years
Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Asphyxia
- Rickets

DISORDER OF GESTATION AGE AND BIRTH WEIGHT

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the lesson the learner should be able to:
Define SGA and light for dates infants List the characteristics of SGA infants State the factors that affect fetal growth/causes
State the differentiation between SGA and a preterm infant

Intra uterine growth standards are used to compare an infant's weight and gestational age with population averages
Height may however be affected by sex, age, parity etc
Weight serves to assess growth while gestational age assesses maturity
The fetal growth chart presents average fetal weights for the $10^{\text {th }}, 25^{\text {th }}, 50^{\text {th }}$ and $75^{\text {th }}$ percentiles

An infant born at 40 weeks gestation and weighing less 2500 g would be mature but undergrown (intra-uterine growth retardation). This is classified as small for gestational age. An infant born at 36 weeks but weighing 3600 g (above $90^{\text {th }}$ percentile) would be immature but overgrown (large for gestational age)
Premature infants are those born before 37 weeks gestation. An infant weighing 2500 g or less is of low birth weight while infants weighing 1500 g or less are of very low birth weight.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING FETAL GROWTH}
1. Maternal factors - maternal nutritional factors will lead to low weight gain during pregnancy Women who are malnourished during pregnancy due to poverty, adolescence, women with frequent pregnancies are likely to deliver low birth weight babies
pregnancy induced hypertension poses a threat to fetal growth since it decreases intra uterine blood flow advanced maternal diabetes and the accompanying vascular insufficiency promote intra uterine growth retardation

Substance abuse - e.g. cigarette smoking has been correlated with decreased fetal growth. Birth weight is decreased on the average of 170 g as a result of 10 cigarettes smoked per day
Extremes of maternal age
2.Placental influences

Under normal circumstances the size of the placenta determines fetal size. When there is severe nutritional deprivation the maintenance needs of the placenta are met first leading to reduction in fetal growth. The diffussional capacity of the placenta increases with fetal growth. Any impairment of oxygen and nutrients transfer affects fetal.
3.fetal endocrine influences -????

\section*{SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE}

A term used to describe a baby who is smaller than the usual size for the number of weeks of pregnancy; considering parameters such as length head circumference

\section*{assesment of sga infants}

Neurological criteria tend to be more accurate than physical criteria since most of the physical characteristics tend to be abnormal.

\section*{LIGHT FOR DATES BABY}

A baby whose birth weight is below the 10th percentile for its estimated gestational age. One third of low birth weight babies are light for dates Both conditions reflect intrauterine malnutrition and growth retardation of the fetus.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

There is no significant difference in management from that described for the normal infant except that the small for gestational age or light for dates infant would be more susceptible to hypothermia.
Babies <2kg should be given incubator care if not on skin to skin care
Initiate early feeding to prevent hypoglycemia using cup
Labworks, I/O,
Facilitate bonding
Infection prevention
Health education and support to parents and caregivers

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF SGA}
Asphyxia
Respiratory distress syndrome (rare)
Hypoglycemia
Hypothermia
There is a high mortality risk

NEONATALJAUNDICE

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

Define jaundice
Differentiate between physiological and pathological jaundice describe the management of jaundice Discuss nursing management of a baby on phototherapy
Describe exchange transfusion Discuss the two main types of blood incompatibilities

\section*{DEFINITION}

Neonatal jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the skin and/or sclera of newborn infants caused by tissue deposition of bilirubin.

There is Excessive levels and accumulation of bilirubin in blood
- Normal levels are $0.2-1.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.
- Normally manifests when the bilirubin levels are more than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism}

When RBCs are broken down by haemolysis, they produce haeme and globulin.
The haem part produces bilirubin,carbon monoxide and iron ( via biliverdin which is green)
Unconjugated(indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble hence has to be converted to water soluble form(conjugated/direct bilirubin) for it to be excreted .
Bilirubin is transported to the liver by binding to a protein(albumin)

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

On arrival to the liver , bilirubin detaches itself from albumin
Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver
Conjugation is done by glucuronyl
transferase in which bilirubin is added to glucuronic acid to become bilirubin diglucuronide that is water soluble
Excretion of the bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestines

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

While in the intestines bilirubin is converted to stercobilinogen by the gut normal flora and excreted in stool Some of it is absorbed in the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine.
If conjugation is interfered with there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

This bilirubin may cross the blood brain barrier and cause brain damage leading to a condition known as kernicterus (characterized by hypertonicity, seizures,lethargy,stiff neck with hyper extended head)

\section*{PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

> Characteristics:
> Affects both term and preterm babies
> It appears between $\mathbf{2 4}$ to $\mathbf{7 2}$ hours of life. It is apparent with signs on Day 3 of birth.
> It is self limiting in term babies and fades away within 7 days.
> the levels of bilirubin in term babies don't exceed $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{CAUSES OF PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}
1. Excessive breakdown of RBCs

While in the uterus the fetus relies on fetal hemoglobin which has a greater affinity for oxygen, than the adult Hb
Once the neonate is born it adapts to the pulmonary system of adult Hb and the large mass of RBCS being hemolyzed creates a bulk of bilirubin in the circulation.
2. Glucuronyl transferase enzyme deficiency Enzyme responsible for conjugation of bilirubin. Deficiency of this enzyme results in increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin.
3. Increased enterohepatic reabsorption of bilirubin
Increases in newborns, because of lack of the normal enteric bacteria that breaks down bilirubin to urobilinogen/ stercobilinogen
Increased beta glucuronidase enzyme(hydrolyses bilirubin back to unconjugated bilirubin state). Accelerated by lack of feeding
4. Decreased albumin binding capacity: albumin binds to unconjugated bilirubin and transports to liver for conjugation. In preterm babies, the albumin is in lower levels, hence bilirubin will bind to tissues with bilirubin affinity such as the skin and brain

\section*{PATHOLOGICALJAUNDICE}

Clinical jaundice detected before $\mathbf{2 4}$ hours of life.
Characterized by rapid rise in serum bilirubin ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ ) per day
Serum bilirubin greater than $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
Clinical jaundice persisting beyond 14 days of life
Clay or white colored stool and/dark urine staining the clothes yellow

\section*{CAUSES OF PATHOLOGICALJAUNDICE}
1. Increased production of bilirubin: due to increase in hemoglobin destruction
Causes of destruction:

> Blood type/group incompatibility Hemoglobinopathies- sickle cell disease Enzyme deficiency -G6PD (maintains the integrity of the cell membrane) Sepsis/ infections Polycythemia
2. Interference with transportation due to:
reduced albumin
acidosis, hypothermia
hypoxia,
drugs that compete for albumin binding sites e.g. aspirin/ ampicillin
3. Conjugation interference:

Immaturity of enzyme systems.
Lack of/ inadequate glucuronyl transferase enzyme.

\section*{4. Excretion:}
bilirubin excretion is interfered with e.g.:
Hepatic obstruction due to anomalies (extrahepatic biliary atresia)
Infection i.e. neonatal hepatitis can cause an excess of unconjugated bilirubin

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

Admit the baby in the newborn unit and assess the general condition
Start early and frequent feeds (breast-feeding) for glucose provision to the liver cells, and also to encourage bowel colonization with normal flora; important for formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool
Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hour interval
If the bilirubin takes long to clear, phototherapy may be necessary

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PATHOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

Assessment of the newborn to determine the degree of jaundice
To determine the cause of jaundice
On physical examination, check for:
Skin color and sclera color
Signs of lethargy, stiff neck, hyperextended neck, seizures, (signs of kernicterus)
Presence of dehydration or starvation
Light stool or dark urine

\title{
TREATMENT MODALITIES FOR PATHOLOGICAL JAUNDICE
}

Phototherapy
Exchange transfusion

High intensity light at a given wave length (white to blue) administered in order to convert unconjugated bilirubin to conjugated bilirubin, which is excreted through stool/urine.

\section*{PHOTOTHERAPY CONT...}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-123.jpg?height=1525&width=2297&top_left_y=350&top_left_x=105)

\section*{NURSING CARE OF THE BABY ON PHOTOTHERAPY}

Clean the skin with warm water, avoid using creams and lotions on the skin of the baby Expose the whole body to ensure there is increased surface area of skin to light. Keep turning the baby 2 hourly to expose all parts to the light and monitor for rashes or dryness.
Top-tail the baby for hygiene and change linens frequently

Observe the skin color to monitor the progress. Monitor the temperature to prevent hyperthermia Cover the eyes with an eye pad to prevent retinal damage from the light. Uncover during breastfeeding to ensure eye contact
For continuous phototherapy, give extra fluids for every ill neonate or dehydrate babies.
Monitor neurological status of the newborn e.g. the sleep/wake patterns
Explain and reassure the family

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS OF PHOTOTHERAPY}
Hyperthermia leading to fluid loss and dehydration
Retinal damage due to high intensity lights
Skin rashes and skin burns
Visual deprivation and isolation

\section*{EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}

The treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donor blood.
Done when bilirubin levels are toxic (23-29)
Indications:
Infants with a hemolytic disease
Preterm babies less than 1500 g
Healthy term babies with bilirubin levels of 23 to 29
Complications:
Circulatory collapse
Incompatibility reactions
Acquired infections
Blood clots

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF JAUNDICE}

Retinal damage due to light used in phototherapy
Anemia due to increased RBC haemolysis
Hyperthermia associated with phototherapy
Hypocalcemia due to increased metabolism
Kernicterus when bilirubin crosses BBB causing brain damage.

HEMOLYTIC JAUNDICE

\section*{OVERVIEW}

Types of incompatibility
Prevention
Nursing management

\section*{TYPES OF INCOMPATIBILITY}
- Rhesus incompatibility
- ABO incompatibility

\section*{RHD INCOMPATIBILITY}

Also referred to as hemolytic disease of the newborn
The Rhesus complex (The D antigen) is an antigen found in the red blood cells of about 83\% of the population.
Problems arise if a Rhesus negative mother and a Rhesus positive father have a child who inherits the Rhesus positive traits of the father.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Rhesus incompatibility}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-133.jpg?height=1423&width=1577&top_left_y=274&top_left_x=385}
\end{figure}

The placenta usually acts as a barrier to fetal blood entering the maternal circulation.
However, during pregnancy or birth, fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) can occur
The woman's immune system reacts by producing anti-D antibodies that cause sensitization.
In subsequent pregnancies these maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal erythrocytes.

This hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn caused by Rh isoimmunization can sometimes occur during the first pregnancy
Sensitization during the first pregnancy or birth leads to extensive destruction of fetal red blood cells during subsequent pregnancies
Rh isoimmunization can result from any procedure or incident where maternal blood leaks across the placenta or from the transfusion of Rh positive blood to the woman

\section*{CELL DESTRUCTION}

Cells are destroyed, causing anemia and excess bilirubin in the blood of the baby. The baby will consequently be born with jaundice, which is normally seen 12-24 hours after delivery.

NB: Sometimes the neonate may not appear jaundiced, but the amniotic fluid will be golden and the cord is yellow.

\section*{PREVENTION OF RHD ISOIMMUNIZATION}

Anti D Ig:
Prevention is by administration of anti D immunoglobulin to mothers with non sensitized negative blood type who have a baby with Rh positive blood type within 72 hours of birth or any other sensitizing event

\section*{PROPHYLAXIS FOLLOWING OTHER SENSITIZING EVENTS}

Any threatened, complete or incomplete or missed abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy; if bleeding persists, anti-D should be given at 6 week intervals
Any spontaneous miscarriage before 12 weeks that requires surgical intervention to evacuate the uterus
Therapeutic termination of pregnancy by surgical or medical methods regardless of gestational age
Ectopic pregnancy

\section*{SENSITIZING EVENTS CONT.D}

Amniocentesis, cordocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling or any other invasive intrauterine procedure External cephalic version of the fetus Fetal death in utero or stillbirth Abdominal trauma and antepartum hemorrhage
Transfusion of Rh positive blood or platelets

\section*{ANTENATAL MANAGEMENT}

A mother who is Rhesus negative should be closely observed and at 26-28 weeks gestation; blood is taken for Coomb's test, which is repeated at 34-36 weeks.
Antibody titre is estimated. If it continues to rise, then labor is induced.
However, Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has the potential to maintain the fetus until intrauterine fetal transfusion can be performed. (possible in more developed countries).

\section*{ABO INCOMPATIBILITY}

ABO isoimmunization usually occurs when the mother is blood group O and the baby is blood group A. or less often group B.
Blood of types A and B has protein or antigen not present in type O blood.
Individuals with type O blood develop antibodies against $A$ and $B$
By the first pregnancy the individuals may already have high serum anti-A and anti-B antibody titers.

Some women produce IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta and attach to fetal red cells and destroy them
First and subsequent babies are at risk; however, the destruction is usually much less severe than with Rh incompatibility. ABO incompatibility is also thought to protect the fetus from Rh incompatibility as the mother's anti-A and anti-B antibodies destroy any fetal cells that leak into maternal circulation.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS.}
Hydrops fetalis due excessive RBC hemolysis (leading to anemia)It mainly presents as massive edema even to most organs and finally causes, multiple organ failure
Anemia.
Kernicterus

INFANT OF A DIABETIC MOTHER

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Women with diabetes in pregnancy (Type 1, Type 2, and gestational) are all at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adequate glycemic control before and during pregnancy is crucial to improving outcome
Diabetic mothers have a high incidence of polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and chronic hypertension;
Their fetal mortality rate, especially after 32 wks, is greater than that of non diabetic mothers.

Most infants born to diabetic mothers are large for gestational age.
If the diabetes is complicated by vascular disease, infants may be growth restricted, especially those born after 37 wk gestation
The neonatal mortality rate is over 5 times that of infants of non diabetic mothers and is higher at all gestational ages

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

The probable pathogenic sequence is that maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia
The fetal pancreatic response leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia
Fetal hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia then cause increased hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, accelerated lipogenesis, and augmented protein synthesis

Hyperinsulinism and hyperglycemia produce fetal acidosis, which may result in an increased rate of stillbirth.
Separation of the placenta at birth suddenly interrupts glucose infusion into the neonate without a proportional effect on the hyperinsulinism
Hypoglycemia and attenuated lipolysis develop during the 1st hr after birth.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

They tend to be large and plump as a result of increased body fat and enlarged viscera, with puffy faces resembling that of patients who have been receiving corticosteroids

\section*{MANIFESTATIONS CONT...}

Hypoglycemia
- Tachypnea
- Cardiomegally

Increased incidence of: hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and renal vein thrombosis

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
frequent prenatal evaluation of all pregnant women with overt or gestational diabetes, by evaluation of fetal maturity
by planning the delivery of these infants in hospitals where expert obstetric and pediatric care is continuously available
Periconception glucose control reduces the risk of anomalies and other adverse outcomes, and glucose control during labor reduces the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia.

Regardless of size, all infants of diabetic mothers should initially receive intensive observation and care.
Asymptomatic infants should have a blood glucose determination within 1 hr of birth and then every hour for the next $6-8 \mathrm{hr}$;
if clinically well and normoglycemic, feeding with breast milk or formula should be started as soon as possible and continued at 3 hr intervals.

If any question arises about an infant's ability to tolerate oral feeding, the feeding should be discontinued and glucose given by peripheral intravenous infusion at a rate of $4-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ Bolus injections of hypertonic glucose should be avoided because they may cause further hyperinsulinemia and potentially produce rebound hypoglycemia

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Macrosomia
Hypoglycemia
Polycythemia
Respiratory distress syndrome
cardiac failure
cerebral edema from birth trauma
asphyxia

INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

An intracranial hemorrhage is the pathologic accumulation of blood within the cranial vault.
This condition can be categorized according to the site of origin of the hemorrhage (in some cases, intracranial hemorrhage may involve multiple compartments), as follows:

\section*{INTRO...}
1. Epidural hemorrhage indicates blood between the skull and outside of dura
2. Subdural hemorrhage denotes blood between the dura and the arachnoid mater
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to blood between the arachnoid and the pia mater
4. Intraventricular hemorrhage refers to blood within the ventricles
5. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage refers to blood within the brain itself

\section*{ETIOLOGY}
Large head size
Rigid pelvis
Nonvertex presentation (breech, face, etc.)
Very rapid or prolonged labor or delivery
Difficult instrumental delivery
Coagulation disorders (e.g excess fibrinolytic activity, platelet dysfunction)

\section*{CLINICAL PRESENTATION}

A mass can be noted within 4 hours of birth
Usually a clinically silent syndrome in preterms
Term newborns present with seizures, apnea, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, bulging fontanelle
Systemic signs like hypovolemia and anemia

\section*{MANAGEMENT IN PRETERMS}

Supportive care; watch for complications Maintaining normal BPs, electrolytes and blood gases
Transfusions as necessary
Correct thrombocytopenia and
coagulation disturbances

\section*{MANAGEMENT IN TERM INFANTS}

Supportive care and treatment of seizures Serial lumbar punctures and eventual Venous pressure (VP) shunts In severe cases, surgery may be required to cauterize the bleeding vessels

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
MRI/ Ct. scans
Serial homoglobin and hematocrit monitoring
Coagulation profile to investigate for presence of a coagulopathy
Bilirubin levels also need to be monitored

FRACTURES

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Most fractures noted at birth are caused by trauma at the time of delivery
II
When more than one fracture is present, one should suspect underlying bone disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta
Fractures associated with delivery are usually either midshaft fractures of the clavicle, humerus or femur or epiphiseal separations of the femur or humerus

\section*{FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE}

Fractures of the clavicle are often unrecognized
Occur in less than 1\% of newborns
Common during vertex delivery
Often of the "greenstick" type (bone bends but does not snap)
Occasionally, crepitations may be felt
An asymmetric moro reflex may be noted.
Does not require treatment; other than care in handling

\section*{FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS}

Epiphyseal separation of proximal humerus:
The fractured limb is limp
Can be confused with Erb palsy.
Midshaft humeral fructures:
Motion is at the center of the shaft.
There may be associated radial nerve paralysis and resultant wrist drop, which resolves
Splinting of the limb to the chest is sufficient

\section*{FRACTURES OF FEMUR}

With a fracture of the proximal femoral epiphysis, the injured extremity appears shorter.
Often associated with abnormal presentation, usually footling breech. Treatment consists of reduction and immobilization
early professional interventions should be sought as serious vascular problems can occur during the management of this fracture

NB:
Always rule out child abuse (battered child) in all types of trauma

Outline the prevention of neonatal tetanus

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Neonatal tetanus a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborn babies Occurs in infants born without protective passive immunity because the mother is not immune.
Usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump
Estimated >270,000 deaths worldwide per year

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF NEONATAL TETANUS}

Overview:
Muscle rigidity
9) Irritability

Dysphagia
- Restlessness
- Facial grimacing
- Muscle spasms
${ }^{-}$Poor suck

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES (CONT.D)}
Usually symptoms begin 3-10 days after birth
Initial symptom is failure to suck and inability to open the mouth known as trismus or lockjaw
Spasm of the facial muscles immobilizes the jaw and produces a fixed sardonic grin called risus sardonicus

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES CONT.D}

Within 12-24 hours after the first symptom, generalized tonic muscular convulsions occur producing flexion and adduction o the arms, clenching of fists and extension of the lower extremities Initially spasms are mild but later become severe with spasms of the glottis and respiratory muscles

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES....}
Abdominal muscles become rigid and spasms of the muscles of the back may result to opisthotonus
Spasms may be precipitated by touch, noise or bright light
Baby remains conscious and alert

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF NEONATAL TETANUS}

The aims of treatment are:
1) Remove the source of the exotoxin
2) Neutralize the remaining circulating toxins
3) Provide supportive care until toxin is metabolized

\section*{Medical management:}

Washing and debridement of the infected site, and administration of antibiotics such as benzyl penicillin or metronidazole Anti-toxin:

Anti-tetanus serum
Human tetanus immunoglobulin
Sedation by:
Diazepam ( $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ )
Phenobarbitone
Paraldehyde

\section*{NURSING CARE}
Cleaning the umbilicus/ wound
Isolate the baby in a dark silent room
ensure proper positioning; to avoid respiratory compromise
Cardiorespiratory monitoring and support
Feed via NG tube: daily milk requirement is $100-120 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Aspiration pneumonia
Lacerations of the mouth and tongue
Intramuscular hematomas leading to hemoglobinuria and renal failure
Vertebral fractures
Decubitus ulcerations
Autonomic disturbances

\section*{PREVENTION}

\section*{CONGENITAL HEART DISEASES}

\section*{SIGNS OF CVS DISEASE IN NEONATES}

Cyanosis,
signs of heart failure other signs include tachypnea, retractions, nasal flaring, shallow respirations, enlarged liver, arrhythmias, murmurs, cardiomegaly, abnormal ECG.

\section*{CARDIAC DEFECTS}

Cyanotic
Transposition of the great vessels
Pulmonary atresia
TOF
Tricuspid atresia

Acyanotic
Patent ductus arteriosus

Ventricular/atrial septal defect
Coarctation of the aorta
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

\section*{DEFECTS}

TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT VESSELS - c the aorta originates in the right ventricle rather than the left while the pulmonary artery originates from the left ventricle rather than the right.

\section*{ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT -a}

An abnormal opening between the right and left atria persists after birth with left to right shunting of blood. This may result from failure of the foramen ovale to close properly.

The vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta which is functional during fetal life persists after birth.
When it remains open the direction of blood flow is reversed because of higher pressure in the aorta shunting oxygenated from the aortic blood into the pulmonary vasculature (during foetal life the shunt is from the pulmonary artery to the aorta)

There is an abnormal left opening between the right and left ventricles. Shunting of blood between the right and left ventricle occurs during systole because of higher left ventricular pressure. If pulmonary resistance occurs the shunt is reversed and occurs right to left with resultant cyanosis.

There is a constriction of aorta causing narrowing of the lumen. This partially obstructs blood flow, creating increased left ventricular pressure and work load. The coarctation may occur before or after the ductus arteriosus
Four defects are combined in TOF. There is:
pulmonary stenosis,
ventricular septal defect,
overriding aorta and
hypertrophy of the right ventricle.
Severities of the symptoms depend on the size ventricular septal defect, degree of pulmonary stenosis and the degree to which the aorta overrides the septal defect.

Diagnosis is done through cardiac catheterization as well as by angiography Once the lesion has been identified it can be corrected surgically or by use of medication such as: Digoxin, morphine, prostaglanding infusion, diuretics, and use of supplementary oxygen Monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.

Preparing the infant and assisting in diagnostic procedures
Provide small frequent feeds
Maintain input and output fluid records
Administering oxygen and monitoring blood gas status
Ensure safe administering of digoxin by checking dosage and route with another nurse
Monitor apical pulse and withhold digoxin if less than 90.

\section*{GASTROINTESTINAL MALFORMATIONS}

\section*{CLEFT LIP AND CLEFT PALATE}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-250.jpg?height=1254&width=1745&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=306)

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This results from failure of the soft or bony tissue of the palate and the upper jaw to unite during the fifth to tenth weeks gestation. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Factors associated with these conditions include: genetic factors, hypoxia, maternal viral infections and nutritional factors.

When only the lip is involved, surgery can be done within the first day of life. When the Palate is involved, the repair is usually postponed to 6 to 24 months. The infant should be fit nutritionally and free of infections, complications of this surgery include speech problems and respiratory tract infections.

Reassure the parents and ensure that the surgical team meets with the parents to explain the procedure.
Using a feeding bottle would be appropriate as sucking of the nipple strengthens the muscles.
Place the infant in an upright position and direct the flow of milk against the side of the mouth to decrease the possibility of chocking.
Mother needs to be told that feeding is important to ensure adequate growth until surgery can be performed

Thickened formulas are often used. Show mother how to feed the baby with breast milk
Note that babies with minor clefts can breastfeed
However those with bilateral clefts must be fed by cup and spoon
Take care to prevent aspiration

Cleft lip repair- position the child on one side to avoid injury to the incision site
After feeding cleanse the suture line with a cotton tipped swab dipped in normal saline. Administer antibiotics as prescribed.
Cleft palate repair- Infant can be positioned on the abdomen.
Feedings are resumed by bottle, breast or cup.
Encourage parents to hold the infant.

It is a midline defect of vertebral discs without protrusion of spinal cord and meninges.
This is a common malformation of the spinal column and is due to congenital lack of one or more vertebral discs, usually at the lower part of the spine.(usually involving L5 and S1)
Patches of hair and discoloration of the skin in the midline of lower back signifies malformation of the spinal cord.
When the membranes covering the spinal cord bulge through the opening the condition is known as meningocele (a soft tumor filled with CSF fluid is formed). The tumor can be influenced by pressure.
Surgical closure should be done as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration of the spinal cord

Myelomeningocele-both the spinal cord and the meninges herniate through the defect in the vertebral column. Most cases involve the lumbo-sacral region but may exist anywhere in the neural axis.
Encephalocele - abnormality that affects the skull and result in protrusion of tissue through a bony midline defect called cranium bifida.
The two forms are:
cranial meningocele-herniation of CSF filled meningocele sac through the cranium bifida.
Cranial encephalocele- contains a sac plus cerebral cortex, Cerebellum and a portion of the brain stem herniating out.

\section*{AETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS}

Genetic determinants
Malnutrition- folic acid deficiency
Drugs e.g. anticonvulsants
Radiation

Ensure the infant is nursed in a prone position
Ensure the area remains clean and free from contamination by urine or feces.
Ensure infection prevention to the defect site
Provide support to the parents.
${ }^{4}$ If the defect is not covered by skin:
- Cover with sterile gauze soaked in sterile normal saline
- Keep gauze moist at all times and ensure that the baby is kept warm
- If ruptured give Benzyl Penicillin 50,000units/kg 12 hrly and Gentamycin $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily for 5 days

\section*{DOWNS SYNDROME}

Also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. A child with trisomy 21 has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies in all of his or her cells.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS \\ 1.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS}

Down syndrome can vary from child to child.
Some of the most common characteristics are as follows:-

Flat face,
Broad forehead,
Short neck,
Narrow slit to the eyes,
White spots in the iris of the eyes (known as Brushfield spots)
Small, abnormally shaped ears,
Small depression near the nose with a somewhat flattened bridge,
Small mouth,

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS CONT.}
4. Slightly protruding tongue(the tongue may be abnormally big),
4. Short arms and legs,
${ }^{0}$ Short fingers and toes with the little fingers curving inwards,
a single horizontal, deep crease in the palms,
) Large space between the first and second toe on each foot,
weak reflexes,
- muscle hypotonia
hyperflexibility of joints

\section*{2.MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS}

Most individuals with Down syndrome have mild (IQ: 50-70) or moderate (IQ: 35-50) Intellectual disability with some cases having severe (IQ: 20-35) difficulties. Slow rate of learning and information processing
They also have trouble expressing what they have learned or understood via the conventional outlets of speech and writing

\section*{ASSOCIATED MEDICAL CONDITIONS}

Congenital heart defects- Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defect.
Gastrointestinal disorders- including the anatomical abnormalities such as imperforate anus, and functional disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux, and malabsorption.
Respiratory problems such as frequent cold, cough and flu.

Skin problems -Infants with Down syndrome have very soft skin. As they grow older, their skin becomes coarse and dry. Atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema is the main skin problem found in children with Down syndrome.
They may suffer from epilepsy, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and a shortage of growth hormones.

Physical Therapy
focuses on motor development. Since most children with Down syndrome have hypotonia or low muscle tone.
Early intervention is a program of therapies, exercises and activities designed to specifically help children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF NERVE INJURIES}

X-ray studies to rule out bony injuries
u/s and assessment of joints
Chest examination to rule out
diaphragmatic involvement
Passive movements started after 7-10
days (after resolution of the nerve edema)
Splints to prevent wrist and digit
contractures

\section*{Nursing management:}

The goal of care is to prevent contractures of the paralyzed muscle
The arm should be partially immobilized in a position of maximum relaxation so that the non-paralyzed muscles cannot exert pull on the affected muscles
By the use of splint or brace when the arm is paralyzed, the arm is abducted 90 degrees and rotated internally at the shoulder with the elbow flexed so that the palm of the hand is turned towards the head

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT CONT..}

When the lower arms and hand are paralyzed, the lower arm and the wrist are kept in a neutral position and the hand is placed over a small pad The infant is immobilized for 6 months during part of the day and night
A longer period of immobilization may be necessary for some infants
After 7-10 days, a complete range of motion (ROM) exercises may be given gently several times each day in order to maintain muscle tone and prevent contraction deformity

Nursing management cont..
When any form of immobilization is used, the fingers and hands must be observed for any coldness or discoloration and the skin for signs of irritation
When a splint is used, the parents must be taught how to apply it properly and how to provide skin care

They should be taught the proper dressing technique-affected hand first and on removing the unaffected hand first
More physical contact and affection should be encouraged than a normal child

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Severe hypotension and bradycardia
Nerve damage or neuritis
Horners syndrome with dyspnea and hoarseness of voice

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF NEW BORN \\ By njiru}

\section*{MODULE OBJECTIVE}

By the end of the module the learner should be able to:
1. Identify babies with special needs/babies at risk
2. Manage babies with special needs/babies at risk
3. Utilize the nursing process in managing babies with special needs /babies at risk
4. The babies are: low birth weigh babies, congenital abnormalities, respiratory distress syndrome, birth injuries and trauma, neonatal jaundice, neonatal sepsis, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, haemorrhage, babies of diabetic mother, opthalmia neonatorum and fetal compromise covered in abnormal midwifery.

\section*{Definition}
- A high risk infant is any neonate, regardless of weight ,size or gestational age who has a greater than average chance of morbidity, or mortality, , especially within the first 28 days of life.
- Risk factors include preconception, prenatal, natal, or postnatal conditions or conditions that interfere with the normal birth process

\section*{1. PREMATURE BABY}

Preterm baby is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Some of them may have growth retardation and therefore be small while others may be exessively large for gestational age (macrosomia).

There are sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age:
extremely preterm (<28 weeks)
- very preterm (28 to <32 weeks)
moderate to late preterm (32 to <37 weeks).

Category of low birth weight babies:
Low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 2500 g (up to and including 2499 g ), regardless of gestational age.
- Very low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 1500 g (up to and including 1499 g ), regardless of gestational age.

Extremely low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 1000 g (up to and including 999 g ), regardless of gestational age

\section*{Predisposing factors}
1.Maternal factors: Maternal age e.g. primigravida below 17 years or above 35 years ; maternal disease in pregnancy such as anaemia,hypertention,preeclampsia.
2.Foetal factors: Congenital abnormalities; multiple pregnancy and polyhydamnios due to over digestion of the uterus ;rhesus incompactibility interfering with foetal viability.
3.Placental factors: APH due to placenta praevia and placenta abruption.
4.Social factors: Straineous exercises, excissive drinking of alcohol and smoking, previous history of miscarriage, psychological stress.

\section*{Clinical Features Of A Premature Baby}
- Weak cry and there is no tears.
-Small stature with low birth weight less than 2500 g
-Thin and sparsely distributed hair on the head
- Skin is reddish with plenty of laguno
-Widely open sutures
-Eyes are closed most of the time
-Pinnae of the ears are soft and fold easily on pressure and slow to uncoil.
- Narrow sinuses and and the nose a bit flat
-Swallowing and sucking reflexes absent or very weak
-Chest is small, soft with underdevelped breast tissues
- Poor muscle tone and the baby lies inactive most of the time
-In females,labis majora are widely separated and the libia minora is protruding in between
-In males, scrotal muscles are smooth and testes are undescended
- Palmer and planter creases are absent
-Grasp reflexes are absent

\section*{Physiology of the preterm baby}
1. Immunity is low due to:
- Low gamma globulinsresponsible for immunity
- Delicate skin that is vulnerable to injuries and infection
- Lack of passive immunity which usually develops around 38 weeks gestation
2. Blood system
- Has poor peripheral circulation with high tendency to haemorrhage because of weak vascular walls
-Prone to haemorrhage due to lack of clotting factors.Vitamin K is administered to promote clotting.
- Unable to store iron hence are at risk of iron deficiency anaemia
-They have very few blood cells and may develop nonpitting oedema
3. Weight
- Initially they lose up to $10 \%$ of their birth weight and start gaining and reach birth weight $2-3$ weeks post delivery
4. Temperature regulation is poor due to:
- Immature heat regulatory centre
- Limited food intake and low metabolic rate
- Inability to shiver and generate heat
- Excessive heat loss due to little or no subcutaneous fat.The brown fat is usually in baby's body by 36 weeks gestation
5. Respiratory system
- Underdeveloped respiratory centre leading to difficulty in initiation of respiration.
- Frequent opnoeic attack with irregular respiration.
- Abdominal movements more than chest movements.
7. Renal system:
- Immature kydneys are unable to concentrate urine hence they excrete chlorides and phosphates
8. Digestive system
- Absence of swallowing and sucking reflexes lead to poor feeding
- Regurgitation after feeds due to underdeveloped cardiac sphincter.
9. Nervous system
- All the regulatory centres are underdeveloped

\section*{Nursing management}
1. Delivery of a preterm baby should be conducted in a warm room and subsequently nursed in preterm incubator.
2. Temperatures of the incubator should be maintained within normal range of about $36-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. perform first examination of the baby to assess maturity.
3.Fix NG tube and feed the baby with expressed breast milk (EBM) and substitute only where breast milk is not available.
4.Feed the baby using the oral feeding regime.
5. Baby is given $60-65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ per kg of body weight in 24 hours in 3 divided doses eg 2.5 kg baby will have $2.5 \times 60 / 8=18.99 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ per feeding thus should be fed 3 hourly.
6. Babies below 1500 gms feed 2 hourly.
6. If the baby tolerates the feed can be increased.
7. If the baby can't tolerate in the oral feeds, give IV fluids eg $10 \%$ dextrose day one the ( $\mathrm{HSD} / 10 \% \mathrm{D}$ ratio of $1: 2$ ) day 2 if there is normal renal function.
8. Introduce cup and spoon feeding gradually as the baby gains weight.
9. Aspirate the gastric content to rule out indigestion
10. Close observation to include:
- Vital signs TPR
- Respiration rhythm to note apnoeic attack
- Umbilical stump for signs of infection.
- Vomiting or retaining food
- General activity and emotional status
11. Provide care of IV lines i.e. Securing, cleaning and dressing
12. Give nutritional suplements eg.iron, folic acids, vitamin from the second week
12. Initiate kangaroo mother care (KMC) for all babies below 2500 gms , if the baby is stable and the mother mentally stable and is willing.
- Kangaroo Mother Care is defined as early, prolonged continuous skin-to-skin contact between a mother (or her surrogate) and her low birth weight infant.
- It is a simple, inexpensive and safe method of caring for low birth weight infants.
- Babies below 1200gms are nursed in an incubator ( not stable for KMC)
13. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically for prevention of infection
14. Take weight on alternate days to monitor the progress
15. Discharge the baby at $2000-2500 \mathrm{~g}$
16. Give BCG vaccine on discharge or advice the mother to go for it
17. Advice the mother on family planning so that she gets another baby when the stress has reduced

\section*{complications}
-Hypothermia neonatorum
-Haemorrhagic disease of new born
-Respiratory distress syndrome
-Retrolental
-Failure to thrive

Jaundice
Infections
Anaemia
Rickets

\section*{Kangaroo mother care}
- Kangaroo Mother Care is defined as early, prolonged continuous skin-to-skin contact between a mother (or her surrogate) and her low birth weight infant.
- It is a simple, inexpensive and safe method of caring for low birth weight infants.

\section*{Benefits of KMC}
1. Decreases the occurrence of apnoeic attacks and irregular breathing
2. Associated with less infections and when they occur, they are less severe
3. Decreases mortality of low birth weight babies
4. Increases mother's confidence in caring for her small newborn and improves bonding
5. Reduces hospital stay for mother and baby (early discharge)

\section*{Benefits of KMC}
6. Helps maintain an appropriate body temperature for the new-born
7. Promotes exclusive breastfeeding, resulting in a higher rate and longer duration of breastfeeding
8. Babies gain weight and grow faster as KMC promotes GI growth Reduces costs for the health facility and the mother/guardian as minimal equipment is required and is less expensive than incubator care
9. Enables fewer nursing staff to care for larger numbers of low birth weight new-borns

\section*{2. SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE}
- This term refers to a baby whose birth weight is below 10 th centile for his gestational age.
- commonly referred to as low birth weight but this includes preterm babies.

\section*{They are susceptible to various problem}
- Congenital abnormalities
- Foetal hypoxia that may lead to intrapartal death
- Birth asphyxia due to inadequate perfusion, meconium aspiration leading to airway obstruction
- Hypothermia due to little subcutaneous tissue
- Apnoeic attacks
- Hypoglycaemia

\section*{Signs And Symptoms}
- Mostly they are born after 37th week gestation
- Pale,dry,loose skin with wrinkles and have no lanugo
- Subcutaneous fat is minimal
- Show features of retarded gowth
- The abdomen appears sunken
- Sutures and fontanelles are normal
- Eyes are allert and has mature facial expression
- Skull bones are hard and allow little mobility
- Have strong cry
- Umbilical cord is thin
- Swallowing and sucking reflexes are present so they feed well
- Normal muscle tone and are active

\section*{Nursing management}
-The baby is predisposed to the risks similar to those of preterm baby thus the management principles are the same:
1. Management should start in labour by closely monitoring foetal condition for signs of foetal distress
2. In case of fortal distress in first stage, administer oxygen to the mother and start IV drip of 10\% dextrose as you prepare the mother for emergency $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$.
- If in the second stage the delivery is hastened by giving a generous episiotomy.
3. Since the baby is prone to hypoglaecaemia, it should be started on breast feeding as soon as possible.
4. Gastric lavage should be done with warm dextrose before breastfeeding
5. Substitutes are given if there is no breast milk, the feed is calculated at $90 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in 24 hours in 8 divided doses ie 3 hourly feeding
6. Closely observe vital signs TPR and signs of infection
7. The baby should be nursed in a warm environment to prevent hypothermia although it has temperature regulation mechanism.
8. Closely monitor blood sugar to rule out hypoglycaemia.
9. Weigh the baby on alternate days to monitor the progress. Usually weight loss is minimal and it gains weight more rapidly and steadily than preterm.
10. Teach the mother how to take care of the delicate skin that may be dry, cracked or peeling

\section*{complications}
-Hypoglycaemia
-Respiratory distress syndrome
-Aspiration pneumonia
-Brain damage

\section*{3. ASPHIXIA NEONATORUM}
- Asphyxia is a term used when the baby fails to breath at birth.

Types of Asphyxia :
-The degree of asphyxia is determined by Apgar score in which the following features are observed and scored 0-2
- Appearance (colour of the body)
- Pulse (heart rate)
- Grimance (response to stimuli)
- Activity (muscle tone)
- Respiration / respiratory effort
-A score between 8-10 does not show asphyxia.

\section*{Types of asphyxia}
-There are three types of asphyxia namely:
1. Mild asphyxia: Apgar score is 6-7 .It requires clearing of the airway and application of external stimuli to initiate breathing.
2. Moderate asphyxia: Apgar score is 4-5. It requires resuscitation, administration of oxygen and drugs to initiate breathing.
3. Severe asphyxia: Apgar score is 0-3. It requires intensive resuscitative measures and intubation to survive.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Any condition causing foetal distress eg cord prolapse, prolonged labour, APH
-Intrauterine hypoxia due to placental insufficiency, postmaturity, placenta abruption, anaemia and pre-eclampsia
-Prematurity due to underdeveloped respiratory centre
-Blockage of airway by mucus or liquor amni at birth.
-Birth injuries e.g. intracranial injury
-Severe maternal disease in pregnancy eg sickle cell anaemia, cardiac disease
-Depression of respiratory centre due to drugs eg General Anaesthesia and narcotics

\section*{Signs and symptoms of asphyxia}

Mild and moderate asphyxia
- Apex beat (pulse rate) $100 / \mathrm{min}$ or less
-Skin colour is pink with blue extremities
- Response to stimuli may be present
- Cry may be weak or strong
- Makes effort to breath and may gasp with irregular respiration

Severe asphyxia
- No attempt to breath and may gasp periodically
- It does not cry
- Entire body skin is blue ie. cyanosed
- No response to stimuli
- Pulse rate very slow or absent
-Poor muscle tone

\section*{Nursing management}
1. Clear the airway as soon as the baby is born. Nurse the baby in an incubator for at least 48 hours to keep it warm at body temperature.
2. Resuscitation may be needed to promote ventilation and ensure effective circulation to prevent acidosis, hypoglycaemia and intracranial haemorrhage
3. Do suctioning whenever necessary
4. Closely observe the baby for skin colour TPR
5. Administer oxygen by mask, ambu bag or nasal catheter whenever there is an apnoetic attack
6. Give IV fluids for rehydration
7. Aspirate mucus to unblock the airway or may intubate the baby
8. Give fluids with electrolytes to maintain fluid - electrolyte balance
9. If the mother was given narcotics during labour,administer its antidote Naloxone through the umbilical vein,
10. Give anticonvulsants to control convulsions if present
10. Administer the following drugs:
- Sodium bicarbonate 1 - 2 mls to combat acidosis
- Vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m to prevent haemorrhagic disorders
- Aminophylline to strengthen heart muscles
11. Maintain accurate input output charts to prevent overhydration or underhydration
12. When the baby,pass the NG tube and start feeding
13. Observe aseptic technique to prevent cross infection
14. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylatically

\section*{Prevention of asphyxia}

\section*{Antinatal period:}
- Proper screening of mothers to detect those at risk and advice on delivery in hospital for proper management.
- Pelvic assesment should be done at 36 weeks to rule out cephalo pelvic dispropation (CPD)
intrapartum:
- Drugs that depress respiratory centre eg.sedatives, GA, narcotics should be avoided in late first stage
- Early detection and management of foetal distress
- Clearing baby's airway as soon as the head is born
- Avoid instrumental deliveries but rather prepare for $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$

\section*{complication}
- Brain damage
- Cardiac arrest
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Respiratory acidosis

\section*{4. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (RDS)}
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome: is a condition that occurs due to lack of or inadequate surfactant in the lung tissue.
- Mature lungs have adequate surfactant that lowers surface tention in the alveoli,stabilises the alveoli and prevents them from adhering together and collapse.This leads to breathing with ease.
- Surfactant is produced slowly from 20 weeks gestation and reaches a surge at $30-34$ weeks gestation and another surge at onset of labour.The premature infants lack this function thus the alveoli wall pressure rises as he breathes out and alveoli collapse leading to severe difficulty in breathing.
- Other names are used to refer to RDS:
- Hyaline membrane disease
- Pulmonary syndrome of the newborn
- Developmental respiratory distress
-It is a disease of prematurity and self - limiting with recovery phase or death.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- RDS may may be a complication of asphyxia and develops within 4 hours of birth
- Prematurity due to inadequate surfactant factor
- Prenatal hypoxia eg due to APH which reduces surfactant synthesis
- Trauma to CNS due to difficult delivery or precipitate labour
- Perinatal hypoxia
- Profound hypothermia: leads to injury of cells that produce surfactant
- Congenital heart disease

\section*{Clinical features}
- Difficulty in breathing (dyspnoea)
- Flaring of alae nasi
- Tachypnoea with respirations above $60 / \mathrm{min}$ normal (30-60 bpm)
- Hypothermia
- Generalised cyanosis
- Costal and sternal retraction
- Grunting expirations
- Reduced or increased heart rate
- Chest x rays shows collapsed alveoli
- The baby has poor muscle tones and is motionless
- Poor digestion due to diminished bowel movement
- Resolves or death occurs within 3-5 days

\section*{Nursing management}
1. The principle of management during care of babies with RDS are observations, oxygenation, positioning, nutrition, and hydration.
2. Management is symptomatic until the disease dissolves
3. If RDS is anticipated,inform a paediatrician to resuscitate the baby.
4. Nurse the baby in an incubator to avoid hypothermia by controling body temperature
5. Administer oxygen or do artificial ventilation to prevent hypoxia
6. Closely monitor the blood pH to prevent acidosis and support pulmonary circulation because high carbon dioxide levels lead to constriction of pulmonary arterioles leading to poor pulmonary blood flow.
7. Incase there is acidosis, sodium bicarbonate is added to $10 \%$ dextrose drip
8. keep the baby nil per oral till the distress resolves
9. Administer IV fluids eg.10\% dextrose and add calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles ; sodium bicarbonate to ensure fluid electrolyte balance
9. Check haematocrit (PVC) and if less than $40 \%$ transfuse with food.
10. Maintain the normal BP with volume expanders
11. Position the baby to provide greatest air entry (prone position with extended head neutral ponormaly )
12. Suction and do postural drainage to remove secretions and keep the airway patent.
13. Close observations to monitor the process whether improving or deteroriating ie. heart rate,respiration,cyanosis.
14. When the condition resolves,introduce oral feeds gradually. In case the baby developes abdominal distension due to indigestion, stope oral feeds and start IV fluids.

\section*{Prevention of RDS}
- Early detection and management of high risk pregnancies to prevent premature delivery.
-Conditions such as diabetes mellitus should be properly managed so that delivery can be prolonged to 36-38 weeks.The mother is then given Dexamethasone 4 mg tds 48 hrs before $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ to stimulate lung maturity.
-Prevent perinatal hypoxia by ensuring there is no intracranial injury at birth.
-Effective resuscitation at birth of high risk babies.
-Assesment of gestational age and lung maturity through amniocentesis so that elective $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ or delivery can be delayed if lungs are not mature enough.

\section*{complication}
- Retrolental fibroplasia
- Hypothermia
- Hypoglycaemia
- Patent ductus arteriosus
- Abdominal distention
- Hypocalcaemia
- Intracrania hemorrhage
- infection

\section*{5. HYPOGLYCAEMIA}
- This is a metabolic disorder in which the blood glucose level falls below $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
- At term, the baby's glucose level is almost equal to that of the mother but gradually drops within 3-4 hours after birth.
- This is why the baby has to be fed within one hour of life.
- The baby's blood glucose rises steadily following feeds to $2.8-4.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ in 6 - 12 hrs.
- Term babies can maintain their energy requirements as long as they are kept warm.
-This condition is common in infants of diabetic mothers.
-Due to excess glucose, the foetus produces more insulin which increases its body fat and muscle mass leading to large babies (macrosomia).
-At birth the glucose level falls rapidly while insulin levels remail relatively high so the baby is at risk os hypoglycaemia.
-This is why such babies are admitted into NBU.
-Prolonged hypoglycaemia can lead to:
- Mental retardation,
- Permanent neurological damage and
- Death due to respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

\section*{Predisposing factors to hypoglycaemia}
-Low birth weight
-Prematurity
-Birth injuries
-Maternal diabetes mellitus
-Asphyxia
-Septicaemia
-Respiratory distress syndrome

\section*{Clinical features for hypoglycaemia}
- Low blood glucose less than $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Irritability
-Poor feeding
-Hypotonic muscle activity
-High pitched cry
-Hypothermia
-Lethargy
-Apnoea

\section*{Nursing management}
- Give 10 \% dextrose infusion untill normal glucose levels are achieved
-Encourage the mother to breastfeed the baby
- Feed through NG tube or cup feeding expressed breast milk
-If the hypoglycaemia is severe, put up 10\% dextrose infusion and give 65
$-85 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight in 24 hours.
-Give a bolus dose of $25 \%$ dixtrose $2 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight i.v slowly for 30 minutes.
- Closely monitor the glucose levels 1 hourly untill the general condition is stable or normal levels have been achieved.
- Once the normal levels are achieved, wean off the dextrose and observe closely for changes in the condition.

\section*{Prevention}
- Taking blood glucose levels at birth and introducing glucose feeds eg. dextrose and breastfeeding within 1 hours of life.
- Prevent hypothermia
- Monitoring glucose levels 2hourly for the first 6-8 hours.
- Infants of diabetic mothers should be admitted to NBU and blood glucose level regularly checked.

\section*{Complications}
- Hypothermia
-Convulsions
- Brain damage
- Neonatal death as an outcome.

\section*{6. NEONATAL HYPOTHERMIA}
- This is a condition in which the neonates'body temperature falls below $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- The baby loses heat through:
- Evaporation
- Conduction
- Radiation
- Convention
1. Evaporation: cooling of the body by loss of fluid on the skin (amniotic fluid).
- The infants surface area: body mass ratio potentiates heat loss, especially from his head which comprises $25 \%$ of his size.

\section*{hypothermia}
- Its subcutaneous layer is thin and provides poor insulation allowing transfer of core heat to the enviroment and also cooling of blood
2. Conduction: Heat is lost when the baby is in contact with cold surfaces.
3. Radiation: loss of heat to cold objects in the enviroment
4. Convention: loss of heat caused by currents of cold air passing over the surface of the body.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Prematurity
- Asphyxia neonatorum
- Maternal diabetes mellitus
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Cold environment

\section*{Clinical features}
- Rectal temperature is below $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Baby feels cold on touch
- Paleness of extrimities and face
- Very weak cry
- Low respiration rate
- Baby not eager to feed (poor feeding

\section*{Nursing management}
- Nurse the baby in a warm environment in a resuscitaire or wrap it in warm clothing or KMC
- Feed the baby with expressed breast milk via NG tube or cup if able to swallow.
- Give the baby extra glucose eg.dextrose
- Closely observe the baby for signs of hypoglycaemia and if present, give 10\% dextrose
- Check for and treat convulsions with anticovulsants
- Continue With General Nursing Care In NBU

\section*{Prevention of hypothermia}

Delivery should be conducted in a room with controlled temperatures.
- Dry the baby immediately to prevent heat loss through evaporation.
- Put the baby on resuscitaire or incubator to compensate heat loss to the environment.
- Baby should not be bathed within 1 hour of life but top - tailing can be done after one hour.
- Encourage skin to skin contact (KMC) method when carrying the baby.
- Cover the baby with warmclothing and a cap
- Change diapers whenever soiled heat loss through conduction

\title{
Complication
}
-Convulsions
- Hypoglycaemia
- Brain damage

\section*{7. OPTHALMIA NEONATORUM}
- This is a condition that occurs in neonates within 21 days of life and is characterised by purulent discharge from the eyes.
- It is common in infants of mothers who had vaginal discharge eg. gonorrhoea during pergnancy.
- Syphilis does not predispose an infant to opthalmia neonatorum but it causes congenital syphilis that is characterised by gross congenital malformation.

\section*{Causative organism}
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- Chlamydia trachomatis
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Escherichia coli
- Haemophilus influenzae
- Streptococcus pneumoniae
-Pseudomonas spp
- klebsiella

\section*{Clinical features}
- Eyes have sticky watery discharge
- Eyes are slightly red
- Oedematous eyelids
- Yellowish purulent discharge if the infection is by N .
Gonorrhoeae

\section*{Nursing management}
- All prenatal mothers presentig with vaginal discharge suggestive of gonorrhoea should be treated before delivery.
-Correctly swab the baby's eyes at birth.
- Instill 1\% tracycline eye ointment (TEO) to all babies at birth prophylactically .
-All infected babies should be isolated take eye swab for culture and sensitivity.
-Administer drugs such as:
- Gentamicyn eye drops
- TEO but not systemic tetracycline
- Penicilin eye drops
- Kanamycin eye drops
- Swab the eyes with warm saline 3 times a day from inside outwards.
-Administer some broad spectrum systemic antibiotics but not tetracycline because it deposits in bone leading to depressed bone growth.

\section*{Complications}
-Partial or permanent blindness

\section*{8. NEONATAL JAUNDICE}
- Neonatal Jaundice is a condition in neonates characterised by yellow discolouration of the skin, sclera and mucous membranes.
- It develops when there is excessive bilirubin levels in the blood stream.
- When there is increased rate of haemolysis of RBC or decreased conjugation, there are high amounts of free bilirubin in circulation leading to jaundice.

\section*{Bilirubin Metabolism}
- When aged, immature, malformed RBCs are broken down by hemolysis in the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen and the macrophages), they produce haem and globulin. Globulin is stored for reuse.
- The haeme part produces bilirubin and iron. Iron is stored for re use and uncojugated bilirubin (fat soluble) is waste product which should be excreted.
- Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble.
- Unconjugated bilirubin has to be converted to water soluble form. (conjugated/ direct bilirubin) by a process of conjugation for it to be excreted.
- Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver thus it has to be transported to the liver by binding to transport protien, albumin.On arrival to the liver, bilirubin detaches itself from albumin attaches to $x$ and $y$ receptor proteins.
-Conjugation with glucuronic acid by means of glucuronyl transferase enzyme to become to become bilirubin diglucoronide that is water soluble.
-Excretion of bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestines.
-While in the intestines, it is converted to stercobilinogen by gut normal flora and excreted in stool ( gives stool the colour).
- Some of it absorbed from the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine. If passage though the gut is slow some bilirubin will be unconjugated be beta glucuronidase
-If conjugation process is interfered with,there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice.
-This bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) may cross theBBB and cause brain damage, a condition known as Kernicterus that is characterised by seizures, hyper - tonicity, lethargy, stiff neck with hyper - extended head.

\section*{Types of jaundice}

There two types of jaundice:
${ }^{-}$physiological
${ }^{-}$pathological
1. PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE
- Physiological jaundice affects both pretem and term babies in the first few days of life. It is a normal occurence but it may indicate a serious condition.
Characteristic of physiological jaundice:
- Jaundice never appears before 24 hours of age
-The serum bilirubin levels never exceeds 250 umol/l
- The highest serum bilirubin level occurs on the 3rd or 4th day of life
- The jaundice fades by the 7th day of life
- The baby is otherwise well

\section*{Causes of physiological jaundice}
a) Excessive haemolysis of RBCs greater than conjugation rate. In utero the foetus high haemoglibin level $(18-22 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl})$ in order to attract sufficient oxygen across the placenta. The neonatal rbc's have a shorter life span (60-70days) than those of adults.
b) Glucoronyl transferase enzyme deficiency this is due to liver immaturity thus the liver can not cope with the increased haemolysis of rbc's
c) Increased enterohepatic reabsorption: peristalsis is slow until feeding is established and the new born gut is not yet colonised with the normal bacteria responsible for converting bilirubin digluconate to stercobilinogen. These allows apportunity for reabsorbtion
d) Decreased albumin binding capacity: thus less bilirubin is transported to the liver for conjugation.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Admit the baby into the NBU and and asses the general condition.
- Start early and frequent breast feeding for it provides glucose to the liver cells and also encourages bowel colonisation with normal flora which are important in formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool.
-Early feeding also leads to increased gut motility leading to faster excretion of bilirubin.
-Feeding also enhances enzyme production and conjugation.
- Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hr interval.
-If bilirubin levels take time to clear, put the baby on phototherapy.

\section*{Jaundice in preterm babies}
- The preterm baby is more prone to jaundice than the term baby
- The parameters are slightly different
- Jaundice tends to occur earlier
- Peak later and last longer than the in full term baby
- Haemolysis occur in the same way but the life of the rbc's is shorter (30-40 days)
- There is likely to delay feeding of a preterm baby especially if sick
- The gut is also immature thus peristalsis is reduced
- Albumin binding capacity is affected by an increased tendency to hypoxia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypoalbiminaemia
- Liver immaturity
- Likely to complicate due to jaundice and requires treatment for jaundice at a lower bilirubin than full term infants.

\section*{2. Pathological jaundice}
- Pathological jaundice appears within 24 hrs of life and is not selflimiting thus may persist for long.
- There is rapid rise in serum bilirubin.
- It includes both obstructive and haemolytic jaundice.

\section*{causes}
- They include pathological disorders that increase bilirubin production, reduces transportation to and fro the liver or reduces rate of conjugation.
1. Increased haemolysis - Rhesus and ABO incompatibility, G6PD enzyme deficiency, baterial septicaemia.
2. Non-haemolytic causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin - CNS haemorrhage, cephalohaematoma, polycythaemia, exerggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to functional ileus.
3. Decreased rate of conjugation - Cliggler Nagar Syndrome,Gilbert's syndrome.
4. Hepatotoxic drugs
5. Biliary obstruction that prevents transport of conjugated bilirubin to GIT for excretion
6. Reduced bilirubin binding sites on the albumin
7. Malnutrition
8. Increased reconversion of conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin if it stays in the GIT.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Asses the baby to determine the degree of jaundice
-Do investigation on serum bilirubin levels and Hb
- Start the baby on phototherapy
- Order for blood exchange transfussion if necessary.

\section*{Complications of neonatal jaundice}
- Retinal damage due to light used in treatment
- Anaemia
- Hyperthermia associated with phototherapy
- Hypocacaemia
-Kernicterus that is characterised by seizures, hyper - tonicity , lethargy, stiff neck with hyper - extended head.

\section*{Treatment modalities for neonatal jaundice}

There are three main modalitie named :
- Phototherapy
- Blood exchange transfusion
- Protoporphyrins

\section*{A) Phototherapy}
-Phototherapy prevents bilirubin levels from going high enough to cross BBB and cause kernicterus
mechanism of Action: Blue fluorescent light at a given wavelength is absorbed by the unconjugated bilirubin in the skin and superficial capillary and is unconjugated bilirubin (indirect) is converted into conjugated bilirubin (direct) which is water soluble and can be excreted in stool and urine.

Indications.
-Preterm with jaundice appearing after 48 hrs and bilirubin levels are $260-265 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
-Preterm with weight less than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 85-114 mol/l
-Preterm with weight more than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 14-165 mol/l
1.Expose the whole body of the baby to increase surface area exposed to light
2. Keep turning the baby 2 hourly to expose all parts to the fluorescent light.
3. Ensure the airway of the baby is patent by extending the head
4.Cover the eyes to prevent damage by direct rays of light
5. When breastfeeding the eyes are unpadded to encourage eye contact with the mother
6. Provide intermittent phototherapy ie 6 hrs on and 6 hrs off but may be continuous.
7. Give phototherapy for $2-3$ days and asses the serum bilirubin levels twice or three times a day

NB : Greatest reduction in bilirubin levels will be in the first 24 hrs of phototherapy.
8. Observe the eyes for weeping or discharge.
9. If photo therapy is continuous, give extra fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain accurate input output charts.
10.Change linen frequently because opening of bowels is increased. (loose stool)
11.Observe the feeding and sleeping behaviour of the baby.
12.Observations e.g temperature to rule out hyperthermia, skin colour to monitor the progress, apex beat, and respiration.

\section*{Side effects}
-loose stool due rapid interstinal transit
- poor feeding
-Hypocalcaemia
- fragility
-Hyperthermia
- Lethargy
-Visual deprivation
-Irritability.

\section*{B) BLOOD EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}
- This is a treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donors blood.It is used as a difinitive treatment when bilirubin concentrations are approaching toxic levels,the baby has haemolytic disease or low Hb .
The transfusion has the following benefits :
- It helps in increasing the baby's Hb
- Excessive bilirubin and unwanted antibodies are washed from the baby's circulation.
-The donor's blood used for the transfusion should be Rhesus negative so that it does not alter the baby's blood group and to ensure that no antigen is introduced into baby's circulation that may lead to antibodies production.
-It should also be fresh and ABO compatible.

\section*{Indications}
- Infants with haemolytic diseases
- Preterms with bilirubin levels of $300-400 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Babies whose birth weight was less than 1500 g and have bilirubin levels of $225 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Term babies with bilirubin levels above $100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ at birth or later $400-500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$

Care of the baby post transfusion
- Put the baby back to phototherapy
- Closely observe the baby for bleeding from the umbilical cord
- If the baby was on infusion, continue for some time
- Reassure the mother and involve her in the care of the baby

\section*{C) PROTOPORPHYRINS}
- These are haeme oxygenase inhibitors which are administered to inhibit the breakdown of haeme thus reduce bilirubin production.
-They are usually used in combination with phototherapy and/or blood exchange transfusion.

\section*{READ AND MAKE NOTES ON RHESUS AND ABO INCOMPATIBILITY, MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION}

\section*{9. HAEMORRHAGIC DISEASE OF THE NEW BORN.}
-This bleeding that occurs during the first few days of life due to vitamin $k$ deficiency.
-Vitamin K is synthesised by the bowel normal flora and its role is to convert clotting factors such as prothrombin, thrombokinase, thromboplastin.
-To prevent HDN, the neonates are given vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Hereditary factors clotting factor defect
-Prematurity
- Birth trauma
-Treatment with antibiotics
-Respiratory distress syndrome
-Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)
-Birth asphyxia
-Mothers who are on drugs like warfarin, heparin, phenobarbital

\section*{Clinical features}
-Continuous oozing of blood from umbilical cord.
-There is spontaneous bleeding from various parts of the body.
-Bleeding in the mucous membranes of GIT and may present with maleana stool or haematemesis.
-Continuous bleeding from any punctured blood vessel or injection site thus when looking for venous access avoid puncturing femoral orjuguolar veins which are the larget veins in the body.
-Haematuria or omphalorrhagia

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Upon admission into NBU, administer vitamin K 0.5-1 mg I.M
-Preserve all linen soiled by blood for estimation of blood loss
-Administer vitamin K 1-2 mg to arrest bleeding immediately.
- Observe vital signs TPR ¼ hourly.
-If bleeding is severe, transfuse fresh blood or frozen plasma at 20 mls / kg of body weight.
-Observe for signs of shock and if present transfuse with packed cells and fresh whole blood at $75-100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight if the baby is term.
-General management is like any other baby in the unit.

\section*{complications}
-Anaemia
-Hypovolaemic shock
-Brain damage
-Birth injuries refer to trauma that a foetus sustains during birth.
-The structures commonly involved are:
- muscles,
- nerves,
- bones,
- visceral organs
- skin.

TYPES OF BIRTH INJURIES
- Internal organ injury: spleen, liver, adrenal glands
- Nerve injury - mostly branchial plexus leading to Erb's paralysis, klumpke's
- Soft tissue injury - genitalia, eyes
- Intracranial injuries - intracranial haemorrhage, skull features
- Extracranial injuries - cephalohaematoma, caput succadenium.

\section*{Predisposing factors to birth injuries}
- Prematurity
- Large for dates babies
- Cephalopelvic disproportion
- Malpresentation eg brow, breecch,face etc
- Congenital malformations eg hydrocephalus

\section*{A) HEAD TRAUMA}
- Trauma to the head and scalp that occurs during the birth processis usually benign but occasionally results in more serious injuries.
- There are three main types of extracranial (out of the cranium, brain) haemorrhage which are :
- Caput succedaneum
- Cephalohaematoma
-Subgaleal or subaponeurotic haemorrhage
1. CAPUT SUCCADENIUM - Is an oedematous swelling due to accumulation of serum fluid under the foetal scalp. it results from pressure of the presenting part of the scalp against the dilating cervix during delivery that leads to reduced venous blood and lymphatic drainage and part of serum escapes into the tissue .The swelling is self limiting and disappears within 36 hours of life.
2. Cephalohaematoma - is accumulation of blood between the periosteum and the skull bone.It is caused by friction between the foetal skull bones and pelvic bones eg.CPD

\section*{Difference between caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma}

\section*{Caput succadenium}
1. Swelling under the scalp above the periosteum forms on the presenting part
2. Present at birth
3. Disappears within 36 hr
4. Diffuse and pits on pressure
5. May cross a suture line
6. Double caput is unilateral
7. Tends to grow less with time
8. Painless ill defined edges

\section*{cephalohaematoma}
1. Effusion of blood under the periosteumdue to friction btwn the skull and the maternal pelvis.
2. appears after 4 hrs of life
3. may persist for 2 weeks
4. Circumscribed; doesn't pit on pressure
5. never crosses suture lines
6. Double cephalohaematoma is bilateral
7. Tends to grow larger with time
8. Painful, well defined edges

\section*{3. Subgaleal or subaponeurotic haemorrhage}
- Subgaleal haemorrhage is bleeding into the subgaleal compartment.
- The injury occurs as a result of pressure through the head (of the infant) into the pelvic outlet
- It commonly associated with vacuum extraction
- Bleeding occurs below the epicranial aponeurosis.
- It can be confused with a caput succedaneum as the swelling extends across the suture line.
- Early detection is vital

\section*{Characteristic of subgaleal haemorrhage}
1. It is present at birth
2. The swelling crosses the suture line
3. It increases in size
4. Resolves in 2-3 weeks
5. Firm flactuent mass
6. Bleeding ma extend into subcutaneous tissue of the neck and eyelids
7. Bruising may be apparent for days and sometimes weeks.

\section*{Nursing care}
- Serial head circumference may detect any increase due to haemorrhage.
- The infant must be observed for signs of hyperbilirubinaemia and anaemia.
- If the haemorrhage is severe, blood transfusion may be necessary.
- Monitor the bleeding time and coagulation time.
- Assess the level of consciousness.
- Assess Haemoglobin and haematocrit
- Increase in bilirubin is expected due to blood lyses.
- Death due to massive haemorhage is a possibility.

\section*{B) NERVE TRAUMA/ INJURIES}
- The most common are the facial nerve and branchial plexus injuries.
1. Facial Nerve Injury:
- This is due damage of the facial nerve.
- The eye of the affected side remains open \& the mouth is drawn to the normal side.
- Might cause feeding problems.
- No treatment is required
- Spontaneous improvement should be seen in 7-10 days
2. Branchial Plexus Injuries:
- Branchial plexus nerves injury are caused by stretching or disruption of the nerve at the apex of the axilla, lying under the clavicle.
- Injuries can be cause by excessive lateral flexion of the head and neck in cases of shoulder dystocia or breech presentation.
- There are three main types of injurie
a) Erb's palsy
b) Klumpke's palsy
c) Total branchial plexus palsy
a) Erb's palsy:
- This involves damage to the upper roots of the branchial plexus involving the $5^{\text {th }}$ and $6^{\text {th }}$ cervical nerve roots.
- The affect arm is inwardly rotated, lies limply by his side and he can not flex his elbow or lift his arm, the half-closed hand is turned outwards (waiter's tip position), but there is movement of arm and fingers.
b) Klumpke's palsy:
- Klumpke's palsy involves the lower arm, wrist and hand, with wrist drop and limp ( no grasping reflex) fingers caused by damage to spinal roots C8 and T1.
- The shoulder and upper arm has normal movements
- The injury is caused by difficult birth e.g.in breech, large baby
c) Total brachial plexus palsy:
- There is complete paralysis of the shoulder, arm, wrist and hand \& loss of sensation due to damage of all the brachial plexus nerve roots.
Treatment:
- Resting the arm for 7-10 days followed by gentle physiotherapy to avoid contracture.
- Parents should be taught a full range of passive movements for shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
- Complete spontaneous recovery is more common with Erb's palsy than in Klumpke's or total brachial palsy but may take several months up to 2 years
${ }^{-}$Do follow up
3. Phrenic nerve injury:
- Commonly occurs in association with brachial plexus and less commonly as an isolated lesion.
- It may affect one or both sides of the diaphragm.

Treatment : varies from simple oxygen therapy to intermittent positive pressure ventilation
Complication: Hypostatic pneumonia
4. Horner's syndrome:

This is caused by damage to the cervical sympathetic nerves and is often associated with klumpke's paralysis
The syndrome occurs infrequently, presenting with ptosis (drooping or falling of the upper eyelid), enophthalmos (posterior displacement of the eyeball within the orbit) due to loss of function of the orbitalis muscle, constriction of the pupil and absence of sweating from the affected side of the head and face

\section*{C) FRACTURES}
- A fracture can occur during delivery most common are : fractured of the skull, clavicle, humerus and femur bones.
1. SKULL FRACTURES:
- These are rare and majority are linear and asymptomatic.
- An overlying cephalohaematoma or skull deformation may be the only feature
- They may be associated with intracranial haemorrhage, seizures, and death as contusion of the underlying brain may have occurred

\section*{Treatment :}
- symptomatic e.g. ant seizure drugs for seizure
- Antibiotics cover for patients with leak of Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF ) from the nasal and auditory canal
2. CLAVICLE FRACTURE:
this occurs due to shoulder dystocia and in breech delivery
- It is often asymptomatic and may go undiagnosed

Signs and symptoms:
A crack is heard during delivery
- Feeling of distortion at the break
- Presence of crepitus
- In late phase by callus formation

Treatment :
-Figure of eight bandage if the infant shows signs of discomfort
- A stable union of the break usually occurs within 7-10 days

\section*{3. Fractured Humerus}
- This may occur in shoulder dystocia or in extended arms in breech presentation
Signs and symptoms
- A crack may be heard at delivery or
- The infant may present with deformity or
- Pseudoparesis of the upper arm secondary to pain
- Confirm diagnosis by an x-ray

Treatment:
- by splinting the upper arm or bandaging the arm to the chest
${ }^{-}$Stable union occurs 3-4 weeks

\section*{4. Fracture femur}
- Fracture of the femur may occur during delivery of extended legs in breech presentation.
Signs and symtoms:
- A crack may be heard or felt at the time
- Fractures are usually in the mid shaft presenting with deformity
- Or pseudoparesis due to pain
- diagnosis confirmed by x-ray

Treatment :
- simple splinting and application of a firm a crepe bandage to the upper leg for 2-3 weeks.
5. Fracture spine: very rare but may also occur in breech deliver with extended head

\section*{D) MUSCLE INJURIES}

\section*{TORTICOLIS :}
- This results from injury to the sternomastoid muscle (sternocleidomastoid muscle) during birth when the muscle is either torn or its blood supply is impaired.
- It may occur during the delivery of the anterior shoulder in vertex presentation or while rotating the shoulders in breech presentation.

\section*{E) soft tissue injuries in the newborn.}
- Soft tissue injuries usually occurs when there is some degree of disproportion between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion).
Causes of soft tissue injuries
${ }_{-}$Dystocia
- Cephalopelvic disproportion
- Forceps delivery
- Enlarged fetus
- Vacuum delivery
- Improper episiotomy technique
- Caesarean section (rare)

\section*{signs, symptoms and feature of soft tissue injuries}
- Bruising with excoriation can occur in breech and face presentation
- In face presentation the face is congested and bruised and the eyelids and lips edematous.
- In breech presentation there is bruising and edema of the vulva area in female child and scrotum in male.
Nursing care for soft tissue injury.
- Assess the newborn for bleeding from the injury site.
- The soft tissue injury usually fade (disappear) spontaneously within few days, without treatment.
- Explain, reassure and provide health information to the parents about these injuries.

\section*{General management of birth injuries}
- Intrapartally, predisposing factors should be diagnosed and managed early eg.preterm labour,malpresentation,prolonged labour.
- Obseve the baby closely for skin colour, twitching, rolling of eyes, convulsions
- Keep the baby warm
- Administer vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m for they are predisposed to haemorrhage
- Maintain 2hrly turning of the baby
- Provide intermitent oxygen therapy when neccessary (PRN)
- Give fluids eg. $10 \%$ dextrose for the first 24 hours then introduce oral feeds if the condition improves.
- Give symptomatic management.
- Have resuscitative equipment ready incase of emergency
- Administer anticonvulsants eg. Phenobarbital prophylactically

\section*{Complications}
- Musculoskeletal deformities
- Brain damage
- Respiratory distress
- Hyperbilirubinaemia (jaundice)
- Hypogycaemia

\section*{12. NEONATAL INFECTIONS/NEONATAL SEPSIS}

Definition: Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection with or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life.
- It encompasses:
1. various systemic infections of the newborn such as septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections.
2. Superficial infections like conjunctivitis and oral thrush are not usually included under neonatal sepsis.

\section*{Vulnerability Of The Newborn To Infection}
1. The defense mechanism of the newborn infant are imperfectly under developed, More pronounced in the preterm baby, small for gestation or born after prolonged labour or prolonged rupture of membranes.
2. Skin and mucus membranes are thin and easily damaged,
3. The baby is virtually free from organisms and lacking a protective resistant flora.
4. There is decreased cellular immunity due to a reduced number of T- cell lymphocytes.
5. Phagocytosis is less efficient.
6. Immunoglobins ( 1 g ) are deficient, only 1 gG is transported across the placenta in the second half of pregnancy, this protects the infant against those infections to which the mother is immune. 1 gM only produced by the foetus if he is exposed to intrauterine infections and 1 gA is not manufactured until birth.

\section*{Modes of acquiring infections}
- Across the placenta e.g. Rubella virus, HIV, histoplasmosis, syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), listeria monocytogens
- Intrapartum transmission: herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B, candida albicans, Ophthalmia neonatorum, pneumonia
- Infections acquired after birth from the environment, from contaminated equipment's or from people handling the baby:

Infections acquired after birth from the environment, from contaminated equipment's or from people handling the baby:
- Eye Infections,
- Mouth-candiba Albicans ,
- Buttocks Peri-anal Thrush,
- Skin Infections Mostly By Staphylococcus Aureus (Septic Spots, Paronychia, Pemphigus Neonatorum),
- Omphalitis,
- Neonatal Mastitis,
- Respiratory Infections
- Nasopharyngitis,
- Rhinitis,
- Pneumonia,
- Gastro Enteritis,
- Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC),
- Urinary Tract Infections,
- Meningitis

\section*{12. CLASSIFICATION OF NEONATAL SEPSIS}

Neonatal sepsis can be classified into two major categories depending up on the onset of symptoms: Early Neonatal Sepsis And Late Neonatal Sepsis
1. Early Onset Sepsis (EOS):
- It presents within the first 72 hours of life.
- In severe cases, the neonate may be symptomatic at birth.
- Infants with EOS usually present with respiratory distress and pneumonia.
- The source of infection is generally the maternal genital tract.
- Some maternal/ perinatal conditions have been associated with an increased risk of EOS. Knowledge about these potential risk factors would help in early diagnosis of sepsis.

\section*{Risk Of Early Onset Sepsis}
1. Low birth weight (<2500 grams) or prematurity
2. Febrile illness in the mother with evidence of bacterial infection within 2 weeks prior to delivery
3. Foul smelling and/or meconium stained liquor
4. Rupture of membranes $>24$ hours
5. Single unclean or $>3$ sterile vaginal examination(s) during labor
6. Prolonged labor (sum of 1 st and 2 nd stage of labor $>24 \mathrm{hrs}$ )
7. Perinatal asphyxia (Apgar score $<4$ at 1 minute)
- Presence of foul smelling liquor or three of the above mentioned risk factors warrant initiation of antibiotic treatment.
- Infants with two risk factors should be investigated and then treated accordingly.
2. Late Onset Sepsis (LOS):
- It usually presents after 72 hours of age.
- The source of infection in LOS is either nosocomial (hospital-acquired) or community-acquired and neonates usually present with septicemia, pneumonia or meningitis.
Risk factors for nosocomial sepsis include:
- Low birth weight,
- Prematurity,
- Admission in intensive care unit,
- Mechanical ventilation,
- Invasive procedures,
- Administration of parenteral fluids,
- Use of stock solutions.

Risk factors for community-acquired LOS include:
- poor hygiene,
- poor cord care,
- bottle-feeding,
prelacteal feeds e.g 10\% dextrose, glucose, nun
- In contrast, breastfeeding helps in prevention of infections.

\section*{Clinical features of neonatal sepsis}
1. Non-specific features:
- The earliest signs of sepsis are often subtle and nonspecific:
- Neonates with sepsis may present with one or more of the following symptoms and signs:
(a) Hypothermia or fever (former is more common in preterm low birth weight infants)
(b) Lethargy, poor cry, refusal to suck
(c) Poor perfusion, prolonged capillary refill time
(d) Hypotonia, absent neonatal reflexes
(e) Brady/tachycardia
(f) Respiratory distress, apnea and gasping respiration
(g) Hypo/hyperglycemia
(h) Metabolic acidosis.

Clinical features of neonatal sepsis
2. Specific features related to various systems:
a) Central nervous system (CNS): Bulging anterior fontanelle, vacant stare, high-pitched cry, excess irritability, stupor/coma, seizures, neck retraction. Presence of these features should raise a clinical suspicion of meningitis
b) Cardiac: Hypotension, poor perfusion, shock
c) Gastrointestinal: Feed intolerance, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, paralytic ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
d) Hepatic: Hepatomegaly, direct hyperbilirubinemia (especially with urinary tract infections)
e) Renal: Acute renal failure
f) Hematological: Bleeding, petechiae, purpura
g) Skin changes: Multiple pustules, abscess, sclerema, mottling, umbilical redness and discharge (omphalitis)

\section*{Investigations}
- Blood cultures
- Septic screen
- Lumbar puncture
- Radiological studies
- Urine for culture and sensitivity
- Stool specimen

\section*{Antibiotic treatment}
- FIRST LINE: Penicillin or Ampicillin and Gentamicin
- SECOND LINE: Ampicillin or Cloxacillin and Gentamicin or Amikacin
- THIRD LINE: Cefotaxime or Piperacillin-Tazobactam

\section*{Indications for starting antibiotics}

The indications for starting antibiotics in neonates at risk of EOS include any one of the following:
(a) presence of $>3$ risk factors for early onset sepsis (see above)
(b) presence of foul smelling liquor
(c) presence of ? 2 antenatal risk factor(s) and a positive septic screen and
(d) strong clinical suspicion of sepsis.

The indications for starting antibiotics in LOS include:
(a) positive septic screen and/or
(b) strong clinical suspicion of sepsis.

- General health of mother should be observe.
- Genetic screening
2. During pregnancy
- Antenatal profile
- Early detection treatment of any infections before delivery
3. During labour and delivery
- Hand washing by birth attendant
- Clean and safe delivery by maintaining sterility during delivery
- Use of Disinfectant and sterilization of equipment's
- Minimization of vaginal examination
- Prompt diagnosis and treatment of prolonged labour.
- Management of mother using a partoghraph for early identification and management of complications
- Prophylaxis antibiotics for mothers with PROM

\section*{prevention of neonatal sepsis}
4. After delivery
- Early and exclusive breast feeding
- Cord care using chlorhexidine
- Application of tetracycline eye ointment to all babies after birth
- Neonatal immunization
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for babies at risk of neonatal sepsis e.g. foul smelling liquor
- Avoidance of trauma to the skin and the mucus membrane
- Maintaining a clean and safe environment, regular changing of equipment and clothing for baby and cot
- Hand washing
- Individual equipment for each baby and use of disposables
- Exclusion of infected persons from the vicinity of the babies
- Isolation of infected babies

\section*{13. Heavy -for- dates baby?/macrosomia/}
- Definition; a heavy for gestation baby is one whose intra-uterine growth has been excessive, the birth weight will be above $90^{\text {th }}$ centile and he is therefore termed large for gestation.
Causes:
- Maternal diabetes
- Gestational diabetes
- Macrosomia is considered to be due to maternal hyperglycemia leading foetal hyperglycemia which triggers fetal insulin production
- hyperinsulinism in turn caused increased growth and fat deposition.
- The extent of the macrosomia will depend on how well the maternal diabetes is controlled during pregnancy
- Other cause of macrosomia is Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome ( infant is a giant)

\section*{Appearance}
- The infant is large, fat, and cherubic in appearance,
- Many are preterm
- Infant of diabetic mother have a higher incidence of congenital abnormality ,
- Features of beckwith-weidemann syndrome, this is an over growth disorder characterized by macrosomia, omphalocele , exomphalos or gastroschisis in conjunction with a large tongue (macroglossia) and enlarged kidneys and liver.
Complications of baby's born by diabetic mothers:
- Hypoglycaemia
- Resiratory distress syndrome
- Infections
- Most are delivered at 36-37 weeks of gestation or even earlier so they may be premature

\section*{Management macrosomia/ heavy for gestation infant}

Labour and delivery:
- Assessment of the pelvis to role out Cephalopelvic disproportion
- If in doubt caesarean section is recommended
- close monitoring of the maternal blood sugars one hourly.

A paediatrician should be available during incase the infant may need resuscitation
- Admit the newborn in the NBU at least for $24-48$ hours for monitoring and early management of complications.
- Monitor blood glucose levels on admission and 2 hourly
- Initiate early feed
- Continue with other observation, protection from infection and injuries, warmth, ensure baby is breathing spontaneously, provide any medication as needed, monitor input and output, care for bladder and bowel.

\section*{Admission criteria in a new born unit}
-The newborn unit does not only admit babies at risk but also offers accomodation to normal neonates due to unstable maternal condition or death of the mother.

Reasons for admitting the baby into the nursery include the following :

\section*{Infection Prevention And Control In NBU}
- Due to low immunity of the baby in NBU, infection control is critical to protect the babies from infection during their stay in the unit.This necessitates high infection control measures within the unit.

The following are some of the ways of ensuring infection control in the nursery :
1. Keep the unit clean, free from dust. The windows should remain closed at all times to prevent flowing in of dusty air.
2. Daily dump dusting and cleaning of incubators and cots.
3. Isolation of infected babies for barrier nursing
4. Restriction of visitors to ensure adequate control of human traffic into the nursery.
5. Visitors should see the babies through the glass.
6. Strictly observing aseptic technique while performing procedures
7. Feeding utensils should be rinsed (remove the milk), decontaminated, cleaned thoroughly in soapy water and kept in presept (disnifectant tablets) till the next feed
8. Staff working in the isolation room should should not move into other nurseries
9. Cleaning of incubators upon discharge or death of the baby, before the next baby is put.
10. Mothers changing clothes whenever they come to feed the babies.
11. Health educating the mothers on the importance of personal hygiene and care of the baby.

By the end of the module the learner should be able to:
1. Identify babies with special needs/babies at risk
2. Manage babies with special needs/babies at risk
3. Utilize the nursing process in managing babies with special needs /babies at risk.

\section*{Babies at risk}
1. low birth weigh babies,
2. congenital abnormalities,
3. respiratory distress syndrome,
4. birth injuries and trauma,
5. neonatal jaundice,
6. Post term baby
7. neonatal sepsis,
8. hypothermia,
9. hypoglycemia,

\section*{Definition}
- A high risk infant is any neonate, regardless of weight ,size or gestational age who has a greater than average chance of morbidity, or mortality, , especially within the first 28 days of life.
- Risk factors: include
$\checkmark$ preconception,
$\checkmark$ prenatal,
$\checkmark$ natal, or
$\checkmark$ postnatal conditions or conditions that interfere with the normal birth process.

\section*{LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABYIES}
*Low birth weight refers to babies born with weight is less than 2500 gms regardless of period of gestation.
*Category of low birth weight babies:
- Low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 2500 g (up to and including 2499 g ), regardless of gestational age.
- Very low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 1500 g (up to and including 1499 g ), regardless of gestational age.
- Extremely low-birth-weight infant: infant with birth weight lower than 1000g (up to and including 999g), regardless of gestational age

\section*{Low birth weight babies are:}
1. Premature babies
2. Light for gestation babies/ light for dates

\section*{1. PREMATURE BABY}
- Preterm baby is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed.
- Some of them may have growth retardation and therefore be small for gestation, while others may be exessively large for gestational age (macrosomia).

\section*{Sub categories of premature births}

Sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age:
- Extremely preterm (<28 weeks)
- Very preterm (28 to <32 weeks)
- Moderate to late preterm (32 to <37 weeks).

\section*{Predisposing factors to prematurity}
1. Maternal factors: Maternal age e.g. primigravida below 17 years or above 35 years ; maternal disease in pregnancy such as anaemia,hypertention,pre-eclampsia.
2. Foetal factors: Congenital abnormalities; multiple pregnancy and polyhydamnios due to over digestion of the uterus ;rhesus incompactibility interfering with foetal viability.
3. Placental factors: APH due to placenta praevia and placenta abruption.
4. Social factors: Straineous exercises, excessive drinking of alcohol and smoking, previous history of miscarriage, psychological stress.

\section*{Clinical Features Of A Premature Baby}
- Small stature with low birth weight less than 2500 g
- Thin and sparsely distributed hair on the head
-Skin is reddish with plenty of laguno
-Widely open sutures
-Eyes are closed most of the time
-Pinnae of the ears are soft and fold easily on pressure and slow to uncoil.
- Narrow sinuses and and the nose a bit flat
-Swallowing and sucking reflexes absent or very weak
- Weak cry and there is no tears.
-Chest is small, soft with underdevelped breast tissues
-Poor muscle tone and the baby lies inactive most of the time
-In females,labis majora are widely separated and the libia minora is protruding in between
-In males, scrotal muscles are smooth and testes are undescended
-Palmer and planter creases are absent
-Grasp reflexes are absent

\section*{Physiology of the preterm baby}
1. Immunity is low due to:
- Low gamma globulins responsible for immunity
- Delicate skin that is vulnerable to injuries and infection
- Lack of passive immunity which usually develops around 38 weeks gestation
2. Blood system
- Has poor peripheral circulation with high tendency to haemorrhage because of weak vascular walls.
- Prone to haemorrhage due to lack of clotting factors.Vitamin K is administered to promote clotting.
- Unable to store iron hence are at risk of iron deficiency anaemia
- They have very few blood cells and may develop nonpitting oedema
3. Weight
- Initially they lose up to $10 \%$ of their birth weight and start gaining and reach birth weight $2-3$ weeks post delivery
4. Temperature regulation is poor due to:
- Immature heat regulatory centre
- Limited food intake and low metabolic rate
- Inability to shiver and generate heat
- Excessive heat loss due to little or no subcutaneous fat.The brown fat is usually in baby's body by 36 weeks gestation
5. Respiratory system
- Underdeveloped respiratory centre leading to difficulty in initiation of respiration.
- Frequent opnoeic attack with irregular respiration.
- Abdominal movements more than chest movements.
7. Renal system:
- Immature kidneys are unable to concentrate urine hence they excrete chlorides and phosphates
8. Digestive system
- Absence of swallowing and sucking reflexes lead to poor feeding
- Regurgitation after feeds due to underdeveloped cardiac sphincter.
9. Nervous system
- All the regulatory centres are underdeveloped

\section*{Nursing management}
1. Warmth: Delivery of a preterm baby should be conducted in a warm room and subsequently nursed in preterm incubator.
2. Temperatures of the incubator should be maintained within normal range of about $36-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. perform first examination of the baby to assess maturity.
3.Feeding: Fix NG tube and feed the baby with expressed breast milk (EBM) and substitute only where breast milk is not available.

\section*{3. Feeding}

Feed the baby using the oral feeding regime,
a. Baby is given $60-65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ per kg of body weight in 24 hours in 8 divided doses eg 2.5 kg baby will have $2.5 \times 60 / 8=18.99 \mathrm{mls}$ per feeding thus baby should be fed 3 hourly.
b. Babies below 1500 gms feed 2 hourly.
c. If the baby tolerates the feed can be increased.
d. If the baby cannot tolerate the oral feeds, give IV fluids e.g. 10\% dextrose day one then (HSD/10\%D ratio of $1: 2$ ) day 2 if there is normal renal function.
e. Introduce cup feeding gradually as the baby gains weight.
f. Aspirate the gastric content to rule out indigestion.
4. Close observation to include:
- Vital signs Temperature, pulse and respiration
- Respiration rhythm to note apnoeic attack
- Umbilical stump for signs of infection.
- Vomiting or retaining food
- General activity and emotional status
5. Prevention of infection by care of IV lines i.e. Securing, cleaning and dressing, hand hygiene, cord care, giving prophylactic antibiotics, top tailing the infant daily.
6. Give nutritional suplements from 14 days i.e.
- Folic acid 2.5 mgs weekly for 6 months,
-Multivitamin 2.5 mls daily for 6 months,
- Vitmin D drops 400iu (2 drops) daily for 6 months,
- Then at 28 days stat giving Iron suppliment 2.5 mls daily for 6 months,
7. Initiate kangaroo mother care (KMC) for all babies below 2500 gms , if the baby is stable and the mother mentally stable and is willing.
- Kangaroo Mother Care is defined as early, prolonged continuous skin-to-skin contact between a mother (or her surrogate) and her low birth weight infant.
-It is a simple, inexpensive and safe method of caring for low birth weight infants.
- Babies below 1200gms are nursed in an incubator ( not stable for KMC)
8. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically for prevention of infection.
9. Take weight on alternate days to monitor the progress.
10. Teach the mother on how to care for the premature infant
11. Discharge the baby at 2000-2500 g on KMC.
12. Give BCG vaccine on discharge or advice the mother to take the child for immunization regardless of weight.
13. Advice the mother on family planning so that she gets another baby when the stress has reduced.

\section*{Complications of premature babies}
1.Hypothermia neonatorum 6. Anaemia
2.Jaundice 7. Retrolental
3.Haemorrhagic disease of new 8.Ricketsborn
9. Failure to thrive
4.Infections
5.Respiratory distress syndrome

\section*{Prevention of premature birth}
- One way to prevent premature births is to give early and continued prenatal care with stress on dietary and general hygienic education to the expectant mother.
- Prolonged bed rest should be encouraged, especially where the mother has any of the conditions that predispose to preterm labour
- Use of sedatives during preterm labour to ensure complete bed rest
- Avoidance of strenuous exercise and calming the mother, because any strain or stress may aggravate preterm labour

\section*{Kangaroo mother care}
- Kangaroo Mother Care is defined as early, prolonged continuous skin-to-skin contact between a mother (or her surrogate) and her low birth weight infant.
- It is a simple, inexpensive and safe method of caring for low birth weight infants.

\section*{Benefits of KMC}
1. Decreases the occurrence of apnoeic attacks and irregular breathing
2. Associated with less infections and when they occur, they are less severe
3. Decreases mortality of low birth weight babies
4. Increases mother's confidence in caring for her small new-born and improves bonding
5. Reduces hospital stay for mother and baby (early discharge)

\section*{Benefits of KMC}
6. Helps maintain an appropriate body temperature for the new-born
7. Promotes exclusive breastfeeding, resulting in a higher rate and longer duration of breastfeeding
8. Babies gain weight and grow faster as KMC promotes GI growth Reduces costs for the health facility and the mother/guardian as minimal equipment is required and is less expensive than incubator care
9. Enables fewer nursing staff to care for larger numbers of low birth weight new-borns

\section*{2. Small For Gestational baby /small for dates}
- Small for gestation/ small for dates: This term refers to a baby whose birth weight is below 10 th centile for his gestational age.
- Commonly referred to as low birth weight but this includes preterm babies.

\section*{They are susceptible to various problem}
- Congenital abnormalities
- Foetal hypoxia that may lead to intrapartal death
- Birth asphyxia due to inadequate perfusion, meconium aspiration leading to airway obstruction
- Hypothermia due to little subcutaneous tissue
- Apnoeic attacks
- Hypoglycaemia

\section*{Signs And Symptoms}
- Mostly they are born after 37th week gestation
-Pale, dry, loose skin with wrinkles and have no lanugo
- Subcutaneous fat is minimal
- Show features of retarded gowth
- The abdomen appears sunken
- Sutures and fontanelles are normal
- Eyes are allert and has mature facial expression
- Skull bones are hard and allow little mobility
- Have strong cry
- Umbilical cord is thin
- Swallowing and sucking reflexes are present so they feed well
- Normal muscle tone and are active

\section*{Nursing management}
-The baby is predisposed to the risks similar to those of preterm baby thus the management principles are the same:
1. Management should start in labour by closely monitoring foetal condition for signs of foetal distress
2. In case of fortal distress in first stage, administer oxygen to the mother and start IV drip of 10\% dextrose as you prepare the mother for emergency $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$.
3. If in the second stage the delivery is hastened by giving a generous episiotomy.
4. Since the baby is prone to hypoglaecaemia, it should be started on breast feeding as soon as possible.
5. Gastric lavage should be done with warm dextrose before breastfeeding
6. Substitutes are given if there is no breast milk, the feed is calculated at $80 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight in 24 hours in 8 divided doses ie 3 hourly feeding
7. Closely observe vital signs TPR and signs of infection, give vitamin K to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, TEO to prevent opthalmia neonatorium, and CHX for cord care.
8. The baby should be nursed in a warm environment to prevent hypothermia although it has temperature regulation mechanism.
9. Closely monitor blood sugar to rule out hypoglycaemia.
10. Weigh the baby on alternate days to monitor the progress. Usually weight loss is minimal and it gains weight more rapidly and steadily than preterm.
11. Teach the mother how to take care of the delicate skin that may be dry , cracked or peeling
12. Discharge at $2000-2500 \mathrm{gms}$ if newborn is stable.

\section*{complications}
1. Hypoglycaemia
2. Respiratory distress syndrome
3. Aspiration pneumonia
4. Brain damage

\section*{3. ASPHIXIA NEONATORUM}
- Asphyxia is a term used when the baby fails to breath at birth.

Types of Asphyxia :
-The degree of asphyxia is determined by Apgar score in which the following features are observed and scored 0-2
- Appearance(A): Note colour of the skin
- Pulse (P) (heart rate):
- Grimance (G): Note response to stimulation. Gently rub on to the sole of foot and note grimace.
- Activity $(\mathrm{A})$ : Note activity and muscle tone of the baby by stimulating the arms and legs by pulling the
- Respiration (R) / respiratory effort: Note respiration by looking at the abdomen and chest.
For further reading on APGAR score refer NCK procedure manual pg 271
-A score between 8-10 does not show asphyxia.

\section*{Types of asphyxia}

There are three types of asphyxia namely:
1. Mild asphyxia: Apgar score is 6-7 .It requires clearing of the airway and application of external stimuli to initiate breathing.
2. Moderate asphyxia: Apgar score is 4-5. It requires resuscitation, administration of oxygen and drugs to initiate breathing.
3. Severe asphyxia: Apgar score is 0-3. It requires intensive resuscitative measures and intubation to survive.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
1. Any condition causing foetal distress e.g. cord prolapse, prolonged labour, APH
2. Intrauterine hypoxia due to placental insufficiency, postmaturity, placenta abruption, anaemia and pre-eclampsia
3. Prematurity due to underdeveloped respiratory centre
4. Blockage of airway by mucus or liquor amni at birth.
5. Birth injuries e.g. intracranial injury
6. Severe maternal disease in pregnancy eg sickle cell anaemia, cardiac disease
7. Depression of respiratory centre due to drugs e.g. General Anaesthesia and narcotics

\section*{Signs and symptoms of asphyxia}

Mild and moderate asphyxia
- Apex beat (pulse rate) $100 / \mathrm{min}$ or less
- Skin colour is pink with blue extremities
- Response to stimuli may be present
- Cry may be weak or strong
- Makes effort to breath and may gasp with irregular respiration

\section*{Severe asphyxia}
- No attempt to breath and may gasp periodically
- It does not cry
- Entire body skin is blue ie.
cyanosed
- No response to stimuli
- Pulse rate very slow or absent
- Poor muscle tone

\section*{Nursing management}
1. Clear the airway as soon as the baby is born.
2. Nurse the baby in an incubator for at least 48 hours to keep it warm at body temperature.
3. Resuscitation may be needed to promote ventilation and ensure effective circulation to prevent acidosis,hypoglycaemia and intracranial haemorrhage
4. Do suctioning whenever necessary
5. Closely observe the baby for skin colour TPR
6. Administer oxygen by mask, ambu bag or nasal catheter whenever there is an apnoetic attack
7. Aspirate mucus to unblock the airway or may intubate the baby
8. Give IV fluids $10 \%$ D for rehydration calculate as for feeds day 1
9. Give fluids with electrolytes to maintain fluid - electrolyte balance i.e.half strength darrows day 2.
10. If the mother was given narcotics during labour, administer its antidote Naloxone through the umbilical vein,
11. Give anticonvulsants to control convulsions if present,
10. Administer the following drugs:
- Sodium bicarbonate 1 - 2 mls to combat acidosis
- Vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m to prevent haemorrhagic disorders
- Aminophylline to strengthen heart muscles
11. Maintain accurate input output charts to prevent overhydration or underhydration
12. When the baby is stable, pass the NG tube and start feeding
13. Observe hand hygiene, aseptic technique to prevent cross infection
14. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylatically

NURSING PROCESS CLASS PRESENTATION GROUP 2

\section*{Prevention of asphyxia}

\section*{Antinatal period:}
- Proper screening of mothers to detect those at risk and advice on delivery in hospital for proper management.
- Pelvic assesment should be done at 36 weeks to rule out cephalo pelvic dispropation (CPD)

\section*{Intrapartum:}
- Drugs that depress respiratory centre eg.sedatives, GA, narcotics should be avoided in late first stage;
- Early detection and management of foetal distress ;
- Clearing baby's airway as soon as the head is born;
- Avoid instrumental deliveries but rather prepare for $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$;

\section*{Complication}
1. Brain damage
2. Cardiac arrest
3. Respiratory distress syndrome
4. Respiratory acidosis

\section*{Neonatal Emergency}
-Neonatal emergencies are conditions or situations that require prompt and accurate action by the midwife.
-The speed of these actions will often help determine the outcome for the baby.
- It is usually a matter of life and death and midwife's knowledge, skill and correct attitude go a long way in successful management of the situation.
- Example of neonatal emergencies:
1. Asphyxia neonatorum,
2. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
3. Haemorrhagic diseases

\section*{RESUSCITATION OF A NEWBORN BABY}
- Definition: Resuscitation is a series of actions taken to establish Normal Breathing, Heart Rate, Color, Tone and Activity in an infant who has not established breathing or crying or those suffering from birth asphyxia.
- OR resuscitation is an emergency measure taken to sustain life or to revive when life has just ceased.
- Purpose is to restore lung and heart functions through establishing and maintaining a clear airway, ensuring effective circulation, correcting acidosis and preventing hypothermia, hypoglycemia and haemorrhage.
- Indications:
- All infants who do not breath well after delivery (birth asphyxia)
- Babies who have an APGAR score of below 7 in 1 minute.
- Any infant who stops breathing or has depressed vital signs at any time after delivery or in newborn unit

\section*{principles of newborn resuscitation}
-First ensure that all the equipment's and drugs are ready then follow the principles of resuscitation $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{O}$
1. Airway should be cleared either by suction or positioning the infant.
2. Breathing, that is, establish respiration if not breathing.
3. Circulation should be noted through pulse, colour of mucus membrane and heart beat. Start cardiac massage if there is no heart beat or pulse.
4. Drugs
5. Observations to make a diagnosis.
- First level resuscitation includes wiping of the face and body and flicking the soles of the feet to stimulate the baby
- Second level resuscitation involves: A,B,C,D,
1. Keep the baby warm:
- Place the baby on a firm, clean and warm surface.
- Inform the mother that the baby has difficulty breathing and that you will help the baby breath.
- Keep the baby wrapped and under radiant heater if possible.

\section*{2. Open the airway:}
-Position the head so that it is slightly extended to open the airway. (neutral position).
- Overextension or flexion will collapse the pharyngeal airway. A towel folded to $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ thickness placed under the shoulders will help to achieve the correct position.
- If baby is floppy, use the jaw thrust to bring the tongue forward and open airway.
If the baby has secretions suck the mouth and the nose,

Introduce the suction tube into the newborn's mouth 5 cm from lips and suck while withdrawing.
- Introduce the suction tube 3 cm into each nostril and suck while withdrawing until no mucus.
- Repeat each suction if necessary but no more than twice and no more than 20 seconds in total.
3. BREATHING (If still no breathing, ventilate):
- Place a mask ( attached to bag )to cover chin, mouth and nose form a seal between the mask and the newborn's face.
- Using the bag and mask give five inflation breaths each of $2-3$ seconds ( also known as rescue breaths).
- Check the rise of the chest. The chest may not rise during the first 1-3 inflation breaths which are needed displace fluid from the lungs.
- If chest is not raising reposition the head, check mask seal and squeeze the bag harder
- Once chest is raising, ventilate at 40 squeezes per minute until baby start breathing spontaneously.
- If breathing or crying stop ventilating, look for chest in drawing, count breaths, ct care
- If breaths are less than $30 / \mathrm{min}$ continue ventilating and arrange for referral inform the mother and reassure
- Re-assess heart rate after first five breath an increasing heart rate or heart rate above 100 bpm is a sign of effective ventilation.
4. CIRCULATION :if there is no heart beat or heart is < 60bpm, even when the chest is being ventilated, give chest compression (cardiac massage)
- The best way to give cardiac massage is to encircle the newborn's chest with two hands so that the thumbs meet on the sternum below the line between the nipples .
- Compress chest by $1 / 3$ of its depth-three times for each inflation. 3 chest compression: 1 ventilation. 3:1
- Once heart rate is above 60bpm and rising, discontinue chest compression and continue with ventilation and assessing the response.
- If the newborn is breathing normally ( $30-60 \mathrm{bpm}$ ) and there is no chest indrawing and no grunting
- Put baby into skin to skin with the mother;
- Observe breathing at quick intervals;
- Measure temperature and rewarm if 36 degrees;
- Encourage mother to initiate breast feeding
- Keep the baby under observations until she or he has been stable for at least 6 hours.
- Explain what has happened to the mother.

If there is no gasping or breathing at all after 20 min of ventilating stop ventilating and give emotional support to the family.
5. DRUGS do not give drugs as a routine during resuscitation if any drug is to be given give intravenously preferably adrenaline
6. OBSERVATION: perform observation to make a diagnosis APGAR SCORE then continue to assess response to intervention

\section*{Do not in any case}
1. Do not Slap, blow on or pour cold water on the baby.
2. Do not Hold the baby up side down
3. Do not routinely suction the mouth nose of a well baby.
4. Do not Use heavy suctioning of the back of the throat of the baby.
5. Do not give injections of respiratory stimulants or routine sidium bicarbonate.

\section*{4. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (RDS)}
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome: is a condition that occurs due to lack of or inadequate surfactant in the lung tissue.
- Mature lungs have adequate surfactant that lowers surface tention in the alveoli,stabilises the alveoli and prevents them from adhering together and collapse.This leads to breathing with ease.
- Surfactant factor is produced slowly from 20 weeks gestation and reaches a surge at 30-34 weeks gestation and another surge at onset of labour.The premature infants lack this factor thus the alveoli wall pressure rises as he breathes out and alveoli collapse leading to severe difficulty in breathing.

\section*{RDS}
- Other names used to refer to RDS:
- Hyaline membrane disease
- Pulmonary syndrome of the newborn
- Developmental respiratory distress
-Respiratory distress syndrome is a disease of prematurity and self - limiting with recovery phase or death.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- RDS may may be a complication of asphyxia and develops within 4 hours of birth
- Prematurity due to inadequate surfactant factor
- Prenatal hypoxia eg due to APH which reduces surfactant synthesis
- Trauma to CNS due to difficult delivery or precipitate labour
- Perinatal hypoxia
- Profound hypothermia: leads to injury of cells that produce surfactant
- Congenital heart disease

\section*{Clinical Features}
1. Difficulty in breathing (dyspnoea)
7. Grunting expirations
8. Reduced or increased heart rate
2. Flaring of alae nasi
3. Tachypnoea with respirations above $60 / \mathrm{min}$ normal (30-60 bpm)
9. Chest $x$ rays shows collapsed alveoli
10. The baby has poor muscle tones and is motionless
4. Hypothermia
5. Generalised cyanosis
6. Costal and sternal retraction
11. Poor digestion due to diminished bowel movement
12. Resolves or death occurs within 3-5 days

\section*{Nursing management}
1. The principle of management during care of babies with RDS are observations, oxygenation, positioning, nutrition, and hydration.
2. Management is symptomatic until the disease dissolves
3. If RDS is anticipated,inform a paediatrician to resuscitate the baby.
4. Nurse the baby in an incubator to avoid hypothermia by controling body temperature
5. Administer oxygen or do artificial ventilation to prevent hypoxia
6. Closely monitor the blood pH to prevent acidosis and support pulmonary circulation because high carbon dioxide levels lead to constriction of pulmonary arterioles leading to poor pulmonary blood flow.
7. Incase there is acidosis, sodium bicarbonate is added to $10 \%$ dextrose drip
8. Keep the baby nil per oral till the distress resolves
9. Administer IV fluids eg.10\% dextrose and add calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles; sodium bicarbonate to ensure fluid electrolyte balance
9. Check haematocrit (PVC) and if less than $40 \%$ transfuse with blood.
10. Maintain the normal BP with volume expanders
11. Position the baby to provide greatest air entry (prone position with extended head neutral ponormaly )
12. Suction and do postural drainage to remove secretions and keep the airway patent.
13. Close observations to monitor the process whether improving or deteroriating ie. heart rate,respiration,cyanosis.
14. When the condition resolves,introduce oral feeds gradually. In case the baby developes abdominal distension due to indigestion, stope oral feeds and start IV fluids.

\section*{Prevention of RDS}
- Early detection and management of high risk pregnancies to prevent premature delivery.
-Conditions such as diabetes mellitus should be properly managed so that delivery can be prolonged to 36-38 weeks.The mother is then given Dexamethasone 4 mg tds 48 hrs before $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ to stimulate lung maturity.
-Prevent perinatal hypoxia by ensuring there is no intracranial injury at birth.
-Effective resuscitation at birth of high risk babies.
-Assesment of gestational age and lung maturity through amniocentesis so that elective $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ or delivery can be delayed if lungs are not mature enough.

\section*{Complication}
- Retrolental fibroplasia
- Hypothermia
- Hypoglycaemia
- Patent ductus arteriosus
- Abdominal distention
- Hypocalcaemia
- Intracrania hemorrhage
- infection

\section*{5. HYPOGLYCAEMIA}
- This is a metabolic disorder in which the blood glucose level falls below $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
- At term, the baby's glucose level is almost equal to that of the mother but gradually drops within 3-4 hours after birth.
- This is why the baby has to be fed within one hour of life.
- The baby's blood glucose rises steadily following feeds to $2.8-4.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ in 6 - 12 hrs.
- Term babies can maintain their energy requirements as long as they are kept warm.
-This condition is common in infants of diabetic mothers.
-Due to excess glucose, the foetus produces more insulin which increases its body fat and muscle mass leading to large babies (macrosomia).
-At birth the glucose level falls rapidly while insulin levels remail relatively high so the baby is at risk os hypoglycaemia.
-This is why such babies are admitted into NBU.
-Prolonged hypoglycaemia can lead to:
- Mental retardation,
- Permanent neurological damage and
- Death due to respiratory and metabolic acidosis.

\section*{Predisposing factors to hypoglycaemia}
- Low birth weight
-Prematurity
-Birth injuries
-Maternal diabetes mellitus
-Asphyxia
-Septicaemia
-Respiratory distress syndrome

\section*{Clinical features for hypoglycaemia}
- Low blood glucose less than $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Irritability
-Poor feeding
-Hypotonic muscle activity
-High pitched cry
-Hypothermia
-Lethargy
-Apnoea

\section*{Nursing management}
- Give 10 \% dextrose infusion untill normal glucose levels are achieved
-Encourage the mother to breastfeed the baby
- Feed through NG tube or cup feeding expressed breast milk
-If the hypoglycaemia is severe, put up 10\% dextrose infusion and give 65
$-85 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight in 24 hours.
- Give a bolus dose of $25 \%$ dextrose $2 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight i.v slowly for 30 minutes.
- Closely monitor the glucose levels 1 hourly untill the general condition is stable or normal levels have been achieved.
- Once the normal levels are achieved, wean off the dextrose and observe closely for changes in the condition.

\section*{Prevention}
- Taking blood glucose levels at birth and introducing glucose feeds eg. dextrose and breastfeeding within 1 hours of life.
- Prevent hypothermia
- Monitoring glucose levels 2hourly for the first 6-8 hours.
- Infants of diabetic mothers should be admitted to NBU and blood glucose level regularly checked.

\section*{Complications}
- Hypothermia
-Convulsions
- Brain damage
- Neonatal death as an outcome.

\section*{6. NEONATAL HYPOTHERMIA}
- This is a condition in which the neonates'body temperature falls below $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- The infants surface area:body mass ratio pontentiates heat loss,especially from the head which comprises $25 \%$ of his size. T
- he infants subcutaneous layer is thin and provides poor insulation allowing transfer of core heat to the enviroment and also cooling of blood

\section*{hypothermia}

The baby loses heat through:
- Evaporation
- Conduction
- Radiation
- Convention
1. Evaporation : cooling of the body by loss of fluid on the skin (amniotic fluid).
2. Conduction: Heat is lost when the baby is in contact with cold surfaces.
2. Radiation: loss of heat to cold objects in the enviroment
3. Convention: loss of heat caused by currents of cold air passing over the surface of the body.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Prematurity
- Asphyxia neonatorum
- Maternal diabetes mellitus
- Respiratory distress syndrome
- Cold environment

\section*{Clinical features}
- Rectal temperature is below $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Baby feels cold on touch
- Paleness of extrimities and face
- Very weak cry
- Low respiration rate
- Baby not eager to feed (poor feeding

\section*{Nursing management}
- Nurse the baby in a warm environment in a resuscitaire or wrap it in warm clothing or KMC
- Feed the baby with expressed breast milk via NG tube or cup if able to swallow.
- Give the baby extra glucose eg.dextrose
- Closely observe the baby for signs of hypoglycaemia and if present, give 10\% dextrose
- Check for and treat convulsions with anticovulsants
- Continue With General Nursing Care In NBU ( warmth, feeding, prevention of infection, protection from injury, observation, involve the mother in the care of the newborn baby)

\section*{Prevention Of Neonatal Hypothermia}
${ }^{-}$Delivery should be conducted in a room with controlled temperatures.
- Dry the baby immediately to prevent heat loss through evaporation.
- Put the baby on resuscitaire or incubator to compensate heat loss to the environment.
- Baby should not be bathed within 1 hour of life but top - tailing can be done after one hour.
- Encourage skin to skin contact (KMC) method when carrying the baby.
- Cover the baby with warmclothing and a cap
- Change diapers whenever soiled to prevent heat loss through conduction.

\title{
Complication
}
-Convulsions
-Hypoglycaemia
- Brain damage

\section*{Warm chain}
1. Warm delivery room
2. Immediate drying the newborn thoroughly
3. Skin to skin contact
4. Breastfeeding the newborn within an hour
5. Bathing and weighing is postponed
6. Appropriate clothing and bending
7. Mother and baby together (rooming in)
8. Warm transportation ( skin to skin)
9. Warm resuscitation
10. Training and awareness for the mother.
- This is a condition that occurs in neonates within 21 days of life and is characterised by purulent discharge from the eyes.
- It is common in infants of mothers who had vaginal discharge eg. gonorrhoea during pergnancy.
- Syphilis does not predispose an infant to opthalmia neonatorum but it causes congenital syphilis that is characterised by gross congenital malformation.

\section*{Causative organism}

\section*{Clinical features}
- Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- Chlamydia trachomatis
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Escherichia coli
- Haemophilus influenzae
- Streptococcus pneumoniae
-Pseudomonas spp
- klebsiella
- Eyes have sticky watery discharge
- Eyes are slightly red
- Oedematous eyelids
- Yellowish purulent discharge if the infection is by N .
Gonorrhoeae

\section*{Nursing management}
- All prenatal mothers presentig with vaginal discharge suggestive of gonorrhoea should be treated before delivery.
-Correctly swab the baby's eyes at birth.
- Instill 1\% tracycline eye ointment (TEO) to all babies at birth prophylactically .
-All infected babies should be isolated take eye swab for culture and sensitivity.
-Administer drugs such as:
- Gentamicyn eye drops
- TEO but not systemic tetracycline
- Penicilin eye drops
- Kanamycin eye drops
- Swab the eyes with warm saline 3 times a day from inside outwards.
-Administer some broad spectrum systemic antibiotics but not tetracycline because it can cause deposits in bone leading to depressed bone growth.

\section*{Complications}
-Partial or permanent blindness

\section*{8. NEONATAL JAUNDICE}
- Neonatal Jaundice is a condition in neonates characterised by yellow discolouration of the skin, sclera and mucous membranes.
- It develops when there is excessive bilirubin levels in the blood stream.
- When there is increased rate of haemolysis of RBC or decreased conjugation or ostruction of the flow of bile, there will be high amounts of free bilirubin in circulation leading to jaundice.

\section*{Bilirubin Metabolism}
- When aged, immature, malformed RBCs are broken down by hemolysis in the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen and the macrophages), they produce haem and globulin. Globulin is stored for reuse.
- The haeme part is broken down to bilirubin and iron. Iron is stored for re use and uncojugated bilirubin (fat soluble) is waste product which should be excreted.
- Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble.
- Unconjugated bilirubin has to be converted to water soluble form. (conjugated/ direct bilirubin) by a process of conjugation for it to be excreted.
- Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver thus it has to be transported to the liver by binding to transport protien, albumin.On arrival to the liver, bilirubin detaches itself from albumin attaches to x and y receptor proteins.
-Conjugation with glucuronic acid by means of glucuronyl transferase enzyme to become to become bilirubin diglucoronide that is water soluble.
-Excretion of bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestines.
-While in the intestines, it is converted to stercobilinogen by gut normal flora and excreted in stool ( gives stool the colour).
- Some of it absorbed from the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine. If passage though the gut is slow some bilirubin will be unconjugated be beta glucuronidase
-If conjugation process is interfered with,there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice.
-This bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) may cross theBBB and cause brain damage, a condition known as Kernicterus that is characterised by seizures, hyper - tonicity, lethargy, stiff neck with hyper - extended head.

\section*{Types of jaundice}

There two types of jaundice:
${ }^{-}$physiological
${ }^{-}$pathological

\section*{1. PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}
- Physiological jaundice affects both pretem and term babies in the first few days of life. It is a normal occurence but it may indicate a serious condition.
Characteristic of physiological jaundice:
- Jaundice never appears before 24 hours of age
-The serum bilirubin levels never exceeds 250 umol/l
- The highest serum bilirubin level occurs on the 3rd or 4th day of life
- The jaundice fades by the 7th day of life
- The baby is otherwise well

\section*{Causes of physiological jaundice}
a) Excessive haemolysis of RBCs greater than conjugation rate. In utero the foetus high haemoglibin level $(18-22 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl})$ in order to attract sufficient oxygen across the placenta. The neonatal rbc's have a shorter life span (60-70days) than those of adults.
b) Glucoronyl transferase enzyme deficiency this is due to liver immaturity thus the liver can not cope with the increased haemolysis of rbc's
c) Increased enterohepatic reabsorption: peristalsis is slow until feeding is established and the new born gut is not yet colonised with the normal bacteria responsible for converting bilirubin digluconate to stercobilinogen. These allows apportunity for reabsorbtion
d) Decreased albumin binding capacity: thus less bilirubin is transported to the liver for conjugation.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Admit the baby into the NBU and and asses the general condition.
- Start early and frequent breast feeding for;
- feending provides glucose to the liver cells
- Feending also encourages bowel colonisation with normal flora which are important in formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool.
- Early feeding also leads to increased gut motility leading to faster excretion of bilirubin.
- Feeding also enhances enzyme production and conjugation.
- Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hr interval.
-If bilirubin levels take time to clear, put the baby on phototherapy.

\section*{Jaundice in preterm babies}
- The preterm baby is more prone to jaundice than the term baby
- The parameters are slightly different
- Jaundice tends to occur earlier
- Peak later and last longer than the in full term baby
- Haemolysis occur in the same way but the life of the rbc's is shorter (30-40 days)
- There is likely to delay feeding of a preterm baby especially if sick
- The gut is also immature thus peristalsis is reduced
- Albumin binding capacity is affected by an increased tendency to hypoxia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypoalbiminaemia
- Liver immaturity
- Likely to complicate due to jaundice and requires treatment for jaundice at a lower bilirubin than full term infants.

\section*{2. Pathological jaundice}
- Pathological jaundice appears within 24 hrs of life and is not selflimiting thus may persist for long.
- There is rapid rise in serum bilirubin.
- It includes both obstructive and haemolytic jaundice.

\section*{Causes}
- They include pathological disorders that increase bilirubin production, reduces transportation to and fro the liver or reduces rate of conjugation.
1. Increased haemolysis - Rhesus and ABO incompatibility, G6PD enzyme deficiency, baterial septicaemia.
2. Non-haemolytic causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin - CNS haemorrhage, cephalohaematoma, polycythaemia, exerggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to functional ileus.
3. Decreased rate of conjugation - Cliggler Nagar Syndrome,Gilbert's syndrome.
4. Hepatotoxic drugs
5. Biliary obstruction that prevents transport of conjugated bilirubin to GIT for excretion
6. Reduced bilirubin binding sites on the albumin
7. Malnutrition
8. Increased reconversion of conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin if it stays in the GIT.

\section*{Nursing management}
- Asses the baby to determine the degree of jaundice
-Do investigation on serum bilirubin levels and Hb
- Start the baby on phototherapy
- Order for blood exchange transfussion if necessary.
-Ct general nursing of newborn baby at risk

\section*{Complications of neonatal jaundice}
- Retinal damage due to light used in treatment
- Anaemia
- Hyperthermia associated with phototherapy
- Hypocacaemia
-Kernicterus that is characterised by seizures, hyper - tonicity , lethargy, stiff neck with hyper - extended head.

\section*{Treatment modalities for neonatal jaundice}

There are three main modalitie named :
- Phototherapy
- Blood exchange transfusion
- Protoporphyrins

\section*{A) Phototherapy}
-Phototherapy this is the use of ultraviolet blue prevents bilirubin levels from going high enough to cross BBB and cause kernicterus -It is a safe and effective treatment with mild side effects.

Mechanism Of Action: Blue fluorescent light at a given wavelength is absorbed by the unconjugated bilirubin in the skin and superficial capillary and unconjugated bilirubin (indirect) is converted into conjugated bilirubin (direct) which is water soluble and can be excreted in stool and urine.

Indications.
-Preterm with jaundice appearing after 48 hrs and bilirubin levels are $260-265 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
-Preterm with weight less than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 85-114 mol/l
-Preterm with weight more than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 14-165 mol/l
1.Expose the whole body of the baby to increase surface area exposed to light
2. Keep turning the baby 2 hourly to expose all parts to the fluorescent light.
3.Ensure the airway of the baby is patent by extending the head
4.Cover the eyes to prevent damage by direct rays of light
5. When breastfeeding the eyes are unpadded to encourage eye contact with the mother
6.Provide intermittent phototherapy i.e. 6 hrs on and 6 hrs off but may be continuous.
7. Give phototherapy for $2-3$ days and asses the serum bilirubin levels twice or three times a day

NB : Greatest reduction in bilirubin levels will be in the first 24 hrs of phototherapy.
8. Observe the eyes for weeping or discharge.
9. If photo therapy is continuous, give extra fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain accurate input output charts.
10.Change linen frequently because opening of bowels is increased. (loose stool)
11.Observe the feeding and sleeping behaviour of the baby.
12.Observations e.g temperature to rule out hyperthermia, skin colour to monitor the progress, apex beat, and respiration should be done 4 hourly, assess regularly for signs of dehydration.
13. Involve mother in the care of the baby

\section*{When to stop phototherapy}
- When serum bilirubin levels is 50 umol/L.
- Repeat serum bilirubin measurements if necessary12-18 hours after ceasing phototherapy to check for rebound hyperbilirubinaemia.

\section*{Side effects}
-loose stool due rapid interstinal transit
- poor feeding
-Hypocalcaemia
-Fragility
-Hyperthermia due to increased fluid loss and dehydration.
- Lethargy
-Retinal damage from intensity light
-Visual deprivation
-Irritability.
-Skin rashes and skin burns.

\section*{B) BLOOD EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}
- This is a treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donors blood.It is used as a difinitive treatment when bilirubin concentrations are approaching toxic levels, the baby has haemolytic disease or low Hb.
The transfusion has the following benefits :
- It helps in increasing the baby's Hb
- Excessive bilirubin and unwanted antibodies are washed from the baby's circulation.
-The donor's blood used for the transfusion should be Rhesus negative so that it does not alter the baby's blood group and to ensure that no antigen is introduced into baby's circulation that may lead to antibodies production.
-It should also be fresh and ABO compatible.

Indications
- Infants with haemolytic diseases
- Preterms with bilirubin levels of $300-400 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Babies whose birth weight was less than 1500 g and have bilirubin levels of $225 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$
- Term babies with bilirubin levels above $100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$ at birth or later $400-500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$

Care of the baby post transfusion
- Put the baby back to phototherapy
- Closely observe the baby for bleeding from the umbilical cord
- If the baby was on infusion, continue for some time
- Reassure the mother and involve her in the care of the baby

\section*{C) PROTOPORPHYRINS}
- These are haeme oxygenase inhibitors which are administered to inhibit the breakdown of haeme thus reduce bilirubin production.
-They are usually used in combination with phototherapy and/or blood exchange transfusion.

READ AND MAKE NOTES ON RHESUS AND ABO INCOMPATIBILITY, MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION

\section*{9. HAEMORRHAGIC DISEASE OF THE NEW BORN.}
-This bleeding that occurs during the first few days of life due to vitamin $k$ deficiency.
-Vitamin K is synthesised by the bowel normal flora and its role is to convert clotting factors such as prothrombin, thrombokinase, thromboplastin.
-To prevent HDN, all neonates are given vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m at birth.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Hereditary factors (clotting factor defect)
-Prematurity
-Birth trauma
-Treatment with antibiotics
-Respiratory distress syndrome
-Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)
-Birth asphyxia
-Mothers who are on drugs like warfarin, heparin, phenobarbital

\section*{Clinical features}
-Continuous oozing of blood from umbilical cord.
-There is spontaneous bleeding from various parts of the body.
-Bleeding in the mucous membranes of GIT and may present with maleana stool or haematemesis.
-Continuous bleeding from any punctured blood vessel or injection site thus when looking for venous access avoid puncturing femoral or juguolar veins which are the larget veins in the body.
-Haematuria or omphalorrhagia

\section*{Nursing Management}
- Upon admission into NBU, administer vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ I.M
-Preserve all linen soiled by blood for estimation of blood loss
-Administer vitamin K 1-2 mg to arrest bleeding immediately.
- Observe vital signs TPR ¼ hourly.
-If bleeding is severe, transfuse fresh blood or frozen plasma at 20 mls / kg of body weight.
-Observe for signs of shock and if present transfuse with packed cells and fresh whole blood at $75-100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight if the baby is term.
-General management is like any other baby in the unit.

\section*{complications}
-Anaemia
-Hypovolaemic shock
-Brain damage
-Birth injuries refer to trauma that a foetus sustains during birth.
-The structures commonly involved are:
- muscles,
- nerves,
- bones,
- visceral organs
- skin.

\section*{TYPES OF BIRTH INJURIES}
- Internal organ injury: spleen, liver, adrenal glands
- Nerve injury - mostly branchial plexus leading to Erb's paralysis, klumpke's
- Soft tissue injury - genitalia, eyes
- Intracranial injuries - intracranial haemorrhage, skull features
- Extracranial injuries - cephalohaematoma, caput succadenium.

\section*{Predisposing factors to birth injuries}
- Prematurity
- Large for dates babies
- Cephalopelvic disproportion
- Malpresentation eg brow, breecch,face etc
- Congenital malformations eg hydrocephalus

\section*{A) HEAD TRAUMA}
- Trauma to the head and scalp that occurs during the birth processis usually benign but occasionally results in more serious injuries.
- There are three main types of extracranial (out of the cranium, brain) haemorrhage which are :
- Caput succedaneum
- Cephalohaematoma
-Subgaleal or subaponeurotic haemorrhage
1. CAPUT SUCCADENIUM - Is an oedematous swelling due to accumulation of serum fluid under the foetal scalp. it results from pressure of the presenting part of the scalp against the dilating cervix during delivery that leads to reduced venous blood and lymphatic drainage and part of serum escapes into the tissue .The swelling is self limiting and disappears within 36 hours of life.
2. Cephalohaematoma - is accumulation of blood between the periosteum and the skull bone.It is caused by friction between the foetal skull bones and pelvic bones eg.CPD

\section*{Difference between caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma}

\section*{Caput succadenium}
1. Swelling under the scalp above the periosteum forms on the presenting part
2. Present at birth
3. Disappears within 36 hours
4. Diffuse and pits on pressure
5. May cross a suture line
6. Double caput is unilateral

\section*{cephalohaematoma}
1. Effusion of blood under the periosteum due to friction btwn the skull and the maternal pelvis.
2. Appears after 4 hrs of life
3. May persist for 2 weeks
4. Circumscribed; doesn't pit on pressure
5. Never crosses suture lines
6. Double cephalohaematoma is bilateral

\section*{3. Subgaleal or subaponeurotic haemorrhage}
- Subgaleal haemorrhage is bleeding into the subgaleal compartment.
- The injury occurs as a result of pressure through the head (of the infant) into the pelvic outlet
- It commonly associated with vacuum extraction
- Bleeding occurs below the epicranial aponeurosis.
- It can be confused with a caput succedaneum as the swelling extends across the suture line.
- Early detection is vital

\section*{Characteristic of subgaleal haemorrhage}
1. It is present at birth
2. The swelling crosses the suture line
3. It increases in size
4. Resolves in 2-3 weeks
5. Firm fluctuant mass
6. Bleeding my extend into subcutaneous tissue of the neck and eyelids
7. Bruising may be apparent for days and sometimes weeks.

\section*{Nursing care}
- Serial head circumference may detect any increase due to haemorrhage.
- The infant must be observed for signs of hyperbilirubinaemia and anaemia.
- If the haemorrhage is severe, blood transfusion may be necessary.
- Monitor the bleeding time and coagulation time.
- Assess the level of consciousness.
- Assess Haemoglobin and haematocrit
- Increase in bilirubin is expected due to blood lyses.
- Death due to massive haemorhage is a possibility.

\section*{B) NERVE TRAUMA/ INJURIES}
- The most common are the facial nerve and branchial plexus injuries.
1. Facial Nerve Injury:
- This is due damage of the facial nerve.
- The eye of the affected side remains open \& the mouth is drawn to the normal side.
- Might cause feeding problems.
- No treatment is required
- Spontaneous improvement should be seen in 7-10 days
2. Branchial Plexus Injuries:
- Branchial plexus nerves injury are caused by stretching or disruption of the nerve at the apex of the axilla, lying under the clavicle.
- Injuries can be cause by excessive lateral flexion of the head and neck in cases of shoulder dystocia or breech presentation.
- There are three main types of injury
a) Erb's palsy
b) Klumpke's palsy
c) Total branchial plexus palsy
a) Erb's palsy:
- This involves damage to the upper roots of the branchial plexus involving the $5^{\text {th }}$ and $6^{\text {th }}$ cervical nerve roots.
- The affect arm is inwardly rotated, lies limply by his side and he can not flex his elbow or lift his arm, the half-closed hand is turned outwards (waiter's tip position), but there is movement of arm and fingers.
b) Klumpke's palsy:
- Klumpke's palsy involves the lower arm, wrist and hand, with wrist drop and limp ( no grasping reflex) fingers caused by damage to spinal roots C8 and T1.
- The shoulder and upper arm has normal movements
- The injury is caused by difficult birth e.g.in breech, large baby
c) Total brachial plexus palsy:
- There is complete paralysis of the shoulder, arm, wrist and hand \& loss of sensation due to damage of all the brachial plexus nerve roots.
Treatment:
- Resting the arm for 7-10 days followed by gentle physiotherapy to avoid contracture.
- Parents should be taught a full range of passive movements for shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
- Complete spontaneous recovery is more common with Erb's palsy than in Klumpke's or total brachial palsy but may take several months up to 2 years
- Do follow up
3. Phrenic nerve injury:
- Commonly occurs in association with brachial plexus and less commonly as an isolated lesion.
- It may affect one or both sides of the diaphragm.

Treatment : varies from simple oxygen therapy to intermittent positive pressure ventilation
Complication: Hypostatic pneumonia
4. Horner's syndrome:

This is caused by damage to the cervical sympathetic nerves and is often associated with klumpke's paralysis
The syndrome occurs infrequently, presenting with ptosis (drooping or falling of the upper eyelid), enophthalmos (posterior displacement of the eyeball within the orbit) due to loss of function of the orbitalis muscle, constriction of the pupil and absence of sweating from the affected side of the head and face

\section*{C) FRACTURES}
- A fracture can occur during delivery most common are : fractured of the skull, clavicle, humerus and femur bones.
1. SKULL FRACTURES:
- These are rare and majority are linear and asymptomatic.
- An overlying cephalohaematoma or skull deformation may be the only feature
- They may be associated with intracranial haemorrhage, seizures, and death as contusion of the underlying brain may have occurred

\section*{Treatment :}
- symptomatic e.g. ant seizure drugs for seizure
- Antibiotics cover for patients with leak of Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF ) from the nasal and auditory canal
2. CLAVICLE FRACTURE:
this occurs due to shoulder dystocia and in breech delivery
- It is often asymptomatic and may go undiagnosed

Signs and symptoms:
A crack is heard during delivery
- Feeling of distortion at the break
- Presence of crepitus
- In late phase by callus formation

Treatment :
- Figure of eight bandage if the infant shows signs of discomfort
- A stable union of the break usually occurs within 7-10 days

\section*{3. Fractured Humerus}
- This may occur in shoulder dystocia or in extended arms in breech presentation
Signs and symptoms
- A crack may be heard at delivery or
- The infant may present with deformity or
- Pseudoparesis of the upper arm secondary to pain
- Confirm diagnosis by an x-ray

Treatment:
- by splinting the upper arm or bandaging the arm to the chest
-Stable union occurs 3-4 weeks

\section*{4. Fracture femur}
- Fracture of the femur may occur during delivery of extended legs in breech presentation.
Signs and symtoms:
- A crack may be heard or felt at the time
- Fractures are usually in the mid shaft presenting with deformity
- Or pseudoparesis due to pain
- diagnosis confirmed by x-ray

Treatment :
- simple splinting and application of a firm a crepe bandage to the upper leg for 2-3 weeks.
5. Fracture spine: very rare but may also occur in breech deliver with extended head

\section*{D) MUSCLE INJURIES}

\section*{TORTICOLIS :}
- This results from injury to the sternomastoid muscle (sternocleidomastoid muscle) during birth when the muscle is either torn or its blood supply is impaired.
- It may occur during the delivery of the anterior shoulder in vertex presentation or while rotating the shoulders in breech presentation.

\section*{E) soft tissue injuries in the newborn.}
- Soft tissue injuries usually occurs when there is some degree of disproportion between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion).

\section*{Causes of soft tissue injuries}
${ }_{-}$Dystocia
- Cephalopelvic disproportion
- Forceps delivery
${ }^{-}$Enlarged fetus
- Vacuum delivery
- Improper episiotomy technique
- Caesarean section (rare)

\section*{signs, symptoms and feature of soft tissue injuries}
- Bruising with excoriation can occur in breech and face presentation
- In face presentation the face is congested and bruised and the eyelids and lips edematous.
- In breech presentation there is bruising and edema of the vulva area in female child and scrotum in male.
Nursing care for soft tissue injury.
- Assess the newborn for bleeding from the injury site.
- The soft tissue injury usually fade (disappear) spontaneously within few days, without treatment.
- Explain, reassure and provide health information to the parents about these injuries.

\section*{General management of birth injuries}
- Intrapartally, predisposing factors should be diagnosed and managed early eg.preterm labour,malpresentation,prolonged labour.
- Obseve the baby closely for skin colour, twitching, rolling of eyes, convulsions
- Keep the baby warm
- Administer vitamin K $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg}$ i.m for they are predisposed to haemorrhage
- Maintain 2hrly turning of the baby
- Provide intermitent oxygen therapy when neccessary (PRN)
- Give fluids eg. $10 \%$ dextrose for the first 24 hours then introduce oral feeds if the condition improves.
- Give symptomatic management.
- Have resuscitative equipment ready incase of emergency
- Administer anticonvulsants eg. Phenobarbital prophylactically

\section*{Complications}
- Musculoskeletal deformities
- Brain damage
- Respiratory distress
- Hyperbilirubinaemia (jaundice)
- Hypogycaemia

\section*{12. NEONATAL INFECTIONS/NEONATAL SEPSIS}

Definition: Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection with or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life.
- It encompasses :
1. various systemic infections of the newborn such as septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections.
2. Superficial infections like conjunctivitis and oral thrush are not usually included under neonatal sepsis.

\section*{Vulnerability Of The Newborn To Infection}
1. The defense mechanism of the newborn infant are imperfectly under developed, More pronounced in the preterm baby, small for gestation or born after prolonged labour or prolonged rupture of membranes.
2. Skin and mucus membranes are thin and easily damaged,
3. The baby is virtually free from organisms and lacking a protective resistant flora.
4. There is decreased cellular immunity due to a reduced number of T- cell lymphocytes.
5. Phagocytosis is less efficient.
6. Immunoglobins ( 1 g ) are deficient, only 1 gG is transported across the placenta in the second half of pregnancy, this protects the infant against those infections to which the mother is immune. 1 gM only produced by the foetus if he is exposed to intrauterine infections and 1 gA is not manufactured until birth.

\section*{Modes of acquiring infections}
- Across the placenta e.g. Rubella virus, HIV, histoplasmosis, syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), listeria monocytogens
- Intrapartum transmission: herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B, candida albicans, Ophthalmia neonatorum, pneumonia
- Infections acquired after birth from the environment, from contaminated equipment's or from people handling the baby:

Infections acquired after birth from the environment, from contaminated equipment's or from people handling the baby:
- Eye Infections,
- Mouth-candiba Albicans ,
- Buttocks Peri-anal Thrush,
- Skin Infections Mostly By Staphylococcus Aureus (Septic Spots, Paronychia, Pemphigus Neonatorum),
- Omphalitis,
- Neonatal Mastitis,
- Respiratory Infections
- Nasopharyngitis,
- Rhinitis,
- Pneumonia,
- Gastro Enteritis,
- Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC),
- Urinary Tract Infections,
- Meningitis

\section*{12. CLASSIFICATION OF NEONATAL SEPSIS}

Neonatal sepsis can be classified into two major categories depending up on the onset of symptoms: Early Neonatal Sepsis And Late Neonatal Sepsis
1. Early Onset Sepsis (EOS):
- It presents within the first 72 hours of life.
- In severe cases, the neonate may be symptomatic at birth.
- Infants with EOS usually present with respiratory distress and pneumonia.
- The source of infection is generally the maternal genital tract.
- Some maternal/ perinatal conditions have been associated with an increased risk of EOS. Knowledge about these potential risk factors would help in early diagnosis of sepsis.

\section*{Risk Of Early Onset Sepsis}
1. Low birth weight (<2500 grams) or prematurity
2. Febrile illness in the mother with evidence of bacterial infection within 2 weeks prior to delivery
3. Foul smelling and/or meconium stained liquor
4. Rupture of membranes $>24$ hours
5. Single unclean or $>3$ sterile vaginal examination(s) during labor
6. Prolonged labor (sum of 1st and 2nd stage of labor > 24 hrs )
7. Perinatal asphyxia (Apgar score < 4 at 1 minute)
- Presence of foul smelling liquor or three of the above mentioned risk factors warrant initiation of antibiotic treatment.
- Infants with two risk factors should be investigated and then treated accordingly.
2. Late Onset Sepsis (LOS):
- It usually presents after 72 hours of age.
- The source of infection in LOS is either nosocomial (hospital-acquired) or community-acquired and neonates usually present with septicemia, pneumonia or meningitis.
Risk factors for nosocomial sepsis include:
- Low birth weight,
- Prematurity,
- Admission in intensive care unit,
- Mechanical ventilation,
- Invasive procedures,
- Administration of parenteral fluids,
- Use of stock solutions.

Risk factors for community-acquired late onset neonatal sepsis (LOS) include:
- poor hygiene,
- poor cord care,
- bottle-feeding,
prelacteal feeds e.g 10\% dextrose, glucose, nun
- In contrast, breastfeeding helps in prevention of infections.

\section*{Clinical features of neonatal sepsis}
1. Non-specific features:
- The earliest signs of sepsis are often subtle and nonspecific:
- Neonates with sepsis may present with one or more of the following symptoms and signs:
(a) Hypothermia or fever (former is more common in preterm low birth weight infants)
(b) Lethargy, poor cry, refusal to suck
(c) Poor perfusion, prolonged capillary refill time

\section*{Clinical features of neonatal sepsis}
2. Specific features related to various systems:
a) Central nervous system (CNS): Bulging anterior fontanelle, vacant stare, high-pitched cry, excess irritability, stupor/coma, seizures, neck retraction. Presence of these features should raise a clinical suspicion of meningitis
b) Cardiac: Hypotension, poor perfusion, shock
c) Gastrointestinal: Feed intolerance, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, paralytic ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) ,oral thrush

3. During labour and delivery
- Hand washing by birth attendant
- Clean and safe delivery by maintaining sterility during delivery
- Use of Disinfectant and sterilization of equipment's
- Minimization of vaginal examination
- Prompt diagnosis and treatment of prolonged labour.
- Management of mother using a partoghraph for early identification and management of complications
- Prophylaxis antibiotics for mothers with PROM

\section*{prevention of neonatal sepsis}
4. After delivery
-Early and exclusive breast feeding
- Cord care using chlorhexidine
- Application of tetracycline eye ointment to all babies after birth
- Neonatal immunization
- Antibiotic prophylaxis for babies at risk of neonatal sepsis e.g. foul smelling liquor, baby born by mothers with fever.
- Avoidance of trauma to the skin and the mucus membrane
- Maintaining a clean and safe environment, regular changing of equipment and clothing for baby and cot
Hand washing

\section*{13. Heavy -for- dates baby?/macrosomia/}
- Definition; a heavy for gestation baby is one whose intra-uterine growth has been excessive, the birth weight will be above $90^{\text {th }}$ centile and he is therefore termed large for gestation.

\section*{Causes:}
- Maternal diabetes
- Gestational diabetes
- Macrosomia is considered to be due to maternal hyperglycemia leading foetal hyperglycemia which triggers fetal insulin production
- hyperinsulinism in turn caused increased growth and fat deposition.
- The extent of the macrosomia will depend on how well the maternal diabetes is controlled during pregnancy
- Other cause of macrosomia is Beckwith-wiedemann syndrome ( infant is a giant)

\section*{Appearance}
- The infant is large, fat, and cherubic in appearance,
- Many are preterm
- Infant of diabetic mother have a higher incidence of congenital abnormality ,
- Features of beckwith-weidemann syndrome, this is an over growth disorder characterized by macrosomia, omphalocele , exomphalos or gastroschisis in conjunction with a large tongue (macroglossia) and enlarged kidneys and liver.

\section*{complication}

Complications of baby's born by diabetic mothers:
1. Hypoglycaemia
2. Resiratory distress syndrome
3. Infections
4. Most are delivered at 36-37 weeks of gestation or even earlier so they may be premature

\section*{Management macrosomia/ heavy for gestation infant}

\section*{Labour and delivery:}
- Assessment of the pelvis to role out Cephalopelvic disproportion
- If in doubt caesarean section is recommended
- close monitoring of the maternal blood sugars one hourly.
- A paediatrician should be available during labour incase the infant may need resuscitation
- Admit the newborn in the NBU at least for $24-48$ hours for monitoring and early management of complications.
- Monitor blood glucose levels on admission and 2 hourly
- Initiate early feed
- Continue with other observation, protection from infection and injuries, warmth, ensure baby is breathing spontaneously, provide any medication as needed, monitor input and output, care for bladder and bowel.

\section*{Admission criteria in a new born unit}
-The newborn unit does not only admit babies at risk but also offers accomodation to normal neonates due to unstable maternal condition or death of the mother.

\section*{Reasons for admitting the baby into the nursery include the following :}
1. Prematurity
2. Small for gestation
3. Asphyxia neonatorum
4. Heamorrhagic disease of new born
5. Ophthalmia neonatorum
6. Birth injuries
7. Conjenital abnormalities eg.hydrocephalus
8. Respiratory distress syndrome
9. Infants of diabetic mothers (risk of hypoglycaemia)
10. Maternal death
11. Unstable maternal condition

\section*{Infection Prevention And Control In NBU}
- Due to low immunity of the baby in NBU, infection control is critical to protect the babies from infection during their stay in the unit.This necessitates high infection control measures within the unit.

The following are some of the ways of ensuring infection control in the nursery :
1. Keep the unit clean, free from dust. The windows should remain closed at all times to prevent flowing in of dusty air.
2. Daily dump dusting and cleaning of incubators and cots.
3. Isolation of infected babies for barrier nursing
4. Restriction of visitors to ensure adequate control of human traffic into the nursery.
5. Visitors should see the babies through the glass.
6. Strictly observing aseptic technique while performing procedures like fixing branulars, feeding tubes and feeding
7. Feeding utensils should be rinsed (remove the milk), decontaminated, cleaned thoroughly in soapy water and kept in presept (disnifectant tablets) till the next feed
8. Staff working in the isolation room should should not move into other nurseries
9. Cleaning of incubators upon discharge or death of the baby, before the next baby is put in.
10. Mothers changing clothes whenever they come to feed the babies.
11. Health educating the mothers on the importance of personal hygiene and care of the baby.

- Introduction to midwifery care study

\section*{DESCRIPTION- NEWBORN AT RISK}
- Newborn at risk can be defined as;
- any neonate, regardless of birth weight, size or gestational age who has a greater than average chance of morbidity or mortality within the first 28 days of life.
- Usually, maternal conditions may predispose a neonate to be at high risk of developing the disorders you are about to cover
- Identification of newborns at risk cannot always be made before labour, since the course of labour and birth or how the infant will withstand the stress of labour is not known prior to the actual process.

\section*{Classification of high risk infants (weight)}
-Low birth weight infants (LBW) - an infant whose birth weight is less than 2500 gm ( 5.5 pounds) regardless of gestation age
-Very low birth weight infant (VLBW) - an infant with birth weight less than 1500 gm
-Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) - an infant with birth weight less than 1000 gm

\section*{Classification of high risk infants (weight}
-Small for date/ gestation (SGA) - an infant whose rate of intrauterine growth was slowed \& whose birth weight falls below the 10th percentile on intrauterine growth curves

Intrauterine growth restriction - infants whose intrauterine growth is restricted
-Large for gestation age (LGA) - an infant whose birth weight falls above the 90th percentile on intrauterine growth charts

\section*{CLASSIFICATION BY GESTATIONAL AGE}
- Term birth: delivery occurring between 37 and 42 weeks of gestational age
- Preterm birth: delivery occurring before 37 weeks of gestational age
- Extremely preterm: - < 28 weeks of gestational age
- Very preterm - 28 to 32 weeks of gestational age
- Moderate to late preterm - 32 to <37 weeks of gestational age
- Post-term birth: delivery occurring after 42 weeks of gestational age

\section*{The Premature Infant (Preterm)}

Definition
- The preterm baby is born before the end of the 37th gestational
week, regardless of birth weight.
- Or baby born before the 37th completed week of gestation.

Causes of Prematurity
-Unknown- 40\% unknown
- Maternal factors; malnutrition, chronic diseases (heart diseases, renal disease\& liver dse), malaria, Tobacco use
-Pregnancy related factors; hypertension, Anemia, abruption placenta or placenta previa, multiple pregnancy, incompetent cervix, PROM, chorioamnionitis \& polyhydramnios
-Fetal factors; chromosomal abnormalities, intrauterine infections, anatomic abnormalities

\section*{others.}
- Frequent pregnancies
- Low maternal weight (mothers with a weight < 40kg \& a height of $<145 \mathrm{~cm}$ often give birth to LBW babies
-Teenage pregnancy
-Previous preterm baby
-Cervical incompetence, history of cone biopsy
- Induced premature labor

Physical stress caused by non obstetric surgery may lead to premature labour if the mother has this procedure while pregnant .

\section*{Characteristics of the preterm baby}
- skull bones are soft ,large fontanels and wide sutures.
- The chest is small and narrow and appears underdeveloped.
- The abdomen is prominent because the liver and spleen are large and
abdominal muscle tone is poor
- Large liver
- Most reflexes are absent
- Plantar creases not visible
- Plentiful lanugo
- Red skin

\section*{Characteristics of the preterm baby}
- Very small
- Labia are widely separated, not covering the minora resulting in prominent appearance of the clitoris
- Scrotum does not have rugae \& testes are not descended
- Pinna soft and flat.
- Feeble cry
- Scanty hair on the head
- Absent eyebrows
- Visible vessels because of thin subcutaneous tissue

\section*{Problems of Preterm neonates}
-Birth asphyxia
- Hypothermia (term babies keep themselves by active metabolism of brown fat stores, preterms lack brown fat)
-Preterms <34 wks gestation cannot coordinate suckling \& swallowing. Therefore unable to feed from the breast
-Preterms < 30wks of gestation may not tolerate any enteral feeds initially because of gut immaturity

\section*{Problems of Preterm neonates}
- respiratory distress (esp <34 wks) coz of immature lungs. There will be impaired gaseous exchange, xtized by tachypnoea, indrawing of the chest, grunting \& cyanosis
-Apnoeic spells/ attacks - due to immature respiratory control mechanisms. In an apnoeic attack, the baby stops breathing, develops slow heart rate \& turns blue
-Infections - immunocompromised. Do not have sufficient humoral, cellular \& mucosal immune mechanisms to protect themselves against bacteria

\section*{Problems of Preterm neonates}
- Immature vascular bed around the brain ventricles.

These delicate vessels may rapture \& cause
- Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
- Immature metabolic pathways of infants predispose them to develop hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis \& hyperbilirubinemia
-Blindness - if given excess O2 coz of damage to the immature retina (retinopathy of prematurity)
-Organ injury (Brain, Eye, Lung, Intestine, Skin

\section*{Management of a premature}
-Maintenance of respiration and good colour
- Provision of warmth
- Prevention of infection
-Ensuring good progress and growth
-Educating the mother to take care of her infant
- Ensuring baby gets adequate nutrition

\section*{Maintenance of respiration}

Assist to maintain patency of the airway because
- Respiratory centre in the medulla is immature
- The lungs tend to be atelectatic and are not well developed due to inadequate surfactant.
- The diaphragm and chest muscles are weak, hence constantly asphyxiated.
- The infant should be laid with its head to one side and the foot of the cot should be slightly raised to aid with the drainage of mucus
- Observeclosely for signs of respiratory distress and cyanosis
note
- Respiratory distress can be recognised by the rapid, irregular respiration with periods of apnoea, indrawing of the chest walls and sternal recession and expiratory grunt with cyanosis of body and face.
- Give oxygen in such cases -avoid high concentration.
- prolonged administration of a high concentration of oxygen may lead to the development of fibrous tissue behind the lens, which results in a condition known as retrolental fibroplasia leading to blindness in the newborn

\section*{Provision of warmth}
- Prevention of heat loss \& maintenance of neutral thermal environment is crucial for the infant
- Premature and LBW have smaller muscle mass \& fewer deposits of brown fat for heat production, lack of insulating subcutaneous fat \& have poor reflex control of skin capillaries
- heat regulation centre in premature babies is underdeveloped.
- Small babies weighing less than 1.5 kilograms should ideally be nursed in an incubator with temperature of about 30 degrees Celsius and relative humidity of $65 \%$.
- If there is no incubator available, they should be nursed in warm towels.
- Placed in a heated environment

- A high humidity atmosphere contributes to body temperature maintenance by reducing evaporative heat loss
-Skin to skin (kangaroo) contract between stable preterm infant \& mother maintains body temperature
- Use of cotton wool as a means of keeping infantwarm has been condemned, since it deprives the skinof air and there is danger of infection and overheating of infant.

Protection from infection
- Through, meticulous hand washing
-Personnel with infectious disorders should be barred from the unit
-Ensure early \& exclusive breast milk feeding
-Care of the umbilical stump
-Avoid unnecessary interventions e.g. IV lines \& needle pricks
- Nursery should be clean
- Control visitors

\section*{NUTRITION.}
- preterms are at risk of altered nutritional status because of poor nutritional stores \& several physical \& developmental xtics
-Suckling \& swallowing are not coordinated until 32 to 34 wks of gestation \& synchronization occurs after 36 wks.
-Gag reflex is also not well developed hence infants highly prone to aspiration

\section*{NUTRITION}
- Gestation $\geq 34$ wks infants can be breast, bottle or cup fed safely unless otherwise ill
-Those less than 34 wks gestation usually need tube feeding
-Those less than 32 wks should, as a rule be tube fed
- Breast milk is ideal because of its digestibility, nutrients and the immunity it gives to the newborn.
- The practice of withholding feeds or fluid for 24 hours or more before feeding is considered unnecessary

\section*{Feeding Schedule}
-Neonates $>1500 \mathrm{gms}$-60mls/kg/day
-Increase by $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ every day
- Neonates < 1500gms -80mls/kg/day
-Increase by $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ every day
-Feeding done 3 hourly
-Breast feeding/EBM (NGT/ Cup feeding) formula milk, Pre-nan
Parenteral nutrition indicated when;
-Severe feed intolerance
-GI abnormality including Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)
-Energy conservation

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF A PREMATURE.}
- Cyanotic attacks
- Cerebral hemorrhage
- Heart failure and pulmonary edema

Jaundice
- Anemia
- Infection
- Poor mental and intellectual development in later years
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome

\section*{The Small for Gestational Age Infant}
-The small for gestational age (SGA) infant who appears small for their age, may be full term or preterm, but the baby is undernourished, undersized \& therefore, LBW

\section*{characteristic of small for Gestational Age}
- Plantar creases are well defined from toes to heel
- Moro and traction reflexes present
- Pinna of ear has cartilaginous ridges and firm
- Born at term
- Eyes wide open (worried look
- Skin dry and wrinkled
- Skull bones firm

\section*{CAUSES}
- Maternal diseases such as hypertensive disorders
- Placental transfer of inappropriate substances which have erotogenic effects such as nicotine, alcohol, cocaine or infective agents
- Extremes of maternal age, that is those at either end of the childbearing spectrum, for example, very young or old parent
- Socio-economic factors, including poor nutrition of the mother during pregnancy
- Parity and number of fetuses in utero all impinge on the normal growth pattern

Problems of SGA neonates
- Asphyxia
- in-utero undernutrition they have small placenta
- Hypothermia - since they are chronically undernourished in utero, they also lack adequate brown fat stores
-Hypoglycemia coz of insufficient energy stores
- Infections - ill effects of chronic intrauterine stress
-More likely to have malformations

\section*{Summary of problems LBW}
-Hypoxia
-Hypovolemia/ Hypervolemia
-Hypoglycemia/ Hyperglycemia
-Hypokalemia/ hyperkalemia
- $\mathrm{H}+$ [acidosis]
-Hypothermia/ hyperthermia

\section*{management}

General principles for the care of LBW neonates include;
-All neonates weighing $\leq 2000 \mathrm{gms}$ should be admitted in the NBU
- Respiratory support
-Provide adequate warmth (temperature regulation)
- Adequate feeding (nutrition \& fluids)
-Prevent infections

\section*{The Post Term Infant}
- A post term infant is a baby born after 294 days, that is, 40 weeks of gestation.
- Accurate dating and calculation of the gestation period is important.
-The main characteristic features of a post term infant include:

\section*{characteristic features of a post term}
- Skin is loose, dry and desquamating (peeling off)
- Skull bones are hard and firm
- Small fontanelles and narrow sutures
- Nails are overgrown hence long
- Minimal subcutaneous fat of the skin - loose dry skin which peels off.
- Absence of lanugo and vernix
- Meconium staining on the skin
- Birth weight of 4 kg or more in $10 \%$ of prolonged pregnancies.
- $1 \%$ of post mature newborns weigh 4.5 kg
- Meconium aspiration syndrome.
- Placenta insufficiency - malnutrition - intra-uterine growth retardation

\section*{This infant is at risk of developing complications because}
-The placenta starts diminishing in its functions and hence the foetus may not get enough nutrients and oxygen leadind to asphyxia in utero and passing of meconium which will affect the infant's life.
- Since the bones of the skull are firm, moulding is not effective and this may lead to a difficult delivery

\section*{Complications of post term}
-Fetal distress
- MAS
- Fetal trauma
brachial plexus injuries, clavicle fracture
- Increased perinatal mortality
-Dysmaturity syndrome

Meconium Aspiration Syndrome (MAS).
Definition:
-This respiratory disorder is caused by meconium aspiration by the fetus in utero or by the newborn during labor and delivery.
- MAS is often a sign that the neonate has suffered asphyxia before or during birth.
- The mortality rate can be as high as 50\% and survivors may suffer long-term complications related to neurological damage..

\section*{Causes and Pathophysiology:}
1. Fetalis hypoxia; e.g. cord prolapse that comes around the neck of the fetus many days before delivery.
2. Babies born breech presentation.

In both cases;
-----intrauterine hypoxia----vagal nerve stimulation --relaxation of the sphincter muscle -------releasing of the first stool (meconium) in the intrauterine life and becomes mixed with the amniotic fluid, with the first breath the baby can inhale meconium.

\section*{The aspirated meconium can cause}

\section*{airway obstruction clinical}
manifestations of RDS, and an intense

\section*{inflammatory reaction.}
$\checkmark$ Management of MAS:
Suctioning of the oropharynx by obstetricians before delivery of the shoulders.
Immediate insertion of an ET tube and tracheal suctioning before ambu agging (Maintain a neutral thermal environment).
Gastric lavage, and emptying of the stomach contents to avoid further aspiration.

Postural drainage and chest vibration followed by frequent suctioning.
Pulmonary toilet to remove residual meconuim if intubated.
Antibiotic coverage .
Oxygenation ( maintain a high saturation > 95\%)
Mechanical ventilation to avoid hypercapnia \& respiratory acidosis.

\section*{1. NEONATAL HYPOGLYCAEMIA}

\section*{Description,}

An acquired metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally low blood sugar such that for term babies, glucose levels are below $2.0 \mathrm{mmols} / \mathrm{L}$.
the variation of the cut off values is because normal term infant uses compensatory mechanisms and alternative fuels such as ketone bodies, lactate or fatty acids to replace glucose

\section*{PREDISPOSING FACTORS}

\section*{REFERS TO NEONATES AT RISK OF HYPOGLYCAEMIA.}
- Low birth weight
- This is because these babies have lower glycogen stores hence cannot mobilize enough glucose.
- Simultaneously, have immature hormonal and enzyme responses and sometimes cannot feed orally at an early stage
- Severely asphyxiated
- The low oxygen supply upsets the metabolism of carbohydrates hence excessive catabolism of glycogen, leading to exhaustion of the stores
- Idiopathic respiratory distress
- Due to inadequate oxygen supply hence exhaustion of the glycogen stores
- Severe jaundice: toxicity of the high levels of unconjugated bilirubin inhibits feeding hence high use of glucose
- Intracranial injury: due to inadequate oxygen supply
- Severe infection: inhibition of feeding
- Hypothermia: excessive use of glucose to produce heat for survival
- Uncontrolled maternal medical condition; becoz the neonate's pancrease produces large amounts of insulin in the $1^{\text {st }}$ week as it was during intrauterine stage

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF N. HYPOGLYCEMIA}
1. Lethargy \& poor feeding- due to inadequate glucose supply to the tissues
2. Abnormal respiratory pattern- characterized by episodes of shallow breathing and apnoea which finally leads to cyanosis as condition deteriorates. All this is due to reduced oxygen and glucose supply to the brain cells
3. Hypotonicity (limpness) \& hypothermia; becoz of insufficient supply of O2 \& glucose to the muscles
4. Irritability: which ranges from jitteriness( extreme nervousness \& anxiety), later twitching- angles of mouth \& eyes as well as extremeties and eventually seizures/convulsions. It is brought about by neuroglycopenia (insufficient to reduce glucose supply in the nerve cell)- intracranial haemorrhage
5. Coma- it is a life threatening feature characterized by lack of sensation, abnormal heart \& lungs function.
Occurs due to either delay or omission of appropriate measures. Death occurs within 24 hrs if condition is neglected

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC FACTORS}
- Hx- of maternal diabetes, either gestational or chronic diabetes.
-Physical examination findings- features of irritability, limpness, lethargy e.t.c
- Lab tests-Abnormal lab results e.g. low blood sugars e.t.c.

\section*{SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT- N. HYPOGLYCEMIA}

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT OF NEONATAL HYPOGLYCAEMIA:}
- Adequate temperature control- keep the neonate warm
- Encourage early feeding- should be fed within 1 hour after delivery
- Encourage frequent feeding, at least every 3 hourly
- Blood glucose should be checked immediately before the second feed and then 4-6 hrly.
- Observe high standards of hygiene to prevent infections.
- Inform the DR concerning the condition
- Admit the baby in the NBU and manage as follows:

\section*{If the Blood glucose less than $1.1 \mathrm{Mmol} / \mathrm{L}$;}
- Give a bolus of $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight of $10 \%$ glucose IV slowly over five minutes
- If an IV line cannot be established quickly, give $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight of 10\% glucose by Nasogastric tube
- Infuse $10 \%$ glucose at the daily maintenance volume according to the baby's age
- Assess the blood glucose 30 minutes after the bolus of glucose administration \&;
- If the blood glucose is less than $1.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, repeat the bolus of glucose (above) and continue the infusion then assess blood glucose again after 30 minutes
- If the blood glucose is between $1.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, continue the infusion and repeat the blood glucose testing every three hours until the blood glucose is $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or more on two consecutive tests
- Allow the baby to breastfeed.
- As the baby's ability to feed improves, slowly decrease (over a three-day period) the volume of IV glucose while increasing the volume of oral feeds.
- Do not discontinue the glucose infusion abruptly

\section*{If the Blood glucose is between 1.1-2.6 Mmol/L;}
- If the blood glucose is between $1.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, allow the baby to breastfeed and repeat the blood glucose testing every three hours until the blood glucose is $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or more on two consecutive tests
- Once the blood glucose is $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or more for two consecutive tests;
- If the baby cannot breastfeed, give expressed breast milk using an alternative feeding method

\section*{Frequency of blood glucose measurements after blood glucose returns to normal}
- If the baby is receiving IV fluid for any reason, continue blood glucose testing every 12 hours for as long as the baby requires IV fluid.
- If the blood glucose is less than $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ treat as described above
- If the baby no longer requires or is not receiving IV fluid, assess blood glucose every 12 hours for 24 hours (two more tests):
- If the blood glucose remains normal, discontinue testing

\section*{PROGNOSIS}
- Good: with early diagnosis \& immediate + proper mgt
- Poor/fatal or leads to high morbidity rate, where the infant is a light or small for gestational age \& proper mgt is delayed, becoz there's already some degree of cerebral damage= death or severe mental retardation and other associated conditions

\section*{PREVENTION}
1. Routine screening of the prenatals in order to identify the risk factors
2. Adequate temperature control at birth and thereafter( keep infant warm to prevent hypothermia)
3. Early feeding- using milk within $1^{\text {st }} 1$ hour for normal neonates and within 15 minutes of birth for those whose mother is diabetic. The milk has got fat content which spares enough glucose required for the normal cerebral functions hence less chances of brain damage
4. Frequent feeding thereafter atleast 3 hourly to maintain glucose concentration in the circulation hence normal body function
5. Accurate screening \& follow-up of the neonates whose mothers are diabetic during the $1^{\text {st }}$ one week of birth

\section*{2. HYPERGLYCAEMIA}
- Definition: Hyperglycemia is a serum glucose concentration > 8.3 $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ).
- The most common cause of neonatal hyperglycemia is
- Iatrogenic
- Iatrogenic causes usually involve too-rapid IV infusions of dextrose during the first few days of life in very low-birth-weight infants (< 1.5 kg)
- Hyperglycaemia is much less of a clinical problem than hypoglycaemia \& mostly occurs in pre-terms \& severely growth restricted infants
- Symptoms and signs are those of the underlying disorder;
- Diagnosis is by serum glucose testing.
- Additional laboratory findings may include glycosuria and marked serum hyperosmolarity.

Neonatal jaundice
}

Define
Causes of jaundice
Bilirubin physiology
Types
Management
- Jaundice is the yellow discoloration of skin \& mucous membranes as a result of raised bilirubin levels(hyperbilirubinemia), occurring in the first 28 days of life.
Classification;-
Physiological jaundice or
Pathological jaundice
- Visible form of bilirubinemia on;-
- Adult sclera $>2 \mathrm{mg}$.dl
- Newborn skin $>5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Occurs in 60\% of term \& 80\% of preterm neonates

\title{
Bilirubin Physiology
}
- Source of production : Ageing, immature or malformed red cells are removed from the circulation \& broken down in the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen \& macrophages). Hemoglobin from these cells is broken down to the by-products of haem, globin \& iron
- Heam is converted to biliverdin \& then to unconjugated bilirubin
- Globin is broken down into amino acids, which are used by the body to make proteins
- Iron is stored in the body or used for new red cells
- $3 / 4$ of bilirubin comes from hemoglobin catabolism.
- 1 gm of hemoglobin results in the production of 34 mg of bilirubin.
- A normal term new born produces about
- $6-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

Three stages are involved in the process of bilirubin conjugation;
- a)Transport
- b)Conjugation \&
-c)Excretion

\section*{a) Transportation of bilirubin}
- Unconjugated or fat soluble bilirubin is transported to the liver bound to albumin. If not attached to albumin, this unbound or 'free' bilirubin can be deposited in extravascular fatty \& nerve tissues (skin \& brain). Skin deposits of unconjugated or fat soluble bilirubin causes jaundice, while brain deposits can cause bilirubin toxicity or kernicterus
- Once in the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is detached from albumin, combined with glucose \& glucoronic acid \& conjugation occurs in the presence of oxygen \& the enzyme Uridine diphosphoglucoronyl transferase (UDP-GT). The conjugated bilirubin is now water soluble \& available for excretion

\section*{c) Excretion}
- Conjugated bilirubin is excreted via the biliary system into the small intestine where normal bacteria change the conjugated bilirubin into urobilinogen. This is then oxidized into orange colored urobilin. Most is excreted in the feaces, with a small amount excreted in urine
- Two main forms of bilirubin are present in the body;
- Unconjugated bilirubin is fat soluble \& cannot be excreted easily either in bile or urine. Neonatal jaundice can result from increased levels of this fat soluble bilirubin that cannot be excreted and is instead deposited in fatty tissue
- Conjugated bilirubin has been made water soluble in the liver \& can be excreted in feces \& urine. Neonatal jaundice can also result from increased levels of this water soluble bilirubin if excretion is prevented, e.g. by an obstruction

\section*{Assement of jaundice}
- Clinical jaundice first becomes obvious in the face followed by a downward progression as it increases in intensity.
- Assessment of jaundice should be done in natural light.
- The finger is pressed on the baby's skin, preferably over a bony part, till it blanches. The underlying skin is noted for yellow color. Confirm bilirubin level by lab

\section*{a) Physiological jaundice}
- Also known as icterus neonatorum
- Neonatal physiological jaundice occurs when unconjugated (fat soluble) bilirubin is deposited in the skin instead of being taken to the liver for processing into conjugated (water soluble) bilirubin that can be excreted in feces or urine.
- It is a normal transitional state affecting up to 60\% of term \& 80\% of premature babies who have a progressive rise in unconjugated bilirubin level \& jaundice on day 3.
- Physiological jaundice never appears before 24 hours of life, usually fades by 1 week of age \& bilirubin levels don't exceed $12-13 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (200-215 umol/L).
- Lasts 5th to 7th day
- Managed with phototherapy if levels rise significantly $>5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl} /$ day
- In many newborns a temporary discrepancy exists between red cells breakdown and their ability to transport, conjugate \& excrete the resulting bilirubin.
- Physiological jaundice results from increased red cell breakdown at a time of newborn immaturity

\section*{Why does physiological Jaundice develop?}
- Increased bilirubin load (incres RBC brkdwn)
- Decreased trasport of bilirubin to the liver (deficient albumin)
- Defective conjugation (reduced levels of UDP-GT enzyme levels)
- Decreased excretion
- Increased entero-hepatic reabsorption

\section*{increased enterohepatic reabsorption}
- This process is increased as the newborn bowel lacks the normal enteric bacteria that breaks down conjugated bilirubin to urobilinogen (hindering excretion).
- The newborns gut is sterile \& less motile.
- Feeding stimulates peristalsis \& produces rapid passage of meconium hence reducing amount of reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin

\section*{Characteristic of physiological jaundice}
- Appears after 24 hours
- Maximum intensity seen on 4-5th day in term \& 7th day in preterm neonates
- Mainly occurs in the skin \& eyes
- Baby looks \& feeds well
- Serum levels do not exceed $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Clinically undetectable after 14 days
- Disappears without any treatment

\section*{Management of physiological jaundice.}
- No treatment is required but baby should be observed closely for signs of worsening jaundice
- Early frequent breast feeding - breast feeding ensures glucose supply to the liver, increases bowel motility \& normal bowel flora.
- Associated with decreased milk intake related to fewer calories consumed by infant before mother's milk is well established
- Mother advised to expose the baby in the sunlight
- Phototherapy

\section*{Breastfeeding associated jaundice}
- Onset is 2 nd to 4 th day with peak 3rd to 5th day
- Managed by increasing breast feeding

\section*{Pathological jaundice}
- Pathological jaundice in newborns usually appears within 24 hours of birth.
- Increase of serum bilirubin> $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl} /$ day
- Serum bilirubin $>15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Clinical jaundice is persistent after 14 days
- Stool clay/ white colored or urine staining clothes
- Direct bilirubin $>2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ at any time

\section*{causes}
- Appearing within 24 hours of age
- Hemolytic disease of the newborn; Rh, ABO incompartibilities
- Infections: TORCH, malaria, bacterial
- Enzyme deficiencies - (G6PD deficiency leads to increased hemolysis of RBCs)
- Appearing between 24-72 hours of life
- Physiological
- Sepsis neonatorum
- Polycythemia
- Concealed hemorrhage: cephalhematoma, SAH, IVH
- Increased enterohepatic circulation
- Drugs that compete with bilirubin for albumin binding sites e.g. asprin, ampicillin, sulphonamides

\section*{diagnosis}
- Review the maternal \& perinatal hx
- Family hx of jaundice
- Previous siblings with jaundice
- Maternal illness during pregnancy
- Hx of malaria traumatic delivery, delayed cord clamping
- Physical examination
- Laboratory tests
- Total \& direct bilirubin
- Blood group \& Rh for mother \& baby
- Hematocrit
- Direct Coomb's test on infant
- Septic screen
- Liver \& thyroid function tests

\section*{management}
- Rationale: reduce level of serum bilirubin \& prevent bilirubin CNS toxicity
- Keep baby warm
- Continue breastfeeding or give EBM
- Administer antibiotics when indicated
- Prevention of hyperbilirubinemia
- Early feeding
- Adequate hydration
- Reduction of bilirubin
- Phototherapy
- Exchange transfusion
- Natural light (leads to hyperthermia commonly

\section*{phototherapy}
- Is the primary treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- This involves exposure of the naked baby to blue, cool white or green light of wavelength $450-460 \mathrm{~nm}$.
- The light waves convert the bilirubin to water soluble nontoxic forms which are then easily excreted.
- Reduces the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity, because watersoluble photoisomers do not cross the BBB
- Bilirubin 450-460nm Photoisomers of Bilirubin
- (Insoluble) Light (Soluble

\section*{phototherapy}
- Place baby naked in an incubator/ cot
- External genitalia may be covered while giving phototherapy
- Fix eye shields
- The energy delivered to the infant's skin decreases with increasing distance between the infant \& the light source.
- Baby placed at 45 cm from light
- 3 hourly feeding must be continued
- Turn baby 2 hourly or after every feed
- Monitor temp 2-4 hourly
- Weigh the baby on alternate days
- Monitor serum bilirubin daily
- Discontinue phototherapy if the serum bilirubin values are $<10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$

\section*{Advantages of phototherapy}
- It is noninvasive
- Effective
- Inexpensive
- Easy to use

\section*{phototherapy}
- Is the primary treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- This involves exposure of the naked baby to blue, cool white or green light of wavelength $450-460 \mathrm{~nm}$.
- The light waves convert the bilirubin to water soluble nontoxic forms which are then easily excreted.
- Reduces the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity, because watersoluble photoisomers do not cross the BBB

\section*{Side effects of phototherapy}
- Hyperthermia
- Increased fluid loss
- Dehydration
- Damage to the retina by the high light intensity
- Lethargy or irritability
- Loose stools
- Skin rashes/ skin burns
- Increased insensible water loss: provide more frequent extra breast feeding
- Isolation \& lack of usual sensory experiences, including visual deprivation
- A decrease in calcium levels leading to hypocalcemia

\section*{Care during phototherapy}
- Monitor baby's temperature - observe for hypothermia/ hyperthermia
- Eyes - shields or patches must cover the eyes without occluding the nose, \& not be too tight or cause eye discharge or weeping
- Skin - cleaned with warm water \& observed for rashes, dryness \& excoriation
- Position under phototherapy to expose all body surface areas to the light

\section*{Care during phototherapy}
- Weigh the infant daily
- Monitor fluid administration, urine output
- Hydration - fluid intake \& output are monitored \& feeding is continued. Consider IVF for ill or dehydrated babies
- Neurobehavioral states - need for interaction with nurse, parents \& other caregivers
- Monitor calcium levels - symptoms for hypocalcemia include; jitteriness, irritability, rash, loose stools, fever, dehydration \& convulsions (common in preterm babies)
- Parent support

\section*{Exchange transfusion}

Indications:
- If intensive phototherapy has failed to reduce bilirubin levels to a safe range
- The infant has signs of kernicterus (lethargy, decreased feeding, hypotonia, a high-pitched cry, opisthotonous, setting sun sign, fever, seizures)
- Signs of congestive cardiac failure

\section*{Lab investigations prior to procedure}
- Electrolytes
- Bilirubin
- Serum glucose
- Hematocrit
- Blood is removed \& replaced at $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$, removal \& infusion rate should not exceed $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$

\section*{Nursing interventions}
- Ensure consent has been obtained for exchange transfusion
- Prepare infant \& family for exchange transfusion
- Infant is kept NPO for 3-4 hrs before procedure or gastric contents are aspirated with NG tube before the procedure
- Vital observations monitoring; immediately before beginning the procedure, every 5 min for the first 15 min , then every 15 min for the remainder of the procedure
- Monitor blood glucose level every hour for 2 hours after procedure
- Document amount of blood withdrawn \& amount infused
- Monitor vitals every $1 / 4$ hourly for the first hour, then every $1 / 2$ hourly for 1 hour \& then every hour for 2 hours after the procedure.
- Blood is then taken for; electrolytes, bilirubin, serum glucose \& hematocrit
- Weigh the infant daily
- Observe the umbilical site for signs of bleeding

\section*{Complications of jaundice}
- Kernicterus - bilirubin brain damage

Identified by;
- lethargy \& poor feeding
- poor or absent moro reflex
- Opisthotonous
- convulsions

\section*{ABO incompatibility}
- ABO Incompatibility can occur if the mother and the baby have different blood types.
- when the mother has type O blood and the baby has type $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, or AB blood.
- People with type O blood produce anti-A and anti-B antibodies.
- Individuals with type O blood develop antibodies throughout life from exposure to nutrition, diet, some infections \& transfusions

\section*{ABO incompatibility...}
- The anti-A and anti-B antibodies formed are igG antibodies
- igG can cross the placenta and attach to fetal red cells and destroy them

\section*{ABO incompatibility...}
- When a type O blood mom is pregnant with a type $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, or AB blood baby, there is a chance that the anti-A or anti-B antibodies will pass through the placenta during pregnancy or birth and cause ABO Incompatibility.

\section*{ABO incompatibility.}
- Like the antibodies produced in Rh Disease, the antibodies with ABO incompatibility attack the baby's red blood cells once they pass through the placenta.
- These antibodies can cause the rapid breakdown of the baby's red blood cells.

\section*{ABO incompatibility}
- Bilirubin is produced when the body breaks down red blood cells and this rapid breakdown of the baby's red blood cells causes a quick build up of bilirubin, resulting in jaundice and sometimes anemia.
- Diagnosis is done by direct coombs test to identify maternal antibodies on foetal RBCs

\section*{ABO incompatibility}
- ABO usually causes mild haemolysis
- Management depends on the degree of jaundice

Rhesus Isoimmunisation

\section*{Introduction}
- Also called RhD incompatibility
- The D antigen is found on RBCs
- RBCs with antigen D (rhesus positive)
- RBCs without antigen D (rhesus negative)

\section*{Introduction}
- Rhesus disease occur when a woman with Rh-negative blood is pregnant with Rh positive fetus
- Rhesus disease does not affect a first pregnancy
- Mother must have exposure to Rh-positive fetal cells in previous pregnancy
- Then she develops antibodies against the rhesus antigen

\section*{Introduction}
- The ig G antibodies can cross from the mother to the fetus through the plcenta

\section*{Rh-Isoimmunization}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_35321b895bc9b415cdfbg-109.jpg?height=1314&width=2897&top_left_y=561&top_left_x=323)

\section*{Events that facilitate rhesus disease}
- Miscarriage
- Termination of pregnancy (abortion)
- APH
- Invasive prenatal testing e.g. amniocentesis , cordocentesis,chorionic villus sampling,fetal blood sampling
- delivery

\section*{Events that trigger isoimmunization}
- Ectopic pregnancy
- External cephalic version
- Fetal death in utero or stillbirth
- Abdominal trauma

\section*{Prevention of Rhesus disease}
- Screening women for the rhesus factor and antibodies
- Administration of anti-D immunoglobulins to non-sensitized women within 72 hours of birth or any other sensitizing event
- Anti-D ig destroys any fetal cells in the mothers blood before her immune system produces antibodies

\section*{Prevention of Rhesus disease}
- Rh-negative women screened for Rh antibodies (indirect coomb's test)
- A negative test shows an absence of antibodies or no sensitization
- After birth, fetal blood checked for the presence of maternal antibodies on fetal red blood cells (direct coomb's test)
- A negative test shows absence of antibodies or no sensitization

NB: anti D ig NOT given to women who are already sensitized

\section*{Prevention of Rhesus disease cont'}
- Where feasible, administration of anti-D at 28 \& 34 weeks gestation is recommended

\section*{Effects of Rh D isoimmunization}
- Destruction of fetal RBCs (hemolytic anemia)
- Oedema
- Congestive Cardiac failure
- Jaundice with kernicterus
- Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
- Hydrops fetalis due to excessive haemolysis

\section*{Management of RhD isoimmunization}
- Exchange blood transfusion
- Phototherapy to reduce bilirubin levels

VITAL STATISTICS IN MIDWIFERY

\section*{VITAL STATISTICS}

\section*{DEFINITION.}
- Refers to the systematic collection of numerical figures, related to life and death events then they are summarized and studied.

\section*{SPECIFIC OBSTETRICAL STATISTICS.}
-Refers to those of special interest in obstetric, they include:-
1. BIRTH RATE.
- Rate: - Refers to relation of the collected figures to a specific number within the population. The specific no. is generally 1,000 newborn infants, so birth rate is calculated as:

Number of births i.e. live \&dead
$$\times 1,000$$

Number of women in child bearing age
- Therefore, accurate records of birth notifications and registration are important tools for correct birth rate.
- The findings help to estimate the population growth together with other relevant statistics.

\section*{2. STILLBIRTH RATE.}
- Calculated through accounting for total number of stillbirths i.e. both fresh and macerated in a year. Compared to the number of total births/deliveries (live \&dead) relate to a group of 1,000 of those births.
- NB: - Birth/ delivery is that which occurs as from $24{ }^{\text {th }}$ week of pregnancy.
- FORMULA:

Total number of stillbirths (fresh \& macerated)
$$\times 1,000$$

Total number of deliveries (live \& still)
- The findings help to assess the antenatal care and delivery system performance. Take into account when exactly death occurred in terms of whether before arrival to health facility, already admitted but not in labour or in the course of labour.

\section*{3. PERINATAL DEATH RATE}
- Around birth period \& $1^{\text {st }}$ week after birth.

\section*{Definition of Perinatal Death}
- The definition of a perinatal death is: "The definition of a foetus weighing at least 500 grams (or 22 weeks gestation), plus the number of early neonatal deaths (up to 7 days)
- It's a good indicator of the country's socio-economic status, quality of perinatal care and extent to which patients/clients use these services (perinatal servicesprenatal \& delivery)
- Perinatal death refers to both stillbirths and early neonatal death.
- Its significance is to evaluate the performance of relevant disciplines i.e. midwives and obstetrician as well as the responsibility of the mother i.e. whether has played her role accurately.
- However, others, such as socio-economic factors have to be considered as well.
- Mortality rate is expressed as number of stillbirth and early neonatal deaths per 1,000 total birth (live \& still)
- FORMULA:

No. of stillbirths + Early neonatal deaths
$$\times 1,000$$

Total no. of births (live \& still)
- The perinatal mortality rate is currently at 29 deaths per 1,000 total births (KDHS, 2014)

\section*{4. NEONATAL DEATH RATE.}
- It's expressed as total number of both early and late neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births.
- FORMULA:

Early + Late neonatal death
(no. of deaths among babies below 28 days)
$\times 1,000$

Total no. of live births/delivery

\section*{NEONATAL DEATH:}
- It's demise of newborn within the first 28days of extra-uterine life OR Death of a baby during the neonatal period.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION.}
- Early neonatal death: Demise that occurs to a neonate within the first week or 07days of birth.
- Late neonatal death: Demise occurring after the first week, but within the neonatal period OR Death of a baby that occurs as from the $8^{\text {th }}$ - $28^{\text {th }}$ day after birth.
- Neonatal mortality rate is currently at 22 deaths per 1,000 live births (KDHS, 2014).
5. POST NEONATAL DEATH RATE.
- Expressed as number of deaths after the neonatal period per 1,000 live births.
- FORMULA:

No. of post neonatal deaths i.e. before 1 year old
$$\times 1,000$$

Total No. of live births
- Post-neonatal death refers to demise of a baby after the neonatal stage but within the first year after birth or before the first birthday anniversally.

\section*{6. INFANT DEATH(MORTALITY) RATE(IMR)}
- It's expressed as total number of neonatal and post-neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births.
- FORMULA:

Neonatal + Post neonatal deaths
(same year)
$$\times 1000$$

Total No. of live births
- The result (rate) is among the best tools of evaluating the nation's health hence helps in estimating the future population with certainty.
- Currently IMR is on the increase due to multiple factors such as, HIV/AIDS Pandemic, vector borne disease and low socio-economic and westernization status among others.
- Therefore the respective health care disciplines have to protect the fetus prenatally, intrapartumly and the infant postnatally in collaboration with other key sectors (stakeholders), if our future population is to be healthy.
- The specific aim is to lay down a firm foundation for the baby's health.

Source: Liu L, Johnson H, Cousens S et all. 2012. Global, regional and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis. Lancet $379(9832): 2151-61$.

\section*{KDHS 2013/2014 REPORT!}
- The infant mortality rate is 39 deaths per 1,000 live births, and under-5 mortality is 52 deaths per 1,000 live births.
- At these levels, currently, about one in every 26 Kenyan children dies before reaching age 1, and about one in every 19 does not survive to his or her fifth birthday.

\section*{KDHS 2014; IMPORTANT TO NOTE;}
- A child born in the Nyanza region is almost twice as likely to die before age 5 as a child born in the Central region.
- Nairobi has the second highest under-5 mortality rate, following Nyanza (72 deaths per 1,000 live births).
- Male children are more likely than female children to die during their first year of life (44 deaths versus 37 deaths per 1,000 live births)
7. MATERNAL DEATH (MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE- MMR)

\section*{Definiton}
- Death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days (6weeks) of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy, from any cause related to/or worsened by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.
- Maternal deaths account for $14 \%$ of all deaths to women age 15-49 Years
- According to KDHS (2008/2009), MMR was at 488/100,000 live births.
- The target was to reduce this rate to 200 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030
- KDHS (2013/2014) reports of maternal mortality ratio of 362 deaths per 100,000 live births

\section*{GLOBAL CAUSES OF MATERNAL DEATH.}
- Hemorrhage: - APH, PPH, abortion and from ectopic pregnancy. Accounts for 42\%.
- Infections: - Puerperal sepsis, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and aggravated maternal chronic medical condition or when a new medical condition occurs in pregnancy.
- Pregnancy induced conditions, mostly HTN disorder.
- Labour related complications e.g Obstructed labour
- Incidental Causes:- Natural and created calamities.
- WHO 2002, launched an initiative referred to as making pregnancy safe (MPS) which has 3 (three) targets namely;-
- Primary management of unwanted pregnancy and safe abortion.
- Skilled care during pregnancy and delivery.
- Access to accurate referral system when complications arise.

\section*{Purpose of maternal \& perinatal death review}
- To raise awareness among health professionals, administrators, programme managers, policy makers and community members about these factors in the facilities \& the communities, which, if they had been managed, the death may have not occurred
- To stimulate action to address these avoidable factors \& so prevent further maternal \& perinatal deaths

\section*{SAFE MOTHERHOOD}
- Refers to empowerment of women of reproductive age ( $15-49 \mathrm{yrs}$ ) to have quality services hence a healthy pregnancy, safe delivery and healthy neonate.
- Therefore safe motherhood is the model in which maternal morbidity and mortality as well as fetal and neonatal deaths and morbidity are expected to be reduced due to the following integrated services which serves as Pillar.
- These pillars represent important factors namely;-
- Family Planning: The individuals or couples have the right information. This helps them make informed decisions in terms of planning on the timing, number and spacing of the pregnancies.

Focused Antenatal Care: Aimed at early detection and treatment of complications as well as preventing them where possible.
- Clean and safe deliveries: By ensuring that all birth attendants have knowledge, skills, positive attitude and equipment's needed to perform clean and safe delivery. Simultaneously provides postpartum care to the mother and the baby.
Prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDS during pregnancy, child birth or through breastfeeding, by taking the most appropriate precautions.
- Neonatal Care: The goal is to offer optimal care to prevent complications that may arise after birth.
- To realize the above services, the following are the Foundations of the Model. They are at 4 (four) levels namely:-
1. SKILLED ATTENDANTS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE.
- A skilled attendant is a health professional with midwifery skills. They have been trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal deliveries, postnatal period and diagnose or refer obstetric complications- does not include traditional birth attendants (TBAs)

The skilled attendant also has;-
*Effective interpersonal communication skills. This creates an enabling environment for collaboration with other key parties in the planning and implementation of safe motherhood.
$\stackrel{*}{*}$ Ensures privacy and confidentiality.
*Woman friendly services as per local social-culture context increases women's confidence and they get involved in the care they receive.
Quality improvement of clients and RH: It's a process which goes hand in hand with adherence to improved standards and guidelines to satisfy clients needs in a culturally acceptable means.

\section*{2. SUPPORTIVE HEALTH SYSTEMS.}
- Effective communication between health care providers is essential for management of obstetric emergencies for ensuring continuity of care.
- A functional referral system is very important in terms of 24 hour access to means of transport, office, telephone, good record keeping to facilitate in writing of a detailed referral notes.
- Referral system is further strengthened by active supportive supervision, regular feedback on cases, continuing education and in service update sessions.
- Upward consultation facilitates development of professional trust and confidence. "Upward consultation: - between health centers, dispensaries and hospitals.

\section*{3. COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNERSHIPS.}
- This cannot be underestimated. This refers to community mobilization, particularly women, their family (particularly the spouse) and local leaders as well as health care providers of every level, e.g. TBAs.
- Appropriate supervision of TBA activities is imperative to prevent delays in women seeking and receiving treatment in regard to obstetric emergencies.

\section*{4. EQUITY FOR ALL/REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.}
- Women's health is basically the nation's health. Therefore, uniquities for any reason have to be dealt with in the best way possible, so enabling policies based on strong political support and national ownership are vital to attract resources for maternal and newborns health. It's equally important to ensure that the resources reach groups/communities with the highest maternal mortality.
- However it's injustice not to point out that most maternal and perinatal deaths are unavoidable. Nevertheless, maternal and newborn health must be given its due rights, as women are entitled to enjoy a safe pregnancy and childbirth.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION - MATERNAL DEATHS.}
A. True or Direct Obstetrical Death.
- Its demise resulting from obvious obstetrical complications occurring during either during pregnancy, labour, or in puerperium.
- Contributing factors could be unnecessary intervention (over-indulgence), omissions, incorrect treatment or late diagnosis. Therefore number one cause of death in pregnancy.
B. Indirect Obstetrical Death.
- Refers to demise due to either a chronic condition or a demise that develops prenatally, but not related to pregnancy state. Physiological change worsens the state of the condition
- Therefore number one cause of death is the condition or the new demise, pregnancy is only secondary.
C. Coincidental/ Incidental/ Fortuitous Death.
- That which results from other caused factors, not related to obstetric in any way but occurring either during pregnancy, labor or puerperium.
- E.g. Natural catastrophes-land slide, famine.
- Aircraft accidents.
- Assault- war

\section*{D. Later (late) death.}
- Demise caused by either direct or indirect obstetrical factor. Death occurs after puerperium but within the $1^{\text {st }}$ year of abortion or delivery.

\section*{CONCLUSION.}
- The rates have generally decreased currently compared to 20-30 years ago.
- This is due to;-
- Great advancement in the field of medicine in terms of chemotherapeutic agents, specialized personnel and life support machines/facilities.
- Better standards of living- hygiene, housing and means of communication.
- Increase of literally rate- Has helped communities to modify or even abandon, certain beliefs and practices that are not maternal/neonatal health friendly.
- Availability of health facilities within reach.
- However there is still room for improvement since HIV/AIDS menace and low socio-economic status are contributory to rise in various death rates.

\section*{RECOMMENDATION.}
- The aim is to gradually reduce death rates through intersectional collaboration efforts. Ensure Millennium Development Goals 3, 4, 5 and 6 are closely followed up;
- 3) Promote gender equity \& empower women
- 4) Reduce child mortality,
- 5) Improve maternal health
- 6) Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
- System behavior change in HIV/AIDS through change of attitude.
- Control/eradicate corruption which leads to inequitable distribution of resources hence poor socio-economic status.
- Improve infrastructure and communication network.
- Well equipped government health facilities in terms of infrastructure, motivated personnel and conducive environment which favors rendering of services round the clock.
- Control the licensing of private health facilities to avoid substandard services.
- Ensure accessibility of health services payment organization to all e.g. NHIF.
- Standardization of professional bills- private facilities hence are accessible/affordable to common citizen/non-citizen.
- Availability of affordable drugs for HIV/AIDS, opportunistic infection control.
- Introduction of community midwifery services- more of long term goal. Currently empower the TBA through extensive training hence control death rates.
- Tough penalties for those who transmit HIV/AIDS virus knowingly- perhaps will curb the rate of infection hence death rate.
- Maternal mortality rate is expressed as total number of deaths i.e. prenatally, intrapartum and in puerpenium per 100,000 total births.
- FORMULA OF DETERMINING MMR:
prenatal+ intrapartum+ puerperium deaths
$\times 100,000$
Total no. of births (live/dead)

\section*{MAJOR CAUSES OF OBSTETRIC DEATHS.}
- Non-pregnancy related infections- criminal abortion, systematic diseases e.g. malaria.
- Complications of hypersensitive disorders prenatally.
- Obstetric hemorrhage.
- Pregnancy related sepsis.
- Pre-existing medical conditions e.g. cardiac diseases, HIV opportunistic infections, cancer, renal diseases etc.

\section*{Causes of Maternal Mortality in the African Region}
deaths that occurred in 2003 globally, 99 percent $(333,000)$ occurred in developing countries with Sub-Saharan Africa having the highest MMR at 900 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The adult lifetime risk of maternal deaths is highest in Africa (1:26), followed by Oceania (1:62), and Asia (1:62); compared with developed countries, where the risk is $1: 7300$ (WHO, 2007). Major causes of maternal mortality in SSA are depicted below.

\end{figure}

\section*{FACTORS INFLUENCING MMR.}
- Prenatal care; - attendance failure, quality of care given, late booking- because of possibility of unforeseen problems.
- Parity; - usually high among primigravidae due to backstreet (illegal) abortion. Higher among grand multiparous above chances of medical complications and obstetric hemorrhage.
- Age;-below 15years- poor ANC attendant, above 40 years, presence of medical condition and ignorance.
- Socio - economic factors; - Perhaps due to ignorance and stress hence under utilization of prenatal services

- The incidence of drug use within the population has a large geographical variation. As a result, the incidence of drug withdrawal symptoms among neonates \& infants also has a high incidence
- Opiates \& other drugs cross the placenta \& the fetus during pregnancy is likely to be exposed to the same peaks \& troughs of drug exposure that the mother is. Withdrawal may be manifested b4 birth
ASSIGNMENT: Pharmacological drugs that can easily cross the placenta barrier \& their effects on the fetus.
- The increased incidence of fetal compromise may be related to drug withdrawal during labour but the effects of the drugs \& withdrawal on the fetus \& newborn are related to the timings of drug doses
- Infants born to mothers who have used illicit drugs during pregnancy are at risk of withdrawal symptoms.
- The common substances abused by pregnant women are:-
- CNS depressants: alcohol, sedatives, anxiolytics, and hypnotics
- Stimulants: cocaine and amphetamines
- Opiates \& narcotics
- Hallucinogens
- Intoxication and withdrawal represent the most common substance-related disorders.
- Intoxication, defined as the development of a reversible substancespecific syndrome during or after substance use, becomes a clinical problem when significant maladaptive patterns of behavior leads to distress and impairment.
- Withdrawal, another substance-specific syndrome, occurs when the chronic intake of a substance is abruptly discontinued.
- Substance abuse is there4 a maladaptive pattern of use that results in clinically significant functional impairment without satisfying the criteria for substance dependence.
- Abuse is indicated by any one of the following:
- failure to fulfill reasonable obligations, drug use in dangerous situations eg pregnancy and continued use despite recurrent legal, social, and psychological problems associated with the substance
- The effects of substance abuse during pregnancy may be classified into three categories:
- Effects of the illicit substance(s) on the mother
- Effects on the course of pregnancy and delivery
- Effects on the fetus, newborn, and developing child
- Maternal complications of drug abuse include:
- Respiratory complications (infections)
- Cardiovascular, including hypertension and endocarditis
- Neurologic, with seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, and psychoses
- Infectious, such as STIs and HIV
- Renal and gastrointestinal, including acute tubular necrosis and hepatitis; and/or metabolic, such as malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies- Which can lead to end- organ failure

Obstetric and fetal complications associated with maternal substance abuse include:
- Placenta praevia
- Abruptio placentae
- Premature rupture of membranes
- Spontaneous abortion
- Intrauterine growth retardation
- Premature delivery
- Birth defects
- Neonatal and long-term developmental effects
- Poor attendance for antenatal care

\section*{Neonatal effects of substance abuse:}

NB// These depend on the specific substance abused by the mother but generally include:
- congenital anomalies
- neonatal medical complications such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), and respiratory distress syndrome.
- Neurobehavioral changes

\section*{What is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)?}
- Refers to a group of problems that occur in a newborn who was exposed to addictive opiate \& narcotic drugs in utero.
- These substances cross the placenta barrier and the fetus becomes addicted along with the mother.
- This disorder may be associated with long term problems to the baby.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF NEONATAL DRUG WITHDRAWAL}
- These symptoms usually begin 1-3 days after birth but may take up to a week to appear.
- The withdrawal symptoms most frequently seen in neonates are:
- Jitteriness/ restlessness
- Tremor \& Irritability
- Constant/persistent high pitched crying
- Infants often fail to settle btwn feeds (disorganized sucking)
- Hyperactivity
- Frequent yawning (irrespective of adequate periods of feeding), sneezing \& vomiting
- Sweating, pyrexia (may also be in the absence of an infection) \& convulsions
- Respiratory distress
- Diarrhoea \& an irritant nappy rash
- Episodes of high temp in the absence of an infection

\section*{SPECIFIC MGT OF NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME:}
- Divided into general care given to these infants \& pharmacological rx
- Keep the infant with the mother to enhance bonding
- Encourage breastfeeding as long as there's no evidence of HIV or ongoing drug use by the mother esp. cocaine and heroine
- A quiet envt with reduced light and noise is helpful in keeping stimuli to a minimum
- Feeds should be given frequently
- Build up a good working relationship with the mother
- Communication should be clear and non judgmental
- Explain the baby's presenting signs and emphasize that the behavior is not a rejection of their parents
- Encourage parents to take active part in the care of their baby
- Emphasize the possible effects of breast feeding, which would be harmful especially with cocaine and heroine.

\section*{DOMICILIARY SERVICES}
- Also referred to as: - POSTNATAL HOME VISIT.

\section*{DESCRIPTION:}
- It's the care given to the normal puerperal mother and her newborn (neonate) at her home environment after discharge from a health institution (facility).
- Before discharge, they are carefully assessed to ensure no unforeseen complications with the domestic arrangements.
- So discuss with the couple in order to gain consent for the services.

\section*{OBJECTIVES.}
- To offer routine post-natal care to mother and neonate: - hence monitor their recovery and developments i.e. physically and psychologically.
- To assess realities of motherhood in terms of:- Development of independent skills of caring for herself and her baby in a home environment and her attitude towards the baby.
- To assess the reaction of other family members as each comes to term with their altered roles.
- To offer an opportunity for the parents to express any anxieties about the baby, other children or their own relationship e.g. sexuality.
- Then give unstinting (general) support and encouragement.
- To share relevant health messages such as diet using locally available and affordable foods, hygiene and family planning.

NB:- Family planning awareness only, but let the couple decide on the best methods.
- Strive to maintain optimal health whereby for any noted health problem, work with the family for the best solution.

\section*{PERIOD (DURATION).}
- Minimum- 10 consecutive days i.e. on daily basis.
- Maximim-28 consecutive days, frequency as earlier stated.
- Specific time- best in the mornings, for a period of one 1 hour. Actual timing organize the mother(client)

\section*{REQUIREMENTS.}
- Refers to items (articles) which comprise the post-natal home visiting kit. They include:-
- Sphygmomanometer (BP machine).
- Stethoscope.
- Rectal thermometer.
- Tape measure/ Ruler.
- Spirit swabs.
- Clean gauze and wool swabs.
- Piece of soap and towel.
- Recording charts- both mother /neonate.
-Baby's weighing scale-carried along on alternate visits.

\section*{HOME VISIT.}
- In the clients home the midwife is a guest hence must behave appropriately.
- So in order to work smoothly with a particular family, bear the following factors:-
- Must rely on tact and persuasion in order to communicate and provide the care effectively. In other words;-The midwife has no authority to insist that things be done a particular way.
- Have to work very hard to win the confidence of the family, by showing them that you have their interests at heart.
- Must tactfully and sensitively convey the advice and health education to the situation you will find e.g. if you had earlier shared on prevention of home accidents, then you find potato peels all over, you don't show anger or comment carelessly i.e. you are giving up because she seems not to have learned from the talk.
- Eventually the midwife must be accommodative, adaptable and prepared to improvise in order to provide the highest standards of care.

\section*{DAY OF DISCHARGE FROM HEALTH INSTITUION.}
- Perform a thorough examination to both mother and neonate in order to serve as guideline for the future progress.
- 2 or 3 of you (midwives) escorts the mother on discharge to her home in order to be familiar with the locality and to assess the situation, or in this era of mobile phones- can ask for the direction then exchange Tel. nos.
- Then remind her of the learned health messages and organize on the time and day of visit, as appropriate.

\section*{VISITS ACTIVITIES.}
- Wait to be welcomed in the house after you knock the door gently.
- Establish rapport.
- Enquire on the routine care starting with the mother: mother maintain privacy as appropriate.
- Lastly attend to the baby-Supervise the feeding of the baby at least once every 2days.
- NB: - The environment should be conducive. Depending on the weather, may undress baby completely or just remove the top clothings.
- Generally advise as appropriate, and emphasize on diets and adequate rest. Record your findings on the chart daily and interpret.
- Allow time for questions, clarification, expression of worries and concerns. Then respond to them as fairly as possible and refer as appropriate.

\section*{CONCLUSION.}
- On completion of mandatory visits, summarize the events and file the chart with the other clients' records in the institution records department.
- In case a problem is noted in the course of the care, a management plan is worked out together with the family.
- The patient (unwell family member) is referred to a health facility of their choice. Thereafter follow up care is carried out as per need.
