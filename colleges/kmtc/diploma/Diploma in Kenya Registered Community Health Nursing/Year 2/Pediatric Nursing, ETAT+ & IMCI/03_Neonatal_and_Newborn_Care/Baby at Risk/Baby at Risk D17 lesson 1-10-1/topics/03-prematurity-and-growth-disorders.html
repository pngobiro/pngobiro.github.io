                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A preterm infant is a baby born before the 37th completed week of gestation.</li>
                            <li>This is most often due to the early over distension of the uterus, which leads to the fetus being born prematurely.</li>
                            <li>Premature births also occur more frequently in low socio economic and illiterate groups in the population, largely as a result of the poor nutritional intake of the pregnant mother.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, they tend to be more common when there is concurrent maternal metabolic or systemic disease, for example, hypertension and Diabetes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CLASSIFICATION OF PRETERM</h3>
                        <p>WHO Classification is based on gestational age:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extremely preterm ( &lt; 28 weeks)</li>
                            <li>Very preterm ( 28 to &lt; 32 weeks)</li>
                            <li>Moderate to late preterm (32 to &lt;37 weeks)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PREDISPOSING FACTORS TO PREMATURITY</h3>
                        <h4>Fetal factors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Polyhydramnios which causes over distension</li>
                            <li>Congenital malformation of the fetus</li>
                            <li>Rhesus incompatibility interfering with fetal viability.</li>
                            <li>Multiple births (twins or more), which causes early distension of the uterus hence early birth</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Maternal factors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypertension associated with the pregnancy leading to early induction of labor, for example, preeclampsia and eclampsia</li>
                            <li>Premature rupture of membranes due to physical or psychological stress</li>
                            <li>Chronic infections or diseases in the mother, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, chronic nephritis, cardiac disease, diabetes and thyroid disease, may lead to premature labor</li>
                            <li>Acute infections in the mother, like pneumonia, influenza, rheumatic fever and malaria could induce premature labor</li>
                            <li>Strenuous exercise, excessive drinking of alcohol, smoking</li>
                            <li>Physical stress caused by non obstetric surgery may lead to premature labor if the mother has this procedure while pregnant</li>
                            <li>Habitual abortion owing to incompetent cervical OS or uterine malformation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Placental factors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antepartum hemorrhage due to placentae praevia and placenta abruptio</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PREVENTION OF PREMATURE BIRTH</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Early and continued prenatal care with stress on dietary and general hygiene education to the expectant mother. This will also ensure immediate treatment of those complications of pregnancy likely to cause, or be associated with, premature labor.</li>
                            <li>Postpone or inhibit uterine contractions in some cases of premature labor through the use of certain pharmaceutical agents such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Those that act by preventing the release or synthesis of a known uterine stimulant, for example, prostaglandin inhibitors e.g. . non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like aspirin, indomethacin, diclofenac</li>
                                    <li>Those that act by the direct effect on the myometrial cells, for example, beta adrenergic receptor stimulants like retodrine, fenoterol, salbutamol</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prolonged bed rest should be encouraged, especially where the mother has any of the conditions that predispose to preterm labor</li>
                            <li>Use of sedatives during preterm labor to ensure complete bed rest</li>
                            <li>Avoidance of strenuous exercise and calming the mother, because any strain or stress may aggravate preterm labor</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Intra uterine growth standards are used to compare an infant's weight and gestational age with population averages</p>
                        <p>Height may however be affected by sex, age, parity etc</p>
                        <p>Weight serves to assess growth while gestational age assesses maturity</p>
                        <p>The fetal growth chart presents average fetal weights for the $10^{\text {th}}, 25^{\text {th}}, 50^{\text {th}}$ and $75^{\text {th}}$ percentiles</p>
                        <p>An infant born at 40 weeks gestation and weighing less 2500 g would be mature but undergrown (intra-uterine growth retardation). This is classified as small for gestational age. An infant born at 36 weeks but weighing 3600 g (above $90^{\text {th}}$ percentile) would be immature but overgrown (large for gestational age)</p>
                        <p>Premature infants are those born before 37 weeks gestation. An infant weighing 2500 g or less is of low birth weight while infants weighing 1500 g or less are of very low birth weight.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Maternal factors</strong> - maternal nutritional factors will lead to low weight gain during pregnancy Women who are malnourished during pregnancy due to poverty, adolescence, women with frequent pregnancies are likely to deliver low birth weight babies
                                <ul>
                                    <li>pregnancy induced hypertension poses a threat to fetal growth since it decreases intra uterine blood flow</li>
                                    <li>advanced maternal diabetes and the accompanying vascular insufficiency promote intra uterine growth retardation</li>
                                    <li>Substance abuse - e.g. cigarette smoking has been correlated with decreased fetal growth. Birth weight is decreased on the average of 170 g as a result of 10 cigarettes smoked per day</li>
                                    <li>Extremes of maternal age</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Placental influences</strong>
                                <p>Under normal circumstances the size of the placenta determines fetal size. When there is severe nutritional deprivation the maintenance needs of the placenta are met first leading to reduction in fetal growth. The diffussional capacity of the placenta increases with fetal growth. Any impairment of oxygen and nutrients transfer affects fetal.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>fetal endocrine influences -????</strong></li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE</h3>
                        <p>A term used to describe a baby who is smaller than the usual size for the number of weeks of pregnancy; considering parameters such as length head circumference</p>

                        <p>Neurological criteria tend to be more accurate than physical criteria since most of the physical characteristics tend to be abnormal.</p>

                        <p>A baby whose birth weight is below the 10th percentile for its estimated gestational age. One third of low birth weight babies are light for dates Both conditions reflect intrauterine malnutrition and growth retardation of the fetus.</p>

                            <li>There is no significant difference in management from that described for the normal infant except that the small for gestational age or light for dates infant would be more susceptible to hypothermia.</li>
                            <li>Babies <2kg should be given incubator care if not on skin to skin care</li>
