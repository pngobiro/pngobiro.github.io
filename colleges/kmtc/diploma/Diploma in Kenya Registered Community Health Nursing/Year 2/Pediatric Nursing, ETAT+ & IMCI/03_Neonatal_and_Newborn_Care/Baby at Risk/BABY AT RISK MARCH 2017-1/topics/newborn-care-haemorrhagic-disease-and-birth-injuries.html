                        <p>- Trauma to the head and scalp that occurs during the birth processis usually benign but occasionally results in more serious injuries.</p>
                        <p>- There are three main types of extracranial (out of the cranium, brain) haemorrhage which are :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Caput succedaneum</li>
                            <li>Cephalohaematoma</li>
                            <li>Subgaleal or subaponeurotic haemorrhage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>1. CAPUT SUCCADENIUM</strong> - Is an oedematous swelling due to accumulation of serum fluid under the foetal scalp. it results from pressure of the presenting part of the scalp against the dilating cervix during delivery that leads to reduced venous blood and lymphatic drainage and part of serum escapes into the tissue .The swelling is self limiting and disappears within 36 hours of life.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Cephalohaematoma</strong> - is accumulation of blood between the periosteum and the skull bone.It is caused by friction between the foetal skull bones and pelvic bones eg.CPD</p>

                            <li>This involves damage to the upper roots of the branchial plexus involving the $5^{\text {th}}$ and $6^{\text {th}}$ cervical nerve roots.</li>
                            <li>The affect arm is inwardly rotated, lies limply by his side and he can not flex his elbow or lift his arm, the half-closed hand is turned outwards (waiter's tip position), but there is movement of arm and fingers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>b) Klumpke's palsy:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Klumpke's palsy involves the lower arm, wrist and hand, with wrist drop and limp ( no grasping reflex) fingers caused by damage to spinal roots C8 and T1.</li>
                            <li>The shoulder and upper arm has normal movements</li>
                            <li>The injury is caused by difficult birth e.g.in breech, large baby</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>c) Total brachial plexus palsy:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is complete paralysis of the shoulder, arm, wrist and hand & loss of sensation due to damage of all the brachial plexus nerve roots.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Resting the arm for 7-10 days followed by gentle physiotherapy to avoid contracture.</li>
                            <li>Parents should be taught a full range of passive movements for shoulder, elbow, and wrist.</li>
                            <li>Complete spontaneous recovery is more common with Erb's palsy than in Klumpke's or total brachial palsy but may take several months up to 2 years</li>
                            <li>Do follow up</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Commonly occurs in association with brachial plexus and less commonly as an isolated lesion.</li>
                            <li>It may affect one or both sides of the diaphragm.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Treatment :</strong> varies from simple oxygen therapy to intermittent positive pressure ventilation</p>
                        <p><strong>Complication:</strong> Hypostatic pneumonia</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Horner's syndrome:</strong></p>
                        <p>This is caused by damage to the cervical sympathetic nerves and is often associated with klumpke's paralysis. The syndrome occurs infrequently, presenting with ptosis (drooping or falling of the upper eyelid), enophthalmos (posterior displacement of the eyeball within the orbit) due to loss of function of the orbitalis muscle, constriction of the pupil and absence of sweating from the affected side of the head and face.</p>
