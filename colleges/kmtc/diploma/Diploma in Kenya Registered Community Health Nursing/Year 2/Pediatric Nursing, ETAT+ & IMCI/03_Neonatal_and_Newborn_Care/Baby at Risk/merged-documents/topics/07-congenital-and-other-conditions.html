                        <p>Maternal hyperglycemia leads to fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. This results in increased fetal growth (macrosomia) and fat deposition. At birth, the glucose supply from the mother is cut off, but the baby's high insulin levels persist, putting them at high risk for severe hypoglycemia. They are also at risk for RDS, hyperbilirubinemia, and polycythemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> These infants require intensive observation. Blood glucose should be monitored within the first hour of birth and then hourly for 6-8 hours. Early and frequent feeding is crucial to prevent hypoglycemia. If oral feeding is not possible, an IV glucose infusion is started.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)</h3>
                        <p>A pattern of abnormalities in a child caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. There is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. FAS is characterized by small size, slow development, distinct facial features (e.g., thin upper lip, smooth philtrum), and potential for birth defects and mental retardation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> There is no specific treatment; management focuses on creating a supportive environment and addressing specific learning or health needs.</p>

                        <p>A form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns born to non-immune mothers, usually through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump. Symptoms begin 3-10 days after birth and include failure to suck, inability to open the mouth (trismus or lockjaw), and severe muscle spasms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> Aims to remove the source of the toxin (wound debridement, antibiotics), neutralize circulating toxin (anti-tetanus serum), and provide supportive care (sedation, NG tube feeding, respiratory support). Prevention through maternal immunization is paramount.</p>
