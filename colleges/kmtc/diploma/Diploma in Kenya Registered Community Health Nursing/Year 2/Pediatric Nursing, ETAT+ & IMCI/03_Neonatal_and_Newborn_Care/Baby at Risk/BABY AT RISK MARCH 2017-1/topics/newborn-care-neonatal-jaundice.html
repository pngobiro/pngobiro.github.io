                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>- Neonatal Jaundice is a condition in neonates characterised by yellow discolouration of the skin, sclera and mucous membranes.</p>
                        <p>- It develops when there is excessive bilirubin levels in the blood stream.</p>
                        <p>- When there is increased rate of haemolysis of RBC or decreased conjugation, there are high amounts of free bilirubin in circulation leading to jaundice.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bilirubin Metabolism</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When aged, immature, malformed RBCs are broken down by hemolysis in the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen and the macrophages), they produce haem and globulin. Globulin is stored for reuse.</li>
                            <li>The haeme part produces bilirubin and iron. Iron is stored for re use and uncojugated bilirubin (fat soluble) is waste product which should be excreted.</li>
                            <li>Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble.</li>
                            <li>Unconjugated bilirubin has to be converted to water soluble form. (conjugated/ direct bilirubin) by a process of conjugation for it to be excreted.</li>
                            <li>Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver thus it has to be transported to the liver by binding to transport protien, albumin.On arrival to the liver, bilirubin detaches itself from albumin attaches to x and y receptor proteins.</li>
                            <li>Conjugation with glucuronic acid by means of glucuronyl transferase enzyme to become to become bilirubin diglucoronide that is water soluble.</li>
                            <li>Excretion of bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestines.</li>
                            <li>While in the intestines, it is converted to stercobilinogen by gut normal flora and excreted in stool ( gives stool the colour).</li>
                            <li>Some of it absorbed from the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine. If passage though the gut is slow some bilirubin will be unconjugated be beta glucuronidase</li>
                            <li>If conjugation process is interfered with,there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice.</li>
                            <li>This bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) may cross theBBB and cause brain damage, a condition known as Kernicterus that is characterised by seizures, hyper - tonicity, lethargy, stiff neck with hyper - extended head.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of jaundice</h3>
                        <p>There two types of jaundice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>physiological</li>
                            <li>pathological</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE</h4>
                        <p>- Physiological jaundice affects both pretem and term babies in the first few days of life. It is a normal occurence but it may indicate a serious condition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Characteristic of physiological jaundice:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jaundice never appears before 24 hours of age</li>
                            <li>The serum bilirubin levels never exceeds 250 umol/l</li>
                            <li>The highest serum bilirubin level occurs on the 3rd or 4th day of life</li>
                            <li>The jaundice fades by the 7th day of life</li>
                            <li>The baby is otherwise well</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Causes of physiological jaundice</h4>
                        <p>a) Excessive haemolysis of RBCs greater than conjugation rate. In utero the foetus high haemoglibin level $(18-22 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl})$ in order to attract sufficient oxygen across the placenta. The neonatal rbc's have a shorter life span (60-70days) than those of adults.</p>
                        <p>b) Glucoronyl transferase enzyme deficiency this is due to liver immaturity thus the liver can not cope with the increased haemolysis of rbc's</p>
                        <p>c) Increased enterohepatic reabsorption: peristalsis is slow until feeding is established and the new born gut is not yet colonised with the normal bacteria responsible for converting bilirubin digluconate to stercobilinogen. These allows apportunity for reabsorbtion</p>
                        <p>d) Decreased albumin binding capacity: thus less bilirubin is transported to the liver for conjugation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Admit the baby into the NBU and and asses the general condition.</li>
                            <li>Start early and frequent breast feeding for it provides glucose to the liver cells and also encourages bowel colonisation with normal flora which are important in formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool.</li>
                            <li>Early feeding also leads to increased gut motility leading to faster excretion of bilirubin.</li>
                            <li>Feeding also enhances enzyme production and conjugation.</li>
                            <li>Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hr interval.</li>
                            <li>If bilirubin levels take time to clear, put the baby on phototherapy.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Jaundice in preterm babies</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The preterm baby is more prone to jaundice than the term baby</li>
                            <li>The parameters are slightly different</li>
                            <li>Jaundice tends to occur earlier</li>
                            <li>Peak later and last longer than the in full term baby</li>
                            <li>Haemolysis occur in the same way but the life of the rbc's is shorter (30-40 days)</li>
                            <li>There is likely to delay feeding of a preterm baby especially if sick</li>
                            <li>The gut is also immature thus peristalsis is reduced</li>
                            <li>Albumin binding capacity is affected by an increased tendency to hypoxia, acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypoalbiminaemia</li>
                            <li>Liver immaturity</li>
                            <li>Likely to complicate due to jaundice and requires treatment for jaundice at a lower bilirubin than full term infants.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Pathological jaundice</h4>
                        <p>- Pathological jaundice appears within 24 hrs of life and is not selflimiting thus may persist for long.</p>
                        <p>- There is rapid rise in serum bilirubin.</p>
                        <p>- It includes both obstructive and haemolytic jaundice.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">causes</h4>
                        <p>- They include pathological disorders that increase bilirubin production, reduces transportation to and fro the liver or reduces rate of conjugation.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Increased haemolysis - Rhesus and ABO incompatibility, G6PD enzyme deficiency, baterial septicaemia.</li>
                            <li>Non-haemolytic causes of increased unconjugated bilirubin - CNS haemorrhage, cephalohaematoma, polycythaemia, exerggerated enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to functional ileus.</li>
                            <li>Decreased rate of conjugation - Cliggler Nagar Syndrome,Gilbert's syndrome.</li>
                            <li>Hepatotoxic drugs</li>
                            <li>Biliary obstruction that prevents transport of conjugated bilirubin to GIT for excretion</li>
                            <li>Reduced bilirubin binding sites on the albumin</li>
                            <li>Malnutrition</li>
                            <li>Increased reconversion of conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin if it stays in the GIT.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing management</h4>
                        <ul>

                        <p>-Phototherapy prevents bilirubin levels from going high enough to cross BBB and cause kernicterus</p>
                        <p><strong>mechanism of Action:</strong> Blue fluorescent light at a given wavelength is absorbed by the unconjugated bilirubin in the skin and superficial capillary and is unconjugated bilirubin (indirect) is converted into conjugated bilirubin (direct) which is water soluble and can be excreted in stool and urine.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Indications.</h4>

                            <li>Preterm with jaundice appearing after 48 hrs and bilirubin levels are $260-265 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                            <li>Preterm with weight less than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 85-114 mol/l</li>
                            <li>Preterm with weight more than 1500 g and bilirubin levels are 14-165 mol/l</li>

                            <li>Expose the whole body of the baby to increase surface area exposed to light</li>
                            <li>Keep turning the baby 2 hourly to expose all parts to the fluorescent light.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the airway of the baby is patent by extending the head</li>
                            <li>Cover the eyes to prevent damage by direct rays of light</li>
                            <li>When breastfeeding the eyes are unpadded to encourage eye contact with the mother</li>
                            <li>Provide intermittent phototherapy ie 6 hrs on and 6 hrs off but may be continuous.</li>
                            <li>Give phototherapy for $2-3$ days and asses the serum bilirubin levels twice or three times a day</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><strong>NB :</strong> Greatest reduction in bilirubin levels will be in the first 24 hrs of phototherapy.</p>
                        <ol start="8">
                            <li>Observe the eyes for weeping or discharge.</li>
                            <li>If photo therapy is continuous, give extra fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain accurate input output charts.</li>
                            <li>Change linen frequently because opening of bowels is increased. (loose stool)</li>
                            <li>Observe the feeding and sleeping behaviour of the baby.</li>
                            <li>Observations e.g temperature to rule out hyperthermia, skin colour to monitor the progress, apex beat, and respiration.</li>

                        <p>- This is a treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donors blood.It is used as a difinitive treatment when bilirubin concentrations are approaching toxic levels,the baby has haemolytic disease or low Hb .</p>
                        <p>The transfusion has the following benefits :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It helps in increasing the baby's Hb</li>
                            <li>Excessive bilirubin and unwanted antibodies are washed from the baby's circulation.</li>
                            <li>The donor's blood used for the transfusion should be Rhesus negative so that it does not alter the baby's blood group and to ensure that no antigen is introduced into baby's circulation that may lead to antibodies production.</li>
                            <li>It should also be fresh and ABO compatible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Indications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infants with haemolytic diseases</li>
                            <li>Preterms with bilirubin levels of $300-400 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                            <li>Babies whose birth weight was less than 1500 g and have bilirubin levels of $225 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                            <li>Term babies with bilirubin levels above $100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ at birth or later $400-500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Care of the baby post transfusion</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Put the baby back to phototherapy</li>
                            <li>Closely observe the baby for bleeding from the umbilical cord</li>
                            <li>If the baby was on infusion, continue for some time</li>
                            <li>Reassure the mother and involve her in the care of the baby</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">C) PROTOPORPHYRINS</h3>
                        <p>- These are haeme oxygenase inhibitors which are administered to inhibit the breakdown of haeme thus reduce bilirubin production.</p>
                        <p>-They are usually used in combination with phototherapy and/or blood exchange transfusion.</p>
