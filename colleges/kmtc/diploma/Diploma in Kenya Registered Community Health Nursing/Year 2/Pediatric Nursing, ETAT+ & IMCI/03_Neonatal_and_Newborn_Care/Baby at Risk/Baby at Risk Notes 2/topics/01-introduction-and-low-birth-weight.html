                            <li><strong>Warmth:</strong> Delivery of a preterm baby should be conducted in a warm room and subsequently nursed in preterm incubator.</li>
                            <li>Temperatures of the incubator should be maintained within normal range of about 36-37°C. perform first examination of the baby to assess maturity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feeding:</strong> Fix NG tube and feed the baby with expressed breast milk (EBM) and substitute only where breast milk is not available.
                                <p>Feed the baby using the oral feeding regime,</p>

                                    <li>Babies below 1500 gms feed 2 hourly.</li>

                                    <li>If the baby cannot tolerate the oral feeds, give IV fluids e.g. 10% dextrose day one then (HSD/10%D ratio of 1:2) day 2 if there is normal renal function.</li>
                                    <li>Introduce cup feeding gradually as the baby gains weight.</li>

                        <p>The baby is predisposed to the risks similar to those of preterm baby thus the management principles are the same:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Management should start in labour by closely monitoring foetal condition for signs of foetal distress</li>
                            <li>In case of foetal distress in first stage, administer oxygen to the mother and start IV drip of 10% dextrose as you prepare the mother for emergency C/S.</li>
                            <li>If in the second stage the delivery is hastened by giving a generous episiotomy.</li>
                            <li>Since the baby is prone to hypoglycaemia, it should be started on breast feeding as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>Gastric lavage should be done with warm dextrose before breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>Substitutes are given if there is no breast milk, the feed is calculated at 80 mls/kg body weight in 24 hours in 8 divided doses ie 3 hourly feeding</li>
                            <li>Closely observe vital signs TPR and signs of infection, give vitamin K to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, TEO to prevent opthalmia neonatorium, and CHX for cord care.</li>
                            <li>The baby should be nursed in a warm environment to prevent hypothermia although it has temperature regulation mechanism.</li>
                            <li>Closely monitor blood sugar to rule out hypoglycaemia.</li>
                            <li>Weigh the baby on alternate days to monitor the progress. Usually weight loss is minimal and it gains weight more rapidly and steadily than preterm.</li>
                            <li>Teach the mother how to take care of the delicate skin that may be dry , cracked or peeling</li>
                            <li>Discharge at 2000-2500 gms if newborn is stable.</li>
