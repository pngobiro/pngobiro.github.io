                        <p><b>Rate:</b> - Refers to relation of the collected figures to a specific number within the population. The specific no. is generally 1,000 newborn infants, so birth rate is calculated as:</p>

                        <p>Calculated through accounting for total number of stillbirths i.e. both fresh and macerated in a year. Compared to the number of total births/deliveries (live &dead) relate to a group of 1,000 of those births.</p>
