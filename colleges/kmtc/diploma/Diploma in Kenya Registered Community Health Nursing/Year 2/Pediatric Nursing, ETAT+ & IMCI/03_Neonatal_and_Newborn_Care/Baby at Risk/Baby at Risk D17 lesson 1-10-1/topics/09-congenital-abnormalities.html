                        <p><strong>TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT VESSELS</strong> - the aorta originates in the right ventricle rather than the left while the pulmonary artery originates from the left ventricle rather than the right.</p>
                        <p><strong>ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT</strong> - An abnormal opening between the right and left atria persists after birth with left to right shunting of blood. This may result from failure of the foramen ovale to close properly.</p>
                        <p>The vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta which is functional during fetal life persists after birth. When it remains open the direction of blood flow is reversed because of higher pressure in the aorta shunting oxygenated from the aortic blood into the pulmonary vasculature (during foetal life the shunt is from the pulmonary artery to the aorta).</p>
                        <p>There is an abnormal left opening between the right and left ventricles. Shunting of blood between the right and left ventricle occurs during systole because of higher left ventricular pressure. If pulmonary resistance occurs the shunt is reversed and occurs right to left with resultant cyanosis.</p>
                        <p>There is a constriction of aorta causing narrowing of the lumen. This partially obstructs blood flow, creating increased left ventricular pressure and work load. The coarctation may occur before or after the ductus arteriosus.</p>
                        <p>Four defects are combined in TOF. There is: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta and hypertrophy of the right ventricle. Severities of the symptoms depend on the size ventricular septal defect, degree of pulmonary stenosis and the degree to which the aorta overrides the septal defect.</p>

                        <p>Diagnosis is done through cardiac catheterization as well as by angiography Once the lesion has been identified it can be corrected surgically or by use of medication such as: Digoxin, morphine, prostaglanding infusion, diuretics, and use of supplementary oxygen Monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.</p>

                        <p>This results from failure of the soft or bony tissue of the palate and the upper jaw to unite during the fifth to tenth weeks gestation. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Factors associated with these conditions include: genetic factors, hypoxia, maternal viral infections and nutritional factors.</p>
                        <p>When only the lip is involved, surgery can be done within the first day of life. When the Palate is involved, the repair is usually postponed to 6 to 24 months. The infant should be fit nutritionally and free of infections, complications of this surgery include speech problems and respiratory tract infections.</p>

                        <p>It is a midline defect of vertebral discs without protrusion of spinal cord and meninges. This is a common malformation of the spinal column and is due to congenital lack of one or more vertebral discs, usually at the lower part of the spine.(usually involving L5 and S1) Patches of hair and discoloration of the skin in the midline of lower back signifies malformation of the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p>When the membranes covering the spinal cord bulge through the opening the condition is known as <strong>meningocele</strong> (a soft tumor filled with CSF fluid is formed). The tumor can be influenced by pressure. Surgical closure should be done as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration of the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p><strong>Myelomeningocele</strong>-both the spinal cord and the meninges herniate through the defect in the vertebral column. Most cases involve the lumbo-sacral region but may exist anywhere in the neural axis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Encephalocele</strong> - abnormality that affects the skull and result in protrusion of tissue through a bony midline defect called cranium bifida. The two forms are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>cranial meningocele</strong>-herniation of CSF filled meningocele sac through the cranium bifida.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cranial encephalocele</strong>- contains a sac plus cerebral cortex, Cerebellum and a portion of the brain stem herniating out.</li>

                        <h4>1. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
                        <p>Down syndrome can vary from child to child. Some of the most common characteristics are as follows:-</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Flat face,</li>
                           <li>Broad forehead,</li>
                           <li>Short neck,</li>
                           <li>Narrow slit to the eyes,</li>
                           <li>White spots in the iris of the eyes (known as Brushfield spots)</li>
                           <li>Small, abnormally shaped ears,</li>
                           <li>Small depression near the nose with a somewhat flattened bridge,</li>
                           <li>Small mouth,</li>
                           <li>Slightly protruding tongue(the tongue may be abnormally big),</li>
                           <li>Short arms and legs,</li>
                           <li>Short fingers and toes with the little fingers curving inwards,</li>
                           <li>a single horizontal, deep crease in the palms,</li>
                           <li>Large space between the first and second toe on each foot,</li>
                           <li>weak reflexes,</li>
                           <li>muscle hypotonia</li>
                           <li>hyperflexibility of joints</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most individuals with Down syndrome have mild (IQ: 50-70) or moderate (IQ: 35-50) Intellectual disability with some cases having severe (IQ: 20-35) difficulties.</li>
                            <li>Slow rate of learning and information processing</li>
                            <li>They also have trouble expressing what they have learned or understood via the conventional outlets of speech and writing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ASSOCIATED MEDICAL CONDITIONS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Congenital heart defects</strong>- Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gastrointestinal disorders</strong>- including the anatomical abnormalities such as imperforate anus, and functional disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux, and malabsorption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respiratory problems</strong> such as frequent cold, cough and flu.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin problems</strong> -Infants with Down syndrome have very soft skin. As they grow older, their skin becomes coarse and dry. Atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema is the main skin problem found in children with Down syndrome.</li>
                            <li>They may suffer from epilepsy, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and a shortage of growth hormones.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management and Nursing Care</h3>
                        <p><strong>Physical Therapy:</strong> focuses on motor development. Since most children with Down syndrome have hypotonia or low muscle tone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Early intervention</strong> is a program of therapies, exercises and activities designed to specifically help children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.</p>
                        <p>Encourage use of other means of expressions such as pictures, colors, sounds, or any other media, to express themselves, for those babies who cant express themselves convectionally on what they have learnt or understood.</p>
                        <p><strong>Surgical Treatments:</strong> Incases of congenital heart defects and intestinal defects</p>
                        <p><strong>Medications:</strong> Depending on the presenting problem in downs syndrome ie anticonvulsants etc</p>
