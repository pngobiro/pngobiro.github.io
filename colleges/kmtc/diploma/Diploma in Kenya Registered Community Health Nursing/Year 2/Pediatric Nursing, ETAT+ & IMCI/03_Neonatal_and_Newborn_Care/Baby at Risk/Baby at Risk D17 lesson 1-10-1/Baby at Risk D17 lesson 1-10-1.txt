NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE NEWBORN

On leaving the intrauterine environment, the baby's basic needs are to:
establish respiration and subsequently adequate nutrition
maintain normal body temperature
avoid contact with infection.

\section*{NEWBORN REFLEXES}

Moro Reflex - Support the child with your hand and forearm. Then gently but swiftly, tilt the child backwards. In normal circumstances, the child should outstretch their arms (and legs). This is a positive moro reflex.
Rooting reflex - when you gently touch next to the baby's mouth, the baby will turn their head and try to suckle.

Grasp reflex - place your finger in the baby's palm. The baby should grasp with a firm grip
Stepping reflex - holding upright above the bed, and then gently brush the bed against the baby's feet / shins. The baby should step. They may also be able to support some of their own weight.
Others???
a. To continue assessment of the newborn throughout hospital stay:
(1) Observe and record the infant's vital signs.
(2) Monitor weight loss or gain
(3) Monitor bowel and bladder function.
(4) Monitor activity and sleep patterns.
(5) Monitor interactions and bonding with parents.
b. To provide safeguards against infection.
c. To initiate feedings.
d. To provide guidance and health instruction to parents.
- Resuscitate and maintain an airway
${ }^{1}$ Keep the newborn warm and avoid unnecessary hypothermia or cold stress
4) Encourage early breast feeding, and feed high-risk newborns more frequently
ยน Maintain hygiene during delivery and cord cutting; treat infections promptly
9) Ensure the newborn infant stays close to its mother, and mothers have open access to their newborn infant if he or she requires special care

\section*{IMMEDIATE CARE AND ASSESSMENT}

Observe infection prevention practices Deliver baby onto the mother's abdomen Dry the baby and keep warm Assess baby's breathing, skin color and tone
Wipe eyes
Clamp, tie and cut umbilical cord at 2 and 5 cm from the abdomen
Initiate breastfeeding within one hour

\section*{APGAR}

\section*{RESUSCITATION OF THE NEWBORN}

Resuscitation is an emergency measure taken to sustain life or to revive when life has just ceased. The aim is to establish the heart and lung function following cardiopulmonary arrest.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Preparation
Check and arrange equipment/supplies at all times (use equipment checklist) as follows:
- A firm stable surface
- Source of heat e.g. heater, heater lamp or resuscitaire
- Adequate lighting
- Source of oxygen, flow meter, tubing and key
- Suction equipment i.e. suction machine, suction catheters sizes F6, 8, 10
- Ambu bag (500mls)
- Face masks sizes 0 and 1, preferably round
- Wall clock
- At least two pieces of warm dry linen
- Syringes and needles/swabs, (preferably $1 \mathrm{ml}, 2 \mathrm{ml}$ and 10 mls )
- Stethoscope
- Artificial Airways
- Nasal prongs
- Nasogastric tubes
- Scissors and tape

\section*{THE DRUG TRAY}
should contain the following :
Sodium bicarbonate 8.4\% or 7.5\% for correction of metabolic acidosis.
Fifty percent dextrose for correction of hypoglacemia (survival of the newborn infant correlates with glycogen stores).
Adrenaline if the heart rate is falling after several minutes of vigorous resuscitative efforts; it may be given directly by cardiac puncture and then external cardiac massage started. This drug is also a vaso-dilator.

Aminophylline in small doses is given to aid in respiration if distress is present ( $3 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{body}$ weight intravenously). This drug is a vaso-dilator and also stimulates the respiratory centre.
Calcium gluconate can be administered intravenously and slowly to a baby who displays tetany due to calcium deficiency. It is also a cardiac muscle stabliliser.
Source of oxygen to be administered after clearing the airway.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF RESUSCITATION}

ABCDO of resuscitation:
Airway should be cleared either by suction or positioning the infant.
(1)

Breathing, that is, establish respiration if not breathing.
Circulation should be noted through pulse, color of mucus membrane and heart beat. Start cardiac massage if there is no heart beat or pulse.
Drugs
Observations to make a diagnosis.

\section*{NEONATAL RESUSCITATION PROCEDURE}

Temperature:
Dry the baby, remove wet clothing and wrap baby in dry warm clothes. At the same time observe the baby's breathing, color and activity
Place the baby on a firm warm surface or under a radiant heat warmer

Position baby's head in a neutral position (slightly extended position) to open airway.
Open airway
Suction -If there is meconium stained fluid and baby is not crying and moving limbs (Do not suck for more than 3 seconds)
- Suck only what you can see
- Suck the mouth and then the nose
- Suck only while withdrawing the catheter
Place mask to cover chin, mouth and nose
Form a seal
Squeeze bag attached to the mask with two fingers or whole hand about 30 to 50 times per minute
Watch chest for movement, do not over inflate, allow baby to breathe out. If chest is not rising:
- Reposition the head
- Check mask seal
- Squeeze bag harder
Start ventilation immediately using room air (bag and mask). If the baby does not improve then use oxygen

Pull the jaw forward towards the mask with the third finger of the hand holding the mask. Do not hyperextend the neck.

\section*{Circulation}

Assess and count heart rate.

\section*{Chest compression}

Using two fingers method, or thumb method compress the chest ( 1 cm below the line connecting the nipples and the sternum) pushing down 1.5 cm .
Give 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths per minute (3 compressions for every breath).

\section*{OVERVIEW}
- Respiratory distress syndrome

Asphyxia neonatorum

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}
Explain the science behind RDS
Be able to identify who is at risk of RDS
State the signs of increased work of breathing
Outline other causes of respiratory distress in a new born baby
Discuss management of a baby with RDS

\section*{RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME}

Also called the hyaline membrane disease This is a developmental disease of the preterm infant.
pathophysiology - in RDS the alveolar and the ducts are filled with a sticky exudate, a hyaline material that prevents aeration.

This could be due to lack of surfactant that reduces alveolar ventilation and promotes atelectasis.
Reduction in alveolar surfactant may occur due to:-
Immature cells lining the alveoli
Decreased rates of production due to early neonatal stress
Inadequate release of surfactant from the alveolar cells
Death of cells producing surfactants.

\section*{SIGNS OF RDS.}
Increased work of breathing
Grunting
Respiratory rate >60
Cyanosis/low saturations
Recession: subcostal, intercostal, sternal
Head bobbing
Nostrils flaring
Apneas
Symptoms typically worsen over first 48-72h
Investigations:
Full hemogram / full blood count
Blood culture
Blood sugar
X-ray where possible

\section*{TREATMENT}
Oxygen
Intubation and ventilation
Surfactant administration directly to the lungs
Feeding support with NG feeds or IV fluids
Antibiotics (incase respiratory distress due to infection)

\section*{NURSING CARE}
Administer oxygen using the appropriate delivery method
If secretions are present use suction for brief periods using intermittent pressures
Weigh the infant daily and monitor laboratory values as ordered
For IV lines change tubing every 24 hrs
Provide adequate calories per kg body weight
Prepare to administer surfactant replacement therapy (instilled into the endotracheal tube).

\section*{NURSING CARE CONT...}
Provide nutrition
Support bonding
Provide realistic information to the parents
Observe and report any signs of complications

\section*{PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO RDS.}
Prevent preterm labour if possible
Give dexamethasone to the mother at least 48 hours before delivery
Prevention of hypothermia at birth
Prevention of perinatal asphyxia
Adequate resuscitation

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Respiratory pneumothorax ,bronchopulmonary dysplasia
C.V.S - hypotension, PDA,
CNS - cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, renal failure

\section*{BIRTH ASPHYXIA}

Asphyxia means lack of oxygen
Means that baby's organs don't get enough oxygen before, during or right after birth

\section*{WHERE CAN THE BABY SUFFER FROM ASPHYXIA?}

In Utero
During Delivery
After Birth

\section*{CAUSES OF ASPHYXIA}

Decreased placental flow e.g. cord prolapse
Decreased placental gas exchange e.g. placental abruption, uterine rupture and placenta previa.
Decreased placental perfusion
Maternal hypoxia e.g. maternal seizure
Inadequate postnatal cardiopulmonary circulation e.g. blocked airway
Poor APGAR SCORE mostly indicates asphyxia and the infant goes into apnea.
Poor placenta function that may occur with high blood pressure or in post-term pregnancies.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS}
Before delivery, symptoms may include:
Abnormal heart rate or rhythm
An increased acid level in a baby's blood
At birth, symptoms may include:
Bluish or pale skin color
Low heart rate
Weak muscle tone and reflexes
Weak cry
Gasping or weak breathing
Meconium - the first stool passed by the baby - in the amniotic fluid, which can block small airways and interfere with breathing

\section*{ORGANS}
Brain - Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy
Kidneys - Poor urine output, Drugs e.g.. Gentamycin can have decreased clearance
Liver - clotting problems
Cardiac - impaired function
Bowel ischemia

\section*{EXAMINATION}
Poor breathing effort
Prolonged bleeding
Poor urine output
Neurological signs - depends on severity:
Tone - Increased (stiff) or decreased (floppy)
Level of consciousness - hyperalert , lethargic
Reflexes
Seizures
Poor suck and difficulty feeding
Lack of gag reflex

\section*{TREATMENT}

Immediate management:
1.Establish effective ventilation
2.Assist circulation if necessary

Early management:
1. Restrict fluids by $20 \%$ for first two days
2. Monitor blood pressure and treat hypotension vigorously
3.Assess respiratory effort and
(A)ventilate if baby breathing spontaneously with arterial carbon dioxide tension >7
(b)if baby ventilated maintain arterial carbon tension at 4.5
4.If clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure give Mannitol 1g/kg over 20minutes and repeat if necessary every 4-6hours
Anticonvulsants

ASPHYXIA NEONATORUM

\section*{OVERVIEW}

Definition
Pathophysiology
Types of asphyxia
Signs and symptoms
Predisposing factors

\section*{DEFINITION}

\section*{[}
$\square$
Defined as the impaired respiratory gas exchange accompanied by the development of acidosis
According to WHO, it is as a failure to initiate breathing at birth

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
1. Anaerobic metabolism
2. Profound metabolic acidosis
3. Persistence of apgar score of 0 to 3 beyond 5 minutes
4. Clinical neurologic sequelae caused by Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)
5. Multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period

\section*{TYPES OF ASPHYXIA}

The degree of asphyxia is determined by apgar score.
An apgar score between 8-10 does not show asphyxia
There are three types:
1. Mild asphyxia apgar score: 6-7 (at 5 minutes). It requires clearing of airway and application of external stimuli to initiate breathing.
2. Moderate asphyxia: apgar score 4-5. it requires rescuscitation, administration of oxygen, and drugs to initiate breathing
3. Severe asphyxia: apgar score 0-3. requires intensive resuscitative measures and intubation to survive

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Apnea
- Bradycardia
- Altered respiratory patterns (grunting,

Gasping)
- Cyanosis
- Pallor
- Hypotonia

Unresponsiveness
1. Mild and moderate asphyxia Apex beat (pulse) 100 / min or less Skin color is pink with blue extremities Response to stimuli may be present Cry may be weak or strong Makes effort to breathe and may gasp with irregular respiration
2. Severe asphyxia

No attempt to breathe and may gasp periodically
It does not cry
Entire body skin is blue i.e. cyanosed
No response to stimuli
Pulse rate very low or absent
Poor muscle tone

\section*{PREDISPOSING FACTORS}

Depression of the central nervous system of the fetus is the most common basic cause for failure to breathe at birth. However there are also maternal and fetal factors
Maternal causes:
Medical conditions e.g. chronic hypertension
Antenatal conditions e.g. abnormal uterine contractions, antepartum hemorrhage, prolapsed cord, malpositions etc.
Drug abuse
Fetal causes:
Multiple pregnancies,
Big baby with C.P.D
Fetal anomalies e.g. anomalies of the lungs

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT}
1. Clear the airway as soon as the baby is born
2. Nurse the baby in an incubator for at least 48 hours to keep it warm at body temperature
3. Resuscitation may be needed to promote ventilation and ensure effective circulation to prevent acidosis, hypoglycemia and intracranial hemorrhage
4. Do suctioning whenever necessary
5. Closely observe the baby for skin color, TPR
6. Administer oxygen by mask, ambu bag or nasal catheter whenever there is an apneic attack.
7. Give iv fluids for rehydration
8. Aspirate mucus to unblock the airway or may intubate the baby
9. Give fluids with electrolytes to maintain fluid electrolyte balance
10. If the mother was given narcotics during labor, administer its antidote, naloxone, through the umbilical vein
11. Give anticonvulsants to control convulsions if present
12. Maintain accurate input output charts to prevent overhydration or underhydration
13. When the baby is stable, pass NG tube and start feeding
14. Observe aseptic technique to prevent cross infection
15. Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically

\section*{Drug administration}

\section*{Sodium bicarbonate $1-2 \mathrm{mls}$ to combat acidosis}
d.

Vitamin K 0.5-1 mg i.m to prevent hemorrhagic disorders
Aminophylline to improve respiration
Calcium gluconate to strengthen heart muscles
Administer broad spectrum antibiotics prophylactically

\section*{PREVENTION OF ASPHYXIA}

Proper screening of mothers to detect those at risk and advise on delivery in the hospital for proper management Pelvic assessment should be done at 36 weeks to rule out CPD
Proper management of maternal diseases in pregnancy

Drugs that depress respiratory centre e.g. sedatives, General anesthesia and narcotics should be avoided in late first stage.
Early detection and management of fetal distress
Clearing baby's airway as soon as the head is born
Avoiding instrumental deliveries but rather prepare for c/s

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Renal abnormalities (50\%), e.g. azotemia, elevated creatinine levels, acute tubular necrosis
Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
Brain damage
Cardiac arrest
Respiratory distress syndrome
Respiratory acidosis

THE PREMATURE INFANT (PRETERM)

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

A preterm infant is a baby born before the 37th completed week of gestation.
This is most often due to the early over distension of the uterus, which leads to the fetus being born prematurely.
Premature births also occur more frequently in low socio economic and illiterate groups in the population, largely as a result of the poor nutritional intake of the pregnant mother.
Additionally, they tend to be more common when there is concurrent maternal metabolic or systemic disease, for example, hypertension and Diabetes.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF PRETERM}
WHO Classification is based on gestational age:
Extremely preterm ( < 28 weeks)
Very preterm ( 28 to < 32 weeks)
Moderate to late preterm (32 to <37 weeks)

\section*{PREDISPOSING FACTORS TO PREMATURITY}

\section*{Fetal factors}

Polyhydramnios which causes over distension
Congenital malformation of the fetus
Rhesus incompatibility interfering with fetal viability.
Multiple births (twins or more), which causes early distension of the uterus hence early birth

\section*{Maternal factors}

Hypertension associated with the pregnancy leading to early induction of labor, for example, preeclampsia and eclampsia
Premature rupture of membranes due to physical or psychological stress

Chronic infections or diseases in the mother, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, chronic nephritis, cardiac disease, diabetes and thyroid disease, may lead to premature labor
Acute infections in the mother, like pneumonia, influenza, rheumatic fever and malaria could induce premature labor
Strenuous exercise, excessive drinking of alcohol, smoking

Physical stress caused by non obstetric surgery may lead to premature labor if the mother has this procedure while pregnant Habitual abortion owing to incompetent cervical OS or uterine malformation Placental factors

Antepartum hemorrhage due to placentae praevia and placenta abruptio

\section*{PREVENTION OF PREMATURE BIRTH}
1. Early and continued prenatal care with stress on dietary and general hygiene education to the expectant mother.
This will also ensure immediate treatment of those complications of pregnancy likely to cause, or be associated with, premature labor.

\section*{PREVENTION CONT...}
2. postpone or inhibit uterine contractions in some cases of premature labor through the use of certain pharmaceutical agents such as:
Those that act by preventing the release or synthesis of a known uterine stimulant, for example, prostaglandin inhibitors e.g. . non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like aspirin, indomethacin, diclofenac
Those that act by the direct effect on the myometrial cells, for example, beta adrenergic receptor stimulants like retodrine, fenoterol, salbutamol

\section*{PREVENTION CONT...}
3. Prolonged bed rest should be encouraged, especially where the mother has any of the conditions that predispose to preterm labor
4. Use of sedatives during preterm labor to ensure complete bed rest
5. Avoidance of strenuous exercise and calming the mother, because any strain or stress may aggravate preterm labor

\section*{PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN PREMATURE INFANTS}

\section*{General:}
the baby may appear pink or dark red, hands and feet may be cyanosed and may be jaundiced early.
Posture: flattened, abducted hips, flexed knees
Swallowing and sucking reflexes absent or weak

\section*{Skin and Appendages}

The skin is covered by a small amount of vernix caseosa.
Lanugo is present on the sides of the face and on the extremities and the back.
There is scanty hair on the head and the eyebrows are usually absent.

The nipples and areola are inconspicuous. The nails are soft.
Generalized edema is apparent at birth and later the tissue fluid decreases, leaving the skin loose and wrinkled.
Blood vessels can be easily seen under the skin because subcutaneous tissue is thin.
Head

Ear pinna: flat, soft and fold easily on pressure and uncoil slowly
Eyes are closed most of the time
Weak cry and there is no tears produce

Neck and Thorax
The thorax is cone shaped
sternal retraction,
a rapid heart rate and respiratory noises.
Occasionally, cardiac murmurs are heard.
A change in position may cause periods of apnea.

Abdomen
Size: prominent, large liver and spleen
Umbilicus: appears lower in the abdomen

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Sedatives of opium derivatives should not be used during premature labor
Shorten the duration of second stage by performing an episiotomy. As this will reduce the possibility of intracranial injury
Clear the airway using a fine mucus extractor/catheter
Administer oxygen at 1 litre per minute till respiration is well established and color is satisfactory

Put the infant in an incubator or cover with warm towels and transfer to a special baby care unit as soon as practicable
Once immediate steps have been taken to ensure the well being of the premature infant, further management aims at:
- Maintenance of respiration
- Provision of warmth
- Prevention of infection
${ }^{-}$Ensuring good progress and growth
- Promotion of parent-infant attachment

Ensuring baby gets adequate nutrition

If the baby cant tolerate feeds give iv fluids e.g. 10\% dextrose
Give nutritional supplements e.g. iron, folic acids, calcimax, multivitamin from 2 weeks, vitamin D at 1 month.
Take weight on alternative days to monitor their progress
Introduce cup feeding gradually as the baby gains weight

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF PREMATURITY}
Cyanotic attacks
Cerebral hemorrhage
Heart failure and pulmonary edema
Jaundice
Anemia
Infection
Poor mental and intellectual development in later years
Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Asphyxia
- Rickets

DISORDER OF GESTATION AGE AND BIRTH WEIGHT

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the lesson the learner should be able to:
Define SGA and light for dates infants List the characteristics of SGA infants State the factors that affect fetal growth/causes
State the differentiation between SGA and a preterm infant

Intra uterine growth standards are used to compare an infant's weight and gestational age with population averages
Height may however be affected by sex, age, parity etc
Weight serves to assess growth while gestational age assesses maturity
The fetal growth chart presents average fetal weights for the $10^{\text {th }}, 25^{\text {th }}, 50^{\text {th }}$ and $75^{\text {th }}$ percentiles

An infant born at 40 weeks gestation and weighing less 2500 g would be mature but undergrown (intra-uterine growth retardation). This is classified as small for gestational age. An infant born at 36 weeks but weighing 3600 g (above $90^{\text {th }}$ percentile) would be immature but overgrown (large for gestational age)
Premature infants are those born before 37 weeks gestation. An infant weighing 2500 g or less is of low birth weight while infants weighing 1500 g or less are of very low birth weight.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING FETAL GROWTH}
1. Maternal factors - maternal nutritional factors will lead to low weight gain during pregnancy Women who are malnourished during pregnancy due to poverty, adolescence, women with frequent pregnancies are likely to deliver low birth weight babies
pregnancy induced hypertension poses a threat to fetal growth since it decreases intra uterine blood flow advanced maternal diabetes and the accompanying vascular insufficiency promote intra uterine growth retardation

Substance abuse - e.g. cigarette smoking has been correlated with decreased fetal growth. Birth weight is decreased on the average of 170 g as a result of 10 cigarettes smoked per day
Extremes of maternal age
2.Placental influences

Under normal circumstances the size of the placenta determines fetal size. When there is severe nutritional deprivation the maintenance needs of the placenta are met first leading to reduction in fetal growth. The diffussional capacity of the placenta increases with fetal growth. Any impairment of oxygen and nutrients transfer affects fetal.
3.fetal endocrine influences -????

\section*{SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE}

A term used to describe a baby who is smaller than the usual size for the number of weeks of pregnancy; considering parameters such as length head circumference

\section*{assesment of sga infants}

Neurological criteria tend to be more accurate than physical criteria since most of the physical characteristics tend to be abnormal.

\section*{LIGHT FOR DATES BABY}

A baby whose birth weight is below the 10th percentile for its estimated gestational age. One third of low birth weight babies are light for dates Both conditions reflect intrauterine malnutrition and growth retardation of the fetus.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

There is no significant difference in management from that described for the normal infant except that the small for gestational age or light for dates infant would be more susceptible to hypothermia.
Babies <2kg should be given incubator care if not on skin to skin care
Initiate early feeding to prevent hypoglycemia using cup
Labworks, I/O,
Facilitate bonding
Infection prevention
Health education and support to parents and caregivers

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF SGA}
Asphyxia
Respiratory distress syndrome (rare)
Hypoglycemia
Hypothermia
There is a high mortality risk

\section*{COMPARISON BTN PRETERMS AND SGAS}

NEONATALJAUNDICE

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

Define jaundice
Differentiate between physiological and pathological jaundice describe the management of jaundice Discuss nursing management of a baby on phototherapy
Describe exchange transfusion Discuss the two main types of blood incompatibilities

\section*{DEFINITION}

Neonatal jaundice is the yellowish discoloration of the skin and/or sclera of newborn infants caused by tissue deposition of bilirubin.

There is Excessive levels and accumulation of bilirubin in blood
- Normal levels are $0.2-1.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.
- Normally manifests when the bilirubin levels are more than $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism}

When RBCs are broken down by haemolysis, they produce haeme and globulin.
The haem part produces bilirubin,carbon monoxide and iron ( via biliverdin which is green)
Unconjugated(indirect) bilirubin is fat soluble hence has to be converted to water soluble form(conjugated/direct bilirubin) for it to be excreted .
Bilirubin is transported to the liver by binding to a protein(albumin)

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

On arrival to the liver , bilirubin detaches itself from albumin
Conjugation of bilirubin occurs in the liver
Conjugation is done by glucuronyl
transferase in which bilirubin is added to glucuronic acid to become bilirubin diglucuronide that is water soluble
Excretion of the bilirubin is done through the biliary system into the intestines

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

While in the intestines bilirubin is converted to stercobilinogen by the gut normal flora and excreted in stool Some of it is absorbed in the gut and becomes urobilinogen which is excreted in urine.
If conjugation is interfered with there will be accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin leading to hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice

\section*{Bilirubin metabolism cont...}

This bilirubin may cross the blood brain barrier and cause brain damage leading to a condition known as kernicterus (characterized by hypertonicity, seizures,lethargy,stiff neck with hyper extended head)

\section*{PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

> Characteristics:
> Affects both term and preterm babies
> It appears between $\mathbf{2 4}$ to $\mathbf{7 2}$ hours of life. It is apparent with signs on Day 3 of birth.
> It is self limiting in term babies and fades away within 7 days.
> the levels of bilirubin in term babies don't exceed $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{CAUSES OF PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}
1. Excessive breakdown of RBCs

While in the uterus the fetus relies on fetal hemoglobin which has a greater affinity for oxygen, than the adult Hb
Once the neonate is born it adapts to the pulmonary system of adult Hb and the large mass of RBCS being hemolyzed creates a bulk of bilirubin in the circulation.
2. Glucuronyl transferase enzyme deficiency Enzyme responsible for conjugation of bilirubin. Deficiency of this enzyme results in increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin.
3. Increased enterohepatic reabsorption of bilirubin
Increases in newborns, because of lack of the normal enteric bacteria that breaks down bilirubin to urobilinogen/ stercobilinogen
Increased beta glucuronidase enzyme(hydrolyses bilirubin back to unconjugated bilirubin state). Accelerated by lack of feeding
4. Decreased albumin binding capacity: albumin binds to unconjugated bilirubin and transports to liver for conjugation. In preterm babies, the albumin is in lower levels, hence bilirubin will bind to tissues with bilirubin affinity such as the skin and brain

\section*{PATHOLOGICALJAUNDICE}

Clinical jaundice detected before $\mathbf{2 4}$ hours of life.
Characterized by rapid rise in serum bilirubin ( $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ ) per day
Serum bilirubin greater than $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
Clinical jaundice persisting beyond 14 days of life
Clay or white colored stool and/dark urine staining the clothes yellow

\section*{CAUSES OF PATHOLOGICALJAUNDICE}
1. Increased production of bilirubin: due to increase in hemoglobin destruction
Causes of destruction:

> Blood type/group incompatibility Hemoglobinopathies- sickle cell disease Enzyme deficiency -G6PD (maintains the integrity of the cell membrane) Sepsis/ infections Polycythemia
2. Interference with transportation due to:
reduced albumin
acidosis, hypothermia
hypoxia,
drugs that compete for albumin binding sites e.g. aspirin/ ampicillin
3. Conjugation interference:

Immaturity of enzyme systems.
Lack of/ inadequate glucuronyl transferase enzyme.

\section*{4. Excretion:}
bilirubin excretion is interfered with e.g.:
Hepatic obstruction due to anomalies (extrahepatic biliary atresia)
Infection i.e. neonatal hepatitis can cause an excess of unconjugated bilirubin

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

Admit the baby in the newborn unit and assess the general condition
Start early and frequent feeds (breast-feeding) for glucose provision to the liver cells, and also to encourage bowel colonization with normal flora; important for formation of stercobilinogen for excretion in stool
Closely monitor serum bilirubin levels at 12-24 hour interval
If the bilirubin takes long to clear, phototherapy may be necessary

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF PATHOLOGICAL JAUNDICE}

Assessment of the newborn to determine the degree of jaundice
To determine the cause of jaundice
On physical examination, check for:
Skin color and sclera color
Signs of lethargy, stiff neck, hyperextended neck, seizures, (signs of kernicterus)
Presence of dehydration or starvation
Light stool or dark urine

\title{
TREATMENT MODALITIES FOR PATHOLOGICAL JAUNDICE
}

Phototherapy
Exchange transfusion

High intensity light at a given wave length (white to blue) administered in order to convert unconjugated bilirubin to conjugated bilirubin, which is excreted through stool/urine.

\section*{NURSING CARE OF THE BABY ON PHOTOTHERAPY}

Clean the skin with warm water, avoid using creams and lotions on the skin of the baby Expose the whole body to ensure there is increased surface area of skin to light. Keep turning the baby 2 hourly to expose all parts to the light and monitor for rashes or dryness.
Top-tail the baby for hygiene and change linens frequently

Observe the skin color to monitor the progress. Monitor the temperature to prevent hyperthermia Cover the eyes with an eye pad to prevent retinal damage from the light. Uncover during breastfeeding to ensure eye contact
For continuous phototherapy, give extra fluids for every ill neonate or dehydrate babies.
Monitor neurological status of the newborn e.g. the sleep/wake patterns
Explain and reassure the family

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS OF PHOTOTHERAPY}
Hyperthermia leading to fluid loss and dehydration
Retinal damage due to high intensity lights
Skin rashes and skin burns
Visual deprivation and isolation

\section*{EXCHANGE TRANSFUSION}

The treatment in which the baby's blood is gradually removed and replaced by donor blood.
Done when bilirubin levels are toxic (23-29)
Indications:
Infants with a hemolytic disease
Preterm babies less than 1500 g
Healthy term babies with bilirubin levels of 23 to 29
Complications:
Circulatory collapse
Incompatibility reactions
Acquired infections
Blood clots

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF JAUNDICE}

Retinal damage due to light used in phototherapy
Anemia due to increased RBC haemolysis
Hyperthermia associated with phototherapy
Hypocalcemia due to increased metabolism
Kernicterus when bilirubin crosses BBB causing brain damage.

HEMOLYTIC JAUNDICE

\section*{OVERVIEW}

Types of incompatibility
Prevention
Nursing management

\section*{TYPES OF INCOMPATIBILITY}
- Rhesus incompatibility
- ABO incompatibility

\section*{RHD INCOMPATIBILITY}

Also referred to as hemolytic disease of the newborn
The Rhesus complex (The D antigen) is an antigen found in the red blood cells of about 83\% of the population.
Problems arise if a Rhesus negative mother and a Rhesus positive father have a child who inherits the Rhesus positive traits of the father.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Rhesus incompatibility}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-133.jpg?height=1423&width=1577&top_left_y=274&top_left_x=385}
\end{figure}

The placenta usually acts as a barrier to fetal blood entering the maternal circulation.
However, during pregnancy or birth, fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) can occur
The woman's immune system reacts by producing anti-D antibodies that cause sensitization.
In subsequent pregnancies these maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal erythrocytes.

This hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn caused by Rh isoimmunization can sometimes occur during the first pregnancy
Sensitization during the first pregnancy or birth leads to extensive destruction of fetal red blood cells during subsequent pregnancies
Rh isoimmunization can result from any procedure or incident where maternal blood leaks across the placenta or from the transfusion of Rh positive blood to the woman

\section*{CELL DESTRUCTION}

Cells are destroyed, causing anemia and excess bilirubin in the blood of the baby. The baby will consequently be born with jaundice, which is normally seen 12-24 hours after delivery.

NB: Sometimes the neonate may not appear jaundiced, but the amniotic fluid will be golden and the cord is yellow.

\section*{PREVENTION OF RHD ISOIMMUNIZATION}

Anti D Ig:
Prevention is by administration of anti D immunoglobulin to mothers with non sensitized negative blood type who have a baby with Rh positive blood type within 72 hours of birth or any other sensitizing event

\section*{PROPHYLAXIS FOLLOWING OTHER SENSITIZING EVENTS}

Any threatened, complete or incomplete or missed abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy; if bleeding persists, anti-D should be given at 6 week intervals
Any spontaneous miscarriage before 12 weeks that requires surgical intervention to evacuate the uterus
Therapeutic termination of pregnancy by surgical or medical methods regardless of gestational age
Ectopic pregnancy

\section*{SENSITIZING EVENTS CONT.D}

Amniocentesis, cordocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling or any other invasive intrauterine procedure External cephalic version of the fetus Fetal death in utero or stillbirth Abdominal trauma and antepartum hemorrhage
Transfusion of Rh positive blood or platelets

\section*{ANTENATAL MANAGEMENT}

A mother who is Rhesus negative should be closely observed and at 26-28 weeks gestation; blood is taken for Coomb's test, which is repeated at 34-36 weeks.
Antibody titre is estimated. If it continues to rise, then labor is induced.
However, Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has the potential to maintain the fetus until intrauterine fetal transfusion can be performed. (possible in more developed countries).

\section*{ABO INCOMPATIBILITY}

ABO isoimmunization usually occurs when the mother is blood group O and the baby is blood group A. or less often group B.
Blood of types A and B has protein or antigen not present in type O blood.
Individuals with type O blood develop antibodies against $A$ and $B$
By the first pregnancy the individuals may already have high serum anti-A and anti-B antibody titers.

Some women produce IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta and attach to fetal red cells and destroy them
First and subsequent babies are at risk; however, the destruction is usually much less severe than with Rh incompatibility. ABO incompatibility is also thought to protect the fetus from Rh incompatibility as the mother's anti-A and anti-B antibodies destroy any fetal cells that leak into maternal circulation.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS.}
Hydrops fetalis due excessive RBC hemolysis (leading to anemia)It mainly presents as massive edema even to most organs and finally causes, multiple organ failure
Anemia.

INFANT OF A DIABETIC MOTHER

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Women with diabetes in pregnancy (Type 1, Type 2, and gestational) are all at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Adequate glycemic control before and during pregnancy is crucial to improving outcome
Diabetic mothers have a high incidence of polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and chronic hypertension;
Their fetal mortality rate, especially after 32 wks, is greater than that of non diabetic mothers.

Most infants born to diabetic mothers are large for gestational age.
If the diabetes is complicated by vascular disease, infants may be growth restricted, especially those born after 37 wk gestation
The neonatal mortality rate is over 5 times that of infants of non diabetic mothers and is higher at all gestational ages

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}

The probable pathogenic sequence is that maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia
The fetal pancreatic response leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia
Fetal hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia then cause increased hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, accelerated lipogenesis, and augmented protein synthesis

Hyperinsulinism and hyperglycemia produce fetal acidosis, which may result in an increased rate of stillbirth.
Separation of the placenta at birth suddenly interrupts glucose infusion into the neonate without a proportional effect on the hyperinsulinism
Hypoglycemia and attenuated lipolysis develop during the 1st hr after birth.

\section*{CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS}

They tend to be large and plump as a result of increased body fat and enlarged viscera, with puffy faces resembling that of patients who have been receiving corticosteroids

\section*{MANIFESTATIONS CONT...}

Hypoglycemia
- Tachypnea
- Cardiomegally

Increased incidence of: hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and renal vein thrombosis

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
frequent prenatal evaluation of all pregnant women with overt or gestational diabetes, by evaluation of fetal maturity
by planning the delivery of these infants in hospitals where expert obstetric and pediatric care is continuously available
Periconception glucose control reduces the risk of anomalies and other adverse outcomes, and glucose control during labor reduces the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia.

Regardless of size, all infants of diabetic mothers should initially receive intensive observation and care.
Asymptomatic infants should have a blood glucose determination within 1 hr of birth and then every hour for the next $6-8 \mathrm{hr}$;
if clinically well and normoglycemic, feeding with breast milk or formula should be started as soon as possible and continued at 3 hr intervals.

If any question arises about an infant's ability to tolerate oral feeding, the feeding should be discontinued and glucose given by peripheral intravenous infusion at a rate of $4-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ Bolus injections of hypertonic glucose should be avoided because they may cause further hyperinsulinemia and potentially produce rebound hypoglycemia

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Macrosomia
Hypoglycemia
Polycythemia
Respiratory distress syndrome
cardiac failure
cerebral edema from birth trauma
asphyxia

This condition can be categorized according to the site of origin of the hemorrhage (in some cases, intracranial hemorrhage may involve multiple compartments), as follows:

\section*{INTRO...}
1. Epidural hemorrhage indicates blood between the skull and outside of dura
2. Subdural hemorrhage denotes blood between the dura and the arachnoid mater
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to blood between the arachnoid and the pia mater
4. Intraventricular hemorrhage refers to blood within the ventricles
5. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage refers to blood within the brain itself

Nonvertex presentation (breech, face, etc.)
Very rapid or prolonged labor or delivery
Difficult instrumental delivery
Coagulation disorders (e.g excess fibrinolytic activity, platelet dysfunction)

\section*{CLINICAL PRESENTATION}

A mass can be noted within 4 hours of birth
Usually a clinically silent syndrome in preterms
Term newborns present with seizures, apnea, irritability, lethargy, vomiting, bulging fontanelle
Systemic signs like hypovolemia and anemia

\section*{MANAGEMENT IN PRETERMS}

Supportive care; watch for complications Maintaining normal BPs, electrolytes and blood gases

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
MRI/ Ct. scans
Serial homoglobin and hematocrit monitoring
Coagulation profile to investigate for presence of a coagulopathy
Bilirubin levels also need to be monitored

FRACTURES

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Most fractures noted at birth are caused by trauma at the time of delivery
II
When more than one fracture is present, one should suspect underlying bone disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta
Fractures associated with delivery are usually either midshaft fractures of the clavicle, humerus or femur or epiphiseal separations of the femur or humerus

\section*{FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE}

Fractures of the clavicle are often unrecognized
Occur in less than 1\% of newborns
Common during vertex delivery
Often of the "greenstick" type (bone bends but does not snap)
Occasionally, crepitations may be felt
An asymmetric moro reflex may be noted.
Does not require treatment; other than care in handling

\section*{FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS}

Epiphyseal separation of proximal humerus:
The fractured limb is limp
Can be confused with Erb palsy.
Midshaft humeral fructures:
Motion is at the center of the shaft.
There may be associated radial nerve paralysis and resultant wrist drop, which resolves
Splinting of the limb to the chest is sufficient

\section*{FRACTURES OF FEMUR}

With a fracture of the proximal femoral epiphysis, the injured extremity appears shorter.
Often associated with abnormal presentation, usually footling breech. Treatment consists of reduction and immobilization
early professional interventions should be sought as serious vascular problems can occur during the management of this fracture

NB:
Always rule out child abuse (battered child) in all types of trauma

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Neonatal tetanus a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborn babies Occurs in infants born without protective passive immunity because the mother is not immune.
Usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump
Estimated >270,000 deaths worldwide per year

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES OF NEONATAL TETANUS}

Overview:
Muscle rigidity
9) Irritability

Dysphagia
- Restlessness
- Facial grimacing
- Muscle spasms
${ }^{-}$Poor suck

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES (CONT.D)}
Usually symptoms begin 3-10 days after birth
Initial symptom is failure to suck and inability to open the mouth known as trismus or lockjaw
Spasm of the facial muscles immobilizes the jaw and produces a fixed sardonic grin called risus sardonicus

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES CONT.D}

Within 12-24 hours after the first symptom, generalized tonic muscular convulsions occur producing flexion and adduction o the arms, clenching of fists and extension of the lower extremities Initially spasms are mild but later become severe with spasms of the glottis and respiratory muscles

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES....}
Abdominal muscles become rigid and spasms of the muscles of the back may result to opisthotonus
Spasms may be precipitated by touch, noise or bright light
Baby remains conscious and alert

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF NEONATAL TETANUS}

The aims of treatment are:
1) Remove the source of the exotoxin
2) Neutralize the remaining circulating toxins
3) Provide supportive care until toxin is metabolized

\section*{Medical management:}

Washing and debridement of the infected site, and administration of antibiotics such as benzyl penicillin or metronidazole Anti-toxin:

Anti-tetanus serum

\section*{CARDIAC DEFECTS}

Cyanotic
Transposition of the great vessels
Pulmonary atresia
TOF
Tricuspid atresia

Acyanotic
Patent ductus arteriosus

Ventricular/atrial septal defect
Coarctation of the aorta
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

\section*{DEFECTS}

TRANSPOSITION OF THE GREAT VESSELS - c the aorta originates in the right ventricle rather than the left while the pulmonary artery originates from the left ventricle rather than the right.

\section*{ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT -a}

An abnormal opening between the right and left atria persists after birth with left to right shunting of blood. This may result from failure of the foramen ovale to close properly.

The vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta which is functional during fetal life persists after birth.
When it remains open the direction of blood flow is reversed because of higher pressure in the aorta shunting oxygenated from the aortic blood into the pulmonary vasculature (during foetal life the shunt is from the pulmonary artery to the aorta)

There is an abnormal left opening between the right and left ventricles. Shunting of blood between the right and left ventricle occurs during systole because of higher left ventricular pressure. If pulmonary resistance occurs the shunt is reversed and occurs right to left with resultant cyanosis.

There is a constriction of aorta causing narrowing of the lumen. This partially obstructs blood flow, creating increased left ventricular pressure and work load. The coarctation may occur before or after the ductus arteriosus
Four defects are combined in TOF. There is:
pulmonary stenosis,
ventricular septal defect,
overriding aorta and
hypertrophy of the right ventricle.
Severities of the symptoms depend on the size ventricular septal defect, degree of pulmonary stenosis and the degree to which the aorta overrides the septal defect.

Diagnosis is done through cardiac catheterization as well as by angiography Once the lesion has been identified it can be corrected surgically or by use of medication such as: Digoxin, morphine, prostaglanding infusion, diuretics, and use of supplementary oxygen Monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance.

Preparing the infant and assisting in diagnostic procedures
Provide small frequent feeds
Maintain input and output fluid records
Administering oxygen and monitoring blood gas status
Ensure safe administering of digoxin by checking dosage and route with another nurse
Monitor apical pulse and withhold digoxin if less than 90.

\section*{GASTROINTESTINAL MALFORMATIONS}

\section*{CLEFT LIP AND CLEFT PALATE}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-250.jpg?height=1254&width=1745&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=306)

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

This results from failure of the soft or bony tissue of the palate and the upper jaw to unite during the fifth to tenth weeks gestation. It may be unilateral or bilateral. Factors associated with these conditions include: genetic factors, hypoxia, maternal viral infections and nutritional factors.

When only the lip is involved, surgery can be done within the first day of life. When the Palate is involved, the repair is usually postponed to 6 to 24 months. The infant should be fit nutritionally and free of infections, complications of this surgery include speech problems and respiratory tract infections.

Reassure the parents and ensure that the surgical team meets with the parents to explain the procedure.
Using a feeding bottle would be appropriate as sucking of the nipple strengthens the muscles.
Place the infant in an upright position and direct the flow of milk against the side of the mouth to decrease the possibility of chocking.
Mother needs to be told that feeding is important to ensure adequate growth until surgery can be performed

Thickened formulas are often used. Show mother how to feed the baby with breast milk
Note that babies with minor clefts can breastfeed
However those with bilateral clefts must be fed by cup and spoon
Take care to prevent aspiration

Cleft lip repair- position the child on one side to avoid injury to the incision site
After feeding cleanse the suture line with a cotton tipped swab dipped in normal saline. Administer antibiotics as prescribed.
Cleft palate repair- Infant can be positioned on the abdomen.
Feedings are resumed by bottle, breast or cup.
Encourage parents to hold the infant.

\section*{OTHERS INCLUDE:}

Gastroschisis
Ompholocele
Atresias- Esophageal and rectal
Hirchsprung's disease

\section*{CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM ABNORMALITIES}

SPINA BIFIDA
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-258.jpg?height=1429&width=2068&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=197)

It is a midline defect of vertebral discs without protrusion of spinal cord and meninges.
This is a common malformation of the spinal column and is due to congenital lack of one or more vertebral discs, usually at the lower part of the spine.(usually involving L5 and S1)
Patches of hair and discoloration of the skin in the midline of lower back signifies malformation of the spinal cord.
When the membranes covering the spinal cord bulge through the opening the condition is known as meningocele (a soft tumor filled with CSF fluid is formed). The tumor can be influenced by pressure.
Surgical closure should be done as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration of the spinal cord

Myelomeningocele-both the spinal cord and the meninges herniate through the defect in the vertebral column. Most cases involve the lumbo-sacral region but may exist anywhere in the neural axis.
Encephalocele - abnormality that affects the skull and result in protrusion of tissue through a bony midline defect called cranium bifida.
The two forms are:
cranial meningocele-herniation of CSF filled meningocele sac through the cranium bifida.
Cranial encephalocele- contains a sac plus cerebral cortex, Cerebellum and a portion of the brain stem herniating out.

\section*{AETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS}

Genetic determinants
Malnutrition- folic acid deficiency
Drugs e.g. anticonvulsants
Radiation

Ensure the infant is nursed in a prone position
Ensure the area remains clean and free from contamination by urine or feces.
Ensure infection prevention to the defect site
Provide support to the parents.
${ }^{4}$ If the defect is not covered by skin:
- Cover with sterile gauze soaked in sterile normal saline
- Keep gauze moist at all times and ensure that the baby is kept warm
- If ruptured give Benzyl Penicillin 50,000units/kg 12 hrly and Gentamycin $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily for 5 days

Also known as club foot, a general term used to describe a range of unusual positions of the foot.
Each of the following characteristics may be present, and each may vary from mild to severe:
The foot (especially the heel) is usually smaller than normal.
The foot may point downward.
The front of the foot may be rotated toward the other foot.
The foot may turn in, and in extreme cases, the bottom of the foot can point up.

\section*{RISK FACTORS}
Previous history
Multiple pregnancy
Macrosomic fetus
Oligohydramnios
More common in boys than girls
May be unilateral or bilateral
Apply plaster of Paris
Revise every 1-2 weeks
Refer if no response after 3 months
Talipes calcaneovalgus- foot is dorsiflexed and everted.

\section*{DOWNS SYNDROME}

Also known as trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. A child with trisomy 21 has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two copies in all of his or her cells.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS \\ 1.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS}

Down syndrome can vary from child to child.
Some of the most common characteristics are as follows:-

Flat face,
Broad forehead,
Short neck,
Narrow slit to the eyes,
White spots in the iris of the eyes (known as Brushfield spots)
Small, abnormally shaped ears,
Small depression near the nose with a somewhat flattened bridge,
Small mouth,

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS CONT.}
4. Slightly protruding tongue(the tongue may be abnormally big),
4. Short arms and legs,
${ }^{0}$ Short fingers and toes with the little fingers curving inwards,
a single horizontal, deep crease in the palms,
) Large space between the first and second toe on each foot,
weak reflexes,
- muscle hypotonia
hyperflexibility of joints

\section*{2.MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS}

Most individuals with Down syndrome have mild (IQ: 50-70) or moderate (IQ: 35-50) Intellectual disability with some cases having severe (IQ: 20-35) difficulties. Slow rate of learning and information processing
They also have trouble expressing what they have learned or understood via the conventional outlets of speech and writing

\section*{ASSOCIATED MEDICAL CONDITIONS}

Congenital heart defects- Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defect.
Gastrointestinal disorders- including the anatomical abnormalities such as imperforate anus, and functional disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux, and malabsorption.
Respiratory problems such as frequent cold, cough and flu.

Skin problems -Infants with Down syndrome have very soft skin. As they grow older, their skin becomes coarse and dry. Atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema is the main skin problem found in children with Down syndrome.
They may suffer from epilepsy, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and a shortage of growth hormones.

Physical Therapy
focuses on motor development. Since most children with Down syndrome have hypotonia or low muscle tone.
Early intervention is a program of therapies, exercises and activities designed to specifically help children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT CONT..}

Encourage use of other means of expressions such as pictures, colors, sounds, or any other media, to express themselves, for those babies who cant express themselves convectionally on what they have learnt or understood.

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT CONT..}

\section*{Surgical Treatments}

Incases of congenital heart defects and intestinal defects


\section*{Medications}

NERVE INJURIES

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
Discuss different types of nerve injuries Differentiate brachial plexus injuries: Erb palsy and Klumpke's palsy Discuss the management of nerve injuries State the prevention measures for birth injuries

\section*{TYPES OF NERVE INJURIES}
1.Cranial nerve injuries
facial nerve injuries ,recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
2.spinal cord injuries
3.Cranial nerve root injuries
phrenic nerve palsy , injuries to brachial plexus

\section*{BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURIES}
- Brachial plexus comprises of nerve roots at the level of $5^{\text {th }}, 6^{\text {th }}, 7^{\text {th }}$ and $8^{\text {th }}$ cervical vertebrae and the $1^{\text {st }}$ thoracic vertebrae.
- Injuries are mainly 3:
- Erb's palsy
- Klumpke's palsy
- Total brachial plexus palsy

\section*{DUCHENNE-ERB PARALYSIS (C5-C6)}

Affected arm is adducted and internally rotated with elbow extended (Waiter's tip position)
Forearm is prone and wrist is flexed
The limb falls limply to the side of the body when passively adducted
Moro's, biceps, radial reflexes absent on the affected side
Grasp reflex intact

\section*{INFANT WITH ERB PALSY}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_f6b3ef43ff06e534e335g-284.jpg?height=1659&width=1235&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=538)

Klumpke's paralysis (C7, C8 \& T1)
${ }^{1}$ Intrinsic muscles of the hand are affected and grasp is absent (claw hand) Biceps and radial reflex are present

\section*{TOTAL BRACHIAL PLEXUS PALSY}
Injury to the entire brachial plexus- the entire arm is flaccid, all reflexes are absent
In cases of bilateral paralysis, spinal cord injury should be suspected

\section*{KLUMPKE'S PARALYSIS (IMAGE)}

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF NERVE INJURIES}

X-ray studies to rule out bony injuries
u/s and assessment of joints
Chest examination to rule out
diaphragmatic involvement
Passive movements started after 7-10
days (after resolution of the nerve edema)
Splints to prevent wrist and digit
contractures

\section*{Nursing management:}

The goal of care is to prevent contractures of the paralyzed muscle
The arm should be partially immobilized in a position of maximum relaxation so that the non-paralyzed muscles cannot exert pull on the affected muscles
By the use of splint or brace when the arm is paralyzed, the arm is abducted 90 degrees and rotated internally at the shoulder with the elbow flexed so that the palm of the hand is turned towards the head

\section*{NURSING MANAGEMENT CONT..}

When the lower arms and hand are paralyzed, the lower arm and the wrist are kept in a neutral position and the hand is placed over a small pad The infant is immobilized for 6 months during part of the day and night
A longer period of immobilization may be necessary for some infants
After 7-10 days, a complete range of motion (ROM) exercises may be given gently several times each day in order to maintain muscle tone and prevent contraction deformity

Nursing management cont..
When any form of immobilization is used, the fingers and hands must be observed for any coldness or discoloration and the skin for signs of irritation
When a splint is used, the parents must be taught how to apply it properly and how to provide skin care

They should be taught the proper dressing technique-affected hand first and on removing the unaffected hand first
More physical contact and affection should be encouraged than a normal child

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
Severe hypotension and bradycardia
Nerve damage or neuritis
Horners syndrome with dyspnea and hoarseness of voice
Puncture of the pleura may cause pneumothorax
Hemothorax
Hematoma and infection.
