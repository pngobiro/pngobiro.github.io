\section*{OBJECTIVES}
1. Define Asphyxia neonatorum / birth asphyxia
2. Review etiology
3. Review the APGAR Score and interpretation
4. Review the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis
5. Evaluation and treatment of a neonate with asphyxia neonatorum
6. Review complications

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Asphyxia neonatorum means failure to initiate and maintain spontaneous respiration within one minute of birth which then results in absence of the pulse.

\section*{AETIOLOGY}

\section*{There are two main types of neonatal asphyxia: \\ - Acute asphyxia which was caused by intranatal factors only. \\ - Asphyxia, which was developed due to prolonged fetal hypoxia associated
insufficiency. \\ with placental}

\section*{The high risk factors of fetal (antenatal) hypoxia development:}
- Maternal age of less than 16 years old or over 40 years old.
- Postmaturity.
- Multiple pregnancy.
- Threatened preterm labor.
- Diabetes mellitus in pregnant women.
- Bleedings and infectious diseases in IIIII trimester of pregnancy.

\section*{CONT..}
- Smoking or drug addiction in pregnant women.
- Intrauterine growth restriction or another diseases revealed in fetus in ultrasound examination.

The high risk factors of acute (intranatal) asphyxia development:
1. Cesarean operation (planned or urgent).
2.Malpresentation (breech, transverse/oblique presentation).
3. Premature or SGA.
4. Placental abruption.
5. Obstetrical forceps or vacuum-extractor use.
- Birth trauma.
8. Congenital malformations of fetus.
9. Acute labor hypoxia in mother (shock, amniotic fluid embolism, poisonings, decompensated diseases).
10. Maternal anesthesia (both the intravenous drugs and the anesthetic gases cross the placenta and may sedate the fetus).

\section*{At birth, symptoms may include:}

\section*{Physiological newborns reflexes are depressed}
- Meconium in the amniotic fluid
- Arterial hypotension
- rales over the lungs
- Hepatomegaly
- Fluid, electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities including hyperkalaemia, hypoglycaemia, and acidosis.

\section*{Cont ...}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Apgar Scale (evaluate @ 1 and 5 minutes postpartum)} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Sign} & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline A & Activity (muscle tone) & Active & Arms and legs flexed & Absent \\
\hline P & Pulse & $>100 \mathrm{bpm}$ & $<100 \mathrm{bpm}$ & Absent \\
\hline G & Grimace (reflex irritability) & Sneezes, coughs, pulls away & Grimaces & No response \\
\hline A & Appearance (skin color) & Normal over entire body & Normal except extremities & Cyanotic or pale all over \\
\hline R & Respirations & Good, crying & Slow, irregular & Absent \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Interpretation of the APGAR SCORE}
- A score of 7-10 is normal (no depression)
- 4-6 indicates moderate CNS depression
- 0-3 indicates severe CNS depression.

\section*{Evaluation}

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Prophylactic
- Supportive
- Definitive

\section*{PROPHYLACTIC}
1.Antenatal detection of high risk patients
2. Careful fetal monitoring, particularly in high risk pregnancy
3.Judicious administration of anaesthetic agents and depressant drugs during labor.

BABIES WITH APGAR SCORE 7-9 (PINK, BREATHING REGULAR HR > 100).
- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ administration if cyanosed on peripheries
- Re-assess the condition at 5 minutes

\section*{BABIES WITH APGAR SCORE 4-6 [PERIPHERAL}

\section*{CYANOSIS, BREATHING IRREGULAR}

\section*{$\mathrm{HR} \geq 100 . . . .$. Contd}
- Place under a radiant heater and dry the baby
- Baby is put flat or airway in neutral position
- Immediate suction
- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ administration

\section*{BABIES WITH APGAR SCORE BELOW 4 (CENTRAL CYANOSIS)}

No breathing HR <100]
$\square$ Tracheal intubation and ventilatory support must be started immediately
$\square$ If mother received pethedine or morphine within 3 hrs of delivery give Nalaxone $10 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{i} / \mathrm{v}$ it may be repeated every $2-3 \mathrm{mts}$.

\section*{Supportive}
- IV Fluids: $10 \%$ dextrose $2 / 3$ of the volume for the day
- Convulsions chart
- Input/output chart
- Trophic feeds
- Oxygen if in distress
- Counsel the parents

Complications
- Immediate
- Delayed

IMMEDIATE
- Cardiovascular - HTN, cardiac failure
- Renal - acute cortical necrosis, renal failure

Liver function - compromised
GI - Ulcers and necrotising enterocolitis
Lungs - Persistent pulmonary HTN
Brain - Cerebral edema, seizures.

\section*{DELAYED}
- Retarded mental and physical growth
- Epilepsy - up to $30 \%$ in severe asphyxia
- Minimal brain dysfunction
- Questions ?????
