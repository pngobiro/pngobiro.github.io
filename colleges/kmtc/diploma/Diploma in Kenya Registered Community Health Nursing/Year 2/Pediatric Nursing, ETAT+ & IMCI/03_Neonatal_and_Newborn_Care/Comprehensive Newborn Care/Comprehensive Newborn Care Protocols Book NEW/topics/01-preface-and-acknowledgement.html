                        <p>This Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols provide guidance on newborn care to clinicians and nurses. These protocols in this handbook are underpinned on the 'Newborn Care Quality Statements' outlined in this handbook.</p>
                        <p>The development of this handbook was inspired by the NEST360 technical modules (https://nest360.org/education/). This handbook is an advancement of and complimentary to the Basic Paediatric Protocols and Emergency Triage Assessment & Treatment, plus Admission care of the critically ill child (ETAT+) 2016 guidelines. It integrates use of technologies with newborn clinical pathways. The protocols are evidence-based and were adapted from latest WHO guidance, clinical guidelines from other institutions and emerging scientific evidence.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Chapter 1) Newborn Care Clinical Pathways:</strong> It consists of pathways of care of the common newborn conditions including newborn resuscitation, respiratory support for newborn with breathing problems, feeding and treatment for the small and sick newborns, prevention and management of early neonatal hypoglycaemia, management of seizure and neonatal sepsis. Also included are nomograms to provide guidance for treatment of neonatal jaundice and the Comprehensive Newborn Monitoring Chart to aid in documentation of care provided to the small and sick newborns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chapter 2) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):</strong> It consists of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the common equipment that are essential in managing the small and sick newborns. These include radiant warmer, suction machine, newborn glucometer, bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP), oxygen concentrator and oxygen flow splitters, pulse oximeter, LED phototherapy lights and light meter. The SOPs are aligned to the brands of equipment available for training practical sessions for dissemination of these protocols. The handbook therefore focuses on the practical principles of how equipment function and how they are used. Readers are advised to follow specific manufacturers' guidance for use and maintenance of all the equipment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chapter 3) Common Clinical Procedures performed on small and sick newborns:</strong> These include: newborn resuscitation, use of plastic wraps to keep newborns warm, administering oxygen, feeding the small and sick newborn including guidance on breastfeeding techniques and expressing breastmilk, cup-feeding, inserting gastric tubes, administering buccal glucose, heel prick and inserting intravenous line. The protocols emphasize family centred care and observation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures.</p>

                    <h3 id="section-heading-3" class="subsection-heading">Target Audience and Scope</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols target management of the seriously ill newborn in the first one week of life, recognizing that over $90 \%$ of the newborns in the Kenyan Newborn Units (NBUs) are admitted to the units on their first day of birth or the following day. The handbook is aimed at paediatricians, doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers responsible for the care of the small and sick newborns at intermediate (secondary) level newborn units. It is useful for tertiary or university teaching hospitals for defining basic evidence informed care to students in medical schools and other health training institutions.</p>
                        <p>The guidelines presume newborn units that provide care have minimum resources to provide quality care. These include; all the equipment and their accessories, essential drugs, and capacity to do essential investigations for common serious conditions and illnesses among the small and sick newborns. The complexity of care envisaged in the intermediate level NBU requires adequate and skilled health care workers dedicated to providing quality care to the small and sick newborns.</p>
                        <p>The simplified algorithms in this handbook may be enlarged and used as job aides in the NBUs and delivery rooms. These guidelines will undergo periodic revision to keep abreast with emerging evidence and technologies and hence continue to deliver quality care to the newborns of this nation. Updates or additional materials can be found at the websites: https://kenyapaediatric.org/nest360/ and https://nest360.org/education/. These Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols are disseminated through the Newborn ETAT+ Provider course (commonly known as NEST Training). This is a five-day course that comprises of theory sessions on disease processes and management, demonstrations of how the equipment work and how to use the equipment on a patient. The course has dedicated time for hands on experience on using the clinical pathways, assembling the required technologies using the SOPs in the protocols, preparing patients using the clinical procedure guidelines outlined in the protocols and prevention and managing common complications that result from use of the technologies.</p>
                        <p>The training materials for the Newborn ETAT+ Provider course, including audio recorded power point presentations are available in the websites.</p>
