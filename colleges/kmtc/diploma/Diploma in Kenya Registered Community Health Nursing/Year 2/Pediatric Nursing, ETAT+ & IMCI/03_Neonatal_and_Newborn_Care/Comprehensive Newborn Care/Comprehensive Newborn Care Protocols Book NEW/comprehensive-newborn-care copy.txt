Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols
}

Integrating Technologies with Clinical Pathways

March 2022

\section*{PREFACE}

This Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols provide guidance on newborn care to clinicians and nurses. These protocols in this handbook are underpinned on the 'Newborn Care Quality Statements' outlined in this handbook.

The development of this handbook was inspired by the NEST360 technical modules (https://nest360.org/education/). This handbook is an advancement of and complimentary to the Basic Paediatric Protocols and Emergency Triage Assessment \& Treatment, plus Admission care of the critically ill child (ETAT+) 2016 guidelines. It integrates use of technologies with newborn clinical pathways. The protocols are evidence-based and were adapted from latest WHO guidance, clinical guidelines from other institutions and emerging scientific evidence.

\section*{The Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols consist of three chapters.}

Chapter 1) Newborn Care Clinical Pathways: It consists of pathways of care of the common newborn conditions including newborn resuscitation, respiratory support for newborn with breathing problems, feeding and treatment for the small and sick newborns, prevention and management of early neonatal hypoglycaemia, management of seizure and neonatal sepsis. Also included are nomograms to provide guidance for treatment of neonatal jaundice and the Comprehensive Newborn Monitoring Chart to aid in documentation of care provided to the small and sick newborns.

Chapter 2) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): It consists of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the common equipment that are essential in managing the small and sick newborns. These include radiant warmer, suction machine, newborn glucometer, bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP), oxygen concentrator and oxygen flow splitters, pulse oximeter, LED phototherapy lights and light meter. The SOPs are aligned to the brands of equipment available for training practical sessions for dissemination of these protocols. The handbook therefore focuses on the practical principles of how equipment function and how they are used. Readers are advised to follow specific manufacturers' guidance for use and maintenance of all the equipment.

Chapter 3) Common Clinical Procedures performed on small and sick newborns: These include: newborn resuscitation, use of plastic wraps to keep newborns warm, administering oxygen, feeding the small and sick newborn including guidance on breastfeeding techniques and expressing breastmilk, cup-feeding, inserting gastric tubes,
administering buccal glucose, heel prick and inserting intravenous line. The protocols emphasize family centred care and observation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures.

The Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols target management of the seriously ill newborn in the first one week of life, recognizing that over $90 \%$ of the newborns in the Kenyan Newborn Units (NBUs) are admitted to the units on their first day of birth or the following day. The handbook is aimed at paediatricians, doctors, clinical officers, nurses and other health workers responsible for the care of the small and sick newborns at intermediate (secondary) level newborn units. It is useful for tertiary or university teaching hospitals for defining basic evidence informed care to students in medical schools and other health training institutions.

The guidelines presume newborn units that provide care have minimum resources to provide quality care. These include; all the equipment and their accessories, essential drugs, and capacity to do essential investigations for common serious conditions and illnesses among the small and sick newborns. The complexity of care envisaged in the intermediate level NBU requires adequate and skilled health care workers dedicated to providing quality care to the small and sick newborns.

The simplified algorithms in this handbook may be enlarged and used as job aides in the NBUs and delivery rooms. These guidelines will undergo periodic revision to keep abreast with emerging evidence and technologies and hence continue to deliver quality care to the newborns of this nation. Updates or additional materials can be found at the websites: https://kenyapaediatric.org/nest360/ and https://nest360.org/education/. These Comprehensive Newborn Care Protocols are disseminated through the Newborn ETAT+ Provider course (commonly known as NEST Training). This is a five-day course that comprises of theory sessions on disease processes and management, demonstrations of how the equipment work and how to use the equipment on a patient. The course has dedicated time for hands on experience on using the clinical pathways, assembling the required technologies using the SOPs in the protocols, preparing patients using the clinical procedure guidelines outlined in the protocols and prevention and managing common complications that result from use of the technologies.

The training materials for the Newborn ETAT+ Provider course, including audio recorded power point presentations are available in the websites.

Newborn Care Quality Statements

These nine standards of care should be appropriately implemented to give high quality care to newborns. Eight of the quality statements are adapted from the standards for improving the quality of care for small and sick newborns in health facilities - WHO 2020. The corresponding input and process quality measures are found in the WHO 2020 publication https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240010765. A ninth quality statement is added to further support safe use of technologies in the care of the small and sick newborns.

\section*{STANDARD 1:}

Every small and sick newborn receives evidence-based routine care and management of complications according to WHO guidelines.

\section*{Quality statements}

\section*{A. Care for all newborns}
1.1 All newborns receive care with standard precautions to prevent health care-associated infections, including implementing additional measures required during outbreaks and pandemic situations. Observing the five moments for hand-hygiene, early and exclusive breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact are important in preventing infection.
1.2 Each newborn receives care at birth from a qualified healthcare worker competent in providing immediate care of the newborn including resuscitation of babies with no spontaneous respiration.
1.3 All high-risk mothers are identified before child-birth. The birth is attended by two healthcare workers competent in providing care to the mother and immediate care of the newborn including resuscitation of babies with no spontaneous respiration.
1.4 The health facility has local arrangements and a mechanism to maintain a documented room temperature in the labour and childbirth areas at or above $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and free of draught.
1.5 All newborns are assessed immediately while receiving essential newborn care.
1.6 All referred newborns are triaged, promptly assessed for danger signs or injuries to determine whether they require resuscitation and receive appropriate care according to MoH guidelines.
1.7 All newborns receive routine postnatal care, including weighing and temperature measurement.
1.8 All newborns are assessed for immunization status and receive recommended vaccinations as per national immunization schedule.
1.9 All newborns are given cord care, vitamin K and vaccines according to national guidelines. Bathing is delayed 24 hrs for Newly born infants.
1.10 All newborns are protected from unnecessary or harmful practices, including sharing an incubator/ radiant warmer/phototherapy canopy, prolonged hospital stays or separation from their mothers and families during their care.
1.11 All newborns are screened for evidence of maltreatment, including neglect and violence, and receive appropriate care.
1.12 All newborns are assessed for congenital abnormalities, managed appropriately and referred in a timely manner.
1.13 All newborns whose gestational age is unknown are assessed using Ballard score before 24 hrs of age and recorded.
1.14 All newborns are assessed for suspected infection or risk factors for infection and, if required, investigated and given the correct antibiotic treatment (choice of antibiotic, dose and frequency) according to MoH guidelines, avoiding overuse of antibiotics. All newborns suspected to have neonatal sepsis have antibiotics administered within 30 minutes of making diagnosis.
1.15 All newborns at risk of congenital syphilis are assessed, investigated and managed according to MoH guidelines.
1.16 All newborns receive eye prophylaxis, are assessed for ophthalmia neonatorum and, if required, managed according to MoH guidelines.
1.17 All newborns at risk for tuberculosis and/or HIV infection are correctly assessed, investigated and managed appropriately according to MoH guidelines.
1.18 All newborns at risk of early hypoglycaemia (e.g. asphyxia, small-for-gestational age and maternal diabetes) are assessed to identify and manage hypoglycaemia.
1.19 All small and sick newborns at risk of retinopathy of prematurity are appropriately identified, screened and treated.
1.20 All newborns are routinely monitored for jaundice; bilirubin is measured in those at risk and treatment initiated in those with hyperbilirubinaemia according to MoH guidelines.

\section*{B. Care for small and sick newborns}

\section*{B1. Care for respiratory conditions}
1.21 Small and sick newborns are assessed for signs of respiratory compromise, and a neonatal pulse oximeter is used to detect hypoxemia or hyperoxia and to guide administration of supplemental oxygen according to MoH guidelines.
1.22 Newborns who require resuscitation at birth are ventilated with room air (or $21 \%-30 \%$ oxygen), and the need for increasing oxygen concentrations is reviewed to ensure oxygen saturation between $90 \%$ and 95\%.
1.23 Small and sick newborns who require supplemental oxygen therapy receive it safely through appropriate neonatal equipment, including neonatal nasal prongs, low-flow meters, air-oxygen blenders, humidifiers and a pulse oximeter.
1.24 Small and sick newborns are assessed and managed for apnoea, and preterm newborns are managed to prevent apnoea according to MoH guidelines.
1.25 Newborns with respiratory distress are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as soon as the diagnosis is made, according to MoH guidelines.

\section*{B2. Nutritional support for newborns}
1.26 Small and sick newborns are fed appropriately, including assisted feeding with the mother's milk when possible. All mothers are educated on best breastfeeding practices: to initiate breastfeeding immediately after birth, breastfeeding techniques, expressing and storage of breast milk and cup feeding when mother is not able to breastfeed.
1.27 Small and sick newborns who cannot tolerate enteral feeding or for whom enteral feeding is contraindicated are provided with parenteral nutrition in correct amounts and composition according to standard guidelines.
1.28 All newborns of HIV-infected mothers are fed appropriately according to MoH guidelines.

\section*{B3. Clinical monitoring and supportive care}
1.30 Small and sick newborns, especially those who are most seriously ill, are adequately monitored, appropriately reassessed and receive supportive care according to MoH guidelines.
1.31 Small and sick newborns are given antibiotics and other medications only if indicated, by the correct route; the dose checked in the protocols (or calculated) and documented when given in the treatment chart. The need for medication is regularly reassessed, and any adverse reaction is appropriately managed and recorded.
1.32 Small and sick newborns who cannot tolerate full enteral feeds are given intravenous fluids containing glucose or safe, appropriate parenteral nutrition; fluids are administered through an infusion pump and a neonatal burette, the volume is recorded, and the intravenous site is checked with other routine observations.
1.33 Small and sick newborns are given blood transfusions when indicated, the blood given is appropriate, the volume is recorded, and the newborn is monitored before, during and after the transfusion.

\section*{B4. Pain management and palliative care for newborns}
1.34 All small and sick newborns are assessed routinely for pain or symptoms of distress and receive appropriate management according to MoH guidelines. For short painful procedures neonate is breastfed and placed skin to skin with carer.
1.35 Small and sick newborns have access to appropriate palliative care.

\section*{B5. Care and advice at discharge}
1.36 Each small and sick newborn has a completely filled discharge summary. Newborn weight at discharge is taken and documented in the summary notes.
1.37 Small and sick newborns are discharged from hospital when home care is considered safe and carers have received a comprehensive discharge management plan and are competent in the care of their newborn. Carer is counselled on best breastfeeding practices, appropriate sunlight exposure to prevent rickets and also to recognize danger signs in a sick newborn.

\section*{Thermoregulation in preterms <2000grams}
1. Wrap all preterm babies less than 32 weeks gestation age (GA) in plastic wrap immediately infant is born. Don't dry! Transfer to the radiant warmer for immediate newborn care and then to NBU while in plastic wrap. Remove plastic wrap once temperature is controlled ( $36.5-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), nurse in KMC or incubator see section 3.2.
2. All clinically stable preterms more than 32 weeks GA to be put in skin-to-skin contact with the mother soon after birth and after drying them thoroughly.
3. Bathing should be delayed to after 24 hrs .

\subsection*{1.3 Breastfeeding Techniques - Good Positioning and Attachment}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_fdc64cfdad4d136cdd69g-031.jpg?height=1684&width=1467&top_left_y=278&top_left_x=105)
- Importance and management of breastfeeding should be discussed with pregnant women and their families during antenatal period.
- Facilitate immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth.
- Support mothers to initiate and maintain breastfeeding and manage common difficulties
- Enable mothers and their infants to remain together and to practice rooming-in 24 hours a day.
- Support mothers to recognize and respond to their infants' cues for feeding

\subsection*{1.4 Prevention and Treatment of Hypoglycemia}

\subsection*{1.5 Feeds and Fluids}

Is the baby unstable? Characteristics of an unstable newborn include; Convulsions, Unconscious, severe respiratory distress, Distress evidenced by severe chest wall indrawing, absent bowel sounds.

Can the baby breastfeed? From weight 1500 grams breastfeed, if not able to breastfeed, feed by cup. Health workers must have the skill of cup feeding and must teach the same to the mothers (section 3.5). If using EBM, show mother how to express breastmilk (section 3.5).

\section*{The Aim}
1. Weight gain - 15 grams/kg/day
2. Appropriate time taken to reach full enteral feeds - Neonates $<1000$ grams at birth - 2 weeks \& neonates with birthweight 1000-1500grams - 1 week

\section*{a) Feeding STABLE AND WELL babies birth weight less than 1.5 kg and equal or over 1.5 kg}

Stable babies are well, without respiratory distress and do not have a congenital malformation as a contraindication to enteral feeding.

Stable babies' birthweight less than 1.5kg: Start with EBM $80 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day on day 1 and increase by $20 \mathrm{mls} /$ kg each day to max $180 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. It may be possible to increase volumes further to as much as $200 \mathrm{mls} /$ kg/day but seek expert advice.

Stable babies' birthweight equal to or over 1.5 kg : Assess ability to breastfeed.

\section*{b) Feeds and Fluids for UNSTABLE neonates}
- Unstable newborn - Sick baby (convulsions, unconscious, severe respiratory distress evidenced by severe chest wall indrawing, absent bowel sounds)
- Day 1:
$\checkmark$ Start IV 10\% Dextrose for 24hrs.
V Birthweight less than 1.5 kg start with $80 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day.
V Birthweight equal or greater than 1.5 kg start with $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
$\checkmark$ To stimulate the gut, give $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of colostrum via NGT every 3hours - to be started when A, B and C are stabilized - do not deduct this from the IVF. (If you think it is unsafe to give IV fluids then start immediate NG feeding with colostrum)
- Day 2:
$\checkmark$ Start feeding with EBM via NGT at $30 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day EBM.
$\checkmark$ Increase the EBM feeds by $30 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume until IVF stopped i.e. until full 3 hourly enteral feed volume achieved appropriate for weight and postnatal age in days.
$\checkmark$ Increase total feeds (IVF + EBM) by $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day to $\max$ of $150 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Once no longer on IVF increase EBM to max of $180 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day, but it may be possible to increase volumes further to as much as $200 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day but seek expert advice.
- Example - equal or greater than 1.5 kg
$\checkmark$ Day 1: Total intake - $60 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day IVF
$\checkmark$ Day 2: Total intake - $80 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ( $30 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day EBM $+50 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day IVF )
$\checkmark$ Day 3: Total intake $-100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day $(60 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day EBM $+40 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day IVF $)$
- Always feed with EBM unless contra-indicated
- For babies who have hypoglycemia, after correction measure, monitor blood glucose prior to feeding. If 3 consecutive blood glucose measurements are normal then monitor 6 hrly
- Prescribe daily the type and volume of IVF to be given per hour PLUS the EBM to be given 3hourly.
- IVF and EBM intake should be monitored using the feeding charts, ensuring that there is no unexplained deficit that would make the neonate be dehydrated or/and fail to gain weight as expected.

\subsection*{1.7 Supporting respiratory efforts - Use of Oxygen and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)}

CPAP not to be done for neonates with;
1. Birth Weight of less 1000 gm
2. APGAR score of less 4 at 5 min

Defer CPAP for neonates with;
1. Uncontrollable seizure
2. Apnea or gasping respiration

\subsection*{1.8 Treatment Failure \& Complications of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)}

\section*{Signs of Improvement}
1. Reduced respiratory distress (work of breathing) as indicated by decrease in;
- Respiratory rate
- Grunting
- Sternal/intercostal indrawing
- Nasal flaring
2. Stabilization or reduction in oxygen requirement to maintain SpO2 between 90-95\%
3. Patient looks more comfortable

\section*{Signs of Treatment Failure}
1. Increased work of breathing (sternal and intercostal recession, grunting, tachypnoea)
2. Oxygen requirement greater than 40\% to maintain SpO2 between 90-95\% in 8 cm water level of CPAP
3. A rapid rise in oxygen requirement (an increase of 10\% FiO2 to maintain SpO2 90-95\% within a 3-hour period)
4. Recurrent apneic episodes requiring stimulation

\section*{Actions to take in Treatment}

\section*{Failure}
1. Assess patient for complications - include a chest X-ray
2. Perform transillumination for babies less than 32 weeks gestation
3. Refer to a higher level facility

\section*{Family Centered Care}

Always Involve the parents.
Give them information regarding the disease process and treatment

\section*{Complications of CPAP and Preventive Measures}

\section*{1. Pressure injury:}
- Necrosis of nasal septum, distortion of nasal nares or ears.

Prevention:
- Measure and size nasal prongs correctly
- Prongs should fit the nares snuggly but no blanching the skin.
- Ensure nasal prongs are not in contact with septum or columella - leave 2 mm , ensure the 2 lines on nasal prongs are visible!
- Check ears for pressure areas, creases or folds

\section*{2. Abdominal distension:}
- Gas delivered enters the stomach

Prevention:
- Use lowest possible flow of gas
- Use orogastric tube on free drainage (if feeding through OGT, then open OGT to free drainage $1 / 2 \mathrm{hr}$ after a feed.)

\section*{3. Air leak syndromes e.g. Pneumothorax:}
- May be due to the disease process or high pressures of above $8 \mathrm{~cm} /$ water. Clinical signs; Increasing respiratory distress, Asymmetrical chest movement or appearance, Decreased air entry, Hyperresonance on auscultation, Positive illumination

\section*{Prevention:}
- Do not exceed $8 \mathrm{~cm} /$ water

\section*{4. Hypoxia or oxygen toxicity:}
- SpO2 below 90\% or above 95\%

\section*{Prevention:}
- Maintain SpO2 90-95\%

\subsection*{1.9 Neonatal Seizures}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_fdc64cfdad4d136cdd69g-043.jpg?height=1835&width=1439&top_left_y=319&top_left_x=136)

In the absence of clinical seizures, neonates with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy need not to be given prophylactic treatment with phenobarbitone

\section*{When to stop anticonvulsant drugs}
1. In neonates with normal neurological examination and/or normal electroencephalography, consider stopping antiepileptic drugs if neonate has been seizure-free for more than 72 hours; the drug(s) should be reinstituted in case of recurrence of seizures.
2. In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single antiepileptic drug, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without any tapering of the doses.
3. In neonates requiring more than one antiepileptic drug for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one by one, with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn.

\section*{Antibiotic Prophylaxis for newly born}

Prophylactic antibiotic should be given as soon as possible after birth to all newborns (term and preterms) with any one of the following risk factors:
- Membrane rupture more than $>18$ hours before delivery
- A mother with fever (Temperature $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) before delivery or during labour
- Suspected or confirmed chorioamnionitis - amniotic fluid foul smelling or purulent

Do blood culture. Benzyl Penicillin and Gentamicin standard dose Treatment should be started immediately and be given for 48-72 hours (at least 4 doses of Penicillin +2 doses of gentamicin). Reassess after two days - continue treatment only if there is positive blood culture OR there are features of sepsis. Stop antibiotics if the baby has remained entirely well during this period.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig 2.1.5b Selecting Baby Mode}
\end{figure}

\section*{a) Prewarm Mode}
$\checkmark$ This mode provides low power background warming in preparation to receive the newborn. Select this mode at least 5 minutes before the baby is placed on the warmer. Warm the linen/towels for receiving the baby in the delivery room by placing them on the mattress of the warmer.

\section*{To use prewarm mode;}
$\checkmark$ Ensure the temperature probe is attached to probe port
- Select PREWARM MODE from the MODE Selection screen. See fig 2.1.5a above
- Ensure the warmer power displayed on the control panel reads $25 \%$ (too much could lead to overheating)

\section*{Baby Mode}

Also known as servo mode or automatic mode. Provides stable control of the baby's skin temperature by automatically adjusting the heater power to compensate for varying metabolic and environmental conditions. It measures and updates the baby's temperature five times per second. It is the preferred mode for maintaining the baby's body temperature.

\section*{To use prewarm, Baby mode and manual mode ;}
- Select BABY MODE from the MODE Selection screen. See fig 2.1.5b above
- Set the desired skin temperature between $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by touching the up/down arrows on the front panel. Ensure the temperature probe is securely attached on the baby

\section*{Manual Mode}

Provides user-adjustable heater power. Provides the option to monitor the baby's temperature using skin sensor. Babies must NEVER be left unattended because the temperature is controlled manually
$\checkmark$ To use manual mode
- Select MANUAL MODE from the MODE Selection screen.
- Set the desired heater power level between $0 \%$ and $100 \%$ by touching the up/down arrows on the front panel. The heater power level is displayed next to the heater power symbol on the control panel.
- Monitor the baby's temperature
- If the warmer is in MANUAL MODE for longer than 15 minutes, the mode selection panel will flash, an audible alarm will sound, and the heater power will be reduced to $25 \%$ (equivalent to prewarm mode).

\subsection*{2.1.6 Setting Apgar And Procedure Timers}
- Follow the manufacturer's instructions
- Touch the timer symbol to access the APGAR and Procedure Timer selection screen. See fig 2.1.6 below
- Touch the APGAR clock immediately the baby is delivered to start the APGAR timer. It will give an alarm at $1 \mathrm{~min}, 5 \mathrm{~min}, 10 \mathrm{~min}, 15 \mathrm{~min}$ automatically
- Touch the +1 or -1 to set the procedure timer. Touch the timer clock to start the count down

\subsection*{2.1.8 Preparing the Radiant Warmer for Use}
- Follow hand hygiene protocol.
- Plug the power cable to the machine and attach to a single power source. Do not use an extension cable.
- Place or ensure the back of radiant warmer is on a wall with the front facing the nurse's station or the center of the room/unit
- Secure the warmer in place by locking the wheels to avoid unnecessary movement
- Place or ensure the storage side trays are secured in their place. Ensure all the side panels are firmly secured in place and none is broken or missing
- Cover the clean radiant warmer mattress with a clean linen
- Plug the temperature probe into the front panel socket.
- Turn on the machine and test if the probe is working by bring it close to the heater elements and checking if the temperature is rising. Place probe on the covered mattress

Fig 2.1.8 Insert temperature probe and test functioning
- Ensure the room temperature is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and draught free; you will need a warm environment as you move the baby to the radiant warmer. Select prewarm mode at least 5 minutes before receiving the baby.
- Place 2 linen towels to receive the baby at delivery on the clean covered radiant warmer mattress. Place other resuscitation items or other items specific to the designated procedure to be performed on the radiant warmer side trays or trolley.
- If expecting the delivery of a preterm less than 32 weeks, prepare to use a plastic wrap by spreading it on the mattress (section 3.2).
- As soon as the baby is born, start the APGAR timer

\subsection*{2.1.9 Preparing the Baby}
- For asphyxiated babies, reduce the heat of the radiant warmer to $0 \%$ and switch off the heat of the radiant warmer \& maintain room temperature. Subsequent temperature management will depend on your hospital policy. For preterms below gestation age of 32 weeks, initiate strict temperature regulation during resuscitation by use of plastic wraps, in addition to warmth provided by the radiant warmer.
- Position the baby naked, in the middle of radiant warmer covered mattress. One radiant warmer should be used for one baby.
- Follow resuscitation protocols (section 3.1)
- To monitor the temperature, locate the site to place and secure the temperature probe
$\checkmark$ Draw a right imaginary midclavicular line
$\checkmark$ Draw an imaginary horizontal line from the level of the xiphisternum, such that this line meets the midclavicular line at $90^{\circ}$ (over the liver)
$\checkmark$ Clean this point where the two lines meet with alcohol swabs and let it dry.
$\checkmark$ Place the shiny flat part of the skin sensor on the temperature probe at this point
$\checkmark$ Secure the skin sensor with medical adhesive tape
$\checkmark$ Select the mode to use (Baby mode is preferred)
$\checkmark$ Ensure the baby's temperature is maintained between $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\subsection*{2.1.10 Alarms \& Monitoring}
- All alarms are displayed on the mode selection panel. When any of these alarms sound, correct the problem or institute alternative methods to keep the baby warm

\subsection*{2.2.6 Preparing the Suction Machine for use}
- Follow hand hygiene protocol and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Plug the suction machine to power and test functionality
- Attach the short tubing between suction machine and machine port on the lid of the reservoir
- Attach the long tubing on the patient port on the lid of the reservoir
- Turn the machine on
- Using the pressure regulator on the machine, adjust the suction vacuum to a pressure of negative 80 $-100 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$.
- Test that the suction machine is functioning by suctioning sterile water or normal saline in a kidney dish.

\subsection*{2.2.7 Preparing and performing oropharyngeal suctioning}
- Visually inspect the baby's oral and nasopharyngeal cavities for secretions or blood to determine need for suctioning
- Ensure baby is attached to a pulse oximeter. Note the baby's $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, respiratory rate \& heart rate before beginning the procedure. Ensure there is an oxygen source and nasal prongs available
- Decide the type of suctioning to perform - Manual suctioning using a penguin or bulb sucker or suctioning with a machine
a) When performing manual suctioning using a penguin sucker or single use bulb sucker;
$\checkmark$ Position the baby in slightly extended position (sniffing position)
$\checkmark$ Squeeze the sucker and introduce it into the mouth
$\checkmark$ Release the sucker while in the mouth to create negative pressure
$\checkmark$ Suck the secretions out and pour the secretions on a gauze
$\checkmark$ Repeat this procedure until all secretions are removed

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig 2.2.7a Steps to suction using a Bulb or Penguin sucker}
\end{figure}
b) Using suction machine

If using a suction machine; Use a Yankheur (wide bore sucker) for thick secretions such as thick meconium. No need for sizing this. Use suction catheter Fr size 6-8 for thin secretions. Select a suction catheter that approximates the diameter of the baby's nostril. Do not use nasogastric tubes for suctioning.
i) When using a wide bore sucker
$\checkmark$ Connect the wide bore sucker to the suction machine
$\checkmark$ Ensure the pressure is set at $80-100 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$
$\checkmark$ Only suck what is visible in the mouth.
$\checkmark$ If secretions are very thick, apply 1-2 drops of normal saline in to the mouth to make the secretions thinner and reduce trauma.
$\checkmark$ Suction for 10 seconds then allow the baby 30 seconds to visibly recover from the procedure or for the $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ to return to above $90 \%$ if baby already connected to a pulse oximeter
$\checkmark$ Rinse the catheter with sterile water/saline in a kidney dish and repeat the procedure until the airway is clear
ii) When using a suction catheter
$\checkmark$ Select the appropriate size of suction catheter to use (Fr Gauge 6 or 8) \& attach catheter to the suction machine.
- Ensure the machine pressure is set at $80-100 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$
- Determine the suction depth for oropharyngeal suctioning;
- Measure the distance from the side of the nose to the tragus of the ear
- Mark this distance on the suction catheter with a small piece of adhesive tape /marker.
- Place the baby in a slightly extended (sniffing) position to ensure effective suctioning.
- With the thumb control valve open, gently insert the catheter into the patient's mouth first then the nostrils to the point marked by the tape/marker.
- Occlude the thumb control valve on the catheter and slowly \& gently withdraw the catheter from the mouth or nostril. Use a $360^{\circ}$ rotation (spiral) motion until the catheter is completely removed.
- Rinse the catheter by suctioning sterile water/saline and repeat the procedure until the airway is clear
$\checkmark$ Suction for 10 seconds then allow the baby 30 seconds to breath.

iii) When using the suction machine with either yankheur or suction catheter;
$\checkmark$ Suction only until the reservoir of the suction machine is $3 / 4$ full
$\checkmark$ Remember;
- Be gentle! Do not suction too vigorously!
- Do not suction for too long! Just 10 seconds and a break for 30 seconds! Otherwise you cause hypoxemia
$\checkmark$ Observe suctioned contents carefully whilst suctioning procedure is taking place. Fresh blood may indicate trauma from the suctioning. Stomach contents may indicate suction from stomach
$\checkmark$ Observe the baby's change in color and drop in $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, respiratory rate \& heart rate for a patient connected to a monitor as you suction. Stop if $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, respiratory rate \& heart rate are dropping and start baby on oxygen
$\checkmark$ When all visible secretions are removed, gently withdraw the suction catheter from the patient's nose and mouth
$\checkmark$ Discard the suction catheter and empty the suction machine's collection reservoir immediately after the procedure
$\checkmark$ Document all assessments and interventions in the baby's file, nurses cardex and comprehensive newborn monitoring chart as appropriate

\section*{Step 7 Add a normal saline drop in each nostril using a 2cc syringe}

Step 8 Insert the CPAP prongs until the line on the prongs is just visible. This will leave 2 mm of space between the prongs and the nasal septum to ensure prongs are not against the columella
- Confirm the size chosen is the correct size for the baby. The prongs should fill the entire nare without blanching the external nare.
- If the size is too big or too small, immediately remove the prongs from the baby's nares, continue the baby on oxygen and choose the next appropriate size.

Step 10 Check for effective functioning of the bCPAP (water bubbling)

Step 11 Attach a pulse oximeter at an appropriate site on the baby
step 12 Check baby's response to bCPAP (assess work of breathing, HR and $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ )
- Increase oxygen flow rate by 1 liter/min every 60 seconds to achieve $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ of $90-95 \%$.

Step 13 Institute other supportive care - warmth, feeds \& fluids, blood sugar

Step 14 Check patient response to bCPAP at 15 minutes. Check;
- Vital signs (RR, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, HR)
- Work of breathing (grunting, sternal, intercostal and lower chest wall in drawing, and nasal flaring)
- Nasal blockages
- Abdominal distension

Step 15 Decide best action based on the clinical assessment - Continue with current treatment or Increase treatment based on baby's response to the bCPAP Aim at increasing the oxygen delivery flow rate before increasing the pressures where possible.

Increased oxygen delivery is achieved by increasing the oxygen flow rate at a given total flow rate. Once FiO of $90 \%$ is achieved increase the total flow rate from 6 to $7 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$ and gradually increase the $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}$ again until $\mathrm{SPO}_{2} 90-95 \%$ is achieved,.

\subsection*{2.3.8 Monitoring}

Step 1 Monitor the CPAP Treatment;
- Vital signs (respiratory rate, heart rate, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ and temperature)
- Work of breathing (respiratory distress - severe lower chest wall indrawing, grunting)
- Nasal blockages - Provide a few drops of normal saline to each nostril
- Abdominal distension - ensure oral gastric tube is in situ and open.

Step 2 Check patient attachment (prongs, tubes \& hat)
- Check position of the prongs - Prongs should not be against the columella
- Check nasal columella for skin compromise
- Check tubing - Tubing should not be kinked or misplaced
- Check that the hat is not loose; if it is loose, replace with new hat

Step 3 Monitor function of the equipment
- Check water level: If water level is below or above the target treatment level, add or remove the water from bottle cap holes using a syringe and an NG tube. Decrease or increase water level by 1 cm of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. For the Pumani CPAP 1 cm of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}=40 \mathrm{mls}$ of water
- Check that the CPAP is bubbling. If not, may be due to the patient's mouth being open or nasal prongs not fully fitting the patient's nostrils.

\end{figure}
2.5.5 Preparing the oxygen splitter for use
- Follow hand hygiene protocol
- Place the oxygen splitter of a firm surface next to an oxygen source as shown on fig 2.5.4 above
- Connect the splitter to the oxygen source using a non-crush oxygen tubing
- Determine flow rate to set on oxygen source flowmeter by adding the total oxygen for all the babies to use the splitter then add 1 extra $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$. For example; to give 4 babies each at $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, total required oxygen is $4 * 2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}=8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Add $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Set $9 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ on oxygen source flow meter
- Open the oxygen flowmeter on the oxygen source at calculated flow rate
- Open all the flowmeters on the splitter to maximum flow rate $(2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ and confirm oxygen is flowing by feeling for air flow on each of the splitter outlets
- Close all splitter flowmeters not in use after confirming flow on each outlet

2.5.6 Administering oxygen to multiple babies using an oxygen flow splitter
- Connect correctly sized oxygen nasal prong or catheter to the splitter outlets of each flowmeter. Splitters should never be used with a non-breather mask as their maximum flow rate is $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
- Adjust the flowrate to the desired volume on each splitter flowmeter by reading the flow rate at the middle of the ball in the splitter flowmeters. Confirm oxygen is flowing through the method of delivery chosen. For nasal prongs and catheters, ensure that oxygen is flowing by bubbling through water through water
- Mark each baby's flowmeter so each gets the individually prescribed oxygen flow rate
- When you adjust one flowmeter check that the other four have remained as desired

- For preventive maintenance, turn on the device and check for a red light on the probe. Then connect the probe and test readings on your finger for normal saturations.
- If the pulse oximeter is not turning on - Press and hold the power button for at least 5 seconds. Check the battery level, if low, plug in the device to charge or get new batteries
- If the pulse oximeter is turning on but is not displaying a trace - Check the probe for a flashing red light. If there is no light, check that the probe is properly connected to the pulse oximeter.
- If the probe is connected and no light is showing, try replacing the probe
- If the probe is connected and the red light is showing, but no probe is detected or no trace is displayed, replace the probe with a different probe
- If the pulse oximeter is turning on but taking time to stabilize the trace - Check that no powerful light sources are shining on the pulse oximeter probe. Confirm that the patient is not moving and the probe is still securely attached. Confirm the probe is dry and clean. Choose an extremity that is warm, dry, and well perfused. Wait at least 1 minute for the signal to stabilize before trying an alternate extremity
- Contact a technician or maintenance department if device continues to not work properly after addressing the common issues

https://www.health.qld.gov.au/ data/assets/pdf file/0019/1040365/o-jaundice-nomogram-38w.pdf
- Mark the level of the total serum bilirubin (TSB) on the Y axis of the nomogram. Each small box $=10 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$
- Mark the age of baby in hours on the $X$ axis of the nomogram. Each big box $=6$ hours
- Mark where the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level and age in hours meet on the phototherapy (red) or exchange transfusion (blue) threshold/level
- Determine the irradiance to use based on the level of the total serum bilirubin (TSB) in relation to the curve threshold
- More than $50 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ below phototherapy level - No phototherapy. Observe the baby. There is no likely risk of developing kernicterus
- Less than $50 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ below phototherapy level - No phototherapy. Repeat Total Serum Bilirubin (TSB) levels within 6-24 hours
- On the phototherapy line - Initiate standard phototherapy at $25-30 \mu \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{nm}$
- More than $50 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ below exchange transfusion level - Initiate standard phototherapy at $25-30 \mu \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{nm}$
- Less than $50 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{I}$ below exchange transfusion level - Prepare for exchange transfusion. Commence intensive phototherapy at $30-35 \mu \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{nm}$ to lower TSB levels and avoid exchange transfusion
- At and above exchange transfusion level - Commence exchange transfusion. Initiate intensive photo therapy as you prepare if TSB close to the exchange transfusion threshold, repeat a TSB before the exchange transfusion to check if it is still indicated.

\subsection*{2.7.6 Preparing the baby for phototherapy}
- Observe hand hygiene protocol
- Turn on the radiant warmer or room warming system to ensure the temperature in the room where the phototherapy will take place is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Assess baby's vital signs \& risk factors
- Remove all the baby's clothes except for a small size diaper
- Ensure the diaper covers only the genital region for hygiene purposes. Fold it if it is covering more.
- Insert a nasal gastric tube if intensive phototherapy is indicated (See section 3.5)
- Place an eye shield on the baby and ensure the eye shield is snuggly fitting and covers the eyes completely. See fig 2.7.6

2.8.6 Preparing the baby for blood glucose testing
- Follow hand hygiene protocol and wear gloves
- Manage pain by breastfeeding the baby 2 minutes before the procedure, during and after the procedure. Administer $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of expressed breast milk (EBM) into the mouth, if the baby can not feed breastfeed. Give $0.4 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of oral $50 \%$ glucose if there is no EBM available
- Clean the skin on the outer or inner (lateral or medial) side of edge of the baby's heel using cotton wool soaked in 70\% alcohol. Allow the alcohol to dry. Blood glucose samples should never be taken from the finger of a neonate. Avoid areas of skin which are poorly perfused, oedematous, inflamed or infected.
- Using the lancet, prick the disinfected outer or inner edge of the heel. A blood drop should form. The patient may cry during blood collection as use of the lancet can be painful.
- Wipe the first drop from the patient's skin and generate an additional blood drop. Collect the second blood drop on the tip of the glucometer strip as shown on fig 2.8.6a. The glucometer should automatically absorb the blood drop.

\begin{figure}

COMMON CLINICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED ON NEWBORNS
}

\subsection*{3.1 Newborn Resuscitation}
- Each newborn should be delivered by a qualified health worker
- All high-risk mothers should be identified before child-birth.
- There should be two competent health workers available at delivery to provide both immediate newborn care (including resuscitation for babies with no spontaneous respiration) and care of the mother.

\subsection*{3.1.2 Steps to follow during newborn resuscitation_(see section 1.1)}

\section*{Step 1 Ensure safety;}
- Warm delivery room $\left(25-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$
- Observe hand hygiene and use of gloves protocol
- Ensure availability of essential drugs and equipment as per the check list above
- Ensure the environment is safe i.e. clean, there are no sharps or clinical waste lying on surfaces or floor, there are no broken pieces of devices lying on surfaces where resuscitation will be performed
- Ensure the suction machine is ready for use - clean, pressure set $80-100 \mathrm{mmHg}$, suction tubes and wide bore catheter ready for use. Test if suction machine is working (see section 2.2)
- Prepare the radiant warmer for use: (see section 2.1)
$\checkmark$ Ensure the radiant warmer is clean and the mattress is covered with a clean linen
$\checkmark$ Plug power cable to the machine
$\checkmark$ Plug temperature probe into baby probe port on the machine.
$\checkmark$ Turn on the machine
$\checkmark$ Test the temperature probe and place it on the mattress
$\checkmark$ Select the pre-warm mode and place the two towels on the mattress at least 5 min before receiving the baby
$\checkmark$ Turn on the examination light
$\checkmark$ Start APGAR timer on as soon as baby is born

\section*{Step 2 Perform initial steps in stabilization}
- Dry and stimulate the baby, while on the mother's abdomen. Remove the wet towel and cover with a warm dry towel
$\checkmark$ Assess; is the baby crying/breathing? Does the baby have a good tone?
$\checkmark$ If No to any of these, immediately cut the cord and place the baby in the middle of the long axis of the radiant warmer mattress and stand at the foot of the radiant warmer

\section*{Step 3 Airway}
- Open the airway into the slightly extended (sniffing) position using the head tilt and chin lift maneuver and look into the mouth
$\checkmark$ If there are secretions, suction only what is visible. See section 2.2.6

\section*{Step 4 Breathing}
- Look, listen and feel for breathing for 5 seconds.
$\checkmark$ Look at the chest for movements
$\checkmark$ Listen for breath sounds
$\checkmark$ Feel for warm air on your cheek
- If the baby is not breathing, shout for help and begin ventilations;
$\checkmark$ Size for the correct BVM mask to use - should cover nose and mouth
$\checkmark$ Using room air
$\checkmark$ Give 40-60 continuous ventilations in 60 seconds ensuring a good $\mathrm{C} \& \mathrm{E}$ grip. To maintain a good rate count out loud 'BREATH, TWO THREE'.
$\checkmark$ Ensure the chest rises

\end{figure}

\section*{Step 5 Circulation}
- Feel the umbilical cord stump for pulsation for 5-10 seconds.
$\checkmark$ If the heart rate is above 60beats/min, continue 40-60 ventilations for another 60 seconds then reassess Airway, Breathing \& Circulation. If the airway is clear and spontaneously breathing, put on oxygen via nasal prongs at $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Titrate oxygen flow rate to achieve the desired $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$
$\checkmark$ If the heart rate is below 60beats/min, begin chest compressions at a rate of 3 compressions to 1 ventilation for 1 -minute. Rescuer 1 should give ventilations and Rescuer 2 should give chest compressions!
$\checkmark$ When giving chest compressions;
- Use the 2-thumb hand encircling technique
- Locate and give the compressions on the lower $1 / 3$ of the sternum
- Compress 1/3rd of the anterior posterior (AP) diameter
- Allow for chest re-coil
- As you start compression connect BVM to $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$ oxygen
- To ensure 120 events $/ \mathrm{min}$ (90 compressions and 30 ventilations) say aloud the phrase - 'ONE and TWO and THREE and BREATH'

\end{figure}

Step 6 Reassess Airway, Breathing \& Circulation after 1 minute.
- Repeat the steps until return of spontaneous breathing \& circulation.

\section*{Step 7 Give oxygen}
- Administer oxygen using nasal prongs at $0.5-1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ if baby did not require chest compression
- Administer oxygen using a non-rebreather mask at $10-15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ if chest compression $100 \%$ oxygen.

\section*{Step 8 Ensure the baby is kept warm (see section 2.1.9)}
- Locate site to place and secure the temperature probe on the baby
- Change the radiant warming mode from prewarm to baby mode (also called servo or automatic mode).
- Set the desired skin temperature between $36.5-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- For asphyxiated babies: Reduce the heat of the radiant warmer to $0 \%$ or or as per hospital policy for therapeutic cooling

\section*{Step 9 Monitor $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$}
- Connect to pulse oximeter (see section 2.6.6)
- Titrate oxygen flow rate to achieve the desired $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$.
- When baby is stable, provide Essential Newborn Care and Family Centered Care.
- Document care provided

\subsection*{3.2 Use of Plastic Wraps for Preterms less than 32 weeks at birth}
- Preterms less than 32 weeks should be resuscitated using the same steps as listed in section 3.1 above except initial stabilization.
- The preterms will not be dried but will be wrapped in a plastic to keep the baby warm

\subsection*{3.2.1 Items required}
- Polyethylene paper/wrap - transparent, low density (saran), 50 cm wide.

Can be commercial or food grade cling film
- Cord clump

\end{figure}

\subsection*{3.2.2 Steps to follow when using plastic wraps}

Step 1 Ensure the delivery room is warm $\left(25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and draught free
Step 2 Spread the occlusive plastic wrap over the bed of the pre-warmed radiant warmer. Do not allow plastic to overheat if under a radiant warmer. Place on radiant warmer 5-10min before the expected delivery then place the prewarmed plastic wrap on the mother's side (for $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{S}$ consider other IPC measures).

Step 3 Receive \& carefully place the newborn on the occlusive plastic wrap without drying and fold the wrap over the infant covering the entire body excluding the head (fig 3.2.2)

Step 4 Dry the head and cover it with a hat.

Step 5 Transfer the baby immediately to the radiant warmer. Perform clinical assessment and resuscitation interventions through the plastic wrap/bag.

Step 6 Attach temperature probe skin sensor on the baby's skin and maintain the baby's temperature between $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. To avoid hyperthermia/heat stress, ensure the temperature probe is well secured to monitor the baby's temperature and remove the plastic wrap/bag when baby has been stabilized in the NBU. To avoid pressure sores, turn the baby hourly

Step 7 Remove the plastic wrap/bag when the newborn has been stabilized and an alternative method of keeping baby warm are available. usually 1-2 hours after birth and an alternative method of keeping baby warm are available.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig 3.2.2 Wrap the baby's body without wiping the liquor and cover the head with a cap}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{3.2.3 Removing the plastic wrap}
1. Ensure the temperature in the room is warm and that other methods of keeping the baby warm are available
2. Gently open the plastic bag or tear off the plastic wrap from the baby's body
3. Dry the baby's body
4. Immediately institute other methods of keeping the baby warm e.g. kangaroo mother care or incubator care
5. Check baby's temperature 30 minutes after removing the plastic bag/wrap to ensure normal body temperature is maintained.
6. Discard the plastic wrap

\subsection*{3.3 Administering Oxygen}

\subsection*{3.3.1 Indications for Oxygen Therapy}
1. Oxygen saturations ( $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ) are less than $90 \%$ (for babies less than 10 minutes old check the target $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ) OR Increased work of breathing - evident use of accessory muscles; severe lower chest wall in drawing, sternal retraction
2. NOTE: Some babies may require positive pressure ventilation including Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). See chapter 2 section 2.3 for Indications for CPAP

\subsection*{3.3.2 Items required}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline - Alcohol based hand rub & - Marker pen if using a nasal catheter \\
\hline - Oxygen source - piped, cylinder or concentrator & - Nasal gastric tube if using a nasal catheter \\
\hline - Oxygen flow rate splitter - if administering to multiple babies & - Transpore medical adhesive \\
\hline - Penguin sucker or suction catheter size 6 or 8 & - Normal saline \\
\hline - Neonatal Nasal prongs or nasal catheters & - 2 or 5cc syringe \\
\hline - Neonatal non-rebreather mask & - Distilled water \\
\hline - Pulse Oximeter & - Kidney dish or procedure tray \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{3.3.3 Preparing to administer Oxygen}
1. Determine the oxygen flow rate to be delivered based on clinical assessment
- Standard flow rate - Neonates: $0.5-1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$;
- High flow rate - Preterm Neonates: $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$; Term neonates: $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
2. Determine if humidification is needed - required ONLY for high flow rate oxygen
3. Determine source of oxygen. Can be;
- Piped oxygen
- Oxygen cylinder
- Oxygen concentrator
4. Determine if oxygen flow rate splitter is required - it may be used with any of the oxygen sources. (see section 2.5.5)
5. Determine mode of oxygen delivery
- Use appropriately sized nasal prongs, nasal catheters or Non-rebreather Mask. (Facemasks, head boxes, incubators and tents are not recommended because they waste oxygen and are potentially harmful).

\subsection*{3.3.4 Initiating Oxygen Therapy}
- Assess the baby's airway for secretions and suction if necessary. See chapter two Section 2.2.7
- Lubricate the nostrils with a drop of normal saline in each nostril.

\section*{a) When using Nasal Prongs (nasal cannula)}
$\checkmark$ Insert the nasal prongs into the nostrils. The distal prong should, the prongs should occupy about half the diameter of the nostrils to allow ambient air in around the prongs. Thus, diameter for the prongs - preterm babies 1 mm and term babies 2 mm . See fig 3.3.4 a and fig 3.3.4b
$\checkmark$ Secure the prongs in place on both cheeks with tape. See fig 3.3.4c
$\checkmark$ Adjust loop adjustment slider at the back of the baby to hold nasal prongs in place securely
$\checkmark$ Protect the sides of the nose and cheek where the tubing could rub and injure the skin.
$\checkmark$ Adjust flow rate accordingly. See table below

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Flow Rate & Age Group & Volume & $\mathbf{F I O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ \\
\hline Standard & Preterm & $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ & $30-35 \%$ \\
\hline & Term & $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ & $30-35 \%$ \\
\hline High & Preterm & $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ & $45-55 \%$ \\
\hline & Term & $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ & $45-55 \%$ \\
\hline

b) When using a Nasal catheter
$\checkmark$ Use French size 8 oxygen catheter with lateral eyes to disperse oxygen (fig 3.3.4d)
$\checkmark$ Measure the appropriate depth to insert - Length between the inner margin of the eyebrow to the side of the nose (fig 3.3.4e)
$\checkmark$ Insert the nasal catheter to the marked depth gently into the nostril. It should easily slide into the nostril, if you feel resistance, remove and try the other nostril.
$\checkmark$ Secure the catheter with tape above the upper lip (fig 3.3.4e).
$\checkmark$ A nasogastric tube should also be inserted when using high flow oxygen to help release excess air from the stomach. NG tube should be inserted in the same nostril so as not to obstruct both nostrils (fig 3.3.4e).
$\checkmark$ Adjust flow rate as for nasal prongs (table 3.3.4 above)

C) When using a Non-rebreather mask (NRM)
$\checkmark$ Use in the post resuscitation period to achieve over 85\% oxygen concentration in the inspired air/ oxygen
$\checkmark$ Ensure airway is clear - suction if necessary, position in the baby in sniffing position
$\checkmark$ Choose the correct size of mask - one that covers nose and mouth (Not the eyes or below the chin)
$\checkmark$ Connect the mask to the oxygen source and ensure the reservoir is filled with oxygen before placing mask on the baby (fig3.3.4f)
$\checkmark$ Adjust flow rate to $10-15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ to achieve target $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$

\begin{figure}

3.3.5 Titrating, Monitoring \& Stopping Oxygen therapy
- When oxygen is started, titrate every $15-30 \mathrm{mins}$ by $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ until $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ is $90-95 \%$ (for the first 10 minutes check the target $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ ). Change the oxygen delivery methods and flow rates based on need
- If baby requires more than the high flow rate oxygen (preterm $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ \&term baby $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ), consider changing treatment to CPAP
- Stop titrating and begin close monitoring if the baby is clinically stable - no increased work of breathing, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ between $90-95 \%$ and no increase in work of breathing
- Monitor every 3 hours;
$\checkmark \quad$ Vital signs - $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$, respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature and tem
$\checkmark$ Work of breathing - Lower chest wall indrawing, sternal retractions
$\checkmark$ Nasal patency - assess for secretions and suction if necessary
$\checkmark$ Nasal mucosa for dryness - administer nasal saline drops if necessary
$\checkmark$ The oxygen delivery method (nasal prongs, catheter, non-breather mask) to ensure it is correctly placed and secured.
- Wean off oxygen slowly by reducing the flow rate by $0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ every $15-30 \mathrm{~min}$ while maintaining $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ between $90-95 \%$. Carefully examine for changes in the work of breathing and $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ to assess whether supplemental oxygen is still required.
- Once oxygen is stopped, recheck $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ after 1 hr , as late desaturation can sometimes occur
- Discharge only if baby has been stable with $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ greater than or equal to $90 \%$ and no increased work of breathing on room air for at least 24 hrs
- Document all assessments and interventions in the baby's file, nurses cardex and comprehensive newborn monitoring chart as appropriate
- Observe all IPC measure;
$\checkmark$ If humidification is required, change the distilled water in the humidifier daily (every 24 hours)
$\checkmark$ Discard the nasal prongs, catheter and non-breather mask after use
$\checkmark$ If no distilled water use water that is boiled for 10 minutes and cooled.

\end{tabular}

\subsection*{3.4 Providing guidance to the mother on the correct breastfeeding technique}

\subsection*{3.4.1 Indications for providing guidance on breastfeeding}
- Health workers must provide all mothers with guidance on how to correctly breastfeed their newborn baby. This is to include correct positioning and attachment.
- The guidance should be given before delivery, immediately after delivery and during the early postnatal period.
- Health talks, demonstrations and visual aids e.g. videos and pictures may be used

\subsection*{3.4.2 Items required}
- Hand washing sink with running water, soap and disposable hand towels or alcohol-based hand rub
- Comfortable sit for the mother
- A pillow
- Manikin - Baby Ann
- Breast models

\subsection*{3.4.3 Steps to teaching on breast feeding}

\section*{Step 1 Introduction to the session by engaging the mothers/participants to;}
- Describe hunger cues (see figure 3.6.3a below). Emphasize to feed as soon as baby is ready to feed and so not to wait for crying
- Name the parts of the breast using the breast models - the nipple, areolar and temporary milk containers at the margin of the areolar. This will build a rationale as to why it is important to have the baby open the mouth wide to compress on these milk containers. Same region compressed during breast milk expression
- Describe why mothers should drain one breast completely before switching to the next one - to ensure baby gets the hind milk that is rich in fat
- Emphasize the need for hand hygiene to optimize benefits of breastmilk and prevent infections
- Describe the most appropriate positions for breastfeeding small and sick neonates - Cross-cradle and football positions. Only these two positions will be demonstrated in the session.
- Identify the features that describe the correct positioning, attachment and effective suckling. See table 3.4.1 below

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Table 3.4.1 Correct Positioning, Attachment \& Suckling} \\

\hline - Baby releases breast when finished & - Mother takes baby off the breast \\
\hline - Mother notices signs of oxytocin release & - No signs of oxytocin reflex noticed \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Step 2 Demonstrate placing baby in the correct position}
- Have a participant wear the breast models and sit on a comfortable chair with a back rest or if on a hospital bed sit up straight with a pillow behind.
- Observe hand hygiene protocol
- For the Cross-Cradle hold (mother breastfeeding from the right breast) See fig 3.4.3a
$\checkmark$ Have a pillow on the laps to allow the baby to be at the same level as the breasts
$\checkmark$ Lay the baby on his side on the mother's laps, with the chest and abdomen against the mother's abdomen
$\checkmark$ When feeding on the right breast, hold the baby's head and neck using the left hand so that the left thumb is behind and below the right ear and the other fingers are behind and below the left ear of the baby
$\checkmark$ Let the baby's whole body lie on the left arm so it's easy to maintain the abdomen to abdomen position between mother and baby
$\checkmark$ Ask the participants to name the features of correct positioning
- For the Football hold (mother breastfeeding from the right breast) See fig 3.4.3b
$\checkmark$ Have a pillow on the side to support the mother's arm and allow the baby to be at the level of your breast
$\checkmark$ Support the baby in a semi sitting position facing the mother, with the bottom against the back of the chair.
$\checkmark$ Support the baby's back with the mother's arm closest to the baby.
$\checkmark$ When feeding on the right breast, hold the baby's head and neck using the right hand so that the right thumb is behind and below the left ear and the other fingers are behind and below the right ear of the baby
$\checkmark$ Let the baby's whole body lie on the right arm so it's easy to maintain the abdomen to abdomen position between mother and baby
$\checkmark$ Ask the participants to name the features of correct positioning

Step 3 Demonstrate the correct attachment of the breast into the baby's mouth (applicable for any baby's position) (see fig 3.4.3c \& fig 3.4.3d)
- Hold the breast with the left hand using a C-grip, with the thumb positioned at the margin of the areolar on the upper side and the index finger same position but on the lower side of the breast
- Gently compress and shape the areolar to conform to the shape of baby's open mouth.
- Touch the baby's upper lip with the nipple to get the baby to open his or her mouth wide
- Quickly bring the baby's shoulders and head to the breast as you quickly pull the baby towards you and introduce the breast into the baby's mouth. See fig 3.4.3e
- Extend baby's neck slightly so that when you pull him on the breast, the chin will reach the breast. Aim the nipple at the baby's upper lip
- Keep the breast compressed until baby begin to suckle
- DO NOT LEAN FORWARD TO TAKE THE BREAST TO THE BABY. Bring the baby to the breast

\end{figure}

\section*{Step 4 Ending a feed}
- Ask the participants to describe how the mother should end a breastfeed - Wait until baby lets go of the nipple
- However, if a baby has not attached correctly or if the baby does not come off the breast by himself after 20 to 25 minutes on a side, and the mother would like to switch breasts or rest awhile, the baby can be taken off the breast by first breaking the suction.
- To release the suction, insert the mother's little finger into the corner of baby's mouth, pushing the finger between his gums until a release is felt or heard. The mother can also try placing her finger on the corner of the baby's mouth and pulling the skin gently toward his ear.
- After taking the baby off the breast, the mother's bra flaps should be left down so that the air can dry her nipples. Air drying helps to maintain healthy nipples.

\subsection*{3.5 Expressing Breast Milk}

\subsection*{3.5.1 Indications for Expressing Breast Milk (EBM)}
- Baby cannot breast feed due to critical condition - can be fed EBM via nasal gastric tube or cup
- Premature baby who is unable to suck - mostly below birth-weight 1500 grams

\end{figure}

Step 2 Size the nasal/oral gastric tube. Measure the distance from the nose to the tragus of the ear, then to the midpoint between xiphisternum (epigastrium) and umbilicus (OGT measure from the corner of the mouth). Mark the tube at this point.

Step 3 Insert the nasal/oral gastric tube (Fig 3.7.3c)
1. Lubricate the tip of the NGT with breast milk/water
2. Slightly flex the baby's head
3. Insert the tube through the nose (NGT) or mouth (OGT) until the measured distance is reached
4. Secure the gastric tube on the cheek if it is inserted in the nose and on the chin if it is inserted in the mouth using a transparent medical adhesive (fig 3.7.3d and fig 3.7.3e)

Step 4 Confirm the position of the nasal/oral gastric tube
1. Aspirate 2 mls of the presumed gastric aspirate using a 2 mls syringe
2. Check that aspirate turns blue litmus paper pink.
3. If no aspirate is obtained, inject 2 mls of air down the tube using a 2 mls syringe and listen over the abdomen with a stethoscope
4. Before feeding always confirm the tube is in the correct position by making sure the mark of the measured distance is visible Fig 3.7.3d

Step 5 Using the Gastric tube. To be demonstrated to the mother until she is able to do it herself
- Keep the gastric tube well secured so as to maintain the correct position.
- Use the tube for the purpose it was inserted.
- For feeding purposes
- To prevent gastric distension during oxygen therapy via nasal catheter and CPAP - When used to feed, close it for 30 minutes after the feed then open it again.
1. Confirm the correct volume to feed
2. Observe hand hygiene protocol
3. Check correct tube placement
4. Pour correct volume of EBM needed in a cup
5. Remove the burrel from a $10-20 \mathrm{cc}$ syringe
6. Pinch the end of the NG/OG tube, open it and attach the empty syringe
7. Pour milk into the empty syringe, remove the pinch \& hold the tube above the baby. See fig 3.7.3f
8. Let the milk flow slowly by gravity

\subsection*{3.9.3 Performing a heel prick}

Step 1 Observe hand hygiene protocols and wear gloves
Step 2 Ensure baby is warm and manage pain by breastfeeding 2 min before, during and after the procedure
Step 3 Select the appropriate site as shown on fig 3.9.3 below. Also described in Section 2.8.6

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_31_fdc64cfdad4d136cdd69g-163.jpg?height=503&width=393&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=615}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig 3.9.3 Choose the appropriate site}
\end{figure}

\section*{Preferred site for heel prick}
- The lateral or medial side of the heel.
- At these point the bone is further away from the outer surface compared to the toe or posterior heel.
- Do not use toes or fingers

Step 4 Clean site with $70 \%$ alcohol; allow to dry for 30 sec. Too much compression of the cleaned selected site before pricking should be avoided as this may cause a deeper puncture than is needed to get good flow

Step 5 Use a disposable lancet to puncture the site to a depth of not more than 2.4 mm . For preterms use a 0.85 mm lancet. Puncture the skin with one quick, continuous and deliberate stroke, to achieve a good flow of blood and to prevent the need to repeat the puncture.

Step 6 Wipe away the first drop of blood because it may be contaminated with tissue fluid or debris (sloughing skin). Avoid squeezing the heel too tightly when collecting second drop because this dilutes the specimen with tissue fluid (plasma) and increases the probability of hemolysis

Step 7 When the blood collection procedure is complete, apply firm pressure to the site to stop the bleeding. Dispose waste appropriately. If more than two specimens are needed, a venipuncture may provide more accurate laboratory results.

\subsection*{3.10 Inserting an Intravenous (IV) Access \\ (provide the URL for global health video)}
3.10.1 Indications for IV access
- To administer IV fluids
- To administer IV medication

\subsection*{3.10.2 Items required}
- Hand washing sink with running water, soap and disposable hand towels or alcohol-based hand rub
- Gloves
- Cotton wool soaked in 70\% alcohol or alcohol swabs
- IV cannula gauge 26 (purple) or gauge 24 (yellow)
- Transpore medical adhesive
- 2cc syringe
- Water for injection
- Tunicate
- Dry Gauze
- Kidney dish or procedure tray

Step 3 Select the appropriate site as shown on fig 3.10.3a and 3.10.3b.
Step 4 Ensure good lighting and apply a tourniquet above the site selected
Step 5 Using gloved hands, clean site with cotton swabs with 70\% alcohol for 30seconds. Let it dry for a minimum of 30 seconds (fig 3.10.3c).
Step 6 Stretch the skin over the selected cleaned site to stabilize the vein to be punctured. Can use a tourniquet to obstruct the venous flow and make the veins more visible..

Step 7 Open the cannula and keep the opening of the needle facing up and puncture the vein at a10-0 angle. A slight flash back of blood into the needle will indicate you are in the vein. Pull the needle gently out as you gently push the cannula slowly forward into the vein.

Step 8 Press the distal end of the cannula to occlude blood flow. Discard needle in sharps container. Remove tourniquet and take samples then flash with sterile water slowly
Step 9 - Secure firmly with a clear medical adhesive. If using a limb, immobilize using a splint. Fingers/toes must be visible and the area around the tip of the catheter must be visible too. See figure 3.9.3e below. Assess the baby for pain and the site for swelling, redness or discharge. If any of these are present, remove the IV access and insert on another site.
