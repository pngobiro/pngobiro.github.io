NEONATAL SEPSIS

\section*{Objectives}

At the end of the lesson, the students will:-
- Define sepsis in a newborn
- Describe preventive measures of sepsis
- Diagnose sepsis in the newborn
- Manage sepsis in the newborn
- Organise appropriate referral procedure

\section*{NEONATAL SEPSIS}

A serious infection of the newborn's entire body

\section*{Risk factors}
- Maternal infection
- Prolonged rupture of membranes.( $>24 \mathrm{hrs}$ )
- prematurity/ low birth weight
- Prolonged labour
- Foul smelling amniotic fluid
- Risk of contracting intrapartum and postpartum infection is inversely proportional to gestational age.

\section*{Rationale}
- Single major cause of death in neonatal period ( $1 / 3$ of all the deaths)
- It may begin as an URTI, omphalitis, dermatitis or without any apparent source of infection
- Group B Haemolytic streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus and E. Coli are most likely causes of neonatal sepsis.
- Common viral agents include herpes simplex, HIV, CMV, and hepatitis B.
- The main source of infection are the mother and environment-staff, delivery area nursery and home
- Neonates are immunologically immature, with decreased polymorph nuclear leukocyte and monocyte function;
- premature infants are particularly so. Maternal IgG antibodies are actively transported across the placenta, but effective levels for all organisms are not achieved until near term. IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta. Premature infants have decreased intrinsic antibody production and reduced complement activity.
- Premature infants are also more likely to require invasive procedures (e.g., endotracheal intubation, prolonged IV access) that predispose to infection

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- A wide variety of infections should be considered in neonates who are ill, febrile, or hypothermic. Infections such as congenital rubella, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and CMV should be considered, particularly in neonates with abnormalities such as growth restriction, deafness, microcephaly, anomalies, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, or neurologic abnormalities.
- History taking
- when and where the baby was born, health status of the mother during labour
- Breastfeeding or not, crying a loud or weak and the general state of the baby
- Physical examination-observe the baby and note feeding habit, respiration, temperature, Cry, colour, activity, jaundice and any signs of eye infection

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
- The primary treatment is usually antimicrobial therapy
- Explain every thing to the mother and family including the urgency of the situation .
- Breastfeed as much as possible - top up with EBM via NGT
- Keep baby warm- hat, socks and gloves or kangaroo method
- Keep nostrils clear and observe breathing
- Orientate mother on care of the sick baby
- Keep nostrils clear and observe breathing
- Orientate mother on care of the sick baby
- I.m /iv gentamycin $2.5 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{kg}$
- i.m/iv crystapen penicillin 100,000iu twice a day for ten days.

\section*{TAKE HOME MESSAGE}
$\checkmark$ NEVER assume that fever in a newborn is unimportant or that a baby who doesn't breastfeed or appear discontent or restless will get better.
REMEMBER that sepsis is the major cause of death in neonates. Without adequate treatment they can die in 24-48 hours
${ }^{\checkmark}$ Don't treat a neonate with fever as if he had URTI
${ }^{\checkmark}$ DO NOT WAIT if you encounter any suspicious sign, its better to treat like sepsis

\section*{Neonatal Sepsis}

\section*{D AGEDO}

\section*{Definition \& Incidence}
- Clinical syndrome of systemic illness accompanied by bacteremia occurring in the first month of life
Incidence
- 1-8/1000 live births
- 13-27/1000 live births for infants < 1500 g

Mortality rate is $13-25 \%$
- Higher rates in premature infants and those with early fulminant disease

\section*{Early Onset}

First 5-7 days of life
Usually multisystem illness with prominent respiratory symptoms (probably due to aspiration of infected amniotic fluid)
High mortality rate
5-20\%
Typically acquired during intrapartum period from maternal genital tract
Associated with maternal chorioamnionitis

\section*{Late Onset}
- May occur as early as 5 days but is most common after the first week of life
- Less association with obstetric complications
- Usually have an identifiable focus
- Most often meningitis or sepsis

Acquired from maternal genital tract or human contact

\section*{Nosocomial sepsis}

Occurs in high-risk newborns \& is related to the underlying illness of the infant
the flora in the NBU/NICU environment
- invasive monitoring

Breaks in the barrier function of the skin and intestine allow for opportunistic infection

\section*{Causative organisms}

Primary sepsis
Group B streptococcus
Gram-negative enterics (esp. E. coli)
Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus, other streptococci (entercocci), anaerobes, H. flu
Nosocomial sepsis
Varies by nursery
- Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia, Proteus, and yeast are most common

\section*{Risk factors}
- Prematurity and low birth weight
- Premature and prolonged rupture of membranes
- Maternal peripartum fever
- Amniotic fluid problems (i.e. mec, chorio)
- Resuscitation at birth, fetal distress
- Multiple gestation
- Invasive procedures
- Other factors: sex, race, variations in immune function, hand washing in the NICU

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific
- Differential diagnosis
- RDS
- Metabolic disease
- Hematologic disease
- CNS disease
- Cardiac disease
- Other infectious processes (i.e. TORCH)

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Temperature irregularity (high or low)
Change in behavior
$\checkmark$ Lethargy, irritability, changes in tone
Skin changes
Poor perfusion, mottling, cyanosis, pallor, petechiae, rashes, jaundice
Feeding problems
Intolerance, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension
Cardiopulmonary
$\square$ Tachypnea, grunting, flaring, retractions, apnea, tachycardia, hypotension
Metabolic
Hypo or hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Cultures}
- Blood
$\checkmark$ Confirms sepsis
94\% grow by 48 hours of age
- Urine
$\checkmark$ Don't need in infants <24 hours old because UTIs are exceedingly rare in this age group
CSF
$\checkmark$ Controversial
May be useful in clinically ill newborns or those with positive blood cultures

\section*{Adjunctive lab tests}

White blood cell count and differential
- Neutropenia can be an ominous sign

I:T ratio > 0.2 is of good predictive value
- Serial values can establish a trend

Platelet count
Late sign and very nonspecific
ESR rises late
Other tests: bilirubin, glucose, electrolytes

\section*{Radiology}

\section*{CXR}

Obtain in infants with respiratory symptoms
- Difficult to distinguish GBS or Listeria pneumonia from uncomplicated RDS
- Renal ultrasound and/or VCUG in infants with accompanying UTI

\section*{Maternal studies}

Examination of the placenta and fetal membranes for evidence of chorioamnionitis

\section*{Management}

Antibiotics
Primary sepsis: ampicillin and gentamicin
- Nosocomial sepsis: vancomycin and gentamicin or cefotaxime
- Change treatment to specific antibiotics depending on culture sensitivity results

\section*{Supportive therapy}
- Respiratory
$\square$ Oxygen and ventilation as necessary
Cardiovascular
Support blood pressure with volume expanders and/or pressors
- Hematologic
$\checkmark$ Treat DIC with FFP
CNS
Treat seizures with phenobarbital
- Metabolic

Treat hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis
$\checkmark$ Correct electrolyte imbalance

\section*{Gram+VE Beta haemolytic Staphyococci (GBS) Prophylaxis}

GBS is the most common cause of early-onset sepsis
0.8-5.5/1000 live births
- Fatality rate of 5-15\%
$10-30 \%$ of women are colonized in the vaginal and rectal areas
Most mothers are screened at 35-37 weeks gestation
If +ve commence mother on antibiotics

\section*{Characteristics of Neonatal Sepsis}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Early Onset <7 days & Late Onset $\geq 7$ days to 3 months & Late, Late Onset >3 months \\
\hline Intrapartum complications & Often present & Usually absent & Varies \\
\hline Transmission & Vertical; organisms often acquired from mother's genital tract & Vertical or via postnatal environment & Usually postnatal environment \\
\hline Clinical manifestations & Fulminant course, multisystem involvement, pneumonia & Insidious, focal infection, meningitis common & Insidious \\
\hline Case-fatality rate & 5 percent to 20 percent & 5 percent & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
