Omondi S. Aluoch NEONATAL TETANUS

\section*{Definition}
- Tetanus an neurological disease characterized by an acute onset of hypertonia, painful muscular contractions (usually of the muscles of the jaw and neck), and generalized muscle spasms without other apparent medical causes.
- Only vaccine preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious

\section*{Cause}
- Clostridium Tetani
- An anaerobic bacterium
- Grows only in dirty wounds
- Gram positive motile bacillus
- Found in human and animal feces
- Found commonly in areas where soil is cultivated, in warm climates and during summer months

\section*{Mode of transmission}
- Acquired during delivery
- After delivery
- Through unsterile cord cutting
- Poor cord care
- Occasionally, unsterile circumcision, traditional operations
- Environmental and social factors: Unhygienic custom habits,Unhygienic delivery practices

\section*{TRANSMISSION:}

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Bacteria gains entry to newborn's body through umbilical stump cut by an unsterile instrument or treated in an unclean method
- Bacteria can only grow in dirty crusted umbilicus
- Neurotoxins produced after incubation of 3-10 days
- Neurotoxins reach nerves producing typical tetanus spasms
- Spores that gain entry can persist in normal tissue for months to years under anaerobic conditions.
- When the oxygen levels in the surrounding tissue is sufficiently low, the implanted C. tetani spore then germinates into a new, active vegetative cell that grows and multiplies and most importantly produces tetanus toxin - tetanospasmin and tetanolysin.
- Tetanolysin is not believed to be of any significance in the clinical course of tetanus.
- Tetanospasmin is and causes the clinical manifestations of tetanus.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Gradual onset of symptoms- age 3-14 days
- Inability to suckle due to spasm of the masseter muscles (trismus)
- Increasing rigidity of muscles especially abdominal
- Within 36hrs typical tetanus spasms follow
- Difficulty in breathing (laryngospasm) with cynosis
- Fever and local signs of umbilical infection

\section*{Clinical features}
* The baby develops progressive feeding difficulty
(reflex spasm of massetter makes feeding painful)
(pharyngeal muscles goes into spasm and cause dysphagia chocking)
- Spasm of larynx and respiratory muscles are induced by stimuli such as touch ,noise ,bright light, resulting in episodes of apnea and cyanosis.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Constipation persists until spasms are relieved, becomes rigid ,develops paralysis

\section*{Opisthotonos in tetanus}
, and may develop opisthotonic posturing(in extension) and experience painful spasm.
- Intercurrent infections, dehydration and acidosis complicate the clinical picture:

\section*{Other symptoms include}
- Drooling

- Irritability
- Uncontrolled urination or defecation

\section*{Management}
- General measures:
- Child nursed in quiet room closely monitored
- Avoid bright light, noise and unnecessary handling- these can precipitate spasm
- Clean umbilical stump and ensure it is dry

\section*{Management}
- Turn the child 3hrly to prevent pneumonia. Never turn the child to his back due to danger of aspiration
- Clear airway of secretion by suction as need arises
- Continuously monitor with a special intensive care chart

\end{tabular}

\section*{Specific treatment}
- ATS 10,000 U im or iv stat
- Newer preparations: human antitetanus immonoglobulin (HTIG) 500 U (still very expensive)
- PPF 50,000 U od for 1 week

\section*{Sedation}
- Sedate to control spasm but not so much that increase the danger of pneumonia
- Begin with diazepam $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ slow iv
- Ct with diazepam $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg}$ im and largactil 12.5 mg 6hrly by NGT

\section*{Sedation}
- Reduce dose once spasm reduce (become less severe)
- Pass NGT after primary sedation and give EBM to the baby to meet nutritional needs and keep the breasts active
- Assess the infant regularly for frequency and severity of spasm and depth of sedation on basis of respiratory rate and effort

\section*{Management}
- Tracheotomy if resp. is compromised
- Artificial respiration

\section*{Prognosis}
- Depends on nursing care and prevention of aspiration of secretions and pneumonia
- If incubation is short the prognosis is worse
- If the child survives, recovery is complete 2 wks to 2 months of onset

\section*{Prevention}
- Targets: i) delivery practices
ii) antenatal services
- Immunize all children against Tetanus. Give booster to all girls leaving school
- All pregnant women not previously vaccinated in ANC 2 inj. Of 0.5 ml TT to protect mother and the baby. Total of 5 inj. (doses) offers life protection

\section*{Prevention}
- Encourage hospital delivery
- Health education on proper handling of the cord (clean hands, delivery surface, cutting and cleaning ), postnatal visits
- Train and equip TBA and MCH workers
- Check your own method of handling the cord and equipment processing

\section*{Tetanus in older children}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Routes of entry:
- Wounds or on limbs eg jiggers, injuries, burns, unsterile vaccination or injections
- In children without external wound, consider CSOM

\section*{Clinical features}
- Same as in newborn;
- Inability to open the mouth
- Painful muscle spasms, without loss of consciousness
- Spasms involving back muscles result in arching of the back and may rais the child on his heels and neck (opisthotonos)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_04_bbf5fc8543289580a71eg-32.jpg?height=1640&width=2360&top_left_y=57&top_left_x=70)

\section*{Treatment}
- Test dose of ATS first then administer $50,000-100,000 \mathrm{U}$ i.m stat. if HTIG is available no test dose is given (no risk of Rxn) give in dose of 30-300U
- Tetanus toxoid 0.5 mls stat
- * PF 0.1gkg/day for 1wh

\section*{Treatment}
- NGT and IV line established
- Surgical wound cleaning
- Sedation- Diazepam $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ and CPZ (individually adjusted) 6hly according to severity of spasm
- Afterwards give full vaccination of TT or DPT-HepB+Hib

\section*{Tetanus prevention after a wound}
- Give TT 0.5 ml im stat (this is a booster as many children have been immunized in the $1^{\text {st }}$ year of life)
- If not sure of primary immunization, give HTIG 250U im, if not available ATS 10,000U im after an intradermal test dose of 0.02 ml

\section*{Tetanus prevention after a wound}
- Repeat TT (TT2)after 1month
- If wound is contaminated give a course of A/B
- Clean the wound
