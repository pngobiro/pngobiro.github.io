Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia

\section*{Objectives}
- At the end of the session the learner should be able to
- Define jaundice
- Describe the metabolism of bilirubin
- Classify the causes of jaundice
- Describe how to investigate and treat jaundice

\section*{Pioneers - neonatal jaundice and kernicterus}
- 1785-Jean Baptiste Baumes
- 1847-Jaques Hervieux
- 1875-Johannes Orth
- 1903-Christian Schmorl

\section*{introduction}
- Jaundice is the most common problem in neonate
- Most jaundiced children are perfectly normal
- Unconjugated bilirubin most common

\section*{Definition}
- Hyperbilirubinemia- $\uparrow$ serum bilirubin [Neonatal $6-8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day;Adult $3-4 / \mathrm{kg} /$ day]
- Jaundice - yellow discoloration of skin and mucus membranes

\section*{Formation of bilirubin}

\section*{Bilrubin is the end product of the catabolism of heme}

\section*{Major source of bilirubin is from circulating hemoglobin appr 75\%}

Berk, PD, Howe, RB, Bloomer, JR, Berlin, NI. Studies of bilirubin kinetics in normal adults. J Clin Invest 1969; 48:2176.

\section*{Sources of bilirubin}

\section*{1. Erythrocytic-Hemoglobin $-80 \%$ [ $250-400 \mathrm{mg}$ adults]}

\section*{2. Non erythrocytic}
- Myoglobin
- Cytochromes
- Catalase
- Peroxidase
- Tryptophan pyrrolase

\section*{Enterohepatic circulation}
- Bilirubin conjugates are unstable and are easily hydrolyzed to none conjugated bilirubin within intestinal lumen
- Bacterial Beta glucoronidase enzyme is responsible for deconjugation
- Enzyme ativity high with introduction of enteral feeding
- After hydrolysis the bilirubin can be reabsorbed across the intestinal mucosa to return to the liver via portal circulation

\section*{Fetal bilirubin metabolism}
- Bilirubin detected in amniotic fluid $12 / 40$
- Always unconjugated and excreted across placenta
- Disappears by 36-37weeks
- Uridine Diphosphoglucoronosyl transferase enzyeme activity is 0.1\% adult levels17-30/40

\section*{Birth changes}
- Newborns rarely jaundiced at birth except in severe hemolytic disease
- $\uparrow$ bilirubin at birth independent of gestation

\section*{Daily neonatal bilirubin production}
- $75 \% \leftarrow$ senescent RBC destruction
- $25 \% \leftarrow$ other sources
1. Non-erythropoeitic component
2. Erythropoieteic component

\section*{Physiological jaundice}
- Mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Develop in normal newborn
- Usually during 1-2weeks of life
- 5 to $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (86 to $103 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) but not $>17$ to 18 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(291$ to $308 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})$
- Develops $72-96 \mathrm{hrs}$ after birth

\section*{Causes:}
1. Increased RBC turnover-large vol of mature and immature erythrocytes precusors
2. decreased RBC lifespan 70-90 days compared to 120 days in adults

- в) increased enterohepatic circulation
- Breast milk jaundice
-develops in an estimated 2\% of breastfed term infants
-after the 7th day of life, with maximal concentrations as high as $10-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$
- reached during the $2 \mathrm{nd}-3 \mathrm{rd}$ week.
-If breast-feeding is continued, the bilirubin gradually decreases
- may persist for $3-10 \mathrm{wk}$ at lower levels.
- Phototherapy may be of benefit.
- etiology of breast-milk jaundice is not entirely clear
- may be attributed to the presence of glucuronidase in some breast milk.

Breastfeeding jaundice
-occur in the 1st week of life
-Hyperbilirubinemia ( $>12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) develops in 13\% of breast-fed infants in the 1st wk of life

\section*{Aetiology}
- may be due to
>> decreased milk intake with dehydration
»and/or reduced caloric intake.
-Giving supplements of glucose water to breast-fed infants is associated with higher bilirubin levels,
>> in part because of reduced intake of the higher caloric density of breast milk.
-Frequent breast-feeding ( $>10 / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ )
- rooming-in with night feeding
- discouraging 5\% dextrose or water supplementation
- lactation support

- Kernicterus $\equiv$ Bilirubin encephalopathy
- pathogenesis
- multifactorial
- involves an interaction between

- neuronal susceptibility to injury.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

\section*{Multifactorial involvement}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_02_1bc465bb9c73bf4afa7cg-063.jpg?height=977&width=1955&top_left_y=701&top_left_x=475)

\section*{Bilirubin toxicity-}
- Factors that Increases permeability of BBB or nerve cell membranes to bilirubin or
- Disruption of the blood-brain barrier
1. Asphyxia
2. Prematurity
3. Hyperosmolality
4. Infection

\section*{Mechanism of toxicity}
- Unclear but several postulations
1. Inhibits mitochondrial enzymes interfering with DNA synthesis
2. Induces DNA strand breakage
3. Inhibits protein synthesis and phosphorylation

\section*{Critical levels}
- Precise level of the bilirubin at which Kernicterus occurs unknown
- Encephalopathy develops $>30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in term healthy infants without hemolysis (21$50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )

\section*{Critical levels}
- All infants with hemolysis have risk directly proportional to the serum bilirubin levels
- VLBW infants $8-12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ associated with Kernicterus
- The less mature the infant the greater the susceptibility to Kernicterus

3. Olfactory area
4. Striate bodies
5. Thalamus
6. Globus pallidus
7. Inferior clivus
8. Putamen
9. Cerebellar and cranial nerve nuclei

\section*{Treatment Options}
- Phototherapy
- Exchange transfusion
- Drugs
- Alkalinization of plasma

\section*{treatment}
- Assess for jaundice in bright, natural light if possible, check the eyes, blanched skin on nose and the sole of the foot
- Always measure serum bilirubin if age < 24 hours and if clinically moderate or severe - Any jaundice if aged <24hrs needs further investigation and treatment
- Refer early if jaundice in those aged <24hrs and facility cannot provide phototherapy and exchange transfusion

\section*{Indications of phototherapy:}
- In a well baby with jaundice easily visible on the sole of the foot
- In a preterm baby with ANY visible jaundice
- In a baby with easily visible jaundice and inability to feed or other signs of neurological impairment and consider immediate exchange transfusion

\section*{Mechanism of action of phototherapy}
- Clinical jaundice and indirect hyperbilirubinemia are reduced by exposure to a high intensity of light in the visible spectrum.
- Bilirubin absorbs light maximally in the blue range ( $420-470 \mathrm{~nm}$ ).
$\square$ Broad-spectrum white, blue, and special narrowspectrum (super) blue lights have been effective in reducing bilirubin levels
$\square$ Bilirubin in the skin absorbs light energy, causing several photochemical reactions.

\section*{Mechanism of action of phototherapy}
structural isomerisation:
phototherapy refers to the use of light to convert bilirubin molecules in the body into water soluble isomers that can be excreted by the body.

The main structural isomer of bilirubin is Z-lumirubin.
structural isomerization is irreversible.
structural isomers of bilirubin are less lipophilic than normal bilirubin and can be excreted into bile without undergoing glucuronidation in the liver

Structural bilirubin isomers, like Z-lumirubin, can also be excreted in the urine.
configurational isomerisation:.
converting the toxic native unconjugated 4Z, 15Z-bilirubin into an conjugated configurational isomer 4Z,15E-bilirubin, which can then be excreted in bile without conjugation.

Configurational isomerization is reversible,
the configurational of bilirubin are less lipophilic than normal bilirubin and can be excreted into bile without undergoing glucuronidation in the liver.

Some of the configurational isomers of bilirubin, however, revert back to the native form after excretion into bile and can be reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation in the gut.

Photooxidation :

The absorptions of light by bilirubin also results in the generation of excited-state bilirubin molecules that react with oxygen to produce colorless oxidation products, or photooxidation products.

This process occurs more slowly than configurational or structural isomerization.

Photooxidation products are primarily excreted in the urine.

\section*{Kramer's rule}

Clinically jaundiced when the bilirubin level reaches $80-120 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_02_1bc465bb9c73bf4afa7cg-084.jpg?height=1260&width=2278&top_left_y=561&top_left_x=105)
- Stop phototherapy - when bilirubin 50 micromol/L lower than phototherapy threshold for the baby's age on day of testing

\section*{Phototherapy and Supportive Care Checklist}
- Shield the eyes with eye patches. -
- Remove periodically such as during feeds
- Keep the baby naked
- Place the baby close to the light source
- - 45 cm distance is often recommended
- but the more light power the baby receives the better the effect so closer distances are OK if the baby is not overheating especially if need rapid effect.
- May use white cloth to reflect light back onto the baby making sure these do not cause overheating
- Do not place anything on the phototherapy devices -
- lights and baby need to keep cool so do not block air vents / flow or light.
- Also keep device clean - dust can carry bacteria and reduce light
- Promote frequent breastfeeding.
- Unless dehydrated, supplements or intravenous fluids are unnecessary.
- Phototherapy use can be interrupted for feeds; allow maternal bonding.

Periodically change position supine to prone -
- Expose the maximum surface area of baby to phototherapy;
- may reposition after each feed.
- Periodic (12 to 24 hrs ) plasma/ serum bilirubin test.
- Visual testing for jaundice or transcutaneous bilirubin is unreliable.
- make sure that each light source is working and emitting light.
- Fluorescent tube lights should be replaced if:
- More than 6 months in use (or usage time >2000 hrs)
- Tube ends have blackened
- Lights flicker.
- Complications
- loose stools
- erythematous macular rash
- purpuric rash associated with transient porphyrinemia
- overheating
- dehydration (increased insensible water loss, diarrhea)
- hypothermia from exposure
- benign condition called bronze baby syndrome..
- Contraindication
- presence of porphyria.

\section*{Intravenous Immunoglobulin.}
- is an adjunctive treatment for hyperbilirubinemia due to isoimmune hemolytic disease
- Its use is recommended when serum bilirubin is approaching exchange levels despite maximal interventions including phototherapy.
- Intravenous immunoglobulin ( $0.5-1.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose; repeat in 12 hr )
- has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusion in both ABO and Rh hemolytic disease, presumably by reducing hemolysis.

\section*{Exchange Transfusion. - Introduction}
- An exchange transfusion involves removing aliquots of patient blood and replacing with donor blood in order to remove abnormal blood components and circulating toxins whilst maintaining adequate circulating blood volume.
- It is primarily performed to -remove antibodies

\section*{excess bilirubin in isoimmune disease}
- the incidence of exchange transfusion is decreasing
- secondary to the prevention
- improved prenatal management of alloimmune haemolytic disease
- improvements in the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia
- Indications
- 1. Alloimmune haemolytic disease of the newborn
- Remove circulating bilirubin to reduce levels and prevent kernicterus
- Replace antibody-coated red cells with antigen-negative red cells
- Severe hyperbilirubinaemia secondary to alloimmune haemolytic disease of the newborn is the most common reason for exchange transfusion in the neonatal intensive care unit.
- A total serum bilirubin level at or above the exchange transfusion level should be considered a medical emergency and intensive phototherapy (multiple light) should be commenced immediately.
- 2. Significant unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with risk of kernicterus due to any cause when intensive phototherapy is unsuccessful
- 3. Severe anaemia (where there is normal or increased circulating blood volume)
- 4
- . Antibodies in maternal autoimmune disease
- 5. Polycythaemia (to reduce haematocrit, usually accomplished with partial exchange transfusion using normal saline replacement)
- 6. Severe disturbances of body chemistry

\section*{-Double volume exchange transfusion is performed \\ - if intensive phototherapy has failed to reduce bilirubin levels to a safe range}
- if the risk of kernicterus exceeds the risk of the procedure.

\section*{procedure}
