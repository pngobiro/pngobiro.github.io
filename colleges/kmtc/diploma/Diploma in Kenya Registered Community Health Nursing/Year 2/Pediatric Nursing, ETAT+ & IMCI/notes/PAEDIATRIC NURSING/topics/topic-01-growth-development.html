                            <p>All body systems undergo progressive maturation; concurrent development of skills allows infants to increasingly respond to the environment. Acquisition of these fine and gross motor skills occurs in an orderly head to toe and center to periphery sequence.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Proportional Changes</h3>
                            <p>Growth is rapid during the first year, especially the initial 6 months. Height increases by 2.5 per month during the first 6 months. Increase in length occur, sudden spurts rather than in a slow, gradual pattern. Average height is 65cm at 6 months and 74cm at 12 months. By 1 year the length has increased by almost 50%. This occurs mainly in the trunk rather than the legs and contributes to the characteristic physique of the older infants.</p>
                            
                            <p>Head growth is rapid and an important determinant of brain growth. Head circumference increases approximately 2 cm per month from birth to 3 months, 1 cm per month from 4 to 6 months. The average head size is 43 cm at 6 months and 46 cm at 12 months. By 1 year, the head size has increased by almost 33%.</p>

                                    <p>Closure of cranial sutures occurs, with the <strong>posterior fontanelle</strong> fusing at 6 to 8 weeks and the <strong>anterior fontanelle</strong> closing by 12 to 18 months of age.</p>

                            <p>It is important to note that genetic, metabolic, environments and nutritional factors strongly influence infant growth. Use appropriate growth charts reflecting weight for length and head circumference in each case to determine appropriate growth parameters. Expanding head size reflects the growth and differentiation of the nervous system.</p>
                            
                            <p>The chest assumes a more adult contour, with the lateral diameter becoming larger than the anterioposterior diameter. The heart grows less rapidly than the rest of the body does; its weight is usually doubled by 1 year of age, where as the body weight triples over the same period.</p>

                            <p>Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development has eight distinct stages and he assumes that a crisis occurs at each stage of development. Successful completion of each stage results in a healthy personality and the acquisition of basic virtue whereas failure to successfully complete a stage can result in a reduced ability to complete further stages and therefore a more unhealthy personality and sense of self.</p>

                                        <h4>1. Trust vs. Mistrust</h4>
                                        <p>During this stage the infant is uncertain about the world in which they live and infant looks towards their primary caregiver for stability and consistency of care. Infants will develop a sense of trust if they receive consistent, predictable and reliable care. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of <strong>hope</strong>. Failing to acquire the virtue of hope will lead to the development of fear.</p>

                                        <h4>2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt</h4>
                                        <p>At this stage the child is mobile and developing physically children begin to assert their independence by walking away from their mother, picking which toy to play with discovering that he or she has many skills and abilities, Such skills illustrate the child's growing sense of independence and autonomy. Children should be allowed to explore the limits of their abilities within an encouraging environment which is tolerant of failure. The aim has to be “self-control without a loss of self-esteem”. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of <strong>will</strong>.</p>

                                        <h4>3. Initiative vs. Guilt</h4>
                                        <p>During this period the primary feature involves the child regularly interacting with other children at school. Central to this stage is play. Children begin to plan activities, make up games, and initiate activities with others. If given this opportunity, children develop a sense of initiative. Conversely, if this tendency is marred, either through criticism or control, children develop a sense of guilt. A healthy balance between initiative and guilt is important. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of <strong>purpose</strong>.</p>

                                        <h4>4. Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority</h4>
                                        <p>Children are at this stage will be learning to read and write, to do sums, to do things on their own. The child’s peer group will gain greater significance. If children are encouraged and reinforced for their initiative, they begin to feel industrious. If this initiative is not encouraged, if it is restricted by parents or teacher, then the child begins to feel inferior. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of <strong>competence</strong>.</p>

                                        <h4>5. Identity vs. Role Confusion</h4>
                                        <p>This is the transition period from childhood to adulthood. Children are becoming more independent, and begin to look at the future. It is during this stage that the adolescent will re-examine his identity and try to find out exactly who he or she is. Success in this stage will lead to the virtue of <strong>fidelity</strong>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Weight for age below 3rd percentile or a downward change crossing two major growth percentiles.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management:</strong> Provide sufficient calories for 'catch up' growth. Add calorie density to feeds, multivitamins. Treat co-existing conditions. Provide positive feeding environment.</p>

                            <h4>Obesity</h4>
                            <p>Excess accumulation of fat. Causes include dietary factors, habits (computer games), decreased energy expenditure, and genetics.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management:</strong> Reduced calorie intake (less sweets/junk), encourage physical activity, behavior modification.</p>

                            <h4>Short Stature</h4>
                            <p>Height less than 2 SD below the mean. Can be proportionate (chronic infection, renal failure) or disproportionate (skeletal growth abnormality).</p>

                            <h4>Tall Stature</h4>
                            <p>Height more than 2 SD above the mean. Causes: Hereditary, cerebral gigantism, acromegaly, chromosomal abnormality (Klinefelter). Most are normal/genetic.</p>
