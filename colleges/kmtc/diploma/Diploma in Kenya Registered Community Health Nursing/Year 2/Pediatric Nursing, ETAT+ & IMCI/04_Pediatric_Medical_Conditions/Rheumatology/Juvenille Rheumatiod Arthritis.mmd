\section*{Juvenille Rheumatiod Arthritis}

\section*{Objectives}
- Define JRA
- Describe the etiology and pathogenesis
- Detail the clinical presentations and diagnostic criteria
- Describe the laboratory findings
- Describe the radiologic features
- Plan the management

\section*{Introduction}
- Commonest rheumatic disorder in children
- American college of Rheumatology classifies it as a category of diseases, with 3 types of onset:
1. Oligo- arthritis (pauciarticular) dx.
2. Polyarthritis
3. Systemic onset dx

\section*{Criteria for Diagnosis}
- Age of onset < 16 yrs .
- Arthritis (Swelling or effusion) presents as $\geq 2$ of limitation of movements, tenderness, or pain on motion, and increased heat in one or more joints.
- Duration of symptoms >6 weeks
- Exclusion of other forms of juvenile arthritis

\section*{Etiology}

Unknown, but 2 events are considered necessary:
1. Immunogenetic susceptibility - HLA subtypes show increased risk or may be protective.
2. External( Environmental) triggers;
- Viruses- parvovirus, rubella, EBV.
- Host hyper- reactivity to specific self antigens ( Type 2 collagen),
- Enhanced T- cell reactivity to bacterial and mycobacterial heat shock proteins.

\section*{pathogenesis}
- Synovitis characterized by villous hypertrophy, hyperplasia and hyperemia, oedema of sub-synovial tissues.
- Vascular endothelial hyperplasia- with infiltration of mononuclear and plasma cells
- Pannus formation occurs in advanced dx- results in progressive erosion of articular cartilage and contiguous bone.
- T-cell recruitment of different clonal expansions especially HLA DR4, DR8, DR5.
- T- cell activation leads to a cascade of events leading to tissue damage, B-cell activation, complement consumption, cytokine release.

\section*{Clinical presentations}
- Morning stiffness and gelling
- Easy fatigue -especially early afternoon
- Joint pains - latter in the day
- Joint swelling - warm, restricted motion, may be painful
- Oligo arthritis; Common in lower limbs, but hip unlikely.
- commoner in females, younger age
- Polyarthritis;
- large and small joints affected (Min 5 joints, max 40 )
- Assos rheumatoid nodules on extensor surfaces of elbows, and over achilles tendon associated with severe dx.
- commoner in females, older age
- Micrognathia - reflect TMJ involvement
- Cervical spine involvement common, associated with atlantoaxial sub-laxation.

\section*{Systemic onset dx}
- Quotidian fever, with daily temp spikes of 39C. for $\geq 2$ weeks.
- Associated faint erythematous macular rash.

Associated linear or circular lesions over trunk and proximal extremities.
- Prominent visceral involvement with; hepatospleenomegally, lymphadenopathy, serositis- pericardial effusion
- Arthritis may be pauci/polyarticular

\section*{Laboratory findings}

Non specific;
- $\uparrow$ ESR, $\uparrow$ CRP ,
- leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anaemia of chronic illness.
- + ANA (40-80\% poly/ pauci dx, rare in systemic onset dx). Assos with uveitis.
- + Rheumatoid factor; common in older children, polyarticular dx, poor prognosis.
- Abnormal bone mineral metabolism, especially appendicular cortical bone,
- $\uparrow$ IL- 6 reduces bone formation leading to low osteocalcinin and reduced bone-specific alkaline phosphatase

\section*{Radiologic changes}
- Soft tissue swellings
- Osteporosis
- Periostitis
- Accelerate regional epiphyseal closure
- Subchondral erosions
- Narrowing of cartilage space
- Bone destruction and fusion
- Severe dx seen in neural arches of C2, C3.
- MRI scan useful.

\section*{Complications}
- Eye: chronic iridocyclitis, - present with small irregular pupils.
- Uveitis,
- Keratopathy
- Cataracts
- Anaemia- seen in active dx or prolonged dx.
- Usually unresposive to iron.
- May be exacerbated by GIT bleed assos with NSAIDS.
- May be a haemolytic anaemia
- may be complication of macrophage activation syndromeassoc with leucopemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and hepatospleenomegally.
- May develop features of SLE- esp polyarticular dx
- Orthopaedic complications
- Psychosocial issues

\section*{Management}

Start with the mildest drugs and escalate in severe dx;
- NSAIDS
- Hydroxychloroquine
- Methotrexate
- Immune suppressants
- Steroids- only for severe dx
