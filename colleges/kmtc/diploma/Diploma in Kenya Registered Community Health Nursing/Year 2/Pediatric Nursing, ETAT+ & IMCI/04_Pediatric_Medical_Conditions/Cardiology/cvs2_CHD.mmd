\section*{Congenital Heart Disease}
- Abnormalities of the heart/great vessels since birth
- Incidence higher in premature infants
- Faulty embryogenesis during 3-8 weeks of IU life
- Cause - unknown
- genetic or environmental
- rubella infection, drugs, heavy drinking during pregnancy

\section*{Classification}
1. Malpositions of Heart Dextrocardia may be accompanied by situs inversus
2. Shunts (Cyanotic CHD)
3. Obstructions (Obstructive CHD)

\section*{Shunts}
A. Left to Right shunts (Acyanotic or Late Cyanotic group) cyanosis months or years after birth
1. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) -25-30\%
2. Atrial septal defect (ASD)- $10-15 \%$
3. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)- 10-20\%
B. Right to Left shunts (Cyanotic group)
1. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)- 6-15\%
2. Transposition of great arteries $-4-10 \%$
3. Persistent truncus arteriosus - $2 \%$
4. Tricuspid atresia and stenosis 1\%

\section*{Obstructions}
1. Coarctation of Aorta $5-7 \%$
2. Aortic stenosis and atresia $4-6 \%$
3. Pulmonary stenosis and atresia 5-7\%

\section*{Shunts}

Abnormal communication b/w 2 chambers or blood vs; blood flows according to pressure gradient
$\mathbf{R} \rightarrow \mathbf{L}$ shunt:
- $\downarrow$ pulm blood flow $\rightarrow$ poor oxygenation of blood $\rightarrow$ enters Lt heart $\rightarrow$ systemic circulation $\rightarrow$ dusky blueness of mucus membranes and skin (Cyanosis)
- Functional anemia $\rightarrow$ increased synthesis of $\mathrm{Hb}+$ RBC mass (polycythemia)
- Emboli from peripheral veins donot undergo filteration action of lungs $\rightarrow$ enter Lt heart $\rightarrow$ embolize to systemic circulation(paradoxical emboli) $\rightarrow$ cause brain infarction \& abscess
- Clubbing (hypertrophic osteoarthropathy) of tips of fingers and toes

\section*{Shunt}

\section*{$\mathbf{L} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ shunt:}
- $\uparrow$ pulm blood flow $\rightarrow \uparrow$ pulm pressure $\rightarrow$ RVH $\rightarrow$ potential cardiac failure
- $\uparrow$ pulm blood flow $\rightarrow$ medial hypertrophy + intimal proliferation to prevent pulmonary edema.
- prolonged $\uparrow$ pulm pressure $\rightarrow$ (> even systemic pressure) $\rightarrow$ reversing the flow from $\mathrm{R} \rightarrow \mathrm{L}$ : unoxygenated blood in systemic © $\rightarrow$ late cyanosis or Eisenmenger syndrome
- Once significant pulmonary HT develops, surgical Rx of cardiac defects not possible

\section*{Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)}
- Hole between the two ventricles, incomplete closure of ventricular septum
- Left to right shunt - majority
- Dilated right heart - too much blood to lungs - increase in pulmonary pressure
- Morphology:
- $90 \%$ in membranous septum
$-10 \%$ lie below pulm valve or within muscular septum
- Mostly single. Multiple VSDs in muscular septum: Swiss cheese septum

\section*{VSD}

Cl features: depend on size of lesion
- Small lesions recognized later or may spontaneously close
- Large VSDs recognized early in life, cause Lt-Rt shunts
$\rightarrow$ volume hypertrophy of RV $\rightarrow$ pulmonary HT since
birth. Ultimately, shunt reversal, cyanosis, death
- Not corrected till 1 yr to wait for spontaneous closure

\section*{Atrial Septal Defect}
- Abnormal fixed opening in atrial septum caused by incomplete tissue formation
- Not to confuse with patent foramen ovale present in $30 \%$ of normal individuals
- Unnoticed in infancy and childhood
- Usually presents late in life (30), late cyanotic heart dis.
- $\mathrm{L} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}$ shunt at atrial level (pulm vascular resistance is less than systemic and compliance of Rt ventricle is greater than Lt )
- Pulm blood flow increased to 2-4 times, hypertrophy of RA and RV
- Pulmonary HT, RHF unusual

Morphology: 3 types according to location
- Secundum ASD (90\%)- deficient or fenestrated oval fossa near centre of septum
- Primum ASD- occur adjacent to AV valves
- Sinus venosus- near entrance of SVC
- AVSD - Atrio ventricular septal defect

\section*{Patent Ductus Arteriosus}
- Ductus arteriosus is normal connection b/w aorta and bifurcation of pulmonary A
- Normally closes at $1^{\text {st }}$ or $2^{\text {nd }}$ day of life, > 3months persistence is abnormal
- Cause: possibly due to $\uparrow$ levels of PGE2 after birth
- seen in children with respiratory distress syndrome
- pharmacologic closure with indomethacin (PGE2 inhibitor)
- Most often does not produce functional difficulties at birth
- A narrow ductus: no effect on growth and development during childhood
- Harsh machinery like murmur

\section*{Right to Left shunts (Cyanotic CHD)}

1 Tetrology of Fallot (TOF)- 6-15\%
2 Transposition of great arteries -4-10\%
3 Persistent truncus arteriosus - $2 \%$
4. Tricuspid atresia and stenosis- $1 \%$

Cyanosis in early postnatal life

\section*{Tetralogy of Fallot}
- Combination of shunts with obstruction with functional shunting of blood
- Most common cyanotic heart disease
- 4 features:
1. VSD
2. Displacement of aorta to right side so that it overrides the septal defect
3. Sub-pulmonary stenosis (obstruction)
4. Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Clinical manifestations dependant on extent of pulmonary stenosis \& VSD
- 2 types: Cyanotic and Acyanotic (pink tetralogy)
- Cyanotic:
- Pulm stenosis is greater $\rightarrow \uparrow$ resistance to flow of blood in RV $\rightarrow$ it flows to LV $\rightarrow$ Cyanosis
- Effects: - pressure hypertrophy of RA and RV
- small tricuspid valve
- small It atrium \& ventricle
- enlarged aortic orifice
- Acyanotic tetrology:
- VSD larger, pulmonary stenosis mild: $L \rightarrow R$ shunt, behaves like isolated VSD

\section*{Transposition of Great arteries}
- Regular transposition:
- Aorta arises from RV and Pulmonary A from LV cyanosis from birth
- Corrected Transposition:
- Aorta arises from RV, Pulmonary A from LV + Pulm veins drain into RA, Sup and Inf vena cava into LA
- Physiologically corrected circulation

\section*{Persistent Truncus Arteriosus}
- Arch that separates aorta from pulmonary A fails to develop. A single large vessel receives blood from both the ventricles
- Often associated VSD
- Early systemic cyanosis
- Poor prognosis

Tricuspid Atresia and stenosis
- Often associated with pulmonary stenosis or atresia
- Atresia- absence of tricuspid orifice, there is dimple in floor of rt atrium
- Stenosis- tricuspid ring is small

\section*{Obstructions (Obstructive CHD)}

\section*{Coarctation of Aorta:}
- Localised narrowing in any part of the aorta
- More common in males, females with Turner syndrome
- Postductal or adult type
- Obstruction is just distal to ductus arteriosus which is closed
- Characterized by HT in upper extremities, weak pulses and low BP in the lower extremities, effects of arterial insufficiency such as coldness and claudication
- With time, development of collaterals b/w pre-stenotic and post- stenotic segment with enlargement of intercostal arteries $\rightarrow$ rib erosion
- Preductal or Infantile type:
- narrowing proximal to ductus arteriosus which remains patent
- lower half of body cyanosed while upper part of body receives blood from aorta

\section*{Aortic stenosis and atresia}
- Most common anomaly of aorta is congenital bicuspid valve. Not much functional significance except predisposes it to calcification
- Congenital aortic atresia rare \& incompatible with life
- Aortic stenosis- congenital or acquired(RHD)
- 3 types of congenital AS:
1.Valvular: cusps thickened and malformed
2.Subvalvular: thick fibrous ring under the aortic valve
3.Supravalvular: uncommon
- May be assoc with hypoplastic heart synd: fatal in neonates

\section*{Pulmonary Stenosis and Atresia}
- Stenosis
- commonest form of obstructive CHD
- occurs as component of TOF or isolated defect
- fusion of cusps of pulmonary valve forming diaphragm like obstruction
- Atresia
- no communication b/w rt ventricle \& lungs
- blood goes to left heart through interatrial septal defect and enters lungs via PDA
