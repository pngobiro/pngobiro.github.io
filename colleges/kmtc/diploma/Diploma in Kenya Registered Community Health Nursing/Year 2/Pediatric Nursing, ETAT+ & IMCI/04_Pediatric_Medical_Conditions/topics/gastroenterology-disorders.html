                        <ul>
                            <li>Observe the abdomen for contour and any markings while the child is standing and when lying down.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Because percussion and palpation will stimulate the small bowel and increase bowel sounds, auscultation should precede these two techniques.</li>
                            <li>Bowel sounds are heard as tinkling, irregular sounds that indicate that fluid is moving from one section of the bowel to the next.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Percussion</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On the right side, percuss for the liver. Confirm on palpation.</li>
                            <li>Liver dullness can frequently be outlined to determine size of the liver.</li>
                            <li>Percuss over the left upper quadrant (LUQ).</li>
                            <li>Percussion over a gas-filled bowel or stomach results in a highpitched, hollow sound.</li>
                            <li>Percuss the lower abdomen, particularly above the symphysis pubis.</li>
                            <li>Above the symphysis pubis, a filled bladder can produce a duller sound, as does a pregnant uterus.</li>
                            <li>The liver is frequently felt about 1 cm-2 cm below the right costal margin. This is a common finding in the neonate and through the early school-age years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Palpation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Divide the abdomen into imaginary quadrants, palpating each with the fingertips.</li>
                            <li>In the RUQ, palpate for the liver edge.</li>
                            <li>Although the liver is easily palpable in most children, you may have to press quite firmly.</li>
                            <li>In the LUQ, palpate for the spleen. Less resistance is encountered as you feel up under the left costal margin.</li>
                            <li>In the upper quadrants, deeply palpate for the kidneys to make sure there is no enlargement of the kidney. Normally, the kidney is not palpable.</li>
                            <li>In the iliac fossa or the left lower quadrant, palpate for the descending bowel. This can be felt, particularly if it's filled with firm stool. It may be slightly tender, but it should not cause severe pain on gentle palpation.</li>
                            <li>Palpate on the right RLQ where the appendix is located. The only sensation is that of gas-filled bowel. Tenderness in this area could be related to an inflamed appendix.</li>
                            <li>If the child has pain in any area when asked to show where the pain is, avoid the area demonstrated, and leave it until last. Note whether the pain is with pressure or rebound.</li>
                            <li>Palpate around the umbilicus for any masses that may indicate a hernia. As you press over the protruding hernia you can feel the sensation of gurgling under your fingers as the bowel returns to the abdomen.</li>
                            <li>Most of these hernias heal naturally by age 6 years. A hernia above the umbilicus can be revealed by asking the child to lift his head from the table. (Widening of the muscles above the umbilicus is called diastasis recti)</li>

                            <li>Nurse in the supine position prop infant at 30 -degree angle; minimizes regurgitation of gastric contents up the distal TEF, decrease the work of breathing and improve oxygenation.</li>
                            <li>NPO; I.V. fluids.</li>
                            <li>RX co morbidities, such as pneumonitis and HF.</li>

                            <li>Administer antibiotics as ordered to prevent or treat associated pneumonitis.</li>
                            <li>Premature care; temperature control, O2, early fluid and dextrose solution resuscitation to limit the problems of apnoea, respiratory distress and hypoglycaemia.</li>
                            <li>Care of parents; give an honest appraisal of the situation. In absence of associated severe congenital abnormalities, prognosis for survival is excellent.</li>
                            <li>Surgical management: Thoracotomy with division and ligation of TEF and end to end anastomosis of esophagus. This can be a single procedure or done in stages.</li>

                            <li>Celiac disease (CD), also called gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is a disease of the small intestines characterized by a permanent inability to tolerate dietary gluten.</li>

                            <li>50x more common in Down syndrome</li>
                            <li>Chronic malabsorption syndrome due to sensitivity to protein, particularly the gluten protein found in grains (wheat, barley, rye, oats)</li>
                            <li>Gluten consists of two proteins i.e. gluten and gliadin. The harmful protein is gliadin</li>
                            <li>When children with celiac disease ingest such protein, changes occur in the intestinal mucosa or villi that prevent absorption of foods across the intestinal villi into the bloodstream; Most noticeable malabsorption developed is inability to absorb fat</li>
                            <li>Celiac panel screening (antigliadin antibodies, transglutaminase antibodies)</li>

                            <li>The swollen engorged bowel is fragile therefore inclined to ulcerate, causing a break in the mucosal barrier</li>
                            <li>Digestive enzymes and intestinal bacteria act on the exposed tissue causing further irritation, inflammation, ulceration and bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Ulcers may become fissures and penetrate deeply into intestinal wall, fistulas to adjacent organs may occur</li>
