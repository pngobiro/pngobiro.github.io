                        <p>Impetigo is one of the most common skin infections in children. It can occur in adults but is seen far more often in children.</p>
                        <p>Impetigo is contagious and can be spread to others through close contact or by sharing towels, sheets, clothing, toys, or other items. Scratching can also spread the sores to other parts of the body.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">DEFINITION</h4>
                        <p>Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It causes red sores that can break open, ooze fluid, and develop a yellow-brown crust.</li>
                            <li>These sores can occur anywhere on the body.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ETIOLOGY</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Impetigo is caused by group of bacteria-streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus or Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.</li>
                            <li>Often these bacteria enter the body when the skin has already been irritated or injured because of other skin problems such as eczema, insect bites, burns, animal bites or cuts.</li>
                            <li>Children may get impetigo after they have had a cold or allergies.</li>
                            <li>skin-to-skin contact.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">RISK FACTORS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age. Impetigo most commonly occurs in children ages 2 to 5.</li>
                            <li>Crowded conditions. Impetigo spreads easily in schools and child care settings.</li>
                            <li>Warm, humid weather. Impetigo infections are more common in summer.</li>
                            <li>Certain sports. Participation in sports that involve skin-to-skin contact, such as football or wrestling, increases your risk of developing impetigo.</li>
                            <li>Broken skin. The bacteria that cause impetigo often enter your skin through a small skin injury, insect bite or rash.</li>
                            <li>poor hygiene</li>
                            <li>Other skin conditions, such as scabies or eczema</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TYPES OF IMPETIGO</h4>
                        <h5>Impetigo contagiosa</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This may also be called nonbullous impetigo, and is the most common type of impetigo in children. It is very contagious. This type of impetigo usually begins with red sores around the nose and mouth.</li>
                            <li>The blisters burst, leaving a weeping, red rash that becomes crusted.</li>
                            <li>This rash may be itchy but is not painful. Swollen lymph nodes may also occur with impetigo contagiosa.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Bullous impetigo</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This form of impetigo is most common in children under age two. Blisters usually appear first on the torso, arms, and legs.</li>
                            <li>These blisters may initially appear clear and then turn cloudy.</li>
                            <li>Blisters tend to last longer than blisters caused by other types of impetigo. The areas around the blisters may be red and itchy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Ecthyma</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the most serious form of impetigo because it affects the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin, rather than just the top layer.</li>
                            <li>Blisters tend to be painful and may turn into ulcers, or aggravated, open sores. Swollen lymph nodes and scars may also occur.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SYMPTOMS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>red sores that pop easily and leave a yellow crust</li>
                            <li>fluid-filled blisters</li>
                            <li>itchy rash</li>

                            <li>Sores that are filled with fluid, draining fluid, or crusted over</li>
                            <li>Areas that are red, swollen, and may itch</li>
                            <li>Swelling of nearby lymph glands (nodes)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Folliculitis occurs when the skin depressions that hold hair follicles become inflamed. In most cases, bacteria are the cause behind this skin problem.</p>

                        <p>Furuncles (boils) are skin abscesses caused by staphylococcal infection, which involve hair follicles. Furuncles are common on the neck, breasts, face, and buttocks. They are uncomfortable and may be painful when closely attached to underlying structures (eg. on the nose, ear, or fingers). Appearance is a nodule or pustule that discharges necrotic tissue and sanguineous (blood+pus). Furuncles may be accompanied by fever and prostration( fatigue).</p>

                            <li>Most Furuncles are caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria, which inhabit the skin surface, throat, and nasal passages.</li>
                            <li>These bacteria can cause infection by entering the skin through a hair follicle, small scrape, or puncture, although sometimes there is no obvious point of entry.</li>

                            <li>Oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics (to treat the infection): for 5 to 10 days; choices include trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole 160/400 mg.</li>

                        <p>A carbuncle is a red, swollen, and painful cluster of boils that are connected to each other under the skin. Usually single, a carbuncle is most likely to occur on a hairy area of the body such as the back or nape of the neck. But a carbuncle also can develop in other areas of the body such as the buttocks, thighs, groin, and armpits. This condition can cause permanent skin scarring.</p>
