\section*{Introduction}

Epilepsy "common" neurological problem.

50 million people have epilepsy globally; 20\% of them are children.

80\% of 3.5 million new cases of epilepsy from developing countries*.

\section*{Why General Pediatrician should be aware of Epilepsy?}

\section*{60\% of later age epilepsy has its "roots" in childhoood*.}

60 to 70\% of childhood epilepsy are manageable in community.

50\% of children with epilepsy have comorbidities**.

\section*{Why General Pediatrician should be aware of Epilepsy?}
$1 / 3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ children in cities \& 85\% children in rural areas with epilepsy either don't attend or are expelled from schools.

Treatment gap is more than $80 \%$.

Universally accepted high mis-diagnosis.

\section*{Definitions}

\section*{Seizure}

A transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in brain

\section*{Epilepsy}

Two or more unprovoked seizures more than 24 hrs apart - epileptic tendency
One Seizure with abnormal Neurological Examination Or EEG Or MRI

\section*{Situation related}

Seizures provoked by illness / metabolic disturbance / toxic event, does not denote epileptic tendency

\section*{Prodrome}

Mood or Behavior change that precedes a seizure
- A seizure is a temporary involuntary disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as impaired consciousness, abnormal motor activity, sensory disturbances or autonomic dysfunction.
- All seizures are not epilepsy
- 2 large categories
- Focal/ partial
- Generalized
- Febrile seizures is a special category
- Acute symptomatic seizures- acute problem affecting bra excitability such as electrolyte imbalance
- Unprovoked seizures
- Remote symptomatic seizures- distant brain injury
-Reflex seizures are usually precipitated by a sensory stimulus such as flashing lights

\section*{EPILEPSY}
- Disorder of brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological
and social consequences of this condition
- 1 unprovoked epileptic seizure+ $2^{\text {nd }}$ such seizure

OR
enough EEG or clinical predisposition
- More than 2 unprovoked seizures in $>24 \mathrm{hrs}$
- Seizure disorder- any one of the several disorders including
- Epilepsy
- Febrile seizure
- single seizures
- secondary to metabolic, infectious , or other etiologies
- Epileptic syndrome- manifests one or more seizure types specific age of onset and specific
- Epileptic encephapægmpsisevere EEG abnormality to result ircognitive
- impgingentpilepsy- genetic
- Symptomatic epilepsy- by an underlying brain disenghergenic epilepsy(presumed symptomatic epilepsy)ubuenydingorder which is not known

\section*{MECHANISMS OF SEIZURES}
- Underlying etiology- brain tumors, strokes, scarring or mutations
- Mutations can involve voltage gated channels,ligand gated channels and $\gamma$-amino butyric acid A receptors [ GABA A]
- Kindling- animal model for temporal lobe epilepsy
- repeated stimulation- activation of metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors as well as TrkB receptor , BDNF and neurotrophin 4
- Increase in intraneuronal - Activates CaMK2 and єadginephimant epileptogenic gene expression

\section*{Types of seizures}

\section*{Focal seizures :}
i. Originate from localized area of one hemisphere*.
ii. Common causes include
a. Idiopathic
b. Cryptogenic
c. Structural
iii. In young infants \& children focal seizures are very subtle.
* Epilepsia. 1999;40:439-44.

\section*{Focal seizures}

ILAE 1989 classification*
- Simple partial seizure (SPS) when consciousness is preserved.
- Complex partial seizure (CPS) when consciousness is impaired or lost.
- Partial seizure evolving secondary to generalized.
*Commission of classification and terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy. Proposal for revised classification of epilepsies \& epileptic syndromes. Epilepsia. 1989;30:389-99

This classification is still used as most physician are familiar with it, yet newer guidelines don't include these terms.

\section*{Focal seizures}

Characterized by aura, behavioral arrest, focal motor activity \& versive eye movements.

SPS can have motor, sensory, autonomic or psychiatric symptoms without loss of sensorium.

CPS is characterized by aura, altered sensorium, motor activity \& automatism.

\section*{Parietal lobe}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_04_67fa618eefb7da544fb6g-038.jpg?height=1382&width=1621&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=471)

\section*{Motor phenomena}

\section*{Frontal}

Auditory or sensory (smell

\section*{Temporal}

\section*{Occipital}

\section*{Parietal}
or taste) phenomena

Positive or negative visual phenomena

Contra lateral altered sensation

\section*{Partial Seizures}
- Simple seizures (no LOC)
${ }^{-}$Focal motor (Jacksonian)
- Sensory or somatosensory
${ }^{-}$Autonomic
${ }^{-}$Psychic
- Complex (impaired consciousness)
${ }^{-}$Involves some cognitive, affective sx
${ }^{-}$Temporal lobe, psychomotor seizures

\section*{Simple Partial Seizure}
- Usually lasts 5-10 seconds; most less than a minute
- Symptoms dependent on cortical area involved
- No loss of consciousness
- No postictal state
${ }^{-}$Difficult to differentiate between psychiatric disorders (key is paroxysmal nature and duration of seizure)
- EEG - normal or focal spikes

\section*{Complex Partial Seizure}
- Most common type of seizures
- Variable duration, but typically less than 3 minutes
- Appears awake, but not responsive - often stare or have automatisms
- If restrained, may become hostile or aggressive
- Postictal period - somnolence, confusion, and headache up for up to several hours
- No memory of what took place during seizure
- EEG - focal activity spreading to involve one or both hemispheres

\section*{Focal seizures}

Evaluation
- Age of onset
- History
- Characteristic

EEG.
These children have normal neurodevelopment
\& don't require extensive workup.

\section*{Focal seizures evaluation}

No neuro-imaging required in benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes RRCFFEPLRM\&MedieERilePseuro-imaging is required.

Request a prolonged or sleep deprived EEG or video EEG to increase the yield.

EEG shows focal slowing or focal spikes \& wave from involved lobe.

\section*{Generalized seizures}

Synchronous involvement of both cerebral hemispheres.

Important to differentiate them from focal seizure with very fast secondary generalization

\section*{Generalized seizures}

\section*{ILAE 1989 clissification*: \\ - Typical \& atypical absence \\ - Myoclonic \\ - Tonic \\ - Clonic \\ - Tonic - clonic}

\footnotetext{
*Commission of classification and terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy. Proposal for revised classification of epilepsies \& epileptic syndromes. Epilepsia. 1989;30:389-99
}

\section*{Generalized tonic clonic seizures}

Tonic phase is characterized by sudden loss of consciousness, generalized body stiffness, open eyes \& shrilled cry lasts for 10 to 30 sec followed by clonic phase for 1 to 2 min .

Clonic phase has alternative rhythmic clonic contractions \& relaxation of the body, cyanosis, salivation, incontinenence \& is always followed by post ictal phase of variable duration lasting for minutes to few hours.

In post ictal phase initially there is stupor followed by agitation confusion \& child may have headache \& vomiting.

\section*{Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure}
- Usually lasts 1-2 minutes
- Abrupt loss of consciousness, often preceded by scream
- All muscles become stiff (tonic) followed by twitching/jerking movements (clonic)
- Expect cyanosis, mouth injuries, or other bodily injuries
- Can be preceded by any partial seizure
${ }^{-}$Postictal period - usually deep sleep with hyperventilation then gradual wakening with complaint of headache
- EEG - series of generalized, high-amplitude spikes

\section*{Generalized tonic clonic seizures}

GTCS can be
a. Primarily generalized
b. Focal with secondary generalization
c. Part of other epileptic syndromes.
- Etiology is idiopathic (mainly genetic) while child with secondary generalization may have underlying focal lesion.

\section*{Generalized tonic clonic seizures}

EEG may be normal or show generalized spike \& wave followed by slowing in post ictal phase,

Focal findings indicate underlying focal structural lesion.

Neuro-imaging must be done in all children with first unexplained GTCS..

\section*{Generalized tonic clonic seizures}

Evaluation after first seigareful history \& examination
ii. Rule out
a. neuro-infections.
b. Febrile seizures.
c. Focal seizures by history of aura
d. Focal onset or post ictal Todd's paresis
e. Non epileptic events

Precipitating factors are sleep deprivation, photosensitivity.

\section*{GENERALISED SEIZURES AND RELATED SYNDROMES}
- ABSENCE SEIZURES
- Start at 5-8 yrs of age
- No aura, last for few seconds, flutter or upward rolling of eyes
- No post ictal period
- Hyperventilation can precipitate
- Atypical absence- associated myoclonic component tone changes are difficult to treat precipitated by drowsiness
$1-2 \mathrm{hz}$ spike and slow wave discharges
- Juvenile absence- at later age
$-4-6 \mathrm{hz}$ spike and slow wave, polyspike and slow wave discharges
a/w juvenile myoclonic epilepsy

\section*{Absence Seizure}
${ }^{-}$Usually lasts between 5-10 seconds; but frequently in clusters
- Considered a seizure disorder of childhood
- Absence before age 5 associated with mental retardation and tendency for future seizures
- Sudden staring with impaired consciousness with eye blinking and lip smacking for longer seizures
- EEG - characteristic generalized, 3 per second, spike and wave

\section*{Evaluation of Patient}

History :
i. Seizures -
. Age of onset
. Generalized/ focal; single/ multiple;
. Aura
. Sequence
. Loss of sensorium
. Injury due to fall
. Post-ictal deficit
. Recall of the event

\section*{Clinical Evaluation of Seizures}

HISTORY is the most important part of the clinical evaluation. Pointed questions are often needed.
Obtain as accurate of a description from patient and witness(es).

\section*{Clinical Evaluation of Seizures}

Before the seizure...
- Was there an aura?
- Was there an identifiable trigger?
- If there is a history of seizure, what are known precipitants or triggers.

\section*{Clinical Evaluation of Seizures}

During the seizure...
${ }^{-}$Was there signs of impaired consciousness?
- What was the patient actually doing?
- Was there loss of urine or stool?
- How long did the episode last?
- If h/o seizures, was this a typical/atypical episode?

\section*{Clinical Evaluation of Seizures}

After the seizure...
${ }^{-}$For the observer, was the patient postictal? If no observer, did patient know where he/she was, what had happened immediately after episode?
- If postictal, how long was it?
- Did the patient have any complaints when s/he became more awake?

\section*{Clinical Evaluation of Seizures}

Other history to obtain besides event history:
- Medical history: febrile seizures, head injury, CVA, malignancy, infectious diseases ,drug use or abuse
- Family history: febrile seizures, epilepsy in close relative, h/o neurological disorders
- Social history: travel, occupation, substance abuse
- When the environment is more calm, do a complete history and physical exam
- Spend time on a thorough neurological exam
- Correct any suspected underlying causes

\section*{Evaluation of Patient}

\section*{Evaluation of Patient}

\section*{Examination :}
- Clinical \& neurological examination
- Head circumference
- Dysmorphism
- Cutaneous marker- hypo/ hyper pigmented lesions, facial nevus
- Focal deficit
- Fundus examination

Laboratory Data
- UECs, Ca, Mg, CBC with differential, toxicology screens, RBS
- Drug levels if patient is on an anticonvulsant.

Consider...
- Lumbar pucture
- Holter monitoring and/or other cardiac evaluation
- Neurology consult

\section*{Investigations}

EEG :
- Recommended in all patients with paroxysmal event.
- Helps to distinguish seizure from non- seizure, classification of seizure type \& syndrome, deciding treatment \& focus localization.
- Video EEG needed for differentiating true seizures from non- seizure paroxysmal disorders \& presurgical evaluation.

\section*{Investigations}

Time to do EEG :
- Ideally should be done 3-4 days after seizure to avoid post ictal slowing.
- Sleep deprived EEG increases the yield.
- Photic stimulation \& hyper- ventilation helps

No need to stop AED before EEG.

\section*{Investigations}

Radiology :
- MRI better than CT- Head CT can be used if suspect mass lesion, hemorrhage, or large stroke. Also used if MRI is contraindicated.
- Indications for neuro- imaging :
- Seizures in early infancy
- Focal seizures (not indicated in benign partial seizure)
- neurbelonnagntal delayndicated in :
- Non-epileptic events
- Febrile
sqiewees (Rolandic) epilepsy
- Absence seizure

\section*{Pre-requisites before starting AED}

Is it epileptic or non epileptic event?

What is the seizure type?

Is it an epileptic syndrome?

What is the etiological diagnosis?

Whether provoked or unprovoked seizures?

\section*{Non-epileptic events}

20 to 30\% difficut to treat epilepsy are in fact NEE (Non-epileptic events)

Video EEG in doubtful cases.

Differentials vary according to the age of the patient.

\section*{Non-epileptic events}

Age related differentials include -
- Newborns (startle, jitteriness, sleep myoclonus)
- Infants (breath holding spells, sandifer syndrome)
- Beyond infancy (syncope, pseudoseizures, migraine variants, night terrors)
- Tremors, ticks \& stereotypes can occur at all ages.

\section*{Clinical Characteristics of Pseudoseizures}
- Strongly Suggest
o Prolonged duration of the event (10-30 minutes)
o Preservation of consciousness despite whole body jerking
o Bizarre and asynchronous motor movements
o Pelvic thrusting movements
o Not stereotyped
- Strongly Against
o Injuries sustained during spells
o Tongue laceration (especially the sides of the tongue)
o Incontinence

\section*{Seizure type}

Important to determine seizure type \& for diagnosing epileptic syndrome, etiological diagnosis \& choosing most appropriate AED.

Childhood Epilepsy Syndromes (CES)
- Conditions with common features such as age of onset, seizure type, EEG pattern \& prognosis.
- Comprises 10\% of childhood epilepsy.

\section*{Seizure type}

Childhood Epilepsy Syndromes (CES)
- Benign syndromes like benign rolandic epilepsy requires only EEG for diagnosis, \& has good outcome while infantile spasm has multi-factorial etiology \& requires specific treatment like steroids \& vigabatrin.
- Correct diagnosis of CES helps in specific treatment \& timely referred to pediatric neurologist.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Benign syndrome Age of onset} & Clinical features & Drugs & Outcome \\
\hline Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) & 5 to 7 yrs & Multiple absence seizures Hyperventilation 3HZ/s spike wave discharge & Sodium valproate Ehosuxamide Limotrigene & Good Remits by puberty \\
\hline BCECT & 4 to 12 yrs & Partial seizure Hemifacial motor In sleep Central focal spikes in EEG & No Rx for infrequent seizures For frequent seizures carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine & Good Remits by puberty \\

\hline Lennox Gestaut Syndrome & 1 to 8 yrs & Multiple seizure types Psychomotor retardation Generalized slow spike waves & Sodium valproate Limotrigene, Topiramate Zonisamide & poor \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Provoked vs unprovoked seizures}

Febrile seizures :-
- Seizure during fever in absence of neuro infection in a neurologically normal child.
- Occur between 3months to 5 yrs of age, with peak incidence at 18 months. Onset after 6 years is unusual.

\section*{Febrile seizures}
- Classified as
- Simple (SFS)
- Complex (CFS)
- SFS don't require EEG or MRI, LP indicated in all infants with fever \& seizures.
- Management includes treatment of acute attack, excluding neuro-infections, finding cause of fever, prophylaxis of future episodes \& parental counseling.

\section*{Febrile seizures}

SFS have good prognosis without any residual effect \& remits with age.

Indications for intermittent prophylaxis :
- Frequent seizures in short period.
- Seizure lasting for more than 15 min .
- Clobazam (0.75 to $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day for 3 days)

\section*{Febrile seizures}

Continuous prophylaxis has limited role, given in
- Failed intermittent prophylaxis.
- Frequent complex febrile seizures.
- Valproic acid or phenobarbitone used.
- Valproic acid preferred over phenobarbitone due to behavioral side effects of latter.
- Continued for 2yrs seizure free period or 5 yrs of age whichever is earlier.

\section*{Management}

Who needs treatment?

If yes, which drug, how long?

What are drug side effects?

\section*{Seizure Management - Medication}

When to start medication? Definitely start if:
- there is a structural lesion, such as tumor, AV malformation, infection
- EEG with a definite epileptic pattern
- history of brain injury or stroke, CNS infection, significant head trauma
- Todd's postictal paresis
- Status epilepticus on presentation

Otherwise, get neurology consult.

\section*{Treatment of Seizures}
- Provoked Seizures
- Treatment directed to the provoking factor
- Unprovoked Seizures
- First Seizure
- Usually no treatment
- Treatment can be initiated if risk of recurrence is high or if a second seizure could be devastating
- Second Seizure
- Diagnosis of epilepsy is established and risk of a third Seizure is high
- Most physician treat at this stage
- In children, some may wait for a third seizure

\section*{Management}

Management of first unprovoked seizure :
- Good history \& examination.
- Mostly a developmentally normal child with $1^{\text {st }}$ idiopathic GTCS doesn't require long-term AED .
- Neuro- imaging must be done to rule out granuloma

Indications of AED after $1^{\text {st }}$ seizure :
- Focal seizures
- Myoclonic seizures \& absence seizures
$-1^{\text {st }}$ episode of status- epilepticus
- Underlying structural lesion
- Severe parental anxity

\section*{Management}

Drug treatment :
- No ideal AED.
- Has to be individualized

Choice of AED depends upon
. Type of seizure \& epileptic syndrome
. Drug safety \& tolerability
. Age \& gender
. Ease of administration
. Lifestyle, pre- morbid condition

\section*{Management}

Principle of therapy :
- Monotherapy is best option \& is mandatory when treatment is started first.
- Always start monotherapy at low dose \& titrate slowly until seizure remit or adverse effects emerge.
- Monotherapy in appropriate dosage controls seizure in 70 to 80\% cases.

\section*{Management}

Principle of therapy :
- If seizures are uncontrolled by first drug, choose alternate monotherapy \& readually withdraw $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ drug.
- If seizures are still not controlled, refer to child neurologist. May require polytherapy, ketogenic diet or surgery.
- Before lebelling drug failure, always check compliance; rule out NEE \& progressive neurological disorders.

\section*{Treatment of Established Epilepsy}
- First Line
- Approved Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)
- Second Line (intractable epilepsy)
- Epilepsy Surgery
- Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy
- Experimental Therapy
- AEDs
- Implanted Devices

\section*{Management}

\section*{Duration of AED :}
- Generally given for minimum 2 yrs seizure free period in most of idiopathic generalized tonic epilepsies.
- AED is required for longer duration in symptomatic epilepsy, epileptic syndromes \& if there are multiple risk factors for recurrence.
- In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, small dose AED are required lifelong.

\section*{Management}

How to taper AED :
- Always individualized.
- Slow taper over 3-6 months after consultation with parents \& explaining risk of recurrence.
- Most epilepsies remit, relapse are reported in 11-41\% greatest risk is in 1-2 yrs after drug discontinuation.
- Restart previous AED, most patients will remit again.
- Risk factors for relapses- symptomatic epilepsies, structural brain lesions, abnormal neurological signs \& EEG

\section*{Management}

Therapeutic drug monitering (TDM):
- Not indicated in well controlled patients without adverse drug effects.
- Indications for TDM :
- Suspicion of non-compliance
- Intractable epilepsy
- Signs of toxicity
- Patients on poly therapy

\section*{Selecting AEDs}
- Type of Seizures
- Co-morbid conditions
- Side Effect Profile
- Pharmacokinetics
- Cost
- Compliance

\section*{Side Effects}
- Phenobarbital-sedation
- Valproate-weight gain, liver toxicity, decreased platelets, pancreatitis
- Sodium abnormalities-ox-carbazepine
- Lamotrigine-Steven's Johnson syndrome
- Topiramate-weight loss, language dysfunction, kidney stones, glaucoma
- Levetiracetam-irritability,agitation

\section*{Parental counseling}

Explain the nature of disease, regular treatment \& follow up. Maintain seizure diary, video record if possible.

Demonstrate domiciliary management of seizure.
Emphasize to treat the child like other children.
Maintain normal lifestyle with caution.

Explain that most children are normal \& their mental development would not be affected by drugs or disease.

Avoid precipitants like sleep deprivation \& alcohol.

\section*{Algorithm for epilepsy treatment}

Most appropriate First line monotherapy in low dose

\section*{Seizure uncontrolled}

\section*{Gradual increase the dose}

> If seizure recurs, increase to maximum tolerated dose/ side effects

Add alternate $2{ }^{\text {nd }}$ drug $\quad 1^{\text {st }}$ drug taper \& stop

Seizure persists

Check compliance
Re-evaluate
Rule out
progressive
disorder
NEE

\section*{ACTH}
${ }^{-}$Preferred drug for the management of infantile spasms
${ }^{-}$Dose and duration of therapy are not uniform.
- Prednisone is equally effective.
- A common schedule includes ACTH, 20 U/day (IM) for 2 wk, and if no response occurs, the dosage is increased to 30 and then $40 \mathrm{U} /$ day IM for an additional 4 wk .
- Unless seizure control is complete, ACTH is replaced with oral prednisone, $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ for 2 wk .
${ }^{-}$If the seizures persist, prednisone is given for an additional 4 wk .
- Side effects of ACTH include hyperglycemia, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, gastrointestinal disturbances, infection (including Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia), and transient brain shrinkage observed by CT scanning.
- ACTH and prednisone are equally effective for the treatment of cryptogenic and symptomatic seizures, and control can be expected in $\approx 70 \%$ of patients.

\section*{KETOGENIC DIET}
- Mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet is unknown,though some evidence shows that it exerts an anticonvulsant effect secondary to elevated levels of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate resulting from the ketosis.
- The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in association with the ketogenic diet, because the risk of hepatotoxicity is enhanced.

\section*{Treatment of Medically Intractable Epilepsy}
- An epilepsy that is not responding well to medical treatment
- Most expert agree if a patient fails adequate trial of 2 AEDs, his/her epilepsy is intractable
- 25-35\% of all epilepsies are intractable
- Medical treatment should be continued and other options should be explored

\section*{Treatment of Intractable Epilepsy "Other Options"}
- Epilepsy Surgery
- Removal of seizure focus
- Requires extensive evaluation
- Results are superior to medical treatment in patients who are good candidate
- Surgery is associated with a small risk; however, the benefit justifies the risk
- Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS)
- Not superior to medical treatment
- Advantage: compliance, no side effects
- Disadvantage: expensive

\section*{A Randomized Controlled Trial of Surgery in TLE (Wiebe et al, NEJM 2001)}
- 80 patients with TLE were randomized equally to medical treatment or anterior temporal lobectomy (36/40 underwent surgery) and followed for 1 year
- After one year; 58\% (64\%) of the surgical group patients were free of seizures that alter awareness vs. 8\% in the medical group
- Complications related to surgery occur in 4 patients; 1 thalamic infarct caused LT thigh sensory loss , 1 wound infection, 2 verbal memory decline
- One patient in the medical group died (unexplained), none in the surgical group
- Complications not related to surgery (depression, psychosis) were similar in both groups

\section*{Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS)}

- Animal experiments have suggested that electrical stimulation of the left vagal nerve will interrupt or prevent seizures.
${ }^{-}$In a double-blind trial of 60 children, 16 of whom were younger than 12 yr of age, left vagal nerve stimulation produced by an implanted device reduced seizures by 31-42\% over 18 mo , suggesting that it may be a safe adjunctive therapy for patients refractory to other therapies.

\section*{Status Epilepticus}
- Status epilepticus is defined commonly as repeated seizures without a return to consciousness lasting longer than 30 minutes.
- Most types of epileptic seizures can be manifested as status epilepticus.
- The 2 major types of status epilepticus,
A. generalized convulsive status epilepticus (major motor seizures and recurrent generalized tonic-clonic [GTC] convulsions) and
B. nonconvulsive status epilepticus (recurrent nonconvulsive seizures, which include absence status, partial complex status, and simple partial status),

\section*{Cont.}
-Convulsive status epilepticus is the most common emergency associated with neurologic disease because brain damage and death can result from the systemic consequences of repeated GTC seizures.
-Most persons who experience GTC status epilepticus have localized cerebral disturbances as a cause and therefore have secondary generalized partial seizures.

\section*{Cont.}
- Repeated cerebral epileptic activity can disrupt brain structures or cause permanent neurologic or intellectual deficits.
- Common causes of status epilepticus include CNS infections, toxins, ingestions (including AED ingestion), and drug withdrawal, such as from opiates or benzodiazepines.
- The most common cause of benzodiazepine withdrawal seizures is abrupt discontinuation of clonazepam use in patients undergoing longterm therapy for seizures or anxiety.

\section*{Cont...}
- Frequent repetitive GTC seizures create a life-threatening systemic condition of hyperpyrexia, failure of cerebrovascular autoregulation, acidosis, and severe hypoxia, causing hypotension, hypoperfusion of the brain, pulmonary edema, electrolyte disturbances, and eventual circulatory collapse.
- Even after cessation of status epilepticus and correction of systemic abnormalities, sepsis from aspiration pneumonia can be a late but life-threatening complication.

\section*{Acute Seizure Management}

Airway

Breathing

Circulation
- Airway management
- Gag reflex is suppressed during ictus
- Vomiting with aspiration
- Lateral recumbent position
- Remove dentures
- Consider endotracheal intubation
- Persistent seizure
- Induce with benzodiazepine

\section*{Cont...}

\section*{Treatment}
- Therapy must be directed at suppressing all ictal (electrical seizure) activity on EEG.
- Ictal EEG activity can show the following progression:
(1) discrete seizures,
(2) merging of seizures with waxing and waning of amplitude and frequency in variable locations,
(3) continuous ictal activity,
(4) continuous ictal activity intermixed with periods of isoelectric EEG, and
(5) a periodic lateralized or generalized epileptic discharge pattern.

\section*{Cont...}
- Treatment of status epilepticus consists of correction of glucose, electrolyte, magnesium, and calcium disturbances; control of blood pressure and oxygenation; and the administration of benzodiazepines and a series of routine anticonvulsants.
- At home, caregivers and parents can administer rectal diazepam, which is absorbed rapidly through blood vessels, while they call to emergency medical personnel.

\section*{TREATMENT OF SE}
${ }^{-}$Initial treatment begins with an assessment of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
- Best managed in an intensive care unit.
- Secure oral airway and inspected for patency
- Monitor pulse, temperature, respirations, and blood pressure, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Sats
- Remove excessive oral secretions by gentle suction
- Give oxygen via well fitting mask
- Intubate and start assisted ventilation if patient not responding to oxygen via mask/ambu bagging
- Insert an NGT and an IV catheter
- If hypoglycemia is confirmed by Dextrostix, a rapid infusion of $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ of 10\% dextrose is provided.
- Take blood for a CBC,UECs,Ca, Mag,Phos, lactate, and anticonvulsant levels, if indicated and ABGs
- Blood and urine may be obtained for metabolic studies and toxicology,
- Remember that some drugs potentiate or precipitate status epilepticus (amphetamines, cocaine, phenothiazines, theophylline in toxic levels, tricyclic antidepressants).
- LP unless contraindicated. In this case, appropriate antibiotics should be administered, followed by imaging studies, before a lumbar puncture is attempted.
- If the seizures are refractory to the front-line anticonvulsants or if the patient is paralyzed and is on a respirator, continuous EEG monitoring is important to assess the frequency of seizure discharges, their location, and the response to anticonvulsant therapy.

\section*{Acute Seizure Management - Status Epilepticus}

\section*{Benzodiazepines}
- Lorazepam - $0.05-0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV administered slowly at $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ up to 10 mg . Can also be given PR or sublingual, same dose.
- Diazepam - $0.1-0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV at $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ up to 20 mg . Can also be given ET or PR at $0.2-0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$.
- Midazolam - $2.5-15 \mathrm{mg}$ IV or $0.15-0.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV/IM. Very short acting. Buccal or nasal route ( $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) is another option when IV access is not available

\section*{BE PREPARED TO INTUBATE!}

\section*{Lorazepam (Ativan)}
- Drug of choice
- Terminates seizure within 2 minutes
- Longer duration of action ( 4 to 6 hours)
- Can be given IM or IV
- Must be refrigerated or reconstituted
- Dose
- $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV ( 4 mg in older children/adolescents)
- Repeat in 10 minutes
- $0.01-0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour infusion

\section*{Diazepam (Valium)}
- Liquid form in room temperature
- Easily carried by EMS for long periods
- Rectal gel
- IV onset is 10 to 20 seconds
- 50\% chance of recurrent seizure within 2 hours
- Dose
- 5 to 10 mg every 10 minutes up to 30 mg in 8 hour period
${ }^{-}$Rectal in pediatrics at 0.3 to $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$

\section*{Midazolam (Versed)}
- Onset of action is 1 minute
- Can be administered intranasally
- Has the least cardiovascular effects
${ }^{-}$Dose
- $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bolus (don't exceed 2.5 mg )
${ }^{\bullet} 0.05-0.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour infusion
- $0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ intranasally

\section*{Cont...}
- Intravenous lorazepam ( $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose) usually is administered first in treating status epilepticus.
- If the seizures do not break, a second dose of intravenous lorazepam ( $0.1 \mathrm{mg} . / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose) is followed by fosphenytoin ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose).
- Next, a loading dose of phenobarbital ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose) is considered if seizures continue.
- Intubation is a consideration if respiratory depression is observed with either benzodiazepines or phenobarbital.

\section*{Phenytoin/Fosphenytoin}
- 15 up to $30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV (given in $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ increments) at the rate of $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$.
- Fosphenytoin has advantages over the older formulation because it is water soluble, less irritating after IV injection, and well absorbed after intramuscular injection
20-30 minute onset so must also use smaller doses of benzodiazepine

-
Give too rapidly and may cause hypotension or arrhythmias.

-
If the seizures do not recur, a maintenance dose of 3-9 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ divided into two equal doses daily is begun 12-24 hr later

\section*{Barbiturates}
- Phenobarb given in a loading dose of $15-20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ or in neonates $20-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV during $10-30 \mathrm{~min}$. With control of the seizures, the maintenance dose is $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ divided into two equal doses.
May also be used, but majority of experience with this medication is the ER setting with pediatric patients on in the ICU setting for refractory seizures.
Still may be useful in adolescentss who are seizing because of phenobarbital withdrawal.
Be prepared to intubate and support blood pressure.
Propofol and phenobarbital are acceptable options for treating refractory seizures in ICU setting.
Get help from a neurologist if you are in the ICU.
- If the status epilepticus is not controlled by the preceding strategy, the physician must make some important therapeutic decisions, because it is likely the transitional period has passed.
- Choices for further drug management include a diazepam infusion, barbiturate coma, paraldehyde, or general anesthesia.
- By this stage, the patient is usually sedated and may show signs of respiratory depression, necessitating elective intubation and assisted ventilation.
- Constant IV infusion of either midazolam ( $0.20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bolus, $20-400 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ infusion) or propofol ( $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}, 2- 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ infusion)
- Barbiturate coma-The initial IV loading dose of thiopental is $2-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and is then titrated to achieve a burst suppression EEG pattern, continued for at least 48 hr , followed by cessation of thiopental until the serum phenobarbital level falls to the therapeutic range.
- Barbiturate coma requires careful monitoring because hypotension due to myocardial depression often requires pressor therapy.
- General anesthesia probably acts by reversing cerebral anoxia and the concomitant metabolic abnormalities, allowing the previously administered anticonvulsants to exert their effect.

\section*{Conclusions}

Current childhood epilepsy treatment is based on specific epilepsy syndromes.

Conform diagnosis, type of seizure \& syndrome, do EEG at the onset \& follow principle of monotherapy.

For better compliance, always explain nature of disease to parents.

Goal should be to maintain quality of life.

In resistant cases, early referral will help in offering other options timely.
