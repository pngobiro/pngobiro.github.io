\section*{SEIZURES IN CHILDREN}

\section*{Definition}
- Epileptic seizure: paroxysmal involuntary disturbance of the brain function.
- Clinical features include an impairment (or loss) of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioural abnormalities, sensory disturbance or autonomic dysfunction.

\section*{SEIZURES IN CHILDREN}
- Seizure may result from enhanced:
${ }^{-}$neuronal discharge of a given focus.
- transmission of normal/abnormal discharge.
- Convulsion: an epileptic seizure characterised by motor activity.
${ }^{-}$Epilepsy: two or more recurrent unprovoked seizures.

\section*{SEIZURES IN CHILDREN}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Epilepsy syndrome: a clinical entity of relatively consistent clinical features.
- The features are:
${ }^{\circ}$ seizure type(s),
${ }^{\circ}$ aetiology,
${ }^{-}$EEG features,
${ }^{\circ}$ neurologic status,
${ }^{\circ}$ prognosis, and/or,
${ }^{\circ}$ response to specific antiepileptic drugs.

\section*{Aetiology of Seizures:}

\section*{SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION.}
1. Partial seizure (focal or localised)
(A) Simple Partial seizures
${ }^{\circ}$ With motor signs.
- With somatosensory or special sensory systems.
- With autonomic symptoms or signs.
${ }^{\circ}$ With psychic symptoms.

\section*{SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION.}
1. Partial seizure (focal or localised)
(B) Complex partial seizures
- Simple partial at onset followed by impairment of consciousness
- With impairment of consciousness at onset

\section*{SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION.}
1. Partial seizure (focal or localised)
(C) Partial seizure evolving to secondarily generalised seizures
- Simple partial seizures evolving to generalised seizure
- Complex partial seizures evolving to generalised seizures
- Simple partial seizures evolving to complex partial then to generalised seizures.

\section*{SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION.}

\section*{11. Generalised}
- Absence seizures
${ }^{\circ}$ Tonic clonic (grand mal epilepsy)
${ }^{-}$Tonic
- Clonic
- Akinetic/ atonic
${ }^{\circ}$ Myoclonic

\section*{Seizures: Clinical Features}
${ }^{-}$Depend on:
- the type of seizure manifested,
${ }^{\circ}$ the aetiology or
${ }^{\circ}$ the epileptic syndrome among others.
- It may be generalised or localised (focal/ partial).
- Associated with variable level of consciousness.
- Characterised based on the classification of the International League Against Epilepsy.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{1. Partial Seizures}
A. Simple partial seizures
${ }^{\square}$ Consciousness retained through the episode.
${ }^{0}$ Manifestation may be motor, sensory or autonomic.
${ }^{0}$ Depends on the part of the brain primarily affected.
Precentral gyrus focus presents motor activity.
- Sensory features - Postcentral gyrus activity.

Autonomic presentation e.g. nausea, palpitations in temporal and frontal lobes focus.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{1. Partial Seizures}
B. Complex partial seizures

Associated impairment of consciousness.
${ }^{\square}$ Impaired consciousness either at onset or secondary.
Aura present (often not recognised).

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{1. Partial Seizures}
C. Partial seizure secondarily generalised.
${ }^{\square}$ Initial simple partial seizure spreads to other parts.
${ }^{\square}$ Complex partial seizures evolving to generalised seizures.
Simple partial evolves to complex partial then generalised.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{2. Generalised seizures}
A. Absence seizure
${ }^{\circ}$ Brief episodes of sudden interruption of ongoing activity, blank stare, altered tone
- associated loss of consciousness over this period
- minimal or no motor manifestation
- no memory of the event
${ }^{\circ}$ easily provoked by hyperventilation

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{2. Generalised seizures}
B. Tonic clonic seizure
- Is associated with convulsion involving various muscle groups
- Generalised seizures have bilaterally synchronous onset and generalised EEG features commonly.
C. Tonic
- Sudden sustained muscle contraction.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{2. Generalised seizures}
D. Clonic.
- Repeated muscle jerk like activity
E. Akinetic/ atonic.
- Sudden loss of muscle tone.
- Presents like faint attack/syncope
F. Myoclonic
-Isolated muscle group jerk like epsodes.

\section*{Investigations}

Are many and will be influenced by the differential diagnosis:
- Random blood sugar
- Haemogram
- Blood slide for Malaria parasites
- Blood biochemistry
- Liver function tests

\section*{Investigations}
- Cerebrospinal fluid assay
- Chemical analysis for poisoning
- Skull x-ray
- EEG
- CT scan / MRI scan.

\section*{TREATMENT}
- Depends on the suspected cause.
- Treat the primary cause.
- Anti-epileptic drugs to stop the seizure.
- Long-term anti seizure drugs.

\section*{Differential Diagnosis}
- Syncope / faint attack.
- Psychogenic pseudoseizures.
- Transient ischaemic attack.
- Tics.
- Breath holding attacks.
- Tetany/ tetanus/ Muscular spasms.
- Movement disorders.
- Total global amnesia

\section*{Differential Diagnosis}
- Abdominal colic.
- Narcolepsy/ cataplexy.
- Sleep disorders.
- Paroxysmal torticollis.
- Startle disease (hyperexplexia).
- Daydreaming.
- Benign paroxysmal vertigo.
- Migraine.

\section*{FEBRILE SEIZURES}
- Age of occurrence is 6 month to 6 years.
- Always associated with fever.
- Diagnosis of exclusion.
- Occurs in boys more commonly than girls.
- Familial association seen (Chr 19 and 8)
- Usually generalised tonic clonic but can take any form.
- Chances of recurrence are higher in those whose onset was at infancy.

\section*{Febrile Seizures}
${ }^{-}$Epilepsy may develop in later life.
- Status epilepticus can occur.
- Complicated febrile seizures:
- are prolonged,
- focal or
- several episodes within the same illness
- Exclude CNS infections like meningitis.

\section*{Febrile Seizures}
- Investigations are variable.
- EEG not routine test; usually it is normal.
- Treat the cause; control fever; and the convulsion.
- Long term prophylaxis with Phenobarbital useful.
- Prophylaxis is not mandatory (the American Academy of Paediatrics - 2001)

\section*{NEONATAL SEIZURES}
- GTC seizures tend not to occur during the first month of life - incomplete arborization of axons and dendritic processes, incomplete myelination.
- At least 5 seizure types seen in neonates
- Focal seizures
- Tonic
- Clonic - focal/multifocal
- Myoclonic
- Subtle seizures eg chewing motions, nystagmus, apnoea, peddling movts, etc
