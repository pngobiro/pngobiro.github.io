\section*{KENYA}
- 390 cases (1.3\% of all admissions) of whom 88\% were <5 years old
- The apparent minimum annual incidence in children younger than 5 years of age increased from 120 to 202 per 100000 between 1995 and 2000 ( $P<0.001$ ).
- Increasing the lumbar punctures performed by including prostrated or convulsing children significantly increased the number of cases detected ( $P<0.005$ ).
- The most common organisms in infants <3 months were streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae . Streptococcus pneumoniae (43.1\%) and Haemophilus influenzae (41.9\%) were predominant in the postneonatal period.
- The overall mortality was 30.1\%, and 23.5\% of survivors developed neurologic sequelae.
- Chloramphenicol resistance of H. influenzae rose from 8\% in 1994 to 80\% in 2000 ( $P<0.0001$ ) accompanied by an apparent increase in mortality.
- A short history, impaired consciousness and hypoglycemia were associated with death.
- Prolonged coma and low cerebrospinal fluid glucose were associated with neurologic sequelae.

\section*{KNH,NEONATES}
- The prevalence of meningitis amongst cases of suspected sepsis was 17.9\%.
- The male:female ratio was 1.5:1 mean birth weight 2116.7 grams (1682.2-2551.2) mean gestational age 35.7 weeks (32.6-38.8) and the mean postnatal age was 4.1 days (2.75.4) with none of the parameters being significantly different from those without meningitis.
- Feed intolerance and lethargy were the most common clinical features, present in 73.3\% and 60\% of patients with meningitis respectively.
- Neonates with meningitis had a higher mean CSF protein value ( $2.67 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ vs $1.97 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{p}=0.367$ ) and a significantly higher mean CSF white cell count ( 21 cells/mL vs 7 cells $/ \mathrm{mL}, \mathrm{p}=0.001$ ).
- The most common aetiological agents were Escherichia coli (46.7\%). Group B. Streptococci (26.7\%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.3\%).
- Most blood and CSF isolates were resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin but showed good in-vitro sensitivities to amikacin, cefuroxime and the third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and cefotaxime).
- Blood cultures were positive in only 53.3\% of neonates with meningitis.
- Resistance to the commonly employed first-line antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) is high and a change of empirical antibiotic use for neonates with suspected sepsis is recommended.

\section*{TRANSMISSION}
- Droplet transmission of bacteria from person to person
- Close and prolonged contact e.g sneezing,coughing
${ }^{-}$Incubation period 2-10 days

\section*{Routes of infection}
- Nasopharynx
- Bloodstream
- Direct spread(skull fracture,meningo/encephalocele
- Middle ear infection
${ }^{-}$Infected VP shunts
- Congenital defects
- Sinusitis
- Bacterial

\section*{Bacterial meningitis Organisms}

\section*{Neonates}
- Most caused by Group B Streptococci
- S.AureusE coli, enterococci, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Samonella, Serratia, Listeria
Older infants and children
- Neisseria meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, tuberculosis, H. influenzae

\section*{NEONATES}
- 0-7 days days - group B Streptococcus (GBS), E. coli, other enteric bacilli, and L. monocytogenes. Uncommon pathogens include other streptococci, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
- 7 days or older - antimicrobial-resistant gramnegative organisms must be considered in addition to above.
- Hospitalized neonates seven days of age or older - gram-positive organisms must be considered in addition to antimicrobial resistant gram-negative organisms, GBS, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes.

HOST PATHOGEN INTERACTION
- Variety of factors including preceding viral infections, inhalation of dry dusty air, or exposure to passive smoking have been associated with invasive disease
- Meningococcus is able to adhere to non-ciliated epithelial cells through a number of adhesion factors, including pili
- Bacterium avoids host immunological mechanisms in the nasopharynx by:
- production of IgA protease
- production of factors which inhibit ciliary activity
- possession of a polysaccharide capsule which promotes adherence and inhibits opsonophagocytosis
- variation in expression or structure of a variety of surface antigens, including proteins and endotoxin e.g In group $B$ meningococci, the polysaccharide structure is nonimmunogenic, because of structural similarity with the human neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)

\section*{Host factors}
- Passive immunity
- Acquired immunity
- Complement
pathway:Classical,alternate,MBL
pathways- Individuals deficient in terminal components of the complement pathway or properdin,suffer recurrent infection.Individuals with mutations in the mannose binding lectin gene have an increased risk of meningococcal disease but appear less likely to suffer recurrent infections once antibodies have developed.

PATHOGENESIS OF
BACTERIAL MENINGITIS
- Entry of organism through BBB
- Release of cell wall and membrane products
- Outpouring of polymorphs and fibrin
- Cytokines and chemokines
- Inflammatory mediators
- Inflammed meninges covered with exudate(most marked in pneumoccocal meningitis)

\section*{MICROVASCULAR INJURY IN MENINGOCOCCAL SEPSIS}
- The complex physiology of meningococcal sepsis is largely explained by four basic processes affecting the microvasculature:
(1) Increased vascular permeability
(2) Pathological vasoconstriction and vasodilatation
(3) Loss of thromboresistance and intravascular coagulation
(4) Profound myocardial dysfunction.
- These events are largely responsible for the development of shock and multiorgan failure.

\section*{Increased vascular permeability and the capillary leak syndrome}
- Hypovolemia, a direct result of a gross increase in vascular permeability, appears to be the most important early event leading to shock
${ }^{-}$Increased capillary leak due to:
- Increased inflammation
- Enzymatic degradation of endothelial surface proteins
- loss of the surface endothelial glycosaminoglycans
$\square$ Leads to loss of albumin, fluids and electolytes
(A) The inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways are linked at many levels, leading to organ failure and eventually death.

\section*{NEUROLOGIC INJURY}
- Direct bacterial toxicity
- Indirect inflammatory processes such as cytokine release, neutrophil activation, with resultant vasculitis, and cellular oedema
- Cerebral oedema may be caused by increased secretion of CSF, diminished reabsorption of CSF, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier

\section*{So what is a sensible rule for}

At a minimum, if you want to avoid missing meningitis (and deaths and handicap from it), and avoid wasting antibiotics, at least LP those with history of fever and one of:
- Bulging fontanelle
- Stiff neck
${ }^{-}$Fits if age $<6$ months or $>6 \mathrm{y}$
- Partial or focal fits
${ }^{-}$Reduced consciousness
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_04_ec104c85896449bfde85g-41.jpg?height=729&width=721&top_left_y=1029&top_left_x=1674)

\section*{Value of LP findings - Acute bacterial meningitis.}

All the true acute bacterial meningitis cases

\section*{Bedside assessment alone is very helpful.}

75\% of acute bacterial meningitis cases can be detected by examining for CSF cloudiness or turbidity at the bedside.

\section*{CSF Cloudiness / Turbidity}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_04_ec104c85896449bfde85g-44.jpg?height=648&width=1395&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=133)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_04_ec104c85896449bfde85g-44.jpg?height=667&width=1395&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=133)

A simple test of CSF turbidity is to see if normal print can be read easily through the sample - CSF should be crystal clear.

Cloudiness usually appears at CSF WBC counts > $200 \times 10^{6}$ Wbc per L

\section*{CSF culture is great but if it is not available a microscope will provide nearly all you need to know.}

82\% of acute bacterial meningitis cases can be detected by either turbidity or a CSF white cell count and using a cut-off of $>50 \mathrm{Wbc}$ per $\mu \mathrm{L}$. ( $>50 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Wbc}$ per L )

\section*{CSF microscopy, blood and CSF glucose measures are highly sensitive.}

96\% of acute bacterial meningitis cases can be detected by turbidity, a CSF white cell count of $>50$ Wbc per $\mu \mathrm{L}\left(>50 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Wbc}\right.$ per L$)$ or a CSF glucose to Blood glucose ratio <0.1*

\footnotetext{
* Books suggest a ratio of ~0.6, this is much too high to be useful
}

\section*{MICROSCOPY - GRAM STAIN}
- Absence of organisms on Gram stain does not exclude the diagnosis .
- The probability of visualizing bacteria depends upon the number of organisms present and is increased by cytocentrifugation
- An organism is visualized on CSF Gram stain in approximately 90 percent of children with pneumococcal meningitis and 80 percent of children with meningococcal meningitis.
- In contrast, Gram stain is positive in only one-half of patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis and one-third of patients with listeria meningitis

\section*{MICROSCOPY}
- Gram-positive diplococci suggest S. pneumoniae
- Gram-negative diplococci suggest N. meningitidis)
- Small pleomorphic Gram-negative coccobacilli suggest Hib
- Gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli suggest group B streptococcus
- Gram-positive rods and coccobacilli suggest L. monocytogenes

\section*{LP changes after antibiotics.}

Prior antibiotic use reduces the sensitivity of CSF gram stain by 20\% and CSF culture by 30\%.
It takes 24-36 hours of therapy before >90\% of CSF cultures will be sterile.
It takes 2-3 days of therapy to change the WBC cell count of CSF in true bacterial meningitis.
Prior treatment is no excuse for not doing an LP!

\section*{LATEX AGGLUTINATION}
- Commercial kits utilizing latex beads coated with antibodies to meningococcal capsular antigens are available for use in body fluids other than blood (eg, CSF and urine)
- Detect agglutination of five capsular types: A, B, C, Y, and W135.
- The sensitivity for serogroup B is low, and false negative results can occur

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
- Detects small quantities of bacterial DNA
- Has the potential to be an important tool in the rapid diagnosis of meningococcal infection.
- Advantages compared to culture for the diagnosis of meningococcal infection include:
${ }^{-}$It can establish the diagnosis more rapidly
- Since viable bacteria are not required, sensitivity is not affected by prior antibiotic administration
${ }^{-}$It can rapidly type strains, a useful adjunct in situations that appear to be an epidemic in evolution
- Multiplex PCR permits simultaneous testing for meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae infection

\section*{PCR Cont:}
- Also useful in diagnosis of TBM and viral meningitis
- Methods for the rapid detection of M. tuberculosis in CSF include the nucleic acid-based amplification test (NAAT) that relies upon PCR
- Poor sensitivity,largely attributed to the difference in sample volume between PCR (typically around 50 microL) and culture (several mL)

\section*{OTHER TESTS}
- Serum C-reactive protein - not a reliable indicator of severe infection
- In retrospective cohorts, elevated serum procalcitonin ( $>0.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) appears to be helpful in distinguishing bacterial from viral meningitis
- Presence of tumor necrosis factor may distinguish bacterial from viral meningitis
- Presence of IL-1 or IL-10 also may correlate with meningitis, but whether these indicators are sensitive and specific enough to accelerate the diagnosis remains to be determined

But the lab needs....
- Specimens before treatment ideally
- CSF must be processed within 1 hour of collection
CSF cannot be put in a fridge
Only put CSF in an incubator if the temperature is $<15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and it cannot be taken to the lab quickly.

\section*{TREATMENT}
- Empiric regimen for infants and children older than 1 month with bacterial meningitis include coverage for antibioticresistant S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and Hib
- Cefotaxime ( $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ [IV], maximum dose $12 \mathrm{~g} /$ day, in 3 or 4 divided doses) or
- Ceftriaxone ( $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ IV, maximum dose $4 \mathrm{~g} /$ day in 1 or 2 divided doses) plus
- Vancomycin ( $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day IV, maximum dose 2 g/day, in 4 divided doses)

\section*{DURATION OF THERAPY}
- S. pneumoniae - 10 to 14 days
- N. meningitidis - 5 to 7 days
- Hib - 7 to 10 days
- L. monocytogenes - 14 to 21 days
- Gram-negative bacilli - 3 weeks or a minimum of 2 weeks beyond the first sterile culture, whichever is longer

Pneumococcal resistance
- Strep pneumococcus - most common cause of invasive bacterial infections in children >2 months old
${ }^{-}$Incidence of PCN-, cefotaxime- \& ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible isolates has $\uparrow^{\prime}$ d to ~40\%
- Strains resistant to PCN, cephalosporins, and other $\beta$-lactam antibiotics often resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim ${ }^{\text {â„¢ }}$, Septra ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ ), erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline

\section*{Mechanism of resistance}
- PCN-binding proteins synthesize peptidoglycan for new cell wall formation
${ }^{-}$PCN, cephalosporins, and other $\beta$ lactam antibiotics kill $S$ pneumoniae by binding irreversibly to PCN-binding proteins located in the bacterial cell wall
- Chromosomal changes can cause the binding affinity for the $\beta$-lactam antibiotics to decrease
