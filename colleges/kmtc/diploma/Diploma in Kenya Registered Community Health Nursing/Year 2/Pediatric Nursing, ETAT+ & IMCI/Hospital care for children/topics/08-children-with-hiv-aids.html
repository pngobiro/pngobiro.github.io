                        <p>In general, the management of specific conditions in HIV-infected children is similar to that in other children (see Chapters 3-7). Most infections in HIV-positive children are caused by the same pathogens as in HIV-negative children, although they may be more frequent, more severe and occur repeatedly. Some, infections, however, are due to unusual pathogens.</p>
                        <p>Many HIV-positive children die from common childhood illnesses, and some of these deaths are preventable by early diagnosis and correct management or by giving routine scheduled vaccinations and improving nutrition. These children have a particularly greater risk for staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections and TB. Saving children's lives depends on early identification, immediate treatment with ART and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for those who are HIV-infected.</p>
                        <p>All infants and children should have their HIV status established at their first contact with the health system, ideally at birth or at the earliest opportunity thereafter. To facilitate this, all areas of the hospital in which maternal, neonatal and child services are delivered should offer HIV serological testing to mothers and their infants and children.</p>
                        <p>This chapter covers mainly the management of children with HIV/AIDS: diagnosis of HIV infection, counselling and testing, clinical staging, ART, management of HIV-related conditions, supportive care, breastfeeding, planning discharge and follow-up and palliative care for terminally ill children.</p>

                        <p>The clinical expression of HIV infection in children is highly variable. Many HIV-positive children show severe HIV-related signs and symptoms in the first year of life, while others may remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic for more than a year and may survive for several years.</p>
                        <p>Clinical experience indicates that children infected with HIV perinatally who are not on antiretroviral therapy fit into one of three categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>those with rapid progression (25-30%), most of whom die before their first birthday; they are thought to have acquired the infection in utero or during the early postnatal period;</li>
                            <li>children who develop symptoms early in life, then follow a downhill course and die at the age of $3-5$ years ( $50-60 \%$ );</li>
                            <li>long-term survivors, who live beyond 8 years of age ( $5-25 \%$ ); they tend to have lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis and stunting, with low weight and height for age.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Suspect HIV if any of the following signs, which are not common in HIV-negative children, are present:</p>
                        <h4>Signs that may indicate possible HIV infection</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>recurrent infection:</strong> three or more severe episodes of a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, cellulitis) in the past 12 months</li>
                            <li><strong>oral thrush:</strong> erythema and white-beige pseudomembranous plaques on the palate, gums and buccal mucosa. After the neonatal period, the presence of oral thrush is highly suggestive of HIV infection when it lasts > 30 days despite antibiotic treatment, recurs, extends beyond the tongue or presents as oesophageal candidiasis.</li>
                            <li><strong>chronic parotitis:</strong> unilateral or bilateral parotid swelling (just in front of the ear) for $\geq 14$ days, with or without associated pain or fever.</li>
                            <li><strong>generalized lymphadenopathy:</strong> enlarged lymph nodes in two or more extrainguinal regions with no apparent underlying cause.</li>
                            <li><strong>hepatomegaly with no apparent cause:</strong> in the absence of concurrent viral infections such as cytomegalovirus.</li>
                            <li><strong>persistent and/or recurrent fever:</strong> fever ( $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) lasting $\geq 7$ days or occurring more than once over 7 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>neurological dysfunction:</strong> progressive neurological impairment, microcephaly, delay in achieving developmental milestones, hypertonia or mental confusion</li>
                            <li><strong>herpes zoster (shingles):</strong> painful rash with blisters confined to one dermatome on one side</li>
                            <li><strong>HIV dermatitis:</strong> erythematous papular rash. Typical skin rashes include extensive fungal infections of the skin, nails and scalp and extensive molluscum contagiosum.</li>
                            <li><strong>chronic suppurative lung disease</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Signs or conditions specific to HIV-infected children</h4>
                        <p>Strongly suspect HIV infection if the following are present:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia (PCP)</li>
                            <li>oesophageal candidiasis</li>
                            <li>lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia</li>
                            <li>Kaposi sarcoma</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Signs common in HIV-infected children but which also occur in ill children with no HIV infection:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>chronic otitis media:</strong> ear discharge lasting $\geq 14$ days</li>
                            <li><strong>persistent diarrhoea:</strong> diarrhoea lasting $\geq 14$ days</li>
                            <li><strong>moderate or severe acute malnutrition:</strong> weight loss or a gradual but steady deterioration in weight gain from that expected, as indicated on the child's growth card. Suspect HIV particularly in breastfed infants < 6 months old who fail to thrive.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>HIV provider-initiated testing and counselling should be offered to all children attending clinical services in countries with generalized HIV epidemics (prevalence over 1% in pregnant women). If the child's HIV status is not known, counsel the family and offer diagnostic testing for HIV.</p>
                        <p>As the majority of children are infected by vertical transmission from the mother, the mother and often the father are probably infected but may not know it. Even in countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection, it remains an extremely stigmatizing condition, and the parents may feel reluctant to undergo testing.</p>
                        <p>In HIV counselling, the child should be treated as part of the family by taking into account the psychological implications of HIV for the child, mother, father and other family members. Counsellors should stress that, although there is no definitive cure, early initiation of ART and supportive care can greatly improve the child's and the parents' quality of life and survival.</p>
                        <p>Counselling requires time and must be done by trained staff. If there are no trained staff, assistance should be sought from local AIDS support organizations. HIV testing should be voluntary, with no coercion, and informed consent should be obtained before testing is performed.</p>
                        <h4>Indications for HIV counselling and testing</h4>
                        <p>All infants and children in countries with generalized HIV epidemics with unknown HIV status should be offered counselling and testing. In most cases, the HIV status of the child is established by asking about maternal HIV testing during pregnancy, labour or postpartum and checking the child's or mother's health card. If the HIV status is not known, counselling and testing should be offered in the following situations to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>all infants and children in generalized HIV epidemic settings (prevalence $>1 \%$ in pregnant women).</li>
                            <li>all HIV-exposed infants at birth or at the earliest opportunity thereafter.</li>
                            <li>any infant or child presenting with signs, symptoms or medical conditions that could indicate HIV infection.</li>
                            <li>all pregnant women and their partners in generalized HIV epidemics.</li>

                    <h3 id="section-heading-8.1.3" class="subsection-heading">8.1.3 Testing and diagnosis of HIV infection</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Diagnosis of HIV infection in perinatally exposed infants and young children < 18 months of age is difficult, because passively acquired maternal HIV antibodies may still be present in the child's blood. Additional diagnostic challenges arise if the child is still breastfeeding or has been breastfed. Although many children will have lost HIV antibodies between 9 and 18 months, a virological test is the only reliable method for determining the HIV status of a child < 18 months of age.</p>
                        <p>When either the mother or the child has a positive serological HIV test and the child has specific symptoms suggestive of HIV infection but virological testing is not available, the child may presumptively be diagnosed as having HIV infection. However, HIV virological testing should be done at the earliest opportunity to confirm infection.</p>
                        <p>All diagnostic HIV testing of children must be confidential, be accompanied by counselling and conducted only with informed consent, so that it is both informed and voluntary.</p>
                        <h4>HIV serological antibody test (ELISA or rapid tests)</h4>
                        <p>Rapid tests are widely available, sensitive and reliable for diagnosing HIV infection in children > 18 months. For children < 18 months, HIV antibody tests are a sensitive, reliable way of detecting exposure and of excluding HIV infection in non-breastfeeding children.</p>
                        <p>Rapid HIV tests can be used to exclude HIV infection in a child presenting with severe acute malnutrition, or TB or any other serious clinical event in areas of high HIV prevalence. For children aged < 18 months, confirm all positive HIV serological results by virological testing as soon as possible (see below). When this is not possible, repeat antibody testing at 18 months.</p>
                        <h4>Virological tests</h4>
                        <p>Virological testing for HIV-specific RNA or DNA is the most reliable method for diagnosing HIV infection in children < 18 months of age. This may require sending a blood sample to a specialized laboratory that can perform this test, although virological testing is becoming more widely available in many countries. The tests are relatively cheap, easy to standardize and can be done on dried blood spots. The following assays (and respective specimen types) may be available:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HIV DNA on whole blood specimen or dried blood spots</li>
                            <li>HIV RNA on plasma or dried blood spots</li>
                            <li>ultrasensitive p24 antigen detection in plasma or dried blood spots</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One positive virological test at 4-8 weeks is sufficient to diagnose HIV infection in a young infant. ART should be started without delay, and, at the same time, a second specimen should be collected to confirm the positive virological test result.</p>
                        <p>If the infant is still breastfeeding and the virological test is negative, it should be repeated 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding to confirm that the child is not infected with HIV.</p>
                        <p>The results of virological testing in infants should be returned to the clinic and to the child, mother or carer as soon as possible but at the very latest within 4 weeks of specimen collection.</p>
                        <h4>Diagnosing HIV infection in breastfeeding infants</h4>
                        <p>A breastfeeding infant is at risk of acquiring HIV infection from an infected mother throughout the period of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should not be stopped in order to perform diagnostic HIV viral testing. Positive test results should be considered to reflect HIV infection. The interpretation of negative results is, however, difficult because a 6-week period after complete cessation of breastfeeding is required before negative viral test results can reliably indicate HIV infection status.</p>

                        <p>In a child with diagnosed or highly suspected HIV infection, the clinical staging system helps to determine the degree of damage to the immune system and to plan treatment and care.</p>
                        <p>The clinical stages represent a progressive sequence from least to most severe, each higher clinical stage indicating a poorer prognosis.

                        <p>All HIV-infected infants < 60 months of age should immediately begin ART once diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of clinical or immunological status. Although antiretroviral drugs cannot cure HIV infection, they dramatically reduce mortality and morbidity and improve the children's quality of life.</p>
                        <p>The current standard first-line treatment for HIV infection is use of three antiretroviral medications (triple drug therapy) to suppress viral replication as much as possible and thus arrest the progression of HIV disease. Fixeddose combinations are now available and are preferable to syrups or single drugs because they encourage adherence to treatment, and reduce the cost.</p>
                        <p>Clinicians should be familiar with the national paediatric HIV treatment guidelines. The underlying principles of ART and the choice of first-line drugs for children are largely the same as for adults. Suitable formulations for children may not be available for some antiretroviral drugs (particularly the protease inhibitor class). It is nevertheless important to consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the availability of a suitable formulation that can be taken in appropriate doses</li>
                            <li>the simplicity of the dosage schedule</li>
                            <li>the taste and palatability, and hence compliance, for young children.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is also important to ensure that HIV-infected parents access treatment; and ART should ideally be ensured for other family members.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8.2.1 Antiretroviral drugs</h3>
                        <p>Antiretroviral drugs fall into three main classes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs),</li>
                            <li>non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and</li>
                            <li>protease inhibitors (see Table 24).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Triple therapy is the standard of care, and first-line regimens should be based on two NRTIs plus one NNRTI or protease inhibitor.</p>
                        <p>All infants and children < 3 years of age should be started on Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus two NRTIs, regardless of exposure to nevirapine (NVP) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. When viral load monitoring is available, consideration can be given to substituting LPV/r with an NNRTI after virological suppression is sustained.</p>
                        <p>For children $\geq 3$ years efavirenz (EFV) is the preferred NNRTI for first-line treatment particularly once daily therapy, although NVP may be used as an alternative especially for children who are on twice daily therapy. Efavirenz is also the NNRTI of choice in children who are on rifampicin, if treatment has to start before anti-TB therapy is completed.</p>
                        <p>For drug dosages and regimens see Annex 2, pp. 370-3.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Calculation of drug dosages</h4>
                        <p>In general, children metabolize protease inhibitor and NNRTI drugs faster than adults and therefore require higher equivalent doses to achieve appropriate drug levels. Drug doses must be increased as the child grows; otherwise, there is a risk for under-dosage and the development of resistance.</p>
                        <p>Drug dosages are given on pp. 370-4, per kilogram of body weight for some drugs and per surface area of the child for others. A table listing the equivalent weights of various surface area values is given in Annex 2 (p. 354) to help in calculating dosages. The use of weight bands for paediatric dosing has also simplified treatment regimens.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Formulations</h4>
                        <p>Dosing in children is usually based on either body surface area or weight, or, more conveniently, on weight bands. As these change with growth, drug doses must be adjusted in order to avoid the risk for under-dosage.</p>
