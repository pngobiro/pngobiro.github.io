                       <p>As there are many causes of prolonged fever, it is important to know the commonest causes in a given area. Investigations to determine the most likely cause can then be started and treatment decided. Sometimes there is need for a 'trial of treatment', e.g. for highly suspected TB or Salmonella infections; improvement supports the suspected diagnosis.</p>
                       <h4>History</h4>
                       <p>Take a history, as for fever (see p. 150). In addition, consider the possibility of HIV, TB or malignancy, which can cause persistent fever.</p>
                       <h4>Examination</h4>
                       <p>Fully undress the child, and examine the whole body for the following signs:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>fast breathing or chest indrawing (pneumonia)</li>
                            <li>stiff neck or bulging fontanel (meningitis)</li>
                            <li>red tender joint (septic arthritis or rheumatic fever)</li>
                            <li>fast breathing or chest indrawing (pneumonia or severe pneumonia)</li>
                            <li>petaechial or purpuric rash (meningococcal disease or dengue)</li>
                            <li>maculopapular rash (viral infection or drug reaction)</li>
                            <li>inflamed throat and mucous membranes (throat infection)</li>
                            <li>red, painful ear with immobile ear-drum (otitis media)</li>
                            <li>jaundice or anaemia (malaria, hepatitis, leptospirosis or septicaemia)</li>
                            <li>painful spine, hips or other joints (septic arthritis)</li>
                            <li>tender abdomen (suprapubic or loin in urinary tract infection)</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>Some causes of persistent fever may have no localizing diagnostic signs, such as septicaemia, Salmonella infections, miliary TB, HIV infection or urinary tract infection.</p>
                       <h4>Laboratory investigations</h4>
                       <p>When available, perform the following:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>blood films or rapid diagnostic test for malaria parasites (a positive test in an endemic area does not exclude other, co-existing causes of fever)</li>
                            <li>full blood count, including platelet count, and examination of a thin film for cell morphology</li>
                            <li>urinalysis, including microscopy</li>

                       <p>Severe malaria, which is usually due to Plasmodium falciparum, is a life-threatening condition. The illness starts with fever and often vomiting. Children can deteriorate rapidly over 1-2 days, developing complications, the commonest of which are coma (cerebral malaria) or less profound altered level of consciousness, inability to sit up or drink (prostration), convulsions, severe anaemia, respiratory distress (due to acidosis) and hypoglycaemia.</p>
                       <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                       <p><strong>History.</strong> Children with severe malaria present with some of the clinical features listed below. A change of behaviour, confusion, drowsiness, altered consciousness and generalized weakness are usually indicative of 'cerebral malaria'.</p>
                       <p><strong>Examination.</strong> Make a rapid clinical assessment, with special attention to level of consciousness, blood pressure, rate and depth of respiration and pallor. Assess neck stiffness and examine for rash to exclude alternative diagnoses. The main features indicative of severe malaria are:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>generalized multiple convulsions: more than two episodes in 24 h</li>
                            <li>impaired consciousness, including unrousable coma</li>
                            <li>generalized weakness (prostration) or lethargy, i.e. the child is unable walk or sit up without assistance</li>
                            <li>deep laboured breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing)</li>
                            <li>pulmonary oedema (or radiological evidence)</li>
                            <li>abnormal bleeding</li>
                            <li>clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction</li>
                            <li>circulatory collapse or shock with systolic blood pressure $<50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$</li>
                            <li>haemoglobinuria（dark urine）</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Laboratory findings.</strong> Children with the following findings on investigation have severe malaria：</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>hypoglycaemia（blood glucose $<2.5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ litre or $<45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ ）．Check blood glucose in all children with signs suggesting severe malaria．</li>
                            <li>hyperparasitaemia（thick blood smears and thin blood smear if species identification required）．Hyperparasitaemia $>100000 / \mu \mathrm{l}(2.5 \%)$ in low－ intensity transmission areas or 20\％hyperparasitaemia in areas of high transmission．Where microscopy is not feasible or may be delayed，a positive rapid diagnostic test is diagnostic．</li>
                            <li>severe anaemia（eryththrocyte volume fraction［EVF］，＜15\％；Hb，＜ $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ）</li>
                            <li>high blood lactate（＞ $5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ litre）</li>
                            <li>high serum creatinine（renal impairment，creatinine $>265$ umol／l）</li>
                            <li>lumbar puncture to exclude bacterial meningitis in a child with severe malaria and altered level of consciousness or in coma．A lumbar puncture should be done if there are no contraindications（see p．346）．If lumbar puncture is delayed and bacterial meningitis cannot be excluded，give antibiotic treat－ ment in addition to antimalarial treatment（see p．169）．</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>If severe malaria is suspected and the initial blood smear is negative，perform a rapid diagnostic test，if available．If the test is positive，treat for severe malaria but continue to look for other causes of severe illness（including severe bacterial infections）．If the rapid diagnostic test is negative，malaria is unlikely to be the cause of illness，and an alternative diagnosis must be sought．</p>
                       <h4>Treatment</h4>
                       <p><strong>Emergency measures，to be taken within the first hour</strong></p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>If the child is unconscious，minimize the risk for aspiration pneumonia by inserting a nasogastric tube and removing the gastric contents by suction． Keep the airway open，and place in recovery position．</li>
                            <li>Check for hypoglycaemia and correct，if present（see p．161）．If blood glu－ cose cannot be measured and hypoglycaemia is suspected，give glucose．</li>
                            <li>Treat convulsions with rectal or IV diazepam（see Chart 9，p．15）．Do not give prophylactic anticonvulsants．</li>
                            <li>Start treatment with an effective antimalarial agent（see below）．</li>
                            <li>If hyperpyrexia is present，give paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce tem－ perature below $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ．</li>
                            <li>Check for associated dehydration, and treat appropriately if present (see fluid balance disturbances, p. 159).</li>
                            <li>Treat severe anaemia (see p. 160).</li>
                            <li>Institute regular observation of vital and neurological signs.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Antimalarial treatment</strong></p>
                       <p>If confirmation of malaria from a blood smear or rapid diagnostic test is likely to take more than 1 h , start antimalarial treatment before the diagnosis is confirmed.</p>
                       <p>Parenteral artesunate is the drug of choice for the treatment of severe $P$. falciparum malaria. If it is not available, parenteral artemether or quinine should be used. Give antimalarial agents by the parenteral route until the child can take oral medication or for a minimum of 24 h even if the patient can tolerate oral medication earlier.</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li><strong>Artesunate:</strong> Give artesunate at $2.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV or IM on admission, then at 12 h and 24 h , then daily until the child can take oral medication but for a minimum of 24 h even if the child can tolerate oral medication earlier.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quinine:</strong> Give a loading dose of quinine dihydrochloride salt at $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ by infusion in $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of IV fluid over $2-4 \mathrm{~h}$. Then, 8 h after the start of the loading dose, give $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ quinine salt in IV fluid over 2 h , and repeat every 8 h until the child can take oral medication. The infusion rate should not exceed a total of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h of quinine dihydrochloride salt.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>IV quinine should never be given as a bolus injection but as a $2-4 \mathrm{~h}$ infusion under close nursing supervision. If IV quinine infusion is not possible, quinine dihydrochloride can be given as a diluted divided IM injection. Give the loading dose split into two as $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of quinine salt into the anterior aspect of each thigh. Then, continue with $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 8 h until oral medication is tolerated. The diluted parenteral solution is better absorbed and less painful.</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li><strong>Artemether:</strong> Give artemether at $3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM on admission, then $1.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily until the child can take oral medication. Use a 1-ml tuberculin syringe to give the small injection volume. As absorption of artemether may be erratic, it should be used only if artesunate or quinine is not available.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>Give parenteral antimalarial agent for the treatment of severe malaria for at least 24 h ; thereafter, complete treatment with a full course of artemisinin-based combination therapy, such as:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>artemether-lumefantrine</li>
                            <li>artesunate plus amodiaquine</li>
                            <li>artesunate plus sulfadoxine－pyrimethamine，</li>
                            <li>dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine．</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Supportive care</strong></p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Ensure meticulous nursing care，especially for unconscious patients．</li>
                            <li>Ensure that they receive daily fluid requirements，and monitor fluid status carefully by keeping a careful record of fluid intake and output．</li>
                            <li>Feed children unable to feed for more than 1－2 days by nasogastric tube， which is preferable to prolonged IV fluids．</li>
                            <li>Avoid giving any harmful drugs like corticosteroids，low－molecular－mass dextran and other anti－inflammatory drugs．</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Dehydration</strong></p>
                       <p>Examine frequently for signs of dehydration（see p．128）or fluid overload，and treat appropriately．The most reliable sign of fluid overload is an enlarged liver． Additional signs are gallop rhythm，fine crackles at lung bases and fullness of neck veins when upright．Eyelid oedema is a useful sign of fluid overload．</p>
                       <p>If，after careful rehydration，the urine output over 24 h is $<4 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ，give IV furosemide，initially at $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ．If there is no response，double the dose at hourly intervals to a maximum of $8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$（given over 15 min ）．Large doses should be given once to avoid possible nephrotoxicity．</p>
                       <p><strong>For an unconscious child：</strong></p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Maintain clear airway．</li>
                            <li>Nurse the child in recovery position or $30^{\circ}$ head－up to avoid aspiration of fluids．</li>
                            <li>Insert a nasogastric tube for feeding and to minimize the risk of aspiration．</li>
                            <li>Turn the patient every 2 h ．</li>
                            <li>Do not allow the child to lie in a wet bed．</li>
                            <li>Pay attention to pressure points．</li>
                       </ul>
                       <h4>Complications</h4>
                       <p><strong>Coma（cerebral malaria）</strong></p>
                       <p>The earliest symptom of cerebral malaria is usually a brief（1－2－day）history of fever，followed by inability to eat or drink preceding a change in behaviour or altered level of consciousness．In children with cerebral malaria：</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Assess，monitor and record the level of consciousness according to the AVPU or another locally used coma scale for children（see p．18）．</li>
                            <li>Exclude other treatable causes of coma (e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacterial meningitis). Always exclude hypoglycaemia by checking blood glucose; if this is not possible, treat for hypoglycaemia (see p. 161). Perform a lumbar puncture if there are no contraindications. If you cannot do a lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis, give antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (see section 6.3, p. 167).</li>
                            <li>Monitor all other vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and urine output).</li>
                            <li>Manage convulsions if present.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Convulsions</strong></p>
                       <p>Convulsions are common before and after the onset of coma. They may be very subtle, such as intermittent nystagmus, twitching of a limb, a single digit or a corner of the mouth, or an irregular breathing pattern.</p>
                       <p>Give anticonvulsant treatment with rectal diazepam or slow IV injection (see Chart 9, p. 15).</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Check blood glucose to exclude hypoglycaemia, and correct with IV glucose if present; if blood glucose cannot be measured, treat for hypoglycaemia (see p. 161).</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>If there are repeated convulsions, give phenobarbital (see Chart 9, p. 15).</p>
                       <p>If temperature is $\geq 39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, give a dose of paracetamol.</p>
                       <p><strong>Shock</strong></p>
                       <p>Some children may already be in shock, with cold extremities (clammy skin), weak rapid pulse, capillary refill longer than 3 s and low blood pressure. These features may indicate complicating septicaemia, although dehydration may also contribute to the hypotension.</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Correct hypovolaemia as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Take blood for culture</li>
                            <li>Do urinalysis.</li>
                            <li>Give both antimalarial and antibiotic treatment for septicaemia (see section $6.5, \mathrm{p} .179)$.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Severe anaemia</strong></p>
                       <p>Severe anaemia is indicated by severe palmar pallor, often with a fast pulse rate, difficult breathing, confusion or restlessness. Signs of heart failure such as gallop rhythm, enlarged liver and, rarely, pulmonary oedema (fast breathing, fine basal crackles on auscultation) may be present</p>
                       <p>Give a blood transfusion as soon as possible (see p. 308) to:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>all children with an $\mathrm{EVF} \leq 12 \%$ or $\mathrm{Hb} \leq 4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.</li>
                            <li>less severely anaemic children (EVF > 12-15\%; Hb 4-5 g/dl) with any of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>shock or clinically detectable dehydration</li>
                                    <li>impaired consciousness</li>
                                    <li>respiratory acidosis (deep, laboured breathing)</li>
                                    <li>heart failure</li>
                                    <li>very high parasitaemia (>20\% of red cells parasitized).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                       </ul>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Give $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ packed cells or $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ whole blood over $3-4 \mathrm{~h}$.</li>
                            <li>A diuretic is not usually indicated, because many of these children are usually hypovolaemic with a low blood volume.</li>
                            <li>Check the respiratory rate and pulse rate every 15 min . If one of them rises, transfuse more slowly. If there is any evidence of fluid overload due to the blood transfusion, give IV furosemide ( $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) up to a maximum total of 20 mg .</li>
                            <li>After the transfusion, if the Hb remains low, repeat the transfusion.</li>
                            <li>In severely malnourished children, fluid overload is a common and a serious complication. Give whole blood ( $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ rather than $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) once only and do not repeat the transfusion.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p>Give a daily iron-folate tablet or iron syrup for 14 days (see p. 364).</p>
                       <p><strong>Hypoglycaemia</strong></p>
                       <p>Hypoglycaemia (blood glucose $<2.5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ litre or $<45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ ) is particularly common in children < 3 years, especially those with convulsions or hyperparasitaemia and who are comatose. It is easily overlooked because the clinical signs may mimic cerebral malaria. Hypoglycaemia should be corrected if glucose is $<3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}(54 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl})$.</p>
                       <p>Give $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of 10% glucose (dextrose) solution IV rapidly (see Chart 10, p. 16). If IV access is not possible, place an intraosseous needle (see p. 340) or give sublingual sugar solution. Recheck the blood glucose after 30 min , and repeat the dextrose ( $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) if the level is low ( $<3.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l} ;<54 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ ).</p>
                       <p>Prevent further hypoglycaemia in an unconscious child by giving 10% dextrose in normal saline or Ringer's lactate for maintenance infusion (add 20 ml of $50 \%$ glucose to 80 ml of $0.9 \%$ normal saline or Ringer's lactate). Do not exceed the maintenance fluid requirements for the child's weight (see section 10.2, p. 304).</p>
                       <p>Monitor blood glucose and signs of fluid overload. If the child develops fluid overload and blood glucose is still low, stop the infusion; repeat 10% glucose ( $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ), and feed the child by nasogastric tube as appropriate.</p>
                       <p>Once the child can take food orally, stop IV treatment and feed the child by nasogastric tube. Breastfeed every 3 h , if possible, or give milk feeds of $15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ if the child can swallow. If the child cannot feed without risk of aspiration, especially if the gag reflex is still absent, give sugar solution or small feeds by nasogastric tube (see Chart 10, p. 16). Continue monitoring blood glucose, and treat accordingly (as above) if it is $<2.5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ litre or $<45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.</p>
                       <p><strong>Respiratory distress (acidosis)</strong></p>
                       <p>Respiratory distress presents as deep, laboured breathing, while the chest is clear on auscultation, often accompanied by lower chest wall indrawing. It is commonly caused by systemic metabolic acidosis (frequently lactic acidosis). It may develop in a fully conscious child but more often occurs in children with an altered level of consciousness, prostration, cerebral malaria, severe anaemia or hypoglycaemia. Respiratory distress due to acidosis must be distinguished from that caused by pneumonia (including history of aspiration) or pulmonary oedema due to fluid overload. If acidosis is present:</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Give oxygen.</li>
                            <li>Correct reversible causes of acidosis, especially dehydration and severe anaemia:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If Hb is $\geq 5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, give $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ normal saline or Ringer's lactate (Hartmann's solution) IV over 30 min .</li>
                                    <li>If Hb is $<5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$, give whole blood ( $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) over 30 min and a further $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over 1-2 h without diuretics. Check the respiratory rate and pulse rate every 15 min . If either shows any rise, transfuse more slowly to avoid precipitating pulmonary oedema (see guidelines on blood transfusion, section 10.6, p. 308).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Monitor response by continuous clinical observation (oxygen saturation, Hb , packed cell volume, blood glucose and acid-base balance if available)</li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Aspiration pneumonia</strong></p>
                       <p>Treat aspiration pneumonia immediately, as it can be fatal.</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Place the child on his or her side or at least $30^{\circ}$ head-up.</li>
                            <li>Give oxygen if oxygen saturation is $\leq 90 \%$ or, if you cannot do pulse oximetry, if there is cyanosis, severe lower chest wall indrawing or a respiratory rate $\geq 70 / \mathrm{min}$.</li>
                            <li>Give IV ampicillin and gentamicin for a total of 7 days.</li>
                       </ul>
                       <h4>Monitoring</h4>
                       <p>The child should be checked by a nurse at least every 3 h and by a doctor at least twice a day. The IV infusion rate should be checked hourly. Children with cold extremities, hypoglycaemia on admission, respiratory distress and/or deep coma are at greatest risk of death and must be kept under very close observation.</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Monitor and report immediately any change in the level of consciousness, convulsions or the child's behaviour.</li>
                            <li>Monitor temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate (and, if possible, blood pressure) every 6 h for at least the first 48 h .</li>
                            <li>Monitor the blood glucose level every 3 h until the child is fully conscious.</li>
                            <li>Check the IV infusion rate regularly. If available, use a chamber with a volume of $100-150 \mathrm{ml}$. Avoid over-infusion of fluids from a $500-\mathrm{ml}$ or 1 -litre bottles or bags, especially if the child is not supervised all the time. Partially empty the IV bottle or bag to reduce the amount before starting the infusion. If the risk of over-infusion cannot be ruled out, it is safer to rehydrate or feed through a nasogastric tube.</li>
                            <li>Keep a careful record of fluid intake (including IV infusions) and output.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <p>The presentation of uncomplicated malaria is highly variable and may mimic many other causes of fever.</p>
                       <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                       <p>The child has:</p>

                            </li>
                       </ul>
                       <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a child in a malarious area has fever with no obvious cause and it is not possible to confirm malaria on a blood film or with a rapid diagnostic test, treat the child for malaria.</p>

                       <p>Chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria should be treated with amodiaquine, mefloquine or dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine as the drugs of choice.</p>
                       <h4>Complications</h4>
                       <p><strong>Anaemia</strong></p>
                       <p>In any child with palmar pallor, determine the Hb or EVF. Hb of $5-9.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ (equivalent to approximately $15-27 \%$ ) indicates moderate anaemia. Begin treatment with iron and folate immediately after completion of antimalarial treatment or on discharge (omit iron for any child with severe malnutrition until recovery).</p>
                       <ul>
                            <li>Give a daily iron-folate tablet or iron syrup for 14 days; see p. 364).</li>
                            <li>Ask the parent to return with the child in 14 days. Treat for 3 months, as it takes 2-4 weeks to correct anaemia and 1-3 months to build up iron stores.</li>
                            <li>If the child is $>1$ year and has not received mebendazole in the previous 6 months, give one dose of mebendazole ( 500 mg ) for possible hookworm or whipworm infestation (see p. 365).</li>
                            <li>Advise the mother about good feeding practice.</li>
                       </ul>

                       </figure>
                       <h4>Follow-up</h4>
                       <p>If the child is treated as an outpatient, ask the mother to return if the fever persists after 3 days' treatment, or sooner if the child's condition gets worse. If the child returns, check if the child actually took the full dose of treatment and repeat a blood smear. If the treatment was not taken, repeat it. If it was taken but the blood smear is still positive, treat with a second-line antimalarial agent. Reassess the child to exclude the possibility of other causes of fever (see section 6.1, pp. 150-6).</p>
                       <p>If the fever persists after 3 days of treatment with the second-line antimalarial agent, ask the mother to return with the child to assess other causes of fever.</p>
