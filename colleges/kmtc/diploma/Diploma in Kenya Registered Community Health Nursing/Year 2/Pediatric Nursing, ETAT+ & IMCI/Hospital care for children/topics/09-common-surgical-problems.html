                        <p>Good surgical care neither begins nor ends with the procedure. In most instances, it is the preparation for surgery, the anaesthetic and the postoperative care that ensure a good outcome.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">9.1.1 Preoperative care</h3>
                        <p>Both the child and the parents should be prepared for the procedure and must consent.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain why the procedure is needed, the anticipated outcome and the potential risks and benefits.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the child is medically fit for an operation:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Correct any fluid deficit and resuscitate as appropriate before an emergency procedure (IV bolus of normal saline, $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$, repeated as needed). Restoration of urine output implies adequate volume resuscitation.</li>
                                    <li>Correct anaemia. Severe anaemia interferes with oxygen transport. As a consequence, the heart must pump more blood. Surgery may cause blood loss, and the anaesthetic may affect oxygen transport in the blood. Ideally, the child's Hb should be checked to ensure that it is normal for the age and population.</li>
                                    <li>Reserve blood transfusions for situations in which anaemia must be corrected quickly, e.g. emergency surgery.</li>
                                    <li>In children undergoing elective surgery, correct anaemia with oral medications (p. 364).</li>
                                    <li>Children with haemoglobinopathy (HbSS, HbAS, HbSC and thalassaemias) who require surgery and anaesthesia need special care. Refer to standard texts of paediatrics for details.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Check that the child is in the best nutritional state possible. Good nutrition is needed to heal wounds.</li>
                            <li>Check that the child has an empty stomach before a general anaesthetic.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Infants < 12 months: the child should be given no solids orally for 8 h , no formula for 6 h , no clear liquids for 4 h or no breast milk for 4 h before the operation.</li>
                                    <li>If prolonged periods of fasting are anticipated ( >6 h ), give IV fluids that contain glucose.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Preoperative laboratory screening is generally not essential; however, carry out the following if possible:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Infants < 6 months: check Hb or EVF</li>
                                    <li>Children 6 months to 12 years:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>minor surgery (e.g. hernia repair): no investigations</li>
                                            <li>major surgery: check Hb or EVF, group and cross-match blood for possible transfusion.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Other investigations may be indicated after full clinical examination of the child.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Preoperative antibiotics should be given for:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Infected and contaminated cases (e.g. those requiring bowel or bladder surgery):

                                            <li>Bowel: give ampicillin ( $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV four times a day), gentamicin ( $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV once a day) and metronidazole ( $10 \mathrm{mg} /$ kg three times a day) before and for 3-5 days after the operation.</li>
                                            <li>Urinary tract: give ampicillin ( $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV four times a day) and gentamicin ( $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV once a day) before and for $3-5$ days after the operation.</li>

                                            <li>Give amoxicillin at $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ orally before the operation or, if the child is unable to take oral medications, ampicillin at $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV within 30 min of surgery.</li>
                                        </ul>

                        <p>Successful procedures require teamwork and careful planning. The operating room staff should function as a team, including surgeons, anaesthesia staff, nurses, scrub technicians and others. Ensure that essential supplies are readily available before the start of the operation.</p>
                        <h4>Anaesthesia</h4>
                        <p>Infants and children experience pain just like adults, but may express it differently.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make the procedure as painless as possible.</li>
                            <li>For minor procedures in cooperative children, give a local anaesthetic by local infiltration, such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>lidocaine at $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $0.3 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $1 \%$ solution and $0.15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $2 \%$ solution; maximum dose, 200 mg ), not repeated within 2 h</li>
                                    <li>bupivacaine at $0.5-2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ as a $0.25 \%$ or $0.5 \%$ solution; maximum dose, $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $0.25 \%$ solution, $0.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $0.5 \%$ solution ( $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ )</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>For major procedures, give general anaesthesia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ketamine is an excellent anaesthetic when muscle relaxation is not required.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Insert an intravenous cannula. It may be more convenient to delay this until after ketamine has been given IM.</li>
                            <li>Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (short procedures) and analgesia for short painful procedures:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Give ketamine at $5-8 \mathrm{mg}$ IM or $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV over 60 s for surgical anaesthesia, adjusted according to response. The child should be ready in 2-3 min if given IV or 3-5 min if given IM.</li>
                                    <li>Give a further dose of ketamine at $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV if the child responds to a painful stimulus.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (longer procedures) by continuous IV infusion:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Neonate: Give initially $0.5-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion of $500 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h, adjusted according to response; up to $2 \mathrm{mg} /$ kg per h can be used to produce deep anaesthesia.</li>
                                    <li>Infant or child: Give initially $0.5-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion of $0.5-2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h, adjusted according to response.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>At the end of the procedure, turn the child into the lateral position and closely supervise recovery in a quiet place.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Special considerations</h4>
                        <h5>Airway</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The smaller-diameter airway of children makes them especially susceptible to airway obstruction, so they often need intubation to protect their airway during surgical procedures.</li>
                            <li>Small children also have difficulty in moving heavy columns of air, so that adult vaporizer units are unacceptable.</li>
                            <li>Endotracheal tube sizes for children are given in Table 28.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Alternatively, as a rough guide for normally nourished children aged >2 years, use the following formula:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            Internal diameter of tube $(\mathrm{mm})=\frac{\text { Age }(\text { years })}{4}+4$
                        </div>
                        <p>Another rough indicator of the correct tube size is the diameter of the child's little finger. Always have tubes one size larger and smaller available. A noncuffed tube should have a small air leak. Listen to the lungs with a stethoscope after intubation to ensure that the breath sounds are equal on the two sides.</p>
                        <h5>Hypothermia</h5>
                        <p>Small children lose heat more rapidly than adults because they have a greater relative surface area and are poorly insulated. This is important, as hypothermia can affect drug metabolism, anaesthesia and blood coagulation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevent hypothermia in the operating room by maintaining a temperature $>28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when operating on an infant or small child, and cover the exposed parts of the child.</li>
                            <li>Use warmed fluids (but not too hot).</li>
                            <li>Avoid long procedures ( >1 h ) unless the child can be kept warm.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the child's temperature as frequently as possible and at completion of the operation. Preferably use a low-reading thermometer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Hypoglycaemia</h5>
                        <p>Infants and children are at risk for hypoglycaemia because of their limited ability to use fat and protein to synthesize glucose.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use glucose infusions during anaesthesia to help maintain the blood sugar level. For most paediatric operations, other than minor ones, give Ringer's lactate or normal saline with $5 \%$ glucose at a rate of $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h, in addition to replacing the measured fluid losses.</li>
                            <li>Check blood glucose regularly, as the signs of hypoglycaemia might be masked by anaesthesia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Blood loss</h5>
                        <p>Children have smaller blood volumes than adults, so even small amounts of blood loss can be life-threatening, especially if the child is already anaemic.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Measure blood loss during operations as accurately as possible.</li>
                            <li>Consider blood transfusion if the blood loss exceeds $10 \%$ of blood volume (see Table 29).</li>
                            <li>Have blood available in the operating room if blood loss is anticipated.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>monitor the airway, breathing and circulation</li>
                            <li>observe vital signs: temperature, pulse (see Table 30), respiratory rate and blood pressure (with the correct size of cuff, Table 30). Observations should be made more often if there is a change from a normal to an abnormal value.</li>
                            <li>monitor oxygen saturation (normal, > 94%) after a general anaesthetic. Give oxygen if required.</li>
                            <li>Observe the patient closely until the effect of the anaesthetic has worn off.</li>

                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Normal pulse rates are 10% slower in sleeping children. In infants and children, the presence or absence of a strong central pulse is often a more useful guide to the presence or absence of shock than a blood pressure reading.</p>
                        <h4>Fluid management</h4>
                        <p>Postoperatively, children commonly require more than maintenance fluid. Children who have undergone abdominal operations typically require $150\%$ of baseline requirements (p. 304) and even larger amounts if peritonitis is present. The preferred IV fluids are Ringer's lactate with 5% glucose, normal saline with 5% glucose or half-normal saline with 5% glucose. Note that normal saline and Ringer's lactate do not contain glucose and are therefore a risk in hypoglycaemia; large amounts of $5 \%$ glucose contain no sodium and can produce hyponatraemia and cerebral oedema (see Annex 4, p. 377).</p>
                        <p>Monitor fluid status closely.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Record inputs and outputs (IV fluids, nasogastric drainage, vomit, urine drain outputs) every $4-6 \mathrm{~h}$.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Urine output is the most sensitive indicator of fluid status in a child:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal urine output: infants, $1-2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h ; children, $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If urinary retention is suspected, pass a urinary catheter. This also allows hourly measurements of urine output, which can be valuable for severely ill children. Suspect urinary retention if the bladder is palpable or the child is unable to void urine.</p>
                        <h4>Pain control</h4>
                        <p>Have a plan for postoperative pain management.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mild pain</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Give paracetamol ( $10-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every $4-6 \mathrm{~h}$ ) by mouth or rectally. Oral paracetamol can be given several hours before the operation or rectally at the completion of surgery.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Severe pain</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Give IV narcotic analgesics (IM injections are painful)</li>
                                    <li>Morphine sulfate, $0.05-0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV every $2-4 \mathrm{~h}$</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>Many surgical conditions increase caloric needs or prevent adequate nutritional intake. Many children with surgical problems present in a debilitated state. Poor nutrition adversely affects their response to injury and delays wound healing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Feed children as soon as possible after surgery.</li>
                            <li>Provide a high-calorie diet containing adequate protein and vitamin supplements.</li>
                            <li>Consider feeding by nasogastric tube for children whose oral intake is poor.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the child's weight.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Prevention of complications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encourage early mobilization:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>deep breathing and coughing</li>
                                    <li>active daily exercise</li>
                                    <li>Move joints passively</li>
                                    <li>muscular strengthening</li>
                                    <li>provide walking aids, such as canes, crutches and walkers, with instructions for their use</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prevent skin breakdown and pressure sores:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Turn the patient frequently.</li>
                                    <li>Keep urine and faeces off skin.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Common postoperative problems</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tachycardia</strong> (raised pulse rate, see Table 30, p. 261) may be caused by pain, hypovolaemia, anaemia, fever, hypoglycaemia or infection.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Examine the child.</li>
                                    <li>Review the child's pre-operative and intra-operative care.</li>
                                    <li>Monitor the response to pain medication, boluses of IV fluids, oxygen and IV transfusions, when appropriate.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Bradycardia</strong> in a child should be considered a sign of hypoxia until proven otherwise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fever</strong>
                                <p>May be due to tissue injury, wound infection, pneumonia, internal abscess, urinary tract infection (from indwelling catheters), phlebitis (from an IV catheter site) or other concomitant infection (e.g. malaria).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>See section 9.3.6, p. 279 for information on the diagnosis and treatment of wound infections.</li>

                            <li><strong>Low urine output</strong> may be due to hypovolaemia, urinary retention or renal failure; usually due to inadequate fluid resuscitation.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Examine the child.</li>
                                    <li>Review the child's fluid record.</li>
                                    <li>If hypovolaemia is suspected, give normal saline ( $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) and repeat once (total highest safe level, $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$; watch closely after first $20 \mathrm{ml} /$ kg for circulatory fluid overload), as needed.</li>
                                    <li>If urinary retention is suspected (the child is uncomfortable and has a full bladder on physical examination), pass a urinary catheter.</li>

                                    <li>Place a damp, sterile normal saline dressing in the wound, and change the dressing every 24 h .</li>
                                    <li>If the infection is superficial and does not involve deep tissues, monitor for development of an abscess and give antibiotics:
