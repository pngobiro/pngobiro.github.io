                        <p>Cough and difficulty in breathing are common problems in young children. The causes range from a mild, self-limited illness to severe, life-threatening disease. This chapter provides guidelines for managing the most important conditions that cause cough, difficulty in breathing or both in children aged 2 months to 5 years. The differential diagnosis of these conditions is described in Chapter 2. Management of these problems in infants < 2 months of age is described in Chapter 3 and management in severely malnourished children in Chapter 7.</p>
                        <p>Most episodes of cough are due to the common cold, each child having several episodes a year. The commonest severe illness and cause of death that presents with cough or difficult breathing is pneumonia, which should be considered first in any differential diagnosis (Table 6, p. 77).</p>

                        <p>Pneumonia is caused by viruses or bacteria. It is usually not possible to determine the specific cause of pneumonia by clinical features or chest X-ray appearance. Pneumonia is classified as severe or non-severe on the basis of clinical features, the management being based on the classification. Antibiotic therapy should be given in most cases of pneumonia and severe pneumonia. Severe pneumonia may require additional supportive care, such as oxygen, to be given in hospital.</p>

                        <h4>Investigations</h4>
                        <p>Measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry in all children suspected of having pneumonia.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If possible, obtain a chest X-ray to identify pleural effusion, empyema, pneumothorax, pneumatocoele, interstitial pneumonia or pericardial effusion.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Admit the child to hospital.</p>

                        <h5>Oxygen therapy</h5>
                        <p>Ensure continuous oxygen supply, either as cylinders or oxygen concentrator, at all times.</p>
                        <p>Give oxygen to all children with oxygen saturation < 90%</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use nasal prongs as the preferred method of oxygen delivery to young infants; if not available, a nasal or nasopharyngeal catheter may be used. The different methods of oxygen administration and diagrams showing their use are given in section 10.7, p. 312.</li>
                            <li>Use a pulse oximetry to guide oxygen therapy (to keep oxygen saturation $>90 \%$ ). If a pulse oximeter is not available, continue oxygen until the signs of hypoxia (such as inability to breastfeed or breathing rate $\geq 70 / \mathrm{min}$ ) are no longer present.</li>
                            <li>Remove oxygen for a trial period each day for stable children while continuing to use a pulse oximeter to determine oxygen saturation. Discontinue oxygen if the saturation remains stable at $>90 \%$ (at least 15 min on room air).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nurses should check every 3 h that the nasal prongs are not blocked with mucus and are in the correct place and that all connections are secure.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Antibiotic therapy</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give intravenous ampicillin (or benzylpenicillin) and gentamicin.</li>
                            <li>Ampicillin $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ or benzylpenicillin $50000 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV every 6 h for at least 5 days</li>
                            <li>Gentamicin $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV once a day for at least 5 days.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the child does not show signs of improvement within 48 h and staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected, switch to gentamicin $7.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV once a day and cloxacillin $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV every 6 h (p. 83).</p>
                        <p>Use ceftriaxone ( $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV once daily) in cases of failure of firstline treatment.</p>

                        <h5>Supportive care</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove by gentle suction any thick secretions at the entrance to the nasal passages or throat, which the child cannot clear.</li>
                            <li>If the child has fever ( $\geq 39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or $\geq 102.2^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) which appears to be causing distress, give paracetamol.</li>
                            <li>If wheeze is present, give a rapid-acting bronchodilator (see p. 98), and start steroids when appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the child receives daily maintenance fluids appropriate for his or her age (see section 10.2, p. 304), but avoid over-hydration.</li>
                            <li>Encourage breastfeeding and oral fluids.</li>
                            <li>If the child cannot drink, insert a nasogastric tube and give maintenance fluids in frequent small amounts. If the child is taking fluids adequately by mouth, do not use a nasogastric tube as it increases the risk for aspiration pneumonia and obstructs part of the nasal airway. If oxygen is given by nasal catheter at the same time as nasogastric fluids, pass both tubes through the same nostril.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Encourage the child to eat as soon as food can be taken.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Monitoring</h5>
                        <p>The child should be checked by a nurse at least every 3 h and by a doctor at least twice a day. In the absence of complications, within 2 days there should be signs of improvement (breathing slower, less indrawing of the lower chest wall, less fever, improved ability to eat and drink, better oxygen saturation).</p>

                        <h5>Other alternative diagnosis and treatment</h5>
                        <p>If the child has not improved after 2 days or if the child's condition has worsened, look for complications (see section 4.3) or alternative diagnoses. If possible, obtain a chest X-ray. The commonest other possible diagnoses are:</p>
                        <p><strong>Staphylococcal pneumonia.</strong> This is suggested if there is rapid clinical deterioration despite treatment, by a pneumatocoele or pneumothorax with effusion on chest X-ray, numerous Gram-positive cocci in a smear of sputum or heavy growth of $S$. aureus in cultured sputum or empyema fluid. The presence of septic skin pustules supports the diagnosis.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treat with cloxacillin ( $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IM or IV every 6 h ) and gentamicin ( $7.5 \mathrm{mg} /$ kg IM or IV once a day). When the child improves (after at least 7 days of IV or IM antibiotics), continue cloxacillin orally four times a day for a total course of 3 weeks. Note that cloxacillin can be replaced by another antistaphylococcal antibiotic, such as oxacillin, flucloxacillin or dicloxacillin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Tuberculosis.</strong> A child with persistent cough and fever for more than 2 weeks and signs of pneumonia after adequate antibiotic treatment should be evaluated for TB. If another cause of the fever cannot be found, TB should be considered, particularly in malnourished children. Further investigations and treatment for TB, following national guidelines, may be initiated and response to anti-TB treatment evaluated (see section 4.7.2, p. 115). The HIV status of all children suspected of having TB should be confirmed if not known.</p>
                        <p><strong>HIV infection or exposure to HIV.</strong> Some aspects of antibiotic treatment are different for children who are HIV positive or in whom HIV infection is suspected. Although pneumonia in many of these children has the same etiology as that in children without HIV, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), often at the age of 4-6 months (see section 8.4, p. 244) is an important cause to be suspected and treated.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treat as for severe pneumonia above; give ampicillin plus gentamicin IM or IV for 10 days.</li>
                            <li>If the child does not improve within 48 h , switch to ceftriaxone at $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV once daily over 30 min . If ceftriaxone is not available, give gentamicin plus cloxacillin, as above.</li>
                            <li>For children < 12 months, also give high-dose co-trimoxazole ( $8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ trimethoprim and $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ sulfamethoxazole IV every 8 h or orally three times a day) for 3 weeks. For a child aged 12-59 months, give this treatment only if there are clinical signs of PCP (such as chest X-ray findings of interstitial pneumonia).</li>
                            <li>For further management of the child, including PCP prophylaxis, see Chapter 8, p. 225).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Discharge</h5>
                        <p>Children with severe pneumonia can be discharged when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respiratory distress has resolved.</li>
                            <li>There is no hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation, $>90 \%$ ).</li>
                            <li>They are feeding well.</li>
                            <li>They are able to take oral medication or have completed a course of parenteral antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>The parents understand the signs of pneumonia, risk factors and when to return.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Follow-up</h5>
                        <p>Children with severe pneumonia may cough for several weeks. As they have been very sick, their nutrition is often poor. Give the vaccinations that are due, and arrange follow-up 2 weeks after discharge, if possible, to check the child's nutrition. Also address risk factors such as malnutrition, indoor air pollution and parental smoking.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>oxygen saturation < 90% on pulse oximetry or central cyanosis</li>

                        <h4>Treatment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treat child as outpatient.</li>
                            <li>Advise carers to give normal fluid requirements plus extra breast milk or fluids if there is a fever. Small frequent drinks are more likely to be taken and less likely to be vomited</li>
