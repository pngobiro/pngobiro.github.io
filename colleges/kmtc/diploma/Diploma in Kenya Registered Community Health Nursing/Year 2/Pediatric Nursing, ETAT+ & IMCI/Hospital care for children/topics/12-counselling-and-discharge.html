                        <p>In general, in the management of acute infections, a child can be considered ready for discharge after the clinical condition has improved markedly (afebrile, alert, eating and sleeping normally), and oral treatment has been started.</p>
                        <p>A decision on when to discharge should be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration factors such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the family's home circumstances and how much support is available to care for the child</li>
                            <li>the staff's judgement of the likelihood that the treatment course will be completed at home</li>
                            <li>the staff's judgement of the likelihood that the family will return immediately to hospital if the child's condition worsens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The timing of discharge of a child with severe acute malnutrition is particularly important and is discussed in Chapter 7, p. 219. In each case, the family should be given as much warning as possible of the discharge date, so that appropriate arrangements can be made to support the child at home.</p>
                        <p>If the family removes the child prematurely against the advice of the hospital staff, counsel the mother on how to continue treatment at home, and encourage her to bring the child for follow-up after 1-2 days and to make contact with the local health worker for help in the follow-up care of the child.</p>

                        <p>A simple, pictorial card reminding the mother of home care instructions, when to return for follow-up care and the signs indicating the need to return immediately to the hospital can be given to each mother. This card will help her to remember the appropriate foods and fluids and when to return to the health worker.</p>
                        <p>Appropriate cards should be available as part of national IMCI guidelines. If they are available, use them; if not, see Annex 6 for a reference to an example.</p>
                        <p>When reviewing the mother's card with the mother:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hold the card so that she can easily see the pictures, or allow her to hold it herself.</li>
                            <li>Point to the pictures as you talk, and explain each one; this will help her to remember what the pictures represent.</li>
                            <li>Mark the information that is relevant to the mother. For example, put circles around the feeding advice for the child's age and around the signs to return immediately. If the child has diarrhoea, tick the appropriate fluid(s) to be given. Record the date for the next vaccination.</li>
                            <li>Watch to see if the mother looks worried or puzzled. If so, encourage questions.</li>
                            <li>Ask the mother to tell you in her own words what she should do at home. Encourage her to use the card to help her remember.</li>
                            <li>Give her the card to take home. Suggest that she show it to other family members. (If you do not have a large enough supply of cards to give to every mother, keep several in the clinic to show to mothers.)</li>
                            <li>Provide an effective interpreter if language is a barrier.</li>

                        <p>First, identify any feeding problems that have not been fully resolved.</p>
                        <p>Ask the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you breastfeed your child?</li>
                            <li>How many times during the day?</li>
                            <li>Do you also breastfeed during the night?</li>
                            <li>Does the child take any other food or fluids?</li>
                            <li>What food or fluids?</li>
                            <li>How many times a day?</li>
                            <li>What do you use to feed the child?</li>
                            <li>How large are the servings?</li>
                            <li>Does the child receive his or her own serving?</li>
                            <li>Who feeds the child and how?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Compare the child's actual feeding with the recommended guidelines for feeding a child of that age (see section 10.1.2, p. 299). Identify any differences, and list these as feeding problems.</p>
                        <p>In addition, consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Difficulty in breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>Lack of active feeding</li>
                            <li>Not feeding well during the illness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Advise the mother how to overcome the problems and how to feed the child. Refer to local feeding recommendations for children of different ages. These recommendations should include details of locally appropriate energy-rich and nutrient-rich complementary foods.</p>
                        <p>Even when specific feeding problems are not found, praise the mother for what she does well. Give her advice that promotes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>improved complementary feeding practices with locally available energyand nutrient-rich foods</li>
                            <li>giving nutritious snacks to children aged $\geq 2$ years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of nutritionally adequate diets (see Chart 15, p. 106 in the WHO manual Management of the child with a serious infection or severe malnutrition could be printed on the reverse of a locally adapted mother's card.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not give BCG or yellow fever vaccine to a child with symptomatic HIV infection or AIDS, but do give the other vaccines.</li>
                            <li>Do not give DPT-2 or -3 to a child who has had convulsions or shock within 3 days of the most recent dose.</li>

                        <p>A child with diarrhoea who is due to receive oral polio vaccine should be given a dose, but this dose should not be counted in the schedule. Make a note on the child's immunization record that it coincided with diarrhoea, so that the health worker will give the child an extra dose.</p>

The scheduled dose should also be given as soon as possible after 9 months of age. The extra measles dose is also recommended for groups at high risk for death from measles, such as infants in refugee camps, infants admitted to hospitals, HIV-positive infants and infants affected by disasters and during outbreaks of measles.</p>
                        <p>A second opportunity to receive a dose of measles vaccine should be provided for all children. This may be done either as part of the routine schedule or in a campaign.</p>
