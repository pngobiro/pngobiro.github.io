                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">10.1.1 Supporting breastfeeding</h3>
                        <p>Breastfeeding is most important for protecting infants from illness and for their recovery from illness.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended from birth until 6 months of age.</li>
                            <li>Continued breastfeeding, with adequate complementary foods, is recommended from 6 months to $\geq 2$ years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health workers treating sick young children have the responsibility to encourage mothers to breastfeed and to help them overcome any difficulties.</p>
                        <h4>Assessing a breastfeed</h4>
                        <p>Take a breastfeeding history by asking about the infant's feeding and behaviour. Observe the mother while breastfeeding to decide whether she needs help. Observe:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>how the infant is attached to the breast (see next page). Signs of good attachment are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>areola visible above infant's mouth</li>
                                    <li>mouth wide open</li>
                                    <li>lower lip turned out</li>
                                    <li>infant's chin touching the breast</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>how the mother holds her infant (see next page)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>should be held close to the mother</li>
                                    <li>should face the breast</li>
                                    <li>body should be in a straight line with the head</li>
                                    <li>whole body should be supported</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>how the mother holds her breast</li>

                        <h4>Overcoming difficulties</h4>
                        <h5>1. 'Not enough milk'</h5>
                        <p>Almost all mothers can produce enough breast milk for one or even two infants; however, sometimes an infant is not getting enough breast milk. The signs are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>poor weight gain ( <500 g/month or <125 g/week or infant weighing less than the birth weight after 2 weeks)</li>
                            <li>passing a small amount of concentrated urine (less than six times a day, yellow and strong-smelling)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Common reasons why an infant may not be getting enough breast milk are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>poor breastfeeding practices: poor attachment (very common cause), delayed start of breastfeeding, feeding at fixed times, no night feeds, short feeds, use of bottles, pacifiers, other foods and other fluids</li>
                            <li>psychological factors in the mother: lack of confidence, worry, stress, depression, dislike of breastfeeding, rejection of infant, tiredness</li>
                            <li>mother's physical condition: chronic illness (e.g. TB, severe anaemia or rheumatic heart disease), contraceptive pill, diuretics, pregnancy, severe malnutrition, alcohol, smoking, retained piece of placenta (rare)</li>
                            <li>infant's condition: illness or congenital anomaly (such as cleft palate or congenital heart disease) that interferes with feeding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A mother whose breast milk supply is reduced will have to increase it, while a mother who has stopped breastfeeding may need to relactate.</p>
                        <p>Help a mother to breastfeed again by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>keeping the infant close to her and not giving him or her to other carers</li>
                            <li>ensuring plenty of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant at all times</li>
                            <li>offering the infant her breast whenever the infant is willing to suckle</li>
                            <li>helping the infant to take the breast by expressing breast milk into the infant's mouth, and positioning the infant so that he or she can easily attach to the breast</li>
                            <li>avoiding use of bottles, teats and pacifiers. If necessary, express the breast milk and give it by cup. If this cannot be done, artificial feeds may be needed until an adequate milk supply is established.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2. How to increase the milk supply</h5>
                        <p>The main way to increase or restart the supply of breast milk is for the infant to suckle often in order to stimulate the breast.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give other feeds from a cup while waiting for breast milk to come. Do not use bottles or pacifiers. Reduce the other milk by $30-60 \mathrm{ml}$ per day as the mother's breast milk starts to increase. Monitor the infant's weight gain.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>3. Refusal or reluctance to breastfeed</h5>
                        <p>The main reasons why an infant might refuse to breastfeed are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The infant is ill, in pain or sedated.</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the infant is able to suckle, encourage the mother to breastfeed more often. If the infant is very ill, the mother may need to express breast milk and feed by cup or gastric tube until the infant can breastfeed again.</li>
                                    <li>If the infant is in hospital, arrange for the mother to stay with the infant in order to breastfeed.</li>
                                    <li>Help the mother to find a way to hold her infant without pressing on a painful place.</li>
                                    <li>Explain to the mother how to clear a blocked nose. Suggest short feeds, more often than usual, for a few days.</li>
                                    <li>A sore mouth may be due to Candida infection (thrush) or teething. Treat the infection with nystatin ( $100000 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{ml}$ ) suspension. Give $1-2 \mathrm{ml}$ dropped into the mouth four times a day for 7 days. If this is not available, apply 1% gentian violet solution. Encourage the mother of a teething infant to be patient and keep offering the breast.</li>
                                    <li>If the mother is on regular sedation, reduce the dose or try a less sedating alternative.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>There is difficulty with the breastfeeding technique</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Help the mother with her technique: ensure that the infant is positioned and attached well without pressing on the infant's head or shaking the breast.</li>
                                    <li>Advise her not to use a feeding bottle or pacifier: if necessary, use a cup.</li>
                                    <li>Treat engorgement by removing milk from the breast; otherwise mastitis or an abscess may develop. If the infant is not able to suckle, help the mother to express her milk.</li>
                                    <li>Help reduce oversupply. If an infant is poorly attached and suckles ineffectively, the infant may breastfeed more frequently or for a longer time, stimulating the breast so that more milk is produced than required. Oversupply may also occur if a mother tries to make her infant feed from both breasts at each feed, when this is not necessary.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>A change has upset the infant.</strong>
                                <p>Changes such as separation from the mother, a new carer, illness of the mother, a change in the family routine or the mother's smell (due to a different soap, food or menstruation) can upset the infant and cause refusal to breastfeed.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Low-birth-weight and sick infants</h5>
                        <p>Infants with a birth weight < 2.5 kg need breast milk even more than larger infants; often, however, they cannot breastfeed immediately after birth, especially if they are very small.</p>
                        <p>For the first few days, an infant may not be able to take oral feeds and may have to be fed IV. Initiate early feeding with small oral feeds even on day 1 or as soon as the infant can tolerate enteral feeds.</p>
                        <p>Very low-birth-weight infants ( <1.5 kg ) may have to be fed by naso- or orogastric tube during the first days of life. Preferably give the mother's expressed breast milk. The mother can let the infant suck on her cleaned finger while being tube fed. This may stimulate the infant's digestive tract and help weight gain.</p>
                        <p>Low-birth-weight infants at $\geq 32$ weeks' gestational age can start suckling on the breast. Let the mother put her infant to the breast as soon as the infant is well enough. Continue giving expressed breast milk by cup or tube to make sure that the infant gets all the nutrition needed.</p>
                        <p>Infants at $\geq 34-36$ weeks' gestational age can usually take all that they need directly from the breast.</p>

                        <h5>Infants who cannot breastfeed</h5>
                        <p>Non-breastfed infants should receive either:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>expressed breast milk (preferably from their own mothers) or donor human milk where safe and affordable milk-banking facilities are available</li>
                            <li>formula milk prepared with clean water according to instructions or, if possible, ready-made liquid formula</li>
                            <li>If the above are not available, consider animal milk. Dilute cow's milk by adding 50 ml of water to 100 ml of milk, then add 10 g of sugar, with an approved micronutrient supplement. If possible, do not use for premature infants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Expressed breast milk is the best choice, in the following amounts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infants $\geq 2.0 \mathrm{~kg}$ : Give $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily, divided into eight feeds at $3-\mathrm{h}$ intervals.</li>
                            <li>Infants < 2.0 kg : See p. 60 for detailed guidance for low-birth-weight infants.</li>
                            <li>If the child is too weak to suck but can swallow, feeding can be done with a cup. Feed by naso- or orogastric tube if the child is lethargic or severely anorexic or unable to swallow.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The principles for feeding sick infants and young children are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continue breastfeeding.</li>
                            <li>Do not withhold food.</li>
                            <li>Give frequent, small feeds, every 2-3 h.</li>
                            <li>Coax, encourage, and be patient.</li>
                            <li>Feed by nasogastric tube if the child is severely anorexic.</li>
                            <li>Promote catch-up growth after the appetite returns.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The food provided should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>palatable (to the child)</li>
                            <li>easily eaten (soft or liquid consistency)</li>
                            <li>easily digested</li>
                            <li>nutritious: rich in energy and nutrients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The basic principle of nutritional management is to provide a diet with sufficient energy-producing foods and high-quality proteins. Foods with a high oil or fat content are recommended; up to $30-40 \%$ of the total calories can be given as fat. In addition, feeding at frequent intervals is necessary to achieve high energy intake. For sick children, provide multivitamin and mineral supplements.</p>
                        <p>The child should be encouraged to eat relatively small amounts frequently. If young children are left to feed themselves or have to compete with siblings for food, they may not get enough to eat.</p>
                        <p>A blocked nose, with dry or thick mucus, may interfere with feeding. Put drops of saline into the nose with a moistened wick to help soften the mucus.</p>
                        <p>A minority of children who are unable to eat for a number of days (due, e.g. to impaired consciousness in meningitis or respiratory distress in severe pneumonia) may have to be fed through a nasogastric tube. The risk for aspiration can be reduced if small volumes are given frequently and by ensuring before each feed that the tube is in the stomach.</p>
                        <p>To supplement the child's nutritional management in hospital, feeding should be increased during convalescence to make up for any lost weight. It is important that the mother or carer offer food to the child more frequently than normal (at least one additional meal a day) after the child's appetite increases.</p>

                        <p>Give the sick child more than the above amounts if he or she has fever (increase by $10 \%$ for every $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of fever).</p>
                        <h4>Monitoring fluid intake</h4>
                        <p>Pay careful attention to maintaining adequate hydration in very sick children, who may have had no oral fluid intake for some time. Fluids should preferably be given orally (by mouth or nasogastric tube).</p>
                        <p>If fluids have to be given IV, it is important to monitor infusion closely because of the risk for fluid overload, which can lead to heart failure or cerebral oedema.</p>
                        <p>If it is impossible to monitor the IV fluid infusion closely, the IV route should be used only for the management of severe dehydration, septic shock, delivering IV antibiotics and for children for whom oral fluids are contraindicated (such as those with perforation of the intestine or other surgical abdominal problems). Possible IV maintenance fluids include half-normal saline plus $5 \%$ or $10 \%$ glucose. Do not give $5 \%$ glucose alone as this can lead to hyponatraemia. See Annex 4, p. 377 for composition of IV fluids.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The temperatures given in these guidelines are rectal temperatures, unless otherwise stated. Oral and axillary temperatures are lower by approximately $0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $0.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Fever is not an indication for antibiotic treatment and may help the immune defence against infection. High fever ( $>39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or $>102.2^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) can have harmful effects, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>reducing the appetite</li>
                            <li>making the child irritable</li>
                            <li>precipitating convulsions in some children aged 6 months to 5 years</li>
                            <li>increasing oxygen consumption (e.g. in a child with very severe pneumonia, heart failure or meningitis).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All children with fever should be examined for signs and symptoms that indicate the underlying cause of the fever, and should be treated accordingly (see Chapter 6, p. 149).</p>
                        <h4>Antipyretic treatment</h4>
                        <h5>Paracetamol</h5>
                        <p>Treatment with oral paracetamol should be restricted to children aged $\geq 2$ months who have a fever of $\geq 39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(\geq 102.2^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and are uncomfortable or distressed because of the high fever. Children who are alert and active are unlikely to benefit from paracetamol.</p>
                        <ul><li>Paracetamol dose is $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 6 h .</li></ul>
                        <h5>Ibuprofen</h5>
                        <p>The effectiveness in lowering temperature and the safety of ibuprofen and acetaminophen are comparable, except that ibuprofen, like any NSAID, can cause gastritis and is slightly more expensive.</p>
                        <ul><li>Ibuprofen dose is $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 6-8 h.</li></ul>
                        <h5>Other agents</h5>
                        <p>Aspirin is not recommended as a first-line antipyretic because it has been linked with Reye syndrome, a rare but serious condition affecting the liver and brain. Avoid giving aspirin to children with chickenpox, dengue fever and other haemorrhagic disorders.</p>
                        <p>Other agents are not recommended because of their toxicity and inefficacy (dipyrone, phenylbutazone).</p>
                        <h4>Supportive care</h4>
                        <p>Children with fever should be lightly clothed, kept in a warm but well-ventilated room, and encouraged to increase their oral fluid intake.</p>
