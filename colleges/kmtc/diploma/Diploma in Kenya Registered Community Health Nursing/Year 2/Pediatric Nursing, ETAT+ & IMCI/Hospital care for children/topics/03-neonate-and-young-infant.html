                        <p>Most newborns require only simple supportive care at and after delivery.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dry the infant with a clean towel.</li>

                        <p>Skin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding are the best ways to keep an infant warm and prevent hypoglycaemia. Term and low-birth-weight neonates weighing > 1200 g who do not have complications and are clinically stable should be put in skin-to-skin contact with the mother soon after birth after they have been dried thoroughly to prevent hypothermia.</p>

                        <p>Resuscitation may be required for some infants, such as those born to mothers with chronic illness, to mothers who had a previous fetal or neonatal death, to mothers with pre-eclampsia, in multiple pregnancies, in preterm delivery, in abnormal presentation of the fetus, infants with a prolapsed cord, or after prolonged labour, rupture of membranes or meconium-stained liquor.</p>

                        <p><sup>a</sup> Positive pressure ventilation should be initiated with air for infants with gestation > 32 weeks. For very preterm infants, it is preferable to start with $30\%$ oxygen if possible. A and B are basic resuscitation steps</p>

                        <p>There is no need to slap the infant; rubbing the back two or three times in addition to thorough drying is enough for stimulation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>A. Airway</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep the infant's head in a slightly extended position to open the airway.</li>
                            <li>Do not suction routinely. Suction the airway if there is meconium-stained fluid and the infant is not crying and moving limbs. When the amniotic fluid is clear, suction only if the nose or mouth is full of secretions.</li>
                            <li>Suck the mouth, nose and oropharynx by direct vision; do not suck right down the throat, as this can cause apnoea or bradycardia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>B. Breathing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose a mask size that fits over the nose and mouth (see below): size 1 for normal-weight infant, size 0 for small ( $<2.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) infants</li>
                            <li>Ventilate with bag and mask at 40-60 breaths/min.</li>
                            <li>Make sure the chest moves up with each press on the bag; in a very small infant, make sure the chest does not move too much (danger of causing pneumothorax).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>C. Circulation</h4>
                        <p>Give chest compressions if the heart rate is < 60/min after 30-60 s of ventilation with adequate chest movements: 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths/min (three compressions: one breath every 2 s ).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place thumbs just below the line connecting the nipples on the sternum (see below).</li>
                            <li>Compress one third the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy can result from lack of oxygen to vital organs before, during or immediately after birth. The initial treatment is effective resuscitation as above.</p>
                        <p>Problems during the days after birth:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Convulsions: Treat with phenobarbital (see p. 53); ensure hypoglycaemia is not present (check blood glucose).</li>
                            <li>Apnoea: common after severe birth asphyxia; sometimes associated with convulsions. Resuscitate with bag and mask, and manage with oxygen by nasal prongs.</li>
                            <li>Inability to suck: Feed with expressed breast milk via a nasogastric tube. Avoid delayed emptying of the stomach, which may lead to regurgitation of feeds.</li>
                            <li>Poor motor tone: floppy or with limb stiffening (spasticity)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Prognosis can be predicted by recovery of motor function and sucking ability. An infant who is normally active will usually do well. An infant who, within a week of birth, is still floppy or spastic, unresponsive and cannot suck has a severe brain injury and will do poorly. The prognosis is less grim for infants who have recovered some motor function and are beginning to suck. The situation should be sensitively discussed with parents throughout the time the infant is in hospital.</p>

                            <li>Give ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin (see below).</li>
                            <li>If drowsy, unconscious or convulsing, check blood glucose. If glucose $<2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}(<40 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{ml})$, give $10 \%$ glucose at $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV. Then give a sustained IV infusion of $5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per h of 10% glucose for the next few days while oral feeds are built up.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you cannot check blood glucose quickly, assume hypoglycaemia and give glucose IV. If you cannot insert an IV drip, give expressed breast milk or glucose through a nasogastric tube.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give phenobarbital if convulsing (see p. 53).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep the young infant dry and well wrapped.</li>
                            <li>A hat can reduce heat loss. Keep the room warm (at least $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Keeping a young infant in close skin-to-skin contact with the mother (Kangaroo mother care, p. 59) for $24 \mathrm{~h} /$ day is an effective way of keeping the infant warm. An external heating device may be needed when the mother is asleep or too ill.</li>
                            <li>Pay special attention to avoid chilling the infant during an examination or investigation.</li>
                            <li>Check regularly that the infant's temperature is maintained in the range $36.5-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $97.7-99.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) rectal or $36.0-37.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( $96.8-98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) axillary. Use a low-reading thermometer to ensure detection of hypothermia.</li>

                        <p>Encourage the mother to breastfeed frequently to prevent hypoglycaemia. If the infant is unable to feed, give expressed breast milk by nasogastric tube.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Withhold oral feeding if there is bowel obstruction, necrotizing enterocolitis, or the feeds are not tolerated, indicated e.g. by increasing abdominal distension or vomiting everything.</li>
                            <li>Withhold oral feeding in the acute phase in infants who are lethargic, unconscious or having frequent convulsions.</li>

                        <p>If IV fluids are given, reduce the rate as the volume of oral or gastric milk feeds increases. IV fluids should ideally be given with an in-line burette to ensure the exact doses of fluids prescribed.</p>
                        <p>Increase the amount of fluid given over the first 3-5 days (total amount, oral plus IV).</p>

                        <p>When the infant tolerates oral feeds well, the amount of fluid might be increased to $180 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day after some days. Be careful in giving parenteral IV fluids, which can quickly overhydrate a child. Do not exceed $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day of IV fluids, unless the infant is dehydrated or under phototherapy or a radiant heater. This amount is the total fluid intake an infant needs, and oral intake must be taken into account when calculating IV rates.</p>

                            <li>During the first 2 days of life give $10 \%$ glucose infusion IV. Do not use IV glucose without sodium after the first 2 days of life. Suitable alternative IV fluids after the first 2 days are half normal saline and $5 \%$ dextrose.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Monitor the IV infusion very carefully (ideally through an in-line burette).</p>

                            <li>Give oxygen to neonates or young infants with any of the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>central cyanosis or gasping</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Use a pulse oximeter to guide oxygen therapy. Oxygen should be given if the oxygen saturation is $\leq 90 \%$, and the oxygen flow should be regulated to maintain saturation of > 90%. Oxygen can be discontinued once the infant can maintain saturation > 90% in room air.</p>
                        <p>Nasal prongs are the preferred method for delivering oxygen to this age group, with a flow rate of $0.5-1$ litre/min, increased to 2 litres/min in severe respiratory distress to achieve oxygen saturation > 90%. Thick secretions should be cleared from the throat by intermittent suction under direct observation, if they are obstructing the airway and the infant is too weak to clear them. Oxygen should be stopped when the infant's general condition improves and the above signs are no longer present.</p>

                        <p>These infants are usually strong enough to breastfeed and maintain their body temperature. Start feeds within 1 h of delivery. Their mothers usually need additional support for exclusive breastfeeding. They should be kept warm at all times. All low-birth-weight infants are at risk of infection and should be closely observed for infection control.</p>

                        <p>All infants with a gestation < 35 weeks or a birth weight < 2.0 kg should be admitted to a special care unit. These infants are at risk of hypothermia, feeding problems, apnoea, respiratory distress syndrome and necrotizing enterocolitis. The smaller the infant, the higher the risk.</p>
                        <p>The risks associated with keeping the child in hospital (e.g. hospital-acquired infections) should be balanced against the potential benefit of better care. See the infants at least twice a day to assess feeding ability, fluid intake or the presence of any danger signs (p.52) or signs of serious bacterial infection (p.54). If any of these signs is present, it should be closely monitored. Management of common problems is discussed below.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Preventing hypothermia</h4>
                        <p>Low-birth-weight neonates (weighing < 2000 g) who are clinically stable should be given Kangaroo mother care starting soon after birth and ensured at all times, day and night. To provide Kangaroo mother care:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dress the infant only in a nappy, hat and socks.</li>
                            <li>Place the infant skin-to-skin on the mother's chest between her breasts, with the infant's head turned to one side.</li>
                            <li>Tie the infant to the mother with a cloth.</li>
                            <li>Cover the mother and infant with the mother's clothes.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the mother to breastfeed the infant frequently.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Aim for a core body temperature of $36-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, with the feet warm and pink.</p>
                        <p>If the mother is unable to provide Kangaroo mother care, a clean incubator can be used. Incubators should be washed with disinfectant between infants and should be of a basic design that can be used appropriately by the staff available.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Feeding</h4>
                        <p>Many low-birth-weight infants will be able to suckle at the breast. Infants who can suckle should be breastfed. Those who cannot breastfeed should be given expressed breast milk with a cup and spoon. When the infant is sucking well at the breast and gaining weight, reduce the cup feeds. Infants unable to feed from a cup and spoon should be given intermittent bolus feeds through a gastric tube.</p>
                        <p>Feed the infant only the mother's own milk. In exceptional situations, when this is not possible, donor human milk should be given, if safe milk-banking facilities are available. Formula should be given only if neither of the above is possible.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Special feeding considerations for infants weighing < 1.5 kg at birth</h4>
                        <p>These infants are at the highest risk of feeding problems and necrotizing enterocolitis. The smaller the infant, the higher the risk.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starting on the first day, give $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day of enteral feeds, preferably expressed breast milk, with the remaining fluid requirement at $50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day met by IV fluids. If the infant is well and active and not receiving IV fluids, give $2-4 \mathrm{ml}$ of expressed breast milk every 2 h through a nasogastric tube, depending on the weight of the infant (see p. 57).</li>
                            <li>If the infant cannot tolerate enteral feeds, give IV fluids at $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day for the first day of life. It is best to use a paediatric ( 100 ml ) intravenous burette; 60 drops = 1 ml , therefore one drop per minute $=1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{h}$.</li>
                            <li>Check blood sugar every 6 h until enteral feeds are established, especially if the infant is apnoeic, lethargic or convulsing. Very low-birth-weight infants may need a 10% glucose solution. Add 10 ml of 50% glucose to every 90 ml of $4.3 \%$ glucose + 0.18% normal saline, or use 10% glucose in water solution.</li>
                            <li>Start enteral feeding when the condition of the infant is stable and there is no abdominal distension or tenderness, bowel sounds are present, meconium passed and no apnoea.</li>
                            <li>Calculate exact amounts for feeding and the timing of feeds.</li>
                            <li>Use a prescription chart.</li>
                            <li>Increase daily if well tolerated.</li>
                            <li>When commencing milk feeds, start with $2-4 \mathrm{ml}$ every $1-2 \mathrm{~h}$ by orogastric or nasogastric tube. Some active very-low-birth-weight infants can be fed with a cup and spoon or an eyedropper, which must be sterilized before each feed. Use only expressed breast milk if possible. If a $2-4-\mathrm{ml}$ volume is tolerated with no vomiting, abdominal distension or gastric aspirates of more than half the feed, the volume can be increased by $1-2 \mathrm{ml}$ per feed each day. Reduce or withhold feeds if there are signs of poor tolerance. Aim to establish feeding within the first 5-7 days so that the IV drip can be removed, to avoid infection.</li>
                            <li>The feeds may be increased during the first 2 weeks of life to $150-180 \mathrm{ml} /$ kg per day ( 3 -hourly feeds of 19-23 ml for a $1-\mathrm{kg}$ infant and $28-34 \mathrm{ml}$ for a $1.5-\mathrm{kg}$ infant). As the infant grows, recalculate the feed volume on the basis of the higher weight.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Give daily supplements when the infant is accepting full enteral feeds:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>vitamin D at 400 IU</li>
                            <li>calcium at $120-140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$</li>
                            <li>phosphorus at $60-90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$.</li>
                            <li>Start iron supplements at 2 weeks of age at a dosage of $2-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day until 6 months of age.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Preventing apnoea</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give caffeine citrate and aminophylline to prevent apnoea in premature infants. Caffeine is preferred if it is available.</li>
                            <li>The loading dose of caffeine citrate is $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ orally or IV (given slowly over 30 min ). A maintenance dose of $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day should be prescribed 24 h later and can be increased by $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 24 h to a maximum of $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day, unless side-effects develop. Continue 4-5 days after cessation of apnoea (see p. 69).</li>
                            <li>If caffeine is not available, give a loading dose of aminophylline at $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV over 20 min , followed by a maintenance dose of $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ every 12 h (see p. 69).</li>
                            <li>If an apnoea monitor is available, this should be used.</li>
                            <li>If an apnoea monitor is not available, a pulse oximeter with the alarm turned on for hypoxaemia may help to detect apnoea if the neonate is breathing room air.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3.11.3 Common problems of low-birth-weight infants</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Respiratory distress syndrome</h4>
                        <p>Preterm infants are at risk for respiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency. This can be reduced if pregnant mothers at risk for premature delivery (e.g. premature contractions or premature rupture of membranes) are given dexamethasone at two doses of 12 mg 24 h apart. Respiratory distress usually occurs in a preterm infant during the first 3 days of life. It is a self-limiting condition, because birth triggers an increase in surfactant production. The challenge is to support the infant for the first few days of life until such time as the deficiency resolves.</p>
                        <p>The key clinical features usually become obvious within 4 h of birth and include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>tachypnoea</li>
                            <li>an expiratory 'grunt'</li>
                            <li>intercostal and/or subcostal recession and</li>
                            <li>cyanosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Treatment</h5>
                        <p>The principles of treatment are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>minimal handling of the infant</li>
                            <li>supplementary oxygen if needed to keep the oxygen saturation > 90% but < 95% to avoid eye damage</li>
                            <li>initially no oral feeding</li>
                            <li>IV fluids (see above)</li>
                            <li>maintenance of a normal temperature range</li>
                            <li>IV antibiotics for neonatal sepsis, as it is difficult to exclude pneumonia as a cause of respiratory distress</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Continuous positive airway pressure is used, even in expiration, to prevent airway collapse, improve oxygenation and reduce breathing fatigue. See section 10.7 for further details.</p>
                        <p>If there is persistent respiratory distress or hypoxaemia, do chest X-ray to check for pneumothorax.</p>

                        <h4>Necrotizing enterocolitis</h4>
                        <p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (a bowel infection) may occur in low-birth-weight infants, especially after enteral feeds are started. The condition is commoner in low-birth-weight infants fed artificial formulae but may occur in breastfed infants.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Common signs of necrotizing enterocolitis are:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>abdominal distension or tenderness</li>
                            <li>intolerance to feeding</li>
                            <li>bile-stained vomit or bile-stained fluid up the nasogastric tube</li>
                            <li>blood in the stools</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>General signs of systemic illness include</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>apnoea</li>
                            <li>drowsiness or unconsciousness</li>
                            <li>fever or hypothermia</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Treatment</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stop enteral feeding.</li>
                            <li>Pass a nasogastric tube and leave it on free drainage.</li>
                            <li>Start an IV infusion of glucose-saline (see p. 57 for rate of infusion).</li>
                            <li>Start antibiotics: give ampicillin (or penicillin) plus gentamicin plus metronidazole for 10 days.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the infant has apnoea or other danger signs, give oxygen by nasal catheter. If apnoea continues, give aminophylline or caffeine IV (see p. 61).</p>
                        <p>If the infant is pale, check the Hb , and transfuse if $\mathrm{Hb}<10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.</p>
                        <p>Take a supine and lateral decubitus abdominal X-ray. If there is gas in the abdominal cavity outside the bowel, there may be bowel perforation. Ask a surgeon to see the infant urgently.</p>
                        <p>Examine the infant carefully each day. Reintroduce expressed breast milk feeds by nasogastric tube when the abdomen is soft and not tender, the infant is passing normal stools with no blood and is not having bilious vomiting. Start feeds slowly, and gradually increase by $1-2 \mathrm{ml}$ per feed each day.</p>
