                            <p>Cells are the body's smallest functional units. They are grouped together to form tissues, each of which has a specialised function, e.g. blood, muscle, bone. Different tissues are grouped together to form organs, e.g. the heart, stomach and brain. Organs are grouped together to form systems, each of which performs a set of related functions that maintain homeostasis and contribute to the health of the individual (see Fig. 1.2). For example, the digestive system is responsible for taking in, digesting and absorbing food, which involves a number of organs, including the stomach and intestines. The structure and different functions of cells and types of tissue are explored in this chapter.</p>

                            <p>The human body develops from a single cell called the zygote, which results from the fusion of the ovum (female egg cell) and the spermatozoon (male sex cell). Cell division follows and, as the fetus grows, cells with different structural and functional specialisations develop, all with the same genetic make-up as the zygote. Individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye. However, they can be seen when thin slices of tissue are stained in the laboratory and magnified using a microscope.</p>

                            <h3>Plasma membrane</h3>
                            <p>The structure and functions of membranes are fundamental to cell survival, as they control passage of substances into and out of it, regulating the intracellular environment.</p>

                            <h4>Structure</h4>
                            <p>The plasma membrane (Fig. 3.2) consists of two layers of phospholipids (p. 33) with proteins and sugars embedded in them. In addition to phospholipids, the lipid cholesterol is also present. The phospholipid molecules have a head, which is electrically charged and hydrophilic (meaning 'water-loving'), and a tail, which has no charge and is hydrophobic (meaning 'water-hating', Fig. 3.2A). The phospholipid bilayer is arranged like a sandwich with the hydrophilic heads aligned on the outer surfaces of the membrane and the hydrophobic tails forming a central water-repelling layer. These differences influence the transfer of substances across the membrane.</p>

                            <h4>Membrane proteins</h4>
                            <p>Those proteins that extend all the way through the membrane provide channels that allow the passage of, for example, electrolytes and non-lipid soluble substances. Protein molecules on the surface of the plasma membrane are shown in Fig. 3.2B. The membrane proteins perform several functions:</p>

                            <h3>Transport of substances across cell membranes</h3>
                            <p>Each cell is enclosed by its plasma membrane, which provides a selective barrier to substances entering or leaving. This property, called <strong>selective permeability</strong>, allows the cell (plasma) membrane to control the entry or exit of many substances, thereby regulating the composition of its internal environment. Particle size is important, as many small molecules, e.g. water, can pass freely across the membrane by simple diffusion, while large molecules cannot and may be confined to either the interstitial fluid or the intracellular fluid: in Fig. 3.3A, the pink and orange particles are too big to diffuse through the membrane pores, so the pink particles are trapped inside the cell and the orange particles are excluded.</p>
                            <p>Pores or specific channels in the plasma membrane admit certain substances but not others. In Fig. 3.3B, although the green and yellow particles are the same size, the membrane has channels only for the green ones, so the yellow particles are excluded.</p>
                            <p>The membrane is also studded with specialised pumps or carriers that import or export specific substances. In Fig. 3.3C the membrane has pumps that actively import the pink particles and other pumps that actively export the blue particles; pink particles therefore concentrate within the cell and blue particles concentrate outside the cell.</p>
                            <p>Selective permeability ensures that the chemical composition of the fluid inside cells is different from the interstitial fluid that bathes them. Transport mechanisms are explained in the next section.</p>

                            <h4>Passive transport</h4>
                            <p>This occurs when substances can cross the semipermeable plasma and organelle membranes, and move down the concentration gradient (downhill) without using energy.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Diffusion</strong><br>
                            This was described on page 36. Small molecules diffuse down their concentration gradient:</p>

                            <p><strong>Facilitated diffusion</strong><br>
                            This passive process is used by some substances that are unable to diffuse through the semipermeable membrane unaided, e.g. glucose, amino acids. Specialised protein carrier molecules in the membrane have specific sites that attract and bind substances to be transferred, like a lock and key mechanism. The carrier then changes its shape and deposits the substance on the other side of the membrane (Fig. 3.4). The carrier sites are specific and can be used by only one substance. As there are a finite number of carriers, there is a limit to the amount of a substance that can be transported at any time. This is known as the transport maximum.</p>

                            <p><strong>Osmosis</strong><br>
                            Osmosis is passive movement of water down its concentration gradient towards equilibrium across a semipermeable membrane. The process is explained on page 39.</p>

                            <h4>Active transport</h4>
                            <p>This is the transport of substances up their concentration gradient (uphill), i.e. from a lower to a higher concentration. Chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, p. 37) drives specialised protein carrier molecules that transport substances across the membrane in either direction (Fig. 3.4). The carrier sites are specific and can be used by only one substance; therefore the rate at which a substance is transferred depends on the number of sites available.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>The sodium-potassium pump</strong><br>
                            All cells possess this pump, which indirectly supports other transport mechanisms such as glucose uptake, and is essential in maintaining the electrical gradient needed to generate action potentials in nerve and muscle cells.</p>
                            <p>This active transport mechanism maintains the unequal concentrations of sodium ($Na^+$) and potassium ($K^+$) ions on either side of the plasma membrane. It may use up to 30% of cellular ATP (energy) requirements.</p>
                            <p>Potassium levels are much higher inside the cell than outside - it is the principal intracellular cation. Sodium levels are much higher outside the cell than inside - it is the principal extracellular cation. These ions tend to diffuse down their concentration gradients, outwards and $Na^+$ into the cell. In order to maintain their concentration gradients, excess $Na^+$ is constantly pumped out across the cell membrane in exchange for $K^+$.</p>

                            <p><strong>Bulk transport</strong><br>
                            Transfer of particles too large to cross cell membranes occurs by <strong>pinocytosis</strong> ('cell-drinking') or <strong>phagocytosis</strong> ('cell-eating'). These particles are engulfed by extensions of the cytoplasm (Fig. 3.5; see also Fig. 15.1), which enclose them, forming a membrane-bound vacuole. Pinocytosis allows the cell to bring in fluid. In phagocytosis, larger particles (e.g. cell fragments, foreign materials, microbes) are taken into the cell. Lysosomes (see later) then adhere to the vacuole membrane, releasing enzymes that digest the contents.</p>
                            <p>Extrusion of waste material by the reverse process through the plasma membrane is called <strong>exocytosis</strong>. Vesicles formed by the Golgi apparatus (see later) usually leave the cell in this way, as do any indigestible residues of phagocytosis.</p>

                            <p>Organelles (see Fig. 3.1), literally meaning 'small organs', have individual and highly specialised functions, and are often enclosed by their own membrane within the cytosol. They include the nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and cytoskeleton.</p>

                            <h3>Nucleus</h3>
                            <p>All body cells have a nucleus, with the exception of mature erythrocytes (red blood cells). Skeletal muscle fibres and some other cells contain several nuclei. The nucleus is the largest organelle and is contained within the nuclear envelope, a membrane similar to the plasma membrane but with tiny pores through which some substances can pass between it and the cytoplasm.</p>
                            <p>The nucleus contains the body's genetic material, in the form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, p. 476); this directs all its metabolic activities. In a non-dividing cell, DNA is present as a fine network of threads called <strong>chromatin</strong>, but when the cell prepares to divide, the chromatin forms distinct structures called <strong>chromosomes</strong> (see Fig. 17.1). A related substance, ribonucleic acid (RNA), is also found in the nucleus. There are different types of RNA, not all found in the nucleus, but which are, in general, involved in protein synthesis.</p>
                            <p>Within the nucleus there is a roughly spherical structure called the <strong>nucleolus</strong>, which is involved in synthesis (manufacture) and assembly of the components of ribosomes.</p>

                            <h3>Mitochondria</h3>
                            <p>Mitochondria are membranous, sausage-shaped structures in the cytoplasm, sometimes described as the 'power house' of the cell (Fig. 3.6). They are central to aerobic respiration, the processes by which chemical energy is made available in the cell. This is in the form of ATP, which releases energy when the cell breaks it down (see Fig. 2.10). Synthesis of ATP is most efficient in the final stages of aerobic respiration, a process that requires oxygen. The most active cell types have the greatest number of mitochondria, e.g. liver, muscle and spermatozoa.</p>

                            <h3>Ribosomes</h3>
                            <p>These are tiny granules composed of RNA and protein. They synthesise proteins from amino acids, using RNA as the template (see Fig. 17.5). When present in free units or in small clusters in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes make proteins for use within the cell. These include the enzymes required for metabolism. Metabolic pathways consist of a series of steps, each driven by a specific enzyme. Ribosomes are also found on the outer surface of the nuclear envelope and rough endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 3.6 and next section), where they manufacture proteins for export from the cell.</p>

                            <h3>Endoplasmic reticulum</h3>
                            <p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an extensive series of interconnecting membranous canals in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3.6). There are two types: smooth and rough. <strong>Smooth ER</strong> synthesises lipids and steroid hormones, and is also associated with the detoxification of some drugs. Some of the lipids are used to replace and repair the plasma membrane and membranes of organelles. <strong>Rough ER</strong> is studded with ribosomes. These are the site of synthesis of proteins, some of which are 'exported' from cells, i.e. enzymes and hormones that leave the parent cell by exocytosis (Fig. 3.5F) to be used by cells elsewhere.</p>

                            <h3>Golgi apparatus</h3>
                            <p>The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of closely folded flattened membranous sacs (Fig. 3.7). It is present in all cells but is larger in those that synthesise and export proteins. The proteins move from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where they are 'packaged' into membrane-bound vesicles. The vesicles are stored and, when needed, they move to the plasma membrane and fuse with it, expelling the contents from the cell. This process is called exocytosis (Fig. 3.5F).</p>

                            <h3>Lysosomes</h3>
                            <p>Lysosomes are small membranous vesicles pinched off from the Golgi apparatus. They contain a variety of enzymes involved in breaking down fragments of organelles and large molecules (e.g. RNA, DNA, carbohydrates, proteins) inside the cell into smaller particles that are either recycled, or exported from the cell as waste material.</p>
                            <p>Lysosomes in white blood cells contain enzymes that digest foreign material such as microbes.</p>

                            <h3>Cytoskeleton</h3>
                            <p>This consists of an extensive network of tiny protein fibres (Fig. 3.8). The cytoskeleton provides an internal support system for the cell, as well as guiding the movement of materials around the cell interior.</p>

                            These tiny fibres, made of actin, are anchored to the inside of the cell membrane and give the cell support and shape. Actin is also involved in the contractile process in muscle cells (p. 456).</p>

                            <p>Damaged, dead and worn-out cells, depending on their type, can often by replaced by cell division, maintaining tissue integrity and function. The frequency with which cell division occurs varies with different types of tissue (p. 55). Normally, this is carefully regulated to allow effective maintenance and repair of body tissues. At the end of their natural lifespan, ageing cells are programmed to 'self-destruct' and their components are removed by phagocytosis in a process known as <strong>apoptosis</strong> (p. 56).</p>
                            <p>Cells with nuclei have 46 chromosomes and divide by <strong>mitosis</strong>, a process that results in two new, genetically identical daughter cells. The only exception to this is the formation of gametes (sex cells), i.e. ova and spermatozoa, which takes place by <strong>meiosis</strong> (p. 480).</p>
                            <p>The period between two cell divisions is known as the cell cycle. This has two phases that can be seen on light microscopy: mitosis (M phase) and interphase (Fig. 3.10).</p>

                            <h4>Mitosis</h4>
                            <p>Mitosis (Figs 3.11 and 3.12) is a continuous process involving four distinct stages visible by light microscopy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Prophase</strong><br>
                            During this stage the replicated chromatin becomes tightly coiled and easier to see under the microscope. Each of the original 46 chromosomes (called a chromatid at this stage) is paired with its copy in a double chromosome unit. The two chromatids are joined to each other at the centromere (see Fig. 3.11). The mitotic apparatus appears; this consists of two centrioles separated by the mitotic spindle, which is formed from microtubules. The centrioles migrate, one to each end of the cell, and the nuclear envelope disappears.</p>

                            <p><strong>Metaphase</strong><br>
                            The chromatids align on the centre of the spindle, attached by their centromeres.</p>

                            <p><strong>Anaphase</strong><br>
                            The centromeres separate, and one of each pair of sister chromatids (now called chromosomes again) migrates to each end of the spindle as the microtubules that form the mitotic spindle shorten.</p>

                            <p><strong>Telophase</strong><br>
                            The mitotic spindle disappears, the chromosomes uncoil and the nuclear envelope reforms.</p>
                            <p>Following telophase, <strong>cytokinesis</strong> occurs: the cytosol, intracellular organelles and plasma membrane split, forming two identical daughter cells.</p>

                            <h4>Simple epithelium</h4>
                            <p>Simple epithelium consists of a single layer of identical cells and is divided into three main types. It is usually found on absorptive or secretory surfaces, where the single layer enhances these processes, and seldom on surfaces subject to stress. The types are named according to the shape of the cells, which differs according to their functions. The more active the tissue, the taller the cells.</p>

                            <p><strong>Squamous (pavement) epithelium</strong><br>
                            This is composed of a single layer of flattened cells (Fig. 3.13A). The cells fit closely together like paving stones, forming a thin and very smooth membrane across which diffusion occurs easily. It forms the lining of the following structures:</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>Cuboidal epithelium</strong><br>
                            This consists of cube-shaped cells fitting closely together and lying on a basement membrane (Fig. 3.13B). It forms the walls of kidney tubules and is found in some glands such as the thyroid (see Fig. 9.8). Cuboidal epithelium is actively involved in secretion, absorption and/or excretion.</p>

                            <p><strong>Columnar epithelium</strong><br>
                            This is formed by a single layer of tall, thin cells on a basement membrane (Fig. 3.13C). It lines many organs and often has adaptations that make it well suited to a specific function. The lining of the stomach is formed from simple columnar epithelium without surface structures. The free surface of the columnar epithelium lining the small intestine is covered with microvilli (see Fig. 3.9). Microvilli provide a very large surface area for absorption of nutrients from the small intestine. In the trachea, columnar epithelium is ciliated (see Fig. 10.12) and also contains goblet cells that secrete mucus. This means that inhaled particles that stick to the mucus layer are moved towards the throat by cilia in the respiratory tract. In the uterine tubes, ova are propelled along towards the uterus by ciliary action.</p>

                            <h4>Stratified epithelium</h4>
                            <p>Stratified epithelium consists of several layers of cells of various shapes. Continual cell division in the lower (basal) layers pushes cells above nearer and nearer to the surface, where they are shed. Basement membranes are usually absent. The main function of stratified epithelium is to protect underlying structures from mechanical wear and tear. There are two main types: stratified squamous and transitional.</p>

                            <p><strong>Stratified squamous epithelium</strong><br>
                            Stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 3.14) is composed of several layers of cells. In the deepest layers the cells are mainly columnar and, as they grow towards the surface, they become flattened and are then shed.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>Keratinised stratified epithelium.</em> This is found on dry surfaces subjected to wear and tear, i.e. skin, hair and nails. The surface layer consists of dead epithelial cells that have lost their nuclei and contain the protein keratin. This forms a tough, relatively waterproof protective layer that prevents drying of the live cells underneath. The surface layer of skin is rubbed off and is replaced from below (see Figs 1.12 and 14.5).</p>
                            
                            <p><em>Non-keratinised stratified epithelium.</em> This protects moist surfaces subjected to wear and tear, and prevents them from drying out, e.g. the conjunctiva of the eyes, the lining of the mouth, the pharynx, the oesophagus and the vagina (Fig. 3.15).</p>

                            Transitional epithelium (Fig. 3.16) is composed of several layers of pear-shaped cells. It lines several parts of the urinary tract, including the bladder, and allows for stretching as the bladder fills.</p>

                            <h3>Connective tissue</h3>
                            <p>Connective tissue is the most abundant tissue in the body. The cells in this tissue are more widely separated from each other than in epithelial tissues, and intercellular substance (matrix) is present in considerably larger amounts. There are usually fibres present in the matrix, which may be of a semisolid jelly-like consistency or dense and rigid, depending on the position and function of the tissue. The fibres form a supporting network to which the cells attach.</p>
                            <p>Most types of connective tissue have a good blood supply. Major functions of connective tissue are:</p>

                            <h4>Cells in connective tissue</h4>
                            <p>Connective tissue, excluding blood (Ch. 4), is found in all organs, where it supports the specialised tissue. The range of cell types involved includes fibroblasts, fat cells, macrophages, leukocytes and mast cells.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fibroblasts</strong><br>
                            Fibroblasts are large cells with irregular processes (see Fig. 3.8). They manufacture collagen and elastic fibres, and a matrix of extracellular material. Collagen fibres are shown in Fig. 3.17. Very fine collagen fibres, sometimes called reticulin fibres, are found in highly active tissue, such as the liver and reticular tissue. Fibroblasts are particularly active in tissue repair (wound healing), when they may bind together the cut surfaces of wounds or form granulation tissue following tissue destruction (p. 399). The collagen fibres formed during wound healing shrink as they age, sometimes interfering with the functions of the organ involved and with adjacent structures.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fat cells</strong><br>
                            Also known as adipocytes, these cells occur singly or in groups in many types of connective tissue and are especially abundant in adipose tissue (see Fig. 3.20B). They vary in size and shape according to the amount of fat they contain.</p>

                            <p><strong>Macrophages</strong><br>
                            These are large irregular-shaped cells with granules in the cytoplasm. Some are fixed, i.e. attached to connective tissue fibres, and others are motile. They are an important part of the body's defence mechanisms because they are actively phagocytic, engulfing and digesting cell debris, bacteria and other foreign bodies. Their activities are typical of those of the monocyte-macrophage defence system, e.g. monocytes in blood, hepatic macrophages (Kupffer cells) in liver sinusoids, sinus-lining cells in lymph nodes and spleen, and microglial cells in the brain (see Fig. 4.13).</p>

                            <p><strong>Leukocytes</strong><br>
                            White blood cells (p. 68) are normally found in small numbers in healthy connective tissue but neutrophils migrate in significant numbers during infection, when they play an important part in tissue defence. Plasma cells develop from B-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell (p. 70). They synthesise and secrete specific defensive antibodies into the blood and tissues (Ch. 15).</p>

                            <p><strong>Mast cells</strong><br>
                            These are similar to basophil leukocytes (p. 69). They are found in loose connective tissue, under the fibrous capsule of some organs, e.g. liver and spleen, and in considerable numbers round blood vessels. Their cytoplasm is packed with granules containing heparin, histamine and other substances, which are released following tissue damage (Fig. 3.18). Release of the granular contents is called degranulation. Histamine is involved in local and general inflammatory reactions; it stimulates secretion of gastric juice and is associated with the development of allergies and hypersensitivity states (p. 417). Heparin prevents coagulation of blood, which helps to maintain blood flow through inflamed tissues, supplying cells with oxygen and glucose and bringing additional protective leukocytes to the area.</p>

The matrix is semisolid with many fibroblasts and some fat cells (adipocytes), mast cells and macrophages, widely separated by elastic and collagen fibres (Fig. 3.19).

                            <h4>Adipose tissue</h4>
                            <p>Adipose tissue consists of fat cells (adipocytes), containing large fat globules, in a matrix of areolar tissue (Fig. 3.20). There are two types: white and brown.</p>

                            <p><em>White adipose tissue.</em> This makes up 20-25% of body weight in adults with a normal body mass index (Ch. 11); more is present in obese people and less in those who are underweight. Adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin (Table 9.4). The kidneys and eyeballs are supported by adipose tissue, which is also found between muscle fibres and under the skin, where it acts as a thermal insulator and energy store.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>Brown adipose tissue.</em> This has more mitochondria and a more extensive capillary network than white adipose tissue, and is more metabolically active. When it is broken down, it generates more heat than adipose tissue does and is important in keeping the newborn infant warm. In adults, brown fat is found in small amounts in the upper chest and neck areas.</p>

                            <p><strong>Elastic tissue</strong><br>
                            Elastic tissue (Fig. 3.22B) is capable of considerable extension and recoil. There are few cells and the matrix consists mainly of masses of elastic fibres secreted by fibroblasts. It is found in organs where stretching or alteration of shape is required, e.g. in large blood vessel walls, the trachea and bronchi, and the lungs.</p>

                            This fluid connective tissue is described in detail in Chapter 4.</p>

                            <h4>Cartilage</h4>
                            <p>Cartilage is firmer than other connective tissues. The cells (chondrocytes) are sparse and lie embedded in matrix, reinforced by collagen and elastic fibres. There are three types: hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage and elastic fibrocartilage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Hyaline cartilage</strong><br>
                            The chondrocytes in this tissue are arranged in small groups within cell nests and the bluish-white matrix is solid and smooth (Fig. 3.23A). Hyaline cartilage provides flexibility, support and smooth surfaces for movement at joints. It is found:</p>

                            This flexible tissue consists of yellow elastic fibres lying in a solid matrix with chondrocytes lying between the fibres (Fig. 3.23C).

                            <p>Bone cells (osteocytes) are surrounded by a matrix of collagen fibres strengthened by inorganic salts, especially calcium and phosphate. This provides bones with their characteristic strength and rigidity. Bone also has considerable capacity for growth in the first two decades of life, and for regeneration throughout life.

                            <h3>Muscle tissue</h3>
                            <p>This tissue is able to contract and relax, providing movement within the body and of the body itself. Muscle contraction requires a rich blood supply providing sufficient oxygen, calcium and nutrients and removing waste products. There are three types of specialised contractile cells, also known as fibres: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle.</p>

                            <p><strong>Skeletal muscle</strong><br>
                            This type is described as skeletal because it forms those muscles that move the bones (of the skeleton), striated because striations (stripes) can be seen on microscopic examination (Fig. 3.24) and voluntary as it is under conscious control. Although most skeletal muscle moves bones, the diaphragm is made from this type of muscle to accommodate a degree of voluntary control in breathing. In reality, many movements can be finely coordinated, e.g. writing, but may also be controlled subconsciously. For example, maintaining an upright posture does not normally require thought unless a new locomotor skill is being learned, e.g. skating or cycling, and the diaphragm maintains breathing during sleep.</p>
                            
                            <p>These fibres (cells) are cylindrical, contain multiple nuclei and can be up to 35 cm long. Skeletal muscle contraction is stimulated by motor nerve impulses originating in the brain or spinal cord and ending at the neuromuscular junction (p. 456). The properties and functions of skeletal muscle are explained in detail in Chapter 16.</p>

                            <p><strong>Smooth muscle</strong><br>
                            Smooth muscle (Fig. 3.25) is described as non-striated, visceral or involuntary, as it does not have striations and is not under conscious control. Some smooth muscle has the intrinsic ability to initiate its own contractions (automaticity), e.g. peristalsis (p. 315). It is innervated by the autonomic nervous system (p. 186). Additionally, autonomic nerve impulses, some hormones and local metabolites regulate its contraction. Smooth muscle is rich in mitochondria that fuel slow and sustained activity. It fatigues much more slowly than skeletal muscle. Smooth muscle cells are usually organised in sheets in the walls of hollow organs, so that contraction and relaxation determine pressure within the organ, for example:</p>

                            <p><strong>Cardiac muscle</strong><br>
                            This is found only in the heart wall. It is not under conscious control but, when viewed under a microscope, cross-stripes (striations) characteristic of skeletal muscle can be seen. Each fibre (cell) has one nucleus and one or more branches (Fig. 3.26). The ends of the cells and their branches are in very close contact with the ends and branches of adjacent cells. Microscopically, these 'joints', or intercalated discs, are thicker, darker lines than the striations. This arrangement gives cardiac muscle the appearance of a sheet of muscle rather than a very large number of individual fibres. This is significant when the heart contracts, as a wave of contraction spreads from cell to cell across the intercalated discs, which means that the cardiac muscle fibres do not need to be stimulated individually.</p>

                            <p>The heart has an intrinsic pacemaker system, which means that it beats in a coordinated manner without external nerve stimulation, although the rate at which it beats is influenced by autonomic nerve impulses, some hormones, local metabolites and other substances (Ch. 5).</p>

                            <p>Two types of tissue are found in the nervous system:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Excitable cells</strong> - these are called neurones and they initiate, receive, conduct and transmit information.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Non-excitable cells</strong> - these are also known as glial cells and they support the neurones.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Both types are described in detail in Chapter 7.</p>

                            <h3>Tissue regeneration</h3>
                            <p>The extent to which regeneration is possible, following tissue damage, depends on the normal rate of turnover of particular types of cell. Those with a rapid turnover regenerate most effectively. There are three general categories:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Tissues in which cell replication is a continuous process regenerate quickly; these include epithelial cells of, for example, the skin, mucous membrane, secretory glands, uterine lining and reticular tissue.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Other tissues retain the ability to replicate but do so infrequently; these include the liver, kidney, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. These tissues take longer to regenerate.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Some cells are normally unable to replicate; these include nerve cells (neurones) and skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, meaning that damaged tissue cannot be replaced.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Extensively damaged tissue is usually replaced by fibrous tissue, meaning that the functions of the original tissue are lost and the function of the organ as a whole is often impaired.</p>

                            <h3>Membranes</h3>
                            <h4>Epithelial membranes</h4>
                            <p>These membranes are sheets of epithelial tissue and supporting connective tissue that cover or line many internal structures or cavities. The main ones are mucous membrane, serous membrane and the skin (cutaneous membrane; Ch. 14).</p>

                            <p><strong>Mucous membrane</strong><br>
                            This is the moist lining of the alimentary, respiratory and genitourinary tracts and is sometimes referred to as the mucosa. The membrane surface consists of epithelial cells, some of which produce a secretion called mucus, a slimy, tenacious fluid that is discharged on to the epithelial surface. As the cells fill up with mucus they have the appearance of a goblet or flask and are known as goblet cells (see Fig. 12.5). Organs lined by mucous membrane have a moist slippery surface. Mucus protects the lining membrane from drying, and from mechanical and chemical injury. In the respiratory tract it traps inhaled particles, preventing them from entering the alveoli of the lungs.</p>

                            <p><strong>Serous membrane</strong><br>
                            Serous membranes, or serosa, secrete serous watery fluid. They consist of a double layer of loose areolar connective tissue lined by simple squamous epithelium. The parietal layer lines a cavity and the visceral layer surrounds organs (the viscera) within the cavity. The two layers are separated by serous fluid secreted by the epithelium. There are three sites where serous membranes are found:</p>

                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>

                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">the peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity and surrounding abdominal organs (p. 314).</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The serous fluid between the visceral and parietal layers enables an organ to glide freely within the cavity without being damaged by friction between it and adjacent organs. For example, the heart changes its shape and size during each beat, and friction damage is prevented by the arrangement of pericardium and its serous fluid.</p>

                            <h4>Synovial membrane</h4>
                            <p>This membrane lines the cavities of moveable joints and surrounds tendons that could be injured by rubbing against bones, e.g. over the wrist joint. It is not an epithelial membrane but instead consists of areolar connective tissue and elastic fibres.</p>
                            <p>Synovial membrane secretes clear, sticky, oily synovial fluid, which lubricates and nourishes the joints (Ch. 16).</p>

                            <h3>Glands</h3>
                            <p>Glands are groups of epithelial cells that produce specialised secretions. Those that discharge their secretion on to the epithelial surface of hollow organs, either directly or through a duct, are called <strong>exocrine glands</strong> and these vary considerably in size, shape and complexity, as shown in Fig. 3.27. Their secretions include mucus, saliva, digestive juices and earwax. Fig. 3.28 shows simple tubular glands of the large intestine.</p>
                            <p>Other glands discharge their secretions into blood and lymph. These are called <strong>endocrine glands</strong> (ductless glands) and they secrete hormones (Ch. 9).</p>

                            <p>The earlier part of this chapter explored characteristics typical of normal cells and tissues, but these may be affected by physiological and/or pathological changes.</p>
                            <p>Cells may enlarge, in a process known as <strong>hypertrophy</strong> (Fig. 3.29), in response to additional demands; for example, skeletal muscle cells hypertrophy in response to fitness training, increasing the bulk and tone of the exercised muscle. A decrease in the size or the number of cells is referred to as <strong>atrophy</strong>. Without use, muscle fibres atrophy (and muscle mass also decreases), e.g. those of a limb in a plaster cast applied to immobilise a fracture. Impaired nutrient or oxygen supply can also lead to atrophy.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hyperplasia</strong> (Fig. 3.29) occurs when cells divide more quickly than previously, increasing cell numbers (and size of the tissue/organ), e.g. the glandular milk-producing tissue of the breasts during pregnancy and breast feeding. Abnormal hyperplasia can lead to the development of tumours when mitosis is no longer controlled and the daughter cells may show abnormal internal characteristics (see cell differentiation, p. 58).</p>

                            <h3>Cell death</h3>
                            <p>Two different mechanisms are recognised: apoptosis and necrosis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Apoptosis</strong><br>
                            This is normal, genetically programmed cell death, in which an ageing cell at the end of its life cycle shrinks and its remaining fragments are phagocytosed without any inflammatory reaction. In later life, fewer cells lost by apoptosis are replaced, contributing to the general reduction in tissue mass and organ size in older adults.</p>

                            <p><strong>Necrosis</strong><br>
                            This is cell death resulting from lack of oxygen (ischaemia), injury or a pathological process. The plasma membrane ruptures, releasing the intracellular contents and triggering the inflammatory response. Inflammation is the first stage of tissue repair and is needed to clear the area of cell debris before healing and tissue repair can progress (Ch. 14).</p>

                            <p>A tumour or neoplasm (literally meaning 'new growth') is a mass of tissue that grows faster than normal in an uncoordinated manner, and continues to grow after the initial stimulus has ceased.</p>
                            <p>Tumours are classified as benign or malignant, although a clear distinction is not always possible (Table 3.1). Benign tumours only rarely change their character and become malignant. Whether malignant or benign, tumours may be classified according to their tissue of origin, e.g. adeno- (glandular) or sarco- (connective tissue); the latter may be further distinguished, e.g. myo- (muscle) or osteo- (bone). Malignant tumours are further classified according to their origins; for example, a carcinoma, the most common form of malignancy, originates from epithelial tissue and a sarcoma arises from connective tissue. Hence, an adenoma is a benign tumour of glandular tissue but an adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumour of the epithelial component of glands; a benign bone tumour is an osteoma, whereas a malignant bone tumour is an osteosarcoma.</p>

                            <h3>Causes of neoplasms</h3>
                            <p>There are more than 200 different types of cancer but all are caused by mutations within the cell's genetic material. Some mutations are spontaneous, i.e. happen by chance during cell division; others are related to exposure to a mutagenic agent (a carcinogen) and a small proportion are inherited. Advancing knowledge in the area has led to identification of many specific genes/chromosome mutations associated directly with particular cancers. Cell growth is regulated by genes that inhibit cell growth (tumour suppressor genes) and genes that stimulate cell growth (proto-oncogenes). One important tumour suppressor gene, p53, is thought to be defective in 50-60% of cancers. A proto-oncogene that becomes abnormally activated and allows uncontrolled cell growth can also cause cancers and is then referred to as an oncogene.</p>

                            <p><strong>Carcinogens</strong><br>
                            These cause malignant changes in cells by irreversibly damaging their DNA. It is impossible to specify a maximum 'safe dose' of a carcinogen. A small dose may initiate change but this may not be enough to cause malignancy unless there are repeated doses over time that have a cumulative effect. In addition, there are widely varying latent periods between exposure and signs of malignancy.</p>

These labile tissues include skin, mucous membrane, bone marrow, reticular tissue, and gametes in the ovaries and testes. For example, repeated episodes of sunburn (caused by exposure to ultraviolet rays in sunlight) predispose to development of skin cancer (see malignant melanoma, p. 405).</span>

                            <p><strong>Host factors</strong><br>
                            Individual characteristics can influence susceptibility to tumours. Some are beyond individual control, e.g. race, increasing age and inherited (genetic) factors. Others can be modified and are referred to as lifestyle factors; these include diet, smoking habits, exercise levels and body weight. Making healthy lifestyle choices where possible is important, as these factors are thought to be involved in the development of nearly half of all malignant tumours. Tumours of specific tissues and organs are described in later chapters.</p>

                            <h3>Growth of tumours</h3>
                            <p>Normally, cells divide in an orderly manner. Neoplastic cells have escaped from the normal controls and multiply in a disorderly and uncontrolled manner, forming a tumour. Blood vessels grow with the proliferating cells, providing them with a good supply of oxygen and nutrients that promotes their growth. In some malignant tumours the blood supply does not keep pace with growth causing ischaemia (lack of oxygen) that leads to tumour cell death. If the tumour is near the body surface, this may result in skin ulceration and infection. In deeper tissues there is fibrosis; for example, retraction of the nipple in breast cancer is due to the shrinkage of fibrous tissue in a necrotic tumour.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cell differentiation</strong><br>
                            Differentiation into specialised cell types with particular structural and functional characteristics occurs at an early stage in fetal development; for example, epithelial cells develop different characteristics from lymphocytes. Later, when cell replacement occurs, daughter cells have the same appearance, functions and genetic make-up as the parent cell. In benign tumours the cells from which they originate are easily recognised, i.e. tumour cells are well differentiated. Tumours with well-differentiated cells are usually benign but some may be malignant. Malignant tumours grow beyond their normal boundaries and show varying levels of differentiation:</p>

                            <p><strong>Encapsulation and spread of tumours</strong><br>
                            Most benign tumours are contained within a fibrous capsule derived partly from the surrounding tissues and partly from the tumour. They neither invade local tissues nor spread to other parts of the body, even when they are not encapsulated.</p>
                            <p>Malignant tumours are not encapsulated. They spread locally by growing into and infiltrating nearby tissue (known as invasion). Tumour fragments may spread to other parts of the body in blood or lymph. Some of the spreading tumour cells may be recognised as 'non-self' and phagocytosed by macrophages or destroyed by defence cells of the immune system, e.g. cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells (Ch. 15). Others may escape detection and lodge in tissues away from the primary site, growing into secondary tumours (metastases). Metastases are often multiple. Table 3.2 shows common sites of primary tumours and their metastases.</p>

                            <p>The likely prognosis may by determined using staging, a process that assesses the size and spread of the tumour. A commonly used example is the TMN system, where T is tumour size, N indicates affected regional lymph nodes and M identifies metastatic sites. For most tumours, large size and extensive spread suggest a poorer prognosis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Local spread</strong><br>
                            Benign tumours enlarge and may cause pressure damage to local structures but they do not spread to other parts of the body.</p>
                            <p>Benign or malignant tumours may:</p>

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Additionally, malignant tumours invade surrounding tissues and may also erode blood and lymph vessel walls, causing spread of tumour cells to distant parts of the body.</p>

                            <p><strong>Body cavity spread</strong><br>
                            This occurs when a tumour penetrates the wall of a cavity. The peritoneal cavity is most frequently involved. If, for example, a malignant tumour in an abdominal organ invades the visceral peritoneum, tumour cells may metastasise to folds of peritoneum or any abdominal or pelvic organ.</p>
                            <p>Where there is less scope for the movement of fragments within a cavity, the tumour tends to bind layers of tissue together; for example, a pleural tumour binds the visceral and parietal layers together, limiting expansion of the lung.</p>

                            <p><strong>Lymphatic spread</strong><br>
                            This occurs when malignant tumours invade nearby lymph vessels. Groups of tumour cells break off and are carried to lymph nodes, where they lodge and may grow into secondary tumours. There may be further spread through the lymphatic system and to blood because lymph drains into the subclavian veins.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood spread</strong><br>
                            This occurs when a malignant tumour erodes the walls of a blood vessel. A thrombus (blood clot) may form at the site and emboli consisting of fragments of tumour and blood clot enter the bloodstream. These emboli block small blood vessels, causing infarcts (areas of dead tissue) and development of metastatic tumours. Phagocytosis of tumour cells in the emboli is unlikely to occur because these are protected by the blood clot. Single tumour cells can also lodge in the capillaries of other body organs. Division and subsequent growth of secondary tumours, or metastases, may then occur. The sites of blood-spread metastases depend on the location of the original tumour and the anatomy of the circulatory system in the area. The most common sites of these metastases are bone, the lungs, the brain and the liver.</p>

                            <h3>Effects of tumours</h3>
                            <p><strong>Pressure effects</strong><br>
                            Both benign and malignant tumours may compress and damage adjacent structures, especially if in a confined space. The effects depend on the site of the tumour but are most marked in areas where there is little space for expansion, e.g. inside the skull, under the periosteum of bones, and in bony sinuses and respiratory passages. Compression of adjacent structures may cause ischaemia, necrosis, blockage of ducts, organ dysfunction or displacement, and pain due to invasion of nerves or pressure on nerves.</p>

                            <p><strong>Hormonal effects</strong><br>
                            Tumours of endocrine glands may secrete hormones, producing the effects of hypersecretion. The extent of cell dysplasia is an important factor. Well-differentiated benign tumours are more likely to secrete hormones than markedly dysplastic malignant tumours. High levels of hormones are found in the bloodstream, as secretion occurs in the absence of the normal stimulus and homeostatic control mechanism. Some malignant tumours produce uncharacteristic hormones; for example, some lung tumours produce insulin. Endocrine glands may be destroyed by invading tumours, causing hormone deficiency.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cachexia</strong><br>
                            This is the severe weight loss accompanied by progressive weakness, loss of appetite, wasting and anaemia that is usually associated with advanced metastatic cancer. The severity is usually indicative of the stage of the disease. The causes are not clear.</p>
