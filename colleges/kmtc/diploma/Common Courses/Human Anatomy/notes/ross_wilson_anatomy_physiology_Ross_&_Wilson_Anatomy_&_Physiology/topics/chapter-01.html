                            <p>The human body is rather like a technical and sophisticated machine. It operates as a single entity, but is made up of a number of systems that work interdependently. Each system is associated with a specific function that is normally essential for the well-being of the individual. Should one system fail, the consequences can extend to others, and may greatly reduce the ability of the body to function normally. Integrated working of the body systems ensures survival. The human body is therefore complex in both structure and function, and this book uses a systems approach to explain the fundamental structures and processes involved.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Anatomy</strong> is the study of the structure of the body and the physical relationships between its constituent parts. <strong>Physiology</strong> is the study of how the body systems work, and the ways in which their integrated activities maintain the life and health of the individual. <strong>Pathology</strong> is the study of abnormalities and pathophysiology considers how they affect body functions, often causing illness.</p>

                            <p>This chapter introduces the body systems and how they are organised. The following section provides an overview of the levels of structural complexity found within body systems; the smallest units of living matter are cells that form the building blocks for the diverse body organs. The human body contains around 30 trillion cells.</p>

                            <p>For survival, many essential processes must be carried out within the body. Some involve communication and transport, others relate to taking in raw materials and getting rid of wastes and yet others ensure the body remains able to protect itself and that the human species survives. These processes are used as headings in the next section to introduce the body systems, which are then explored in depth in later chapters.</p>

                            <p>Use of standardised anatomical terminology enables the physical relationships between structures within the body to be described accurately and communicated consistently. This chapter also explains some of this fundamental terminology, which is then applied to provide an overview of the organisation of the body, focusing on the skeleton and body cavities.</p>

                            <p>Most body systems become less efficient with age. Physiological decline is a normal part of ageing and should not be confused with illness or disease, although some conditions do become more common in older life. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can not only slow the effects of ageing but also protect against illness. The general impact of ageing is outlined in this chapter and its effects on body function are explored in more detail in later chapters.</p>

                            <p>The final section of this chapter provides a framework for studying diseases, an outline of mechanisms that cause disease and some common disease processes. Building on the normal anatomy and physiology, a systems approach is adopted to consider common illnesses at the end of the later chapters.</p>

                            <p>Within the body there are different levels of structural organisation and complexity. The most fundamental of these is chemical. Atoms combine to form molecules, of which there is a vast range in the body. The structures, properties and functions of important biological molecules are considered in Chapter 2.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cells</strong> are the smallest independent units of living matter. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but when magnified using a microscope, different types can be distinguished by their size, shape and the dyes they absorb when stained in the laboratory. Most body cells have become specialised (differentiated), to carry out a particular function that contributes to body needs. Fig. 1.1 shows some highly magnified nerve cells. The specialised function of nerve cells is to transmit electrical signals (nerve impulses); these are integrated and coordinated, allowing the millions of nerve cells in the body to provide a rapid and sophisticated communication system. In complex organisms such as the human body, cells with similar structures and functions are found together, forming <strong>tissues</strong>. The structure and functions of cells and tissues are explored in Chapter 3.</p>

                            <p><strong>Organs</strong> are made up of a number of different types of tissue and have evolved to carry out a specific function. There are around 80 organs, each of which is associated with one or more body systems. Fig. 1.2 shows that the stomach is lined by a layer of epithelial tissue and that its wall contains layers of smooth muscle tissue. Both tissues contribute to the functions of the stomach, but in different ways.</p>

                            <p><strong>Systems</strong> consist of a number of organs and tissues that together contribute to one or more survival needs of the body. For example, the pancreas, stomach and liver are all organs considered to be part of the digestive system. They all contribute to the ingestion, digestion and absorption of nutrients, but individually have very different functions. The body's systems work interdependently and must communicate and coordinate their functions for the body to remain healthy. The structure and functions of the body systems are considered in later chapters.</p>

                            <p>Communication requires transport systems to ensure that all body cells are supplied with the very many substances needed to support them, as well as allowing for waste excretion; this involves the blood and the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems.</p>
                            <p>Communication systems receive, collate and respond to information that may originate either within the body (internally) or from its environment (externally). Internal communication involves mainly the nervous and endocrine systems; these are important in the maintenance of homeostasis (Ch. 2) and regulation of vital body functions. Communication with the external environment involves the special senses, and verbal and non-verbal activities, and all of these also depend on the nervous system.</p>

                            <p>The heart muscle is not under conscious (voluntary) control. At rest the heart contracts, or beats, between 65 and 75 times per minute. The rate is greatly increased when body oxygen requirements are increased, e.g. during exercise.</p>
                            <p>The rate at which the heart beats can be counted by taking the pulse. The pulse can be felt most easily where a superficial artery can be pressed gently against a bone, usually at the wrist.</p>

                            <p>The lymphatic system (Ch. 6; Fig. 1.6) consists of a series of lymph vessels, which begin as blind-ended tubes in the tissue spaces between the blood capillaries and tissue cells.</p>

                            <p>Structurally, they are similar to veins and blood capillaries but the pores in the walls of the lymph capillaries are larger than those of the blood capillaries. Lymph is tissue fluid that also contains material drained from tissue spaces, including plasma proteins and, sometimes, bacteria or cell debris. It is transported along lymph vessels and returned to the bloodstream near the heart.</p>
                            <p>There are collections of lymph nodes situated at various points along the length of the lymph vessels. Lymph is filtered as it passes through these nodes, removing microbes and other materials. Other lymphatic organs include the spleen and the thymus.</p>
                            <p>The lymphatic system also provides the sites for formation and maturation of lymphocytes, the white blood cells involved in immunity (Ch. 15).</p>
