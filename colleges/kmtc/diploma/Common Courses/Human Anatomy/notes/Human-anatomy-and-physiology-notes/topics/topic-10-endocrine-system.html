                            <p><strong>(a) Group I hormones:</strong> These hormones bind to intracellular receptors to form hormone-receptor complexes (HRC), through which their biochemical functions are mediated. These hormones are lipophilic in nature and are derivatives of cholesterol (except $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ). They are found in circulation in association with transport proteins and possess relatively longer half-lives (hours or day). e.g. Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone, $\mathrm{T}_{3}, \mathrm{~T}_{4}$ etc.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>(b) Group II hormones:</strong> These hormones bind to cell surface (plasma membrane) receptors and stimulate the release of certain molecules, namely the second messengers which in turn, perform the biochemical functions. Thus, hormones themselves are lipophobic in nature, usually transported in the free form and possess short half-lives (in minutes).</p>
                            
                            <p>Group II hormones are subdivided into three categories on the basis of chemical nature of second messengers:</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">MECHANISM OF HORMONE ACTION</h2>
                        
                        <p>The mechanism of hormone action is grouped into two classes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fixed membrane receptor mechanism</li>
                            <li>Mobile receptor mechanism</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Fixed Membrane Receptor Mechanism</h4>
                            <p>This type of mechanism is shown by the water-soluble hormones that are amines or proteins in composition such as the growth hormone, oxytocin, ADH, etc.</p>
                            <p>These hormones can't pass through the lipid membrane. They have their target receptor on the cell membrane to which the hormone binds.</p>
                            <p>When the hormone binds on the specific target receptor, the enzyme adenyl cyclase in the cell membrane is activated. This helps in the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP acts as the secondary messenger. It diffuses through the cell membrane and activates several enzymatic reactions to cause biochemical changes.</p>
                            <p>The target cell responds to these changes and cAMP is deactivated by the enzyme phosphodiesterase.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Mobile Receptor Mechanism</h4>
                            <p>This type of mechanism is shown by lipid soluble hormones such as fatty acids and steroids that can easily pass through the plasma membrane.</p>
                            <p>They possess intracellular receptors. The hormones bind to the target receptor that activates the enzymatic activity of the cell to bring about biochemical changes.</p>
                            <p>Transcription of DNA is initiated by the hormone-receptor complex. The mRNA is translated into protein. This protein causes biochemical changes inside the cell.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Hormones as Regulators</h3>
                        <p>Hormones help in maintaining the internal environment of the body. When the secretion of hormones is under the control of other hormones, it is known as feedback control. It can be of two types:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Positive Feedback Control:</strong> In this process, the end products of action cause more of the action to occur in a feedback loop. For eg., blood clotting, menstrual cycle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Negative Feedback Control:</strong> In this type of regulation the end product of a process reduces the stimulus of that same process. For eg., temperature regulation, regulation of blood sugar.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Hormones as Messengers</h3>
                        <p>The neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus secrete hormones known as neurohormones into the blood. These neurohormones are carried to the pituitary gland and stimulate it to release various hormones. hence they are also known as "releasing factors".</p>

It is often referred to as the 'Master Gland' because it produces some of the important hormones in the body. It is situated in a bony structure called the Pituitary fossa, just below the hypothalamus, close to the optic nerve. The pituitary gland is divided into three parts, also called lobes:</p>

                        <h3>Pituitary disorders</h3>
                        <p>Pituitary disorders affect the functioning of the pituitary gland, increasing or decreasing the level of certain hormone secretion. This generally happens because of a non-cancerous tumor called the pituitary adenoma.</p>
                        <p>A Pituitary macro adenoma (tumor larger than 10 mm ) can also cause the impairment of blood supply into the gland. It can either cause overflow or stop the flow of blood completely into the gland. This is called pituitary apoplexy.</p>

                        <p>The thyroid gland is an endocrine organ found in the neck, it is responsible for regulating the body's metabolic rate via hormones it produces. In this article, we will be looking at its anatomy, its cellular structure, its endocrine physiology and its clinical relevance.</p>

                        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                        <p>The thyroid gland is a ductless alveolar gland found in the anterior neck, just below the laryngeal prominence (Adam's apple). It is roughly butterfly-shaped, with two lobes wrapping around the trachea and connected in the middle by an isthmus. The thyroid gland is not usually palpable.</p>
                        <p>It is supplied by superior and inferior thyroid arteries, drained via superior, middle and inferior thyroid veins and has a rich lymphatic system.</p>

                        <h3>Cellular Structure</h3>
                        <p>The function of the Thyroid gland is to produce and store thyroid hormones. Thyroid epithelia form follicles filled with colloid - a protein-rich reservoir of the materials needed for thyroid hormone production. These follicles range in size from $0.02-0.3 \mathrm{~mm}$ and the epithelium may be simple cuboidal or simple columnar.</p>
                        <p>In the spaces between the follicles, parafollicular cells can be found. These cells secrete calcitonin, which is involved in the regulation of calcium metabolism in the body.</p>

                        <h3>Function</h3>
                        <p>The thyroid gland is one of the main regulators of metabolism. T3 and T4 typically act via nuclear receptors in target tissues and initiate a variety of metabolic pathways. High levels of them typically cause these processes to occur faster or more frequently. Metabolic processes increased by thyroid hormones include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Basal Metabolic Rate</div></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This is achieved in a number of ways, such as increasing the size and number of mitochondria within cells, increasing $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump activity and increasing the presence of $\beta$ adrenergic receptors in tissues such as cardiac muscle.</p>

                        <h3>Thyroid Hormone Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>There are six steps in the synthesis of thyroid hormone, and you can remember them using the mnemonic ATE ICE:</p>
                        
                        <div class="callout callout--tip">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Mnemonic: ATE ICE</h4>
                            <div class="callout-content">
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>A</strong>ctive transport of Iodide into the follicular cell via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS). This is actually secondary active transport, and the sodium gradient driving it is maintained by a Sodium-Potassium ATPase.</li>
                                    <li><strong>T</strong>hyroglobulin (Tg), a large protein rich in Tyrosine, is formed in follicular ribosomes and placed into secretory vesicles.</li>
                                    <li><strong>E</strong>xocytosis of Thyroglobulin into the follicle lumen, where it is stored as colloid. Thyroglobulin is the scaffold upon which thyroid hormone is synthesised.</li>
                                    <li><strong>I</strong>odination of the Thyroglobulin. Iodide is made reactive by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase. Iodide binds to the benzene ring on Tyrosine residues of Thyroglobulin, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) then diiodotyrosine (DIT).</li>
                                    <li><strong>C</strong>oupling of MIT and DIT gives the Triiodothyronine (T3) hormone and coupling of DIT and DIT gives the Tetraiodothyronine (T4) hormone, also known as Thyroxine.</li>
                                    <li><strong>E</strong>ndocytosis of iodinated thyroglobulin back into the follicular cell. Thyroglobulin undergoes proteolysis in lysosomes to cleave the iodinated tyrosine residues from the larger protein. Free T3 or T4 is then released, and the Thyroglobulin scaffold is recycled.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>T3 and T4 are the active thyroid hormones. They are fat soluble and mostly carried by plasma proteins - Thyronine Binding Globulin and Albumin. While T3 is the more potent form, it also has a shorter half-life due to its lower affinity for the binding proteins. Less than $1\%$ of T3 and T4 is unbound free hormone. At the peripheries, T4 is deiodinated to the more active T3.</p>
                        <p>T3 and T4 are deactivated by removing iodine. This happens in the liver and kidney. As T4 has a longer half-life, it is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism over T3 as its plasma concentrations are easier to manage.</p>

                        <h3>Thyroid Hormone Release</h3>
                        <p>Thyroid hormones are released as part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. The Hypothalamus detects a low plasma concentration of thyroid hormone and releases Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) into the hypophyseal portal system.</p>
                        <p>TRH binds to receptors found on thyrotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary gland, causing them to release Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) into the systemic circulation. TSH binds to TSH receptors on the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells and induces the synthesis and release of thyroid hormone</p>

                        <h3>Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and Hyperthyroidism</h3>
                        <p>Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, leading to a variety of severe disorders. When $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 3).</p>
                        
                        <p>In areas of the world with access to iodized salt, dietary deficiency is rare. Instead, inflammation of the thyroid gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones. Called hypothyroidism, the condition is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual irregularities, and reduced mental activity. In contrast, hyperthyroidism-an abnormally elevated blood level of thyroid hormones-is often caused by a pituitary or thyroid tumor. In Graves' disease, the hyperthyroid state results from an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies overstimulate the follicle cells of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can lead to an increased metabolic rate, excessive body heat and sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, tremors, and increased heart rate. The person's eyes may bulge (called exophthalmos) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues of the orbits. The person may also develop a goiter.</p>

                        <p>The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands located in the anterior neck. They are responsible for the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH).</p>

                        <h3>Anatomical location</h3>
                        <p>The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior, medial aspect of each lobe of the thyroid gland. Anatomically, the glands can be divided into two pairs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Superior parathyroid glands</strong> - Derived embryologically from the fourth pharyngeal pouch. They are usually located at the level of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inferior parathyroid glands</strong> - Derived embryologically from the third pharyngeal pouch. They are usually located near the inferior poles of the thyroid gland. However in 1-5% of people they can be found deep in the superior mediastinum.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <figure class="content-figure" data-lightbox="true">
                            <div class="figure-image-wrapper">

                        <h3>Parathyroid Gland Histology</h3>
                        <p>There are two types of cells within the parathyroid gland, the chief cells and the oxyphil cells.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chief cells</strong>- The role of this cell type is to secrete parathyroid hormone. They contain prominent Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum to allow for the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone. The chief cells are the smaller of the two cell types, however they are more abundant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oxyphil cells</strong>-These cells are much larger but less abundant than chief cells. Their purpose is unknown. It is interesting to note however that the number of oxyphil cells increases with age and few are seen before puberty.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that histologically fat cells (adipose cells) are also seen within the parathyroid gland.</p>

                        <h3>Parathyroid Hormone Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>The synthesis of PTH begins within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where pre-pro-PTH is produced. Pre-pro-PTH is 115 amino acids long and consists of a biologically active sequence, a C terminal fragment sequence, a pro sequence and a signal sequence.</p>
                        <p>The signal sequence is cleaved within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving proPTH. After transfer to the Golgi apparatus the pro sequence is also cleaved, resulting in the production of mature PTH, which can then be stored in secretory granules for release.</p>

                        <h3>Parathyroid Hormone Actions</h3>
                        <p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has three main actions, all of which act to increase calcium levels in the body;</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Increased bone resorption</strong>- PTH acts directly on bone to increase bone resorption. It induces cytokine secretion from osteoblasts that act on osteoclast cells to increase their activity. Osteoclasts are responsible for the breakdown of bone and thus an increase in their activity leads to increased bone break down. This leads to an increase in calcium in the extracellular fluid.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Increased reabsorption in the kidney</strong>- PTH increases the amount of calcium absorbed from the Loop of Henle and distal tubules, however the mechanism is not fully understood. Additionally, PTH increases the rate of phosphate excretion which is very important to prevent to formation of calcium phosphate kidney stones.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Vitamin D synthesis</strong>- Although PTH does not actively increase the absorption of calcium from the gut it stimulates the formation of vitamin D , which subsequently increases absorption from the gut.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Parathyroid Hormone Regulation</h3>
                        <p>Like most endocrine organs, the parathyroid gland is controlled by a negative feedback loop. Chief cells have a unique G-protein calcium receptor (CaR) on their surface, which regulates this.</p>
                        <p>When calcium levels in the blood are elevated, PTH production must be stopped in order to prevent further elevation of calcium which could lead to hypercalcaemia. Calcium binds to the G protein CaR which subsequently leads to the production of a molecule called phosphoinositide. The activation of this molecule prevents PTH secretion thus calcium is deposited back into the bones. Furthermore, as mentioned above, PTH stimulates vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D also acts directly on the parathyroid gland to decrease the transcription of the PTH gene hence less PTH is synthesised.</p>
                        <p>When Calcium is reduced, the reverse occurs. Lowered calcium means reduced stimulation of CaR and decreased phosphoinositide. Subsequently, PTH secretion is not inhibited. Decreased Vitamin D results in upregulation of PTH gene transcription thus more PTH is synthesised.</p>
                        <p>Note: Elevated phosphate lowers free Calcium in the blood and inhibits the formation of Vitamin D.</p>

                        <h3>About Parathyroid Disorders</h3>
                        <p>As a rule, if the calcium level in the blood is low, the parathyroid glands sense this and release PTH. PTH then causes release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream, increases vitamin D production from the kidney which ultimately increases absorption of calcium from the intestines. If the calcium level is too high, then PTH secretion should decrease to a very low level.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hyperparathyroidism</strong> exists when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). This may be due to multiple reasons, and the reason helps determine the appropriate type of treatment. Excess parathyroid hormone can lead to negative effects on the body such as osteoporosis which can lead to fractures, kidney stones, decreased kidney function, heart disease, pancreatitis, increased acid secretion in the stomach and ulcers.</p>
                        <p>The opposite problem, <strong>hypoparathyroidism</strong>, occurs when the parathyroid glands do not produce enough PTH. This leads to a low blood calcium level and can adversely affect muscle, nerve and other functions.</p>

                        <p>The Adrenal Glands are found on top of each kidney. Even the name "Adrenal" directly translates to their location: (Latin: ad- "near" and renes - "kidneys.") These glands are also known as suprarenal glands. (Latin: supra - "above" and renes - "kidneys.")</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>As stated in the introduction, the human body has two adrenal glands, the right gland is pyramidal in shape and the left gland is semilunar in shape.</li>
                            <li>The left adrenal gland is also comparatively larger than the right.</li>
                            <li>The glands are usually about $5 \times 3 \mathrm{~cm}$ in size and their combined weight ranges from 7 to 10 grams. Healthy glands are yellowish in colour.</li>

                        <p>There are three distinct layers of the adrenal glands.</p>
                        <h4>Adrenal Capsule</h4>
                        <p>The capsule is a protective layer of fat that surrounds each adrenal glands. They are not strictly a part of the adrenal glands, but the primary function of this capsule layer is to enclose and protect each of the adrenal glands.</p>

                        <h4>Adrenal Cortex</h4>
                        <p>The adrenal cortex is the outermost layer of the adrenal gland which is devoted to the production of aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens hormones. There are three layers of cortex called zones which can be examined and easily differentiated under a microscope:</p>

                        <p>The last and innermost part of the adrenal gland is the medulla. It contains the Chromaffin cells, which produce the body's main source of catecholamines (such as adrenaline and noradrenaline) and endorphins. These are stored and released in response to stress.</p>

                        <h3>Adrenal Gland Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Adrenal Gland disorders appear when not enough hormones or inadequate hormones are produced by the adrenal glands. Even abnormal growths or tumours can cause certain illness.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cushing's Syndrome</strong> is a condition where the cortisol levels in the body are very high. The cause can be a tumour in the adrenal gland or the pituitary gland.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adrenocortical carcinoma</strong> is a cancerous tumour that usually develops in the outer layer of the adrenal gland. This type of tumour is typically found years after they have spread to other organs in the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)</strong> is a genetic disorder characterized by very low levels of cortisol production. The people inflicted with this condition may also have other hormonal imbalances where their bodies may make very little aldosterone, but too much androgen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addison's Disease</strong> is an autoimmune disease where the body mistakenly attacks the adrenal glands. As a result, the adrenal gland does not produce the hormone aldosterone in sufficient quantities.</li>

                        <p>The pancreas lies inferior to the stomach in a bend of the duodenum. It is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland. A large pancreatic duct runs through the gland, carrying enzymes and other exocrine digestive secretions from the pancreatic acinar cells to the small intestine.</p>
                        <p>The tissue of the pancreas has in addition to the acinar cells, groups of cells called islets of Langerhans, after the name of their discoverer (1869). These produce endocrine secretions.</p>

                        <h3>Four kinds of cells have been identified in the islets:</h3>
                        <p>(i) Alpha cells (about 15%) produce glucagon. Alpha cells are also called A-cells.<br>
                        (ii) Beta cells (about 65%) produce insulin. Beta cells are also called B-cells.<br>
                        (iii) Delta cells or D-cells (about 5%) produce somatostatin (SS), and<br>
                        (iv) Pancreatic Polypeptide cells or PP cells or F-cells (15%), produce pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Beta cells are usually found towards the middle of the islet, the alpha cells towards the periphery of the islet and Delta (D) and F-cells are found scattered.</p>

                        <h3>Hormones of Pancreas and Their Role:</h3>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>(i) Glucagon:</h4>
                            <p>It stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. Glucagon is also called an "antiinsulin" hormone.</p>
                            <p><strong>Target Cells:</strong> Glucagon acts on the cells of the liver and adipose tissue.</p>

                            <h4>(ii) Insulin:</h4>
                            <p>(a) It is antagonistic to glucagon. Insulin converts glucose into glycogen in the liver and muscles.<br>
                            (b) It promotes protein synthesis in tissue from amino acids.<br>
                            (c) Insulin reduces catabolism of proteins. It is an anabolic hormone.<br>
                            (d) It increases the synthesis of fat in the adipose tissue from fatty acids.<br>
                            (e) Insulin reduces the breakdown and oxidation of fat.</p>
                            <p><strong>Target Cells:</strong> Insulin acts on the cells of the liver muscles and adipose tissue. Alloxan and Cobalt chloride are compounds widely used by scientists to study cell physiology of islets of Langerhans. Alloxan is used to destroy the beta cells while cobalt chloride to destroy alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans.</p>

                            <h4>(iii) Somatostatin (SS):</h4>
                            <p>The same substance as growth inhibiting hormone from the hypothalamus, is produced not only by the pancreas and hypothalamus but also by some cells of the digestive tract. One of the actions of somatostatin seems to suppress the release of other hormones from the pancreas. It also appears to suppress the release of hormones from the digestive tract.</p>
                            <p><strong>Target Cells:</strong> Both somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide act on the cells of the pancreas.</p>

                            <h4>(iv) Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP):</h4>
                            <p>It appears that pancreatic polypeptide inhibits the release of digestive secretion of the pancreas. Both somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide are relatively newly discovered hormones of the pancreas, and both are still being studied.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Disorders of Pancreas:</h3>
                        <h4>(i) Diabetes mellitus (Hyperglycemia):</h4>
                        <p>The most common endocrine disorder of the pancreas is the diabetes mellitus, now recognized to exist in two forms - insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent.</p>
                        <p>The insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is caused by a failure of the Beta-cells to produce adequate amount of insulin while the non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) appears to involve failure of insulin to facilitate the movement of glucose into cells.</p>
                        <p>In both disorders the blood glucose concentration is elevated above the normal range. Some of the glucose is excreted in the urine, and water follows the glucose, causing excessive urination and dehydration of body tissues. This causes excessive thirst (polydipsia). The cells are unable to utilize glucose and other carbohydrates for energy production.</p>
                        <p>They utilize their proteins for it. The person becomes very weak. Degradation of fats increases, producing ketone bodies (ketosis). The latter are acidic and poisonous. Blood cholesterol level rises. Healing power is impaired.</p>
                        <p>Administration of insulin lowers the blood-glucose level. It gives relief to the patient. A tendency towards non-insulin-dependent diabetes appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive characteristic.</p>

                        <h4>(ii) Hypoglycemia:</h4>
                        <p>It occurs when the blood glucose level falls below normal. Theoretically, it may be caused by an excess of insulin, a deficiency of glucagon, or a failure of the secretion of the two hormones to completely regulate the blood sugar.</p>
                        <p>Some individuals have been found to have few or no Alpha cells and thus are deficient in glucagon, whereas others produce excess quantities of insulin usually because of a tumour of the beta cells.</p>
                        <p>The presence of excess insulin is more correctly referred to as hyperinsulinism. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include weakness, profuse sweating, irritability, confusion, unconsciousness and convulsions. It needs urgent intake of sugar or glucose.</p>

                        <p>Pineal gland is a pinecone-shaped small gland located in the middle of the human brain in between the two hemispheres in an area called epithalamus. It was once known as "the third eye". It is the major site for melatonin secretion, which regulates the body's internal clock (Circadian rhythm).</p>
                        <p>This gland is rich in calcium levels. The calcium acts as a radiographer to locate the middle of the brain in X-ray images. It was also one of the last glands to discovered.</p>

                        <h3>Anatomy of Pineal Gland</h3>
                        <p>The pineal gland is about 0.3 inches long and weighs 0.1 grams. The adrenergic nerves entering the pineal gland regulate its functions.</p>
                        <p>The pineal gland is composed of pinealocytes and supporting cells that resemble the astrocytes present in the brain.</p>
                        <p>Some lower vertebrates have a well-developed eye-like structure that acts as a light receptor.</p>

                        <h3>Hormones Secreted by Pineal Gland-Melatonin</h3>
                        <p>The pineal gland synthesises melatonin and serotonin, hence they are also called as the Pineal Gland Hormone. The pineal gland also produces neurosteroids.</p>
                        <p>Serotonin is the precursor of melatonin. Serotonin is acetylated and methylated to yield melatonin within the pineal gland. The light exposure to the eyes affects the synthesis and secretion of melatonin.</p>
                        <p>Two melatonin receptors have been found in mammals- MellA and MellB. These are Gprotein coupled cell surface receptors.</p>
                        <p><strong>Melatonin affects circadian rhythm.</strong> Our circadian rhythm is a 24 -hour biological cycle, characterised by the sleep-wake patterns. The daylight and darkness regulate our circadian rhythms. The secretion of melatonin is stopped on exposure to light which in turn controls the circadian rhythm. The secretion of melatonin is high during dark and low during daylight. This influences our reaction to photoperiod.</p>
                        <p>The secretion of gonadotropins from the anterior Pituitary gland is blocked by melatonin thereby affecting reproduction. These hormones aid in the development of ovaries and testes.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Secretion Of Melatonin:</strong> This gland secretes the hormone melatonin which regulates the circadian rhythm of the body and also certain reproductive hormones.

                        <h3>Disorders Of Pineal Gland</h3>
                        <p>Listed below are few disorders caused by the malfunctioning of the pineal gland.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Depression.</li>
                            <li>Mood swings.</li>
                            <li>Peptic or stomach ulcers.</li>
                            <li>Disruption in sleep patterns.</li>
                            <li>An impaired pineal gland leads to hormonal imbalance.</li>
                            <li>Sexual disorders are caused by the dysfunctioning of the pineal gland.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Other disorders include: Low melatonin secretion also leads to anxiety, low thyroid hormone production, menopause symptoms, etc. Over secretion of melatonin can lead to low blood pressure and improper functioning of the thyroid glands and adrenal glands.</p>
                        <p>Seasonal affective disorders of pineal gland include a depressive disorder. This disorder is mainly caused in the winter season when melatonin secretion is high due to the presence of low sunlight.</p>
                        <p>If a tumour develops in the pineal gland, it affects several other factors in the body:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nausea.</li>
                            <li>Seizures.</li>
                            <li>Headache.</li>
                            <li>Memory disruption.</li>
                            <li>Impaired vision and other senses</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The Thymus is an obscure organ located deep within the chest. It may not function throughout human life but is a very important organ while active. Read on to explore more about thymus.</p>
                        <p><strong>What is Thymus?</strong> The thymus gland is a very unique organ that is at its largest in children and shrinks away as the body grows older. It is about 2.5 to 5 cms wide, 4 to 6 cms long and 1 cm thick at birth. At its largest instance, (viz. during puberty) the thymus weighs just under 30 grams. After puberty, the thymus slowly starts to shrink and by the age of 75 , it is nothing more than fatty tissue.</p>
                        <p><strong>Thymus Location:</strong> The thymus gland is located in the anterior part of the chest, right behind the breastbone (or the sternum) and between the lungs. It has a pinkish-grey complexion and is lobed, with primary two lobes and smaller lobes radiating from within. The two lobes may be separated or united and generally vary in size.</p>

                        <h3>Histology of Thymus</h3>
                        <p>There are two general cell lines of interest in the thymus. These are thymic epithelial cells and lymphoid cells. The lymphoid cells migrate into the thymus during the intrauterine angiogenesis. The thymic epithelium is important for the maturation and development of these lymphoid cells.</p>
                        <p>The lymphoid progenitor cells can access the thymus in the 10th week of gestation. A welldifferentiated thymus is observed in the 12th week of gestation.</p>

                        <h3>Thymus Function</h3>
                        <p>One of the most important functions of the thymus is to stimulate the production of very specialized cells called T-cells (also called T-lymphocytes). These cells are responsible for directly fending off foreign pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. They also regulate the immune system, helping to prevent autoimmunity, wherein, the body's immune system elicits immune responses on its own healthy cells.</p>
                        <p>Thymus also secretes thymosin to stimulate the development of T-cells.</p>

                        <h3>Thymus Gland Disorders</h3>
                        <p>The most common disorders caused by the dysfunctioning of thymus gland are- Myasthenia gravis, pure red cell aplasia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Myasthenia gravis is caused due to abnormal enlargement of the thymus. The enlarged thymus produces antibodies that destroy the muscle receptor sites. Thus the muscles become very weak. Pure red aplasia is caused when the patient's own immune cells attack the blood-forming stem cells. This happens when there is a tumour in the thymus. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurs when the body does not produce enough antibodies.</p>

                        <h3>Thymosin- The Thymus Hormone</h3>
                        <p>To stimulate the production of T-Cells, the thymus secretes a hormone called Thymosin. Then, a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes pass through the thymus and gets transformed into T-Cells. Once these T-cells have matured, they migrate to the lymph nodes in the body and consequently aid the immune system. The thymus gland is only active until puberty, however, they produce all the T-cells required by the body well before this period.</p>
