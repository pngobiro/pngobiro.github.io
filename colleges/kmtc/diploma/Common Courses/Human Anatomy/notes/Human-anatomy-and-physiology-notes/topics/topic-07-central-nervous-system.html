                        <h3>Dura Mater</h3>
                        <p>The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges, lying directly underneath the bones of the skull and vertebral column. It is thick, tough and inextensible.</p>
                        <p>Within the cranial cavity, the dura contains two connective tissue sheets:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Periosteal layer</strong> - lines the inner surface of the bones of the cranium.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Meningeal layer</strong> - deep to the periosteal layer inside the cranial cavity. It is the only layer present in the vertebral column.</div></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Between these two layers, the dural venous sinuses are located. They are responsible for the venous vasculature of the cranium, draining into the internal jugular veins.</p>
                        <p>In some areas within the skull, the meningeal layer of the dura mater folds inwards as dural reflections. They partition the brain, and divide the cranial cavity into several compartments. For example, the tentorium cerebelli divides the cranial cavity into supratentorial and infratentorial compartments.</p>
                        <p>The dura mater receives its own vasculature; primarily from the middle meningeal artery and vein. It is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (V1, V2 and V3).</p>

                        <h3>Arachnoid Mater</h3>
                        <p>The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, lying directly underneath the dura mater. It consists of layers of connective tissue, is avascular, and does not receive any innervation.</p>
                        <p>Underneath the arachnoid is a space known as the sub-arachnoid space. It contains cerebrospinal fluid, which acts to cushion the brain. Small projections of arachnoid mater into the dura (known as arachnoid granulations) allow CSF to re-enter the circulation via the dural venous sinuses.</p>

                        <p>Like the dura mater, it is highly vascularised, with blood vessels perforating through the membrane to supply the underlying neural tissue.</p>

                        <p>The ventricular system is a set of communicating cavities within the brain. These structures are responsible for the production, transport and removal of cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the central nervous system.</p>

                        <h3>The Ventricles of the Brain</h3>
                        <p>The ventricles are structures that produce cerebrospinal fluid, and transport it around the cranial cavity. They are lined by ependymal cells, which form a structure called the choroid plexus. It is within the choroid plexus that CSF is produced.</p>
                        <p>Embryologically, the ventricular system is derived from the lumen of the neural tube.</p>

                            <h4>Third Ventricle</h4>
                            <p>The lateral ventricles are connected to the third ventricle by the foramen of Monro. The third ventricle is situated in between the right and the left thalamus. The anterior surface of the ventricle contains two protrusions:</p>

                        <p>Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus, located in the lining of the ventricles. It consists of capillaries and loose connective tissue, surrounded by cuboidal epithelial cells. Plasma is filtered from the blood by the epithelial cells to produce CSF. In this way, the exact chemical composition of the fluid can be controlled.</p>
                        <p>Drainage of the CSF occurs in the subarachnoid cisterns (or space). Small projections of arachnoid mater (called arachnoid granulations), protrude into the dura mater. They allow the fluid to drain into the dural venous sinuses.</p>

                            <p>The human brain controls nearly every aspect of the human body ranging from physiological functions to cognitive abilities. It functions by receiving and sending signals via neurons to different parts of the body. The human brain, just like most other mammals, has the same basic structure, but it is better developed than any other mammalian brain.</p>
                            <p>On average, an adult brain weighs between $1.0 \mathrm{~kg}-1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$. It is mainly composed of neurons - the fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system. Recent estimates have suggested that the brain contains anywhere between 86 billion to 100 billion neurons.</p>
                            <p>The brain, along with the spinal cord, constitutes the central nervous system. It is responsible for thoughts, interpretation and origin of control for body movements.</p>

                        <h4>Where is the Brain located?</h4>
                        <p>The brain is enclosed within the skull, which provides frontal, lateral and dorsal protection. The skull consists of 22 bones, 14 of which form the facial bones and the remaining 8 forms the cranial bones. Anatomically, the brain is contained within the cranium and is surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
                        <p>The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is a fluid that circulates within the skull and spinal cord, filling up hollow spaces on the surface of the brain. Every day, the specialised ependymal cells produce around 500 mL of cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
                        <p>The primary function of the CSF is to act as a buffer for the brain, cushioning mechanical shocks and dampening minor jolts. It also provides basic immunological protection to the brain.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, CSF provides buoyancy for the brain. i.e., the brain is suspended in a layer of CSF, wherein, the weight of the brain is nearly negated. If the brain is not suspended in CSF, it would be impeded by its weight, consequently cutting off the blood supply in the lower half of the brain. It would lead to the death of neurons in the affected area</p>

                        <p>The tectum is a small portion of the brain, specifically the dorsal part of the midbrain. It serves as a relay centre for the sensory information from the ears to the cerebrum. It also controls the reflex movements of the head, eye and neck muscles. It provides a passage for the different neurons moving in and out of the cerebrum.</p>

                        <h4>Tegmentum</h4>
                        <p>Tegmentum is a region within the brainstem. It is a complex structure with various components, which is mainly involved in body movements, sleep, arousal, attention, and different necessary reflexes. It forms the platform for the midbrain and connects with the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and the spinal cord.</p>

                        <h4>Cerebellum</h4>
                        <p>The cerebellum is the second largest part of the brain, located in the posterior portion of the medulla and pons. The cerebellum and cerebrum are separated by tentorium cerebelli and transverse fissure. Cortex is the outer surface of the cerebellum, and its parallel ridges are called the foila. Apart from this, the cerebellum has the cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar nuclei, anterior and posterior lobes. The cerebellum consists of two hemispheres, the outer grey cortex and the inner white medulla. It is mainly responsible for coordinating and maintaining the body balance during walking, running, riding, swimming, and precision control of the voluntary movements. The main functions of the cerebellum include:</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Structure and functions of the Spinal Cord</h2>
                        
                        <p>The spinal cord is a part of the central nervous system. It is a long pipe-like structure arising from the medulla oblongata part of the brain consisting of a collection of nerve fibres, running through the vertebral column of the backbone. It is segmented with a pair of roots (dorsal and ventral roots) consisting of nerve fibres joining to form the spinal nerves.</p>

                        <h3>Spinal Cord Anatomy</h3>
                        <p>In adults, the spinal cord is usually 40 cm long and 2 cm wide. It forms a vital link between the brain and the body.</p>
                        <p>The spinal cord is divided into five different parts:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Sacral cord</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Lumbar cord</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Thoracic cord</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Cervical cord</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Coccygeal</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Several spinal nerves emerge out of each segment of the spinal cord. There are 8 pairs of cervical, 5 lumbar, 12 thoracic, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal pair of spinal nerves</p>
                        <p>It performs the primary processing of information as it carries sensory signals from all parts of the body to the Central Nervous System through afferent fibres.</p>
                        <p>Nerve tissue consists of the grey and white matter spread across uniformly. The smooth muscles and the skeletal system carrying nerve fibres liaise different reflexes when ventral horn projects axons which carry motor neurons.</p>
                        <p>It also helps intercede autonomic control for visceral functions which consist of neurons with descending axons. It is a sensitive site, which is severely affected in case of a traumatic injury.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the physiology of the spinal cord helps in detecting and determining the various methods to deal with diseases and damage related to the spinal cord.</p>

                        <h3>Structure of Spinal Cord</h3>
                        <p>The Spinal cord runs through a hollow case from the skull enclosed within the vertebral column. Spinal nerves arise from different regions of the vertebral column and are named accordingly, the regions are - Neck, chest, pelvic and abdominal.</p>
                        <p>Cross-section of spinal cord displays grey matter shaped like a butterfly surrounded by a white matter.</p>
                        <p>Grey matter consists of the central canal at the centre and is filled with a fluid called CSF (Cerebrospinal fluid). It consists of horns (four projections) and forms the core mainly containing neurons and cells of the CNS. There are two dorsal and two ventral horns.</p>
                        <p>The white matter consists of a collection of axons permitting communication between different layers of CNS. A tract is a collection of axons and carries specialized information. Ascending tracts and descending tracts send and transmit signals from the brain respectively to various nerve cells across the body.</p>
                        <p>Spinal nerves act as mediators, communicating information to and from the rest of the body and the spinal cord. We have 31 pairs of spinal nerves.</p>
                        <p>Three layers of meninges surround the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Dura mater consists of two layers- periosteal and meningeal. Epidural space is present between the two layers.</p>
                        <p>Subarachnoid space lies between the arachnoid mater and pia mater. It is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

                        <h3>Spinal Cord Injuries</h3>
                        <p>Damage to any part of the spinal cord or spinal nerves results in permanent and life-long damage to the spinal cord affecting the normal functioning of the spinal cord without any replacements.</p>
                        <p>It often causes long-term changes in the strength, body posture and reflexing of the body. Voluntary control of limbs post an injury depends on the severity and location of the injury.</p>
                        <p>One has a complete injury when he loses the ability to move or sense below the injury. The incomplete injury allows the injured to perform some sensory and motor functions.</p>
                        <p>Spinal cord injury not only has an impact on the spinal nerves and the vertebral column but affects other muscles and vital organs as well.</p>
                        <p>Paralysis from an injury can be of two types:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Tetraplegic</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Paraplegic</div></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tetraplegia is a paralysis that results in total or partial loss of use of all four limbs and torso.</p>
                        <p>Paraplegia, on the other hand, is similar to tetraplegia, except it doesn't affect the arms.</p>
                        <p>These injuries result in the inability to voluntarily move limbs, lose sensation, delayed or exaggerated reflexes, changes in sexual functions, intense shooting pain due to damaged nerve fibres. It also causes shortness of breath, cough and muscle spasms.</p>

                        <h3>Spinal Cord Nerves</h3>
                        <p>The spinal nerves consist of a group of 31 nerves. These nerves are attached to the spinal cord by two roots- dorsal sensory root and ventral motor root.</p>
                        <p>The sensory root fibers carry sensory impulses to the spinal cord. The motor roots, on the contrary, carry impulses from the spinal cord.</p>
                        <p>The spinal nerves carry messages to and from the skin of specific regions of the body called dermatomes.</p>
                        <p>The spinal cord nerves can be grouped as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Cervical</div></li>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p><strong>Cervical Nerves:</strong> Cervical means of the neck. There are 8 cervical nerves that emerge from the cervical spine (C1-C8).</p>
                            <p><strong>Thoracic Nerves:</strong> Thoracic means of the chest. There are 12 thoracic nerves that emerge from the thoracic spine (T1-T12).</p>
                            <p><strong>Lumbar Nerves:</strong> Lumbar means from the lower back region. There are 5 lumbar nerves that emerge from the lumbar spine (L1-L5).</p>
                            <p><strong>Sacral Nerves:</strong> Sacral means of the sacrum. The sacrum is a bony plate at the base of the vertebral column. There are 5 sacral nerves that emerge from the sacral bone (S1-S5).</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Reflex is an involuntary and sudden response to stimuli. It happens to be an integral component of the famed survival instinct.</p>
                            <p>Most of the common reflexes are a response to all the well trained, accumulated knowledge of caution that we have internalized. It could be anything and ranges from the reflex action of abruptly withdrawing the hand as it comes in contact with an extremely cold or hot object. This action is termed as the reflex action. It has a subtle relation to instinct.</p>
                            <p>A point to be thought upon is that we all have our instincts differently depending on our past experience and understanding. A reflex is a reaction triggered by this instinct. At times, we have no prior knowledge if the pan is hot or not. In other words, instinct has little to do with reflex.</p>

                        <h3>The Action of Neuron</h3>
                        <p>Two neurons dominate the pathway, afferent nerves (receptor) and the efferent nerves (effector or excitor).</p>
                        <p>Below is a brief description of the events that take place:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Firstly, it begins with receptor detecting the stimulus or a sudden change in the environment, where the instinct again has a role to play. The stimulus is received from a sensory organ.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Then, the sensory neuron sends a signal to the relay neuron.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">This is followed with the relay neuron sending the signal to the motor neuron.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Further, the motor neuron sends a signal to the effector.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">The effector produces an instantaneous response, for example, pulling away of the hand or a knee-jerk reaction.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="callout callout--note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Reflex Arc</h4>
                            <div class="callout-content">
                                <p>From the above explanations, it can be clearly summarized that the moment the afferent neuron receives a signal from the sensory organ; it transmits the impulse via a dorsal nerve root into the Central Nervous System. The efferent neuron then carries the signal from the CNS to the effector. The stimulus thus forms a reflex arc.</p>
                                <p>In a reflex action, the signals do not route to the brain - instead, it is directed into the synapse in the spinal cord, hence the reaction is almost instantaneous.</p>
