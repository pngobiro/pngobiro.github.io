                            <p>Structure of the eye is essential to understand as it one of the important sensory organs in the human body. It is mainly responsible for vision, differentiation of colour (the human eye can differentiate approximately $10-12$ million colours) and maintaining the biological clock of the human body. The human eye can be compared to a camera as both functions by gathering, focusing, and transmitting the light through the lens for creating an image of an object.</p>
                            <p>The human eyes are the most complicated sense organs in the human body. From the muscles and tissues to nerves and blood vessels, every part of the human eye is responsible for a certain action. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, the eye is not perfectly spherical; instead, it is two separate segments fused together. It is made up of several muscles and tissues that come together to form a roughly spherical structure. From an anatomical perspective, the human eye can be broadly classified into the external structure and internal structure.</p>

                        <h3>The External Structure of an Eye</h3>
                        <p>The parts of the eye that are visible externally comprise the external structure of the eye. These include the following:-</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Sclera:</strong> It is a tough and thick white sheath that protects the inner parts of the eye. We know it as the 'White of the eye'.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Conjunctiva:</strong> It is a thin transparent membrane that is spread across the sclera. It keeps the eyes moist and clear by secreting small amounts of mucus and tears.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Cornea:</strong> It is the transparent layer of skin that is spread over the pupil and the iris. The main role of the cornea is to refract the light that enters the eyes.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Iris:</strong> It is a pigmented layer of tissues that make up the coloured portion of the eye. Its primary function is to control the size of the pupil, depending on the amount of light entering it.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Pupil:</strong> It is the small opening located in the middle of the Iris. It allows light to come in.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Internal Structure of an Eye</h3>
                        <p>The internal structure of the eye includes the following parts:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Lens:</strong> It is a transparent, biconvex, and an adjustable part of an eye. The lens with the help of the cornea refracts light focused on the retina, therefore creating images on it.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Retina:</strong> It is the layer present at the back of the eye where all the images are formed. It is the third and inner coat of the eye which is very sensitive towards the light because of the presence of Photoreceptors. The retina functions by converting the light rays into impulses and sending the signals to the brain through the optic nerve.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Optic nerve:</strong> It is located at the end of the eyes, behind the retina. The optic nerve is mainly responsible for carrying all the nerve impulses from the photoreceptors to the human brain, without which vision would not be possible.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Aqueous Humour:</strong> It is a watery fluid that is present in the area between the lens and the cornea. It is responsible for the nourishment of both the lens and the cornea.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Vitreous Humour:</strong> it is a semi-solid, transparent, jelly-like substance that covers the interior portion of the eyes. It plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the eye and also causes refraction of light before it reaches the retina.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The diseases or a disorder that destroy eye tissue and other parts of eyes can be referred to as the eye diseases. There are different types of eye diseases, which can either be minor, which doesn't last for a longer time or some can also lead to a permanent loss of vision. There are different factors behind the causes of eye diseases. These factors include age, stress, infections, heredity, nutritional deficiencies, injuries or accidents, etc.</p>

                            <h4>Age-Related Macular Degeneration</h4>
                            <p>Macular degeneration is also known as an irregularity that affects the centre of the retina, which is called the Macula. The Macula is responsible for everyday acute vision. There are two types of Macular degeneration- 1. Dry Macular degeneration. 2. Wet Macular degeneration.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Age, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Exposure to sunlight.</p>
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Blurred vision, A dark or empty area in the central area of vision, Distortion of straight lines.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> People suffering from Dry AMD continue with the aid of low vision optical devices. But Wet AMD is treated with injected medications or laser surgery by sealing off the leaking blood vessels.</p>

                            <p>Proptosis as it is also known as occurs due to the swelling of muscle fats and tissue behind the eye causing both eyes to protrude from the eye sockets leaving the cornea exposed to air, making it difficult to keep the eyes moist and lubricated.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Causes:</strong> It has been linked to Glaucoma, Hyperthyroidism, and Leukemia the most common being Graves disease a condition where thyroid glands mistakenly sense harmful cells and release antibodies which fuse to eye muscles causing inflammation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Common symptoms include Appearance of protruding eyes, Excessive dryness in eyes, Visible whiteness between the top of iris and the eyelid, Eye pain, Eye redness.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> Lack of lubrication is the main problem hence artificial tears and eye drops are used for moisture and lubrication.</p>

                            <h4>Glaucoma</h4>
                            <p>It is a situation which is caused by the damage to the eye's optic nerve which gets severer over time. It is often associated with an increase in the pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma tends to be inherited and turns up late in life. There are four different types of Glaucoma which include Chronic open-angle glaucoma, Acute closed-angle glaucoma, Secondary glaucoma, Normaltension glaucoma.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>

                                <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Chronic open-angle glaucoma results from a pressure build-up in the eye and causes severe vision loss without any symptoms.</div></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Acute closed glaucoma appears all of sudden which is very painful and is extremely serious.</div></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Secondary glaucoma arrives as a result of something else like medical conditions and injuries, irregularities.</div></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Normal-tension glaucoma is a unique condition of the eye in which is caused by the damage to an optic nerve. This may result in the loss of vision, caused by the intraocular pressure in the eye.</div></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Blurred vision, severe eye pain, headache, rainbow halos, nausea, and vomiting.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> Glaucoma could be treated with prescription eye drops which reduces eye pressure by slowing the production of fluids within the eye. Doctors also recommend highly focused laser beams to create an alternate hole in the iris. Surgery could treat glaucoma but could not reverse the existing damage.</p>

                            <h4>Lazy Eye</h4>
                            <p>This is a condition where there is a lack of vision in one eye because the eye and the brain stop working together, the brain ignores the image from the amblyopic eye this only affects one eye resulting in the amblyopic eye pointing away from the other thereby appearing "Lazy".</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Causes:</strong> There are various causes behind this condition like Strabismus (Crossed Eyes) and cataracts, ptosis and refractive problems.</p>
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms include eyes that point in different directions, significant favouring of one eye, poor depth perception, poor vision in one eye.</p>
                            <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> Improved sight in a lazy eye could be accomplished however in certain cases an untreated eye might become dysfunctional, Best possible methods are by Patching or covering the strong eye: This method forces the weaker eye to work harder hence strengthening its ability to move and focus. Contact lenses and eyeglasses in some cases surgery to realign the muscles in the eye.</p>

                            <p>The mechanism of hearing involves the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">The sound waves pass through the auditory canal and reach the eardrum.</div></li>

                            <p>The eustachian tube and the vestibular complex are the important parts of the ear responsible for balance.</p>

                        <h3>Disorders of the Ear</h3>
                        <p><strong>Acoustic neuroma</strong> - A non-cancerous growth that begins in the nerve that carries hearing and balance sensation from the ear to the brain. This slow-growing tumor eventually fills the ear canal and, if untreated, can cause life-threatening damage to the brainstem. The optimal treatment is surgical removal of the tumor.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cholesteatoma</strong> - A cholesteatoma is an abnormal cyst or pouch in the middle ear, usually caused by repeated infections. Over time, a cholesteatoma can cause deafness and even lifethreatening complications. Treatment involves surgery to remove the cyst and infection, followed six to 12 months later by another operation to check for any residual cholesteatoma, to reconstruct the middle ear, and to restore hearing, if possible.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mastoiditis</strong> - Infection of the mastoid bone, a honeycomb-type structure that is part of the skull behind the ear. Unchecked, mastoiditis can lead to deafness and life-threatening complications. The first line of defense is antibiotics, but mastoidectomy may be required to clean out the infection and, if necessary, tympanoplasty to repair a damaged eardrum.</p>
                        <p><strong>Meniere's disease</strong> - A disorder of the inner ear characterized by dizziness, hearing loss, and ringing or noises in the ear. It is caused by an imbalance of fluid in the inner ear and is thought to be an immune or inflammatory response. The condition is usually treated with medication, but when medicine doesn't work, an option can be surgery to relieve pressure in the ear, remove a faulty balance organ (the labyrinth), or partially or completely remove a balance and/or hearing nerve.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chronic otitis media</strong> - An ongoing infection or inflammation of the middle ear, usually affecting children. A persistent condition can lead to hearing loss and other serious complications. Treatment includes surgery, called a typanoplasty, to repair the eardrum and hearing bones. This procedure is sometimes combined with mastoidectomy to remove the diseased tissue. Another procedure, a tympanostomy or myringotomy, involves inserting a small metal or plastic tube in the affected ear to ventilate it and prevent buildup of pressure and fluid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Otosclerosis</strong> - A condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, which limits the transmission of sound vibrations through the ear. Left untreated, this condition can lead to total deafness. The surgical option is a stapedectomy, in which the stapes, a spongy bone in the middle ear, is replaced with a prosthesis that transmits sound waves to the inner ear.</p>

                        <p>Nose is the primary organ of smell and functions as an important respiratory organ in the body. Besides this, it is also involved in functions such as hearing and tasting. The air that we breathe in is filtered through the nasal hair. The inhaled air is warmed and humidified before it enters into the lungs.</p>

                        <h3>Functions of Nose</h3>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Helps in Inhalation</h4>
                            <p>The process of respiration starts in the nose. The oxygen enters into the nose through the nostrils and exits the same way during exhalation. The nasal cavities open into a space called choana, which further opens into the nasopharynx. The air then enters the oropharynx and finally reaches the lungs via larynx, trachea and bronchi.</p>

                            <h4>Purification of Inhaled Air</h4>
                            <p>The walls of the nasal cavity are covered with hair or cilia that trap the dust and harmful particles and purify the inhaled air. The back and forth movement of cilia help in moving the dust particles to the throat where they are swallowed, or are excreted through the nasal cavity. The nose hair also moisturizes and warms the air, so that it resembles the air temperature and moisture within the lungs. During exhalation, the heat and moisture present in the carbon dioxide is absorbed by the nasal hair and then released in the atmosphere. The nasal conchae, that is spiral in structure, keeps whirling the air for a longer time within the nasal cavity so that it is humidified and purified properly.</p>

                            <h4>Organ of Smell</h4>
                            <p>The inhaled air comes in contact with the olfactory epithelium and the nerve fibres extending from the olfactory receptors accumulate the molecules containing the odour to send the signals to the olfactory bulbs through the receptors. These signals are carried to the olfactory region of the brain and are decoded so that the smell is identified.</p>

                            <h4>Sense of Taste</h4>
                            <p>While chewing, the food releases certain chemicals that travel up to the nose and activate the olfactory receptors inside the nose. They work in coordination with the taste buds to identify the actual flavour of the food.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Disorders of the Nose</h3>
                        <p><strong>Sinusitis</strong> is one of the most common chronic (ongoing) conditions in the United States effecting fifty million Americans, 20% of the nation's population. Sinusitis is often a chronic (ongoing) disease that includes the symptoms of nasal obstruction (difficulty breathing through the nose), nasal drainage, decreased sense of smell, facial pressure, and frequent sinus infections. Allergies and related respiratory problems such as asthma can also be associated with chronic sinusitis.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Nasal & Sinus Polyps</strong> are associated with sinusitis and occur when the lining of the sinuses swell. Polyps may block the nasal airway, creating difficulty in breathing. Polyps may also block the natural drainage of the sinus cavities leading to infections. Polyps are generally thought to occur as a result of an ongoing inflammatory process within the nose and sinuses.</p>

                        <p><strong>Smell and Taste Disorders</strong> can have a large impact on quality of life. Currently about 2 million adults in the United States are evaluated for smell and taste disorders every year, but it is believed many more cases go unreported. It is estimated that up to $80 \%$ of taste is a result of olfactory (or smell) input. As a result, loss of smell is frequently interpreted as a loss of taste. Problems with smell and taste can be due to a variety of causes. Examples of these include chronic rhinosinusitis, polyps, allergic rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, trauma, tumors or other neurological disorders.</p>

                        <p>The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth covered with a moist, pink tissue called mucosa. It is involved in licking, tasting, breathing, swallowing, and speaking. The papillae present on the tongue give it a rough texture. It is covered by a number of taste buds. There are several nerves in the tongue that help in transmitting taste signals to the brain, and thus help in taste sensation.</p>

                        <h3>Structure of Tongue</h3>
                        <p>The human tongue is about 3.3 inches in men and 3.1 inches in women. It is located in the oral cavity. The tongue is divided into three parts: Tip, Body, Base.</p>
                        <p>The tongue is embryologically divided into the anterior and posterior part. The anterior part is known as the oral or presulcal part that includes the root attached to the floor of the oral cavity. While the posterior part is known as pharyngeal or postsulcal part that includes the base forming the ventral wall of oropharynx.</p>

                        <p>The tongue is made up of three elements:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Epithelium:</strong> The epithelium comprises papillae and taste buds. The taste buds help to sense taste. They are lined by squamous epithelial tissue and have a broad bottom. The taste cells are slender, rod-shaped with a nucleus in the centre. The free surface comprises short taste hair. The taste cells help in detecting taste, which dissolves in saliva for proper sensation.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Muscles:</strong> The tongue muscles are voluntary and contain cross-striated muscular fibres.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Glands:</strong> The tongue consists of small and scattered glands. These glands are of three types: Mucous Glands, Serous Glands, Lymph Nodes. The lymph nodes are very prominent at the posterior part of the tongue and are known as lingual tonsils.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Nerve Supply</h3>
                        <p>The glossopharyngeal nerve and the chorda tympanic branch of the facial nerve are responsible for taste sensation. The sensations of pain, touch, temperature are carried by the trigeminal nerve.</p>

                        <h3>Tongue Functions</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Mastication:</strong> The tongue helps in chewing.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Deglutition:</strong> It helps in swallowing food.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Taste:</strong> The tongue transmits taste signals to the brain and helps in sensing taste.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Speech:</strong> It is an important organ that facilitates speech.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Secretion:</strong> It secretes mucous and serous fluid which keeps the mouth moist.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Salivary Glands</h3>
                        <p>Salivary glands comprise three pairs:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Parotid:</strong> It opens on the inner surface of the cheek by the duct of Stensen. It is located opposite the second upper molar tooth.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Submaxillary:</strong> It opens by Wharton's duct on the floor of the mouth by the sides of the frenulum of the tongue.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Sublingual:</strong> It opens by the ducts of Rivinus on the floor of the mouth by the sides of the frenulum of the tongue.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Disorders of the Tongue</h3>
                        <p><strong>Loss of taste:</strong> Reasons include damage to facial nerve (Bell's palsy), Sjogren's syndrome (reduced saliva), Glossodynia, or certain medications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sore tongue:</strong> Usually caused by trauma, grinding teeth (bruxism), diabetes, anaemia, vitamin deficiency, or skin diseases.</p>
                        <p><strong>Black hairy tongue:</strong> Caused by the failure of old cells to shed. The overgrowth of papillae trap food and bacteria, creating a dark 'coat'. Risk factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, antibiotics, chemotherapy, and diabetes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Glossodynia:</strong> Main symptom is a burning sensation. Causes include infections, nerve damage, smoking, vitamin deficiencies, or medications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Benign migratory glossitis (Geographic tongue):</strong> Irregular and inflamed patches on the tongue surface with white borders. Risk factors include vitamin deficiencies, local irritants, stress, or medications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tongue-tie (Ankyloglossia):</strong> Characterised by a short frenum that stops the tongue from poking out past the lips. Can cause feeding or speech problems.</p>
