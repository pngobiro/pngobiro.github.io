                            <p>The nervous system coordinates voluntary and involuntary actions in the body by sending and receiving information. The nervous system is comprised of an enormous number of cells (over 100 billion), primarily of two types: neurons (the signaling units) and glial cells (the supporting units). However, nervous system function is mostly a story of the neuron. The neuron is the functional unit of the nervous system and is designed to transmit information between cells. Interestingly, neurons with a particular function are found in a predictable location. This regularity in structure has permitted neurobiologists to categorically organize the nervous system based on location and function.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thus, the nervous system can first be divided into two major parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of neurons associated with central processing and which are located in the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of neurons associated with sensory input (afferent) and motor output (efferent), and functions to connect the central nervous system to all other parts of the body. Stated another way, if the entire structure of the neuron is contained within the brain and/or spinal cord, the neuron would be considered part of the CNS. In contrast, if any part of the neuronal structure is located outside of the brain and/or spinal cord the neuron would be considered part of the PNS</p>

                        <h3>The Central Nervous System</h3>
                        <p>The brain and spinal cord are the organs of the central nervous system. Because they are so vitally important, the brain and spinal cord, located in the dorsal body cavity, are encased in bone for protection. The brain is in the cranial vault, and the spinal cord is in the vertebral canal of the vertebral column. Although considered to be two separate organs, the brain and spinal cord are continuous at the foramen magnum.</p>

                        <h3>The Peripheral Nervous System</h3>
                        <p>The organs of the peripheral nervous system are the nerves and ganglia. Nerves are bundles of nerve fibers, much like muscles are bundles of muscle fibers. Cranial nerves and spinal nerves extend from the CNS to peripheral organs such as muscles and glands. Ganglia are collections, or small knots, of nerve cell bodies outside the CNS.</p>
                        <p>The peripheral nervous system is further subdivided into an afferent (sensory) division and an efferent (motor) division. The afferent or sensory division transmits impulses from peripheral organs to the CNS. The efferent or motor division transmits impulses from the CNS out to the peripheral organs to cause an effect or action.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the efferent or motor division is again subdivided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system, also called the somatomotor or somatic efferent nervous system, supplies motor impulses to the skeletal muscles. Because these nerves permit conscious control of the skeletal muscles, it is sometimes called the voluntary nervous system. The autonomic nervous system, also called the visceral efferent nervous system, supplies motor impulses to cardiac muscle, to smooth muscle, and to glandular epithelium. It is further subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Because the autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary or automatic functions, it is called the involuntary nervous system.</p>

                        <h3>NEURON STRUCTURE</h3>
                        <p>Neurons have four specialized structures that allow for the sending and receiving of information: the cell body (soma), dendrites, axon and axon terminals (see lowest figure).</p>
                        
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Cell body or soma:</strong> The cell body is the portion of the cell that surrounds the nucleus and plays a major role in synthesizing proteins.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Dendrites:</strong> Dendrites are short, branched processes that extend from the cell body. Dendrites function to receive information, and do so through numerous receptors located in their membranes that bind to chemicals, called neurotransmitters.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Axon:</strong> An axon is a large process that extends from the cell body at a point of origin-called the axon hillock-and functions to send information. In contrast to the shorter dendrites, the axon can extend for more than a meter. Because of this length, the axon contains microtubules and is surrounded by myelin. Microtubules are arranged inside the axon as parallel arrays of long strands that act as highways for the movement of materials to and from the soma. Specialized motor proteins "walk" along the microtubules, carrying material away from the soma (anterograde transport) or back to the soma (retrograde transport). This system can move materials down the axon at rates of $400 \mathrm{~mm} /$ day (see lowest figure). Myelin consists of totally separate cells that coil and wrap their membranes around the outside of the axon. These are essential for electrical insulation and to speed up action potential propagation.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Axon terminals:</strong> Once an axon reaches a target, it terminates into multiple endings, called axon terminals. The axon terminal is designed to convert the electrical signal into a chemical signal in a process called synaptic transmission (further explained in the section "Physiology of the Neuron").</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Most neurons are amitotic or lose their ability to divide. Exceptions to this rule are found in olfactory neurons (those associated with smell) and hippocampal regions of the brain. Fortunately, lifespans of amitotic neurons is near 100 years. Still, if a neuron is damaged or lost, it is not easily replaced. For this reason, there is usually limited recovery from serious brain or spinal cord injuries. Perhaps the slow recovery rate or lack of regeneration is to ensure that learned behavior and memories are preserved throughout life. Neurons also have exceptionally high metabolic rates and subsequently require high levels of glucose and oxygen. The body will go to great lengths to ensure that neurons are adequately fed; in fact, if for some reason the brain detects that it is not receiving adequate amounts of nutrition, the body will shut down immediately (i.e., faint).</p>

                        <h3 id="conduction-of-nerve-impulse">CONDUCTION OF NERVE IMPULSE</h3>
                        <p>A nerve impulse is the electric signals that pass along the dendrites to generate a nerve impulse or an action potential. An action potential is the movement of ions in and out of the cell. It specifically involves sodium and potassium ions. They are moved in and out of the cell through sodium and potassium channels and sodium-potassium pump.</p>
                        <p>Conduction of nerve impulse occurs due to the presence of active and electronic potentials along the conductors. Transmission of signals internally between the cells is achieved through a synapse. Nerve conductors comprise of relatively higher membrane resistance and low axial resistance. The electrical synapse has its application in escape reflexes, heart and in the retina of vertebrates. They are mainly used whenever there is a requirement of fast response and timing being crucial. The ionic currents pass through the two cell membrane when the action potential reaches the stage of such synapse.</p>

                        <h3>Mechanism of Transmission of Nerve Impulse</h3>
                        <p>The axon or nerve fibers are in the form of a cylinder wherein the interior of the axon is filled with axoplasm and the exterior is covered with axolemma. The nerve fibers are immersed in ECF. The solution is in ionic form that is present in axoplasm and extracellular fluid or ECF.</p>
                        <p>Outside the axon, the negatively charged chloride ions are neutralized in the presence of positively charged sodium ions. Negatively charged protein molecules are neutralized in the presence of potassium ions within the axoplasm. The membrane of a neuron -ve inside and +ve outside. Resting potential would be the difference in charge. The difference in charge might vary from seventy to ninety millivolts, as a result, the membrane would be polarized. Sodium potassium metallic pump operates to keep resting potential in equilibrium.</p>
                        <p>The pump is placed on the axon membrane. Now the potassium ions are pumped from ECF to axoplasm and sodium ions are placed from axoplasm to ECF. The concentration level of sodium ions would be between twenty-eight to thirty times more inside the neuron membrane and the concentration level of sodium ions would be fourteen times more in outside the neuron membrane.</p>

                        <p>The sodium-potassium pump stops operating when a stimulus is applied to a membrane of a nerve fiber. The stimulus could be either electrical, chemical or mechanical. The potassium ions rush outside the membrane and sodium ions rush inside the membrane as a result negative charges are present outside and positive charges are present inside.</p>
                        <p>The nerve fibers are either depolarized or they are said to be in action potential. The action potential traveling along the membrane would be the nerve impulse. It is around +30 mV . The sodium-potassium pump starts to operate once the action potential is completed. As a result, the axon membrane will obtain a resting potential by repolarization.</p>

                        <h3>The Resting Membrane Potential</h3>
                        <p>The resting membrane potential of cells varies depending on the cell type, the resting potential for neurons typically sits between -50 and -75 mV . This value depends on the types of ion channels that are open and the concentrations of different ions in the intracellular and extracellular fluids. In neurons $\mathbf{K}+$ and organic anions are typically found at a higher concentration within the cell than outside, whereas $\mathrm{Na}+$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-$ are typically found in higher concentrations outside the cell.</p>
                        <p>This difference in concentrations provide a concentration gradient for ions to flow down when their channels are open. At rest, most neurons are permeable to $\mathrm{K}+, \mathrm{Na}+$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-$, as such they will all readily flow down their concentration gradients, with $\mathrm{K}+$ moving out of the cells and $\mathrm{Na}+$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-$ moving in to the cell. However the cell is most permeable to $\mathrm{K}+$, as such this exerts the greatest influence on the resting membrane potential - and the value is closest to the equilibrium potential of $\mathrm{K}+$ (the membrane potential at which the concentration gradient for an ion is balanced) out of the three ions.</p>
                        <p>These concentration gradients are maintained by the action of the $\mathbf{N a + / K +}$ ATPase via active transport, which in turn allows the membrane potential to be maintained.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Generation of Action Potentials</h3>
                        <p>During the resting state the membrane potential arises because the membrane is selectively permeable to $\mathrm{K}+$. An action potential begins at the axon hillock as a result of depolarisation. During depolarisation voltage gated sodium ion channels open due to an electrical stimulus. As the sodium rushes back into the cell the positive sodium ions raise the charge inside the cell from negative to positive.</p>
                        <p>If a threshold is reached, then an action potential is produced. Action potentials will only occur if a threshold is reached, as such they are described as "all or nothing". If the threshold is reached then the maximum response will be elicited.</p>
                        <p>Once the cell has been depolarised the voltage gated sodium ion channels close. The raised positive charge inside the cell causes potassium channels to open, $\mathrm{K}+$ ions now move down their electrochemical gradient out of the cell. As the $\mathrm{K}+$ moves out of the cell the membrane potential falls and starts to approach the resting potential.</p>
                        <p>Typically, repolarisation overshoots the resting membrane potential, making the membrane potential more negative. This is known as hyperpolarisation. It is important to note that the $\mathrm{Na}+/ \mathrm{K}+$ ATPase is not involved in the repolarisation process following an action potential.</p>
                        <p>Every action potential is followed by a refractory period. This period can be further divided into the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. This period occurs as once the sodium channels close after an AP, they enter an inactive state during which they cannot be reopened regardless of the membrane potential. This is known as the absolute refractory period.</p>
                        <p>Slowly the sodium channels come out of inactivation. This is known as the relative refractory period. During this period the neuron can be excited with stimuli stronger than one normally needed to initial an AP. Early on in the relative refractory period the strength of the stimulus required is very high and gradually it becomes smaller throughout the relative refractory period as more sodium channels recover from inactivation.</p>

                        <h3>Propagation of Action Potentials</h3>
                        <p>Action potentials are propagated along the axons of neurons via local currents. Local current flow following depolarisation results in depolarisation of the adjacent axonal membrane and where this reaches threshold, further action potentials are generated. The areas of membrane that have recently depolarised will not depolarise again due to the refractory period - meaning that the action potential will only travel in one direction.</p>
                        <p>These local currents would eventually decrease in charge until threshold is no longer reached. The distance that this would take depends on the membrane capacitance and resistance:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content"><strong>Membrane capacitance</strong> - the ability to store charge, lower capacitance results in a greater distance before threshold is no longer reached</div></li>

A higher membrane resistance results in a greater distance before threshold is no longer reached.</div></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Myelinated Axons</h3>
                        <p>In order to allow rapid conduction of electrical signals through a neuron and make them more energy efficient certain neuronal axons are covered by a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath surrounds the axon to form an insulating layer. Myelination improves conduction by increasing the membrane resistance and decreasing the membrane capacitance.</p>
                        <p>There are periodic gaps along a myelinate axon where there is no myelin and the axonal membrane is exposed. This gaps are called Nodes of Ranvier. Myelinated sections of the axon lack voltage gated ion channels where as there is a high density of ion channels in the Nodes of Ranvier. For this reason, action potential can only occur at the nodes.</p>
                        <p>The myelin sheath acts as good insulator so the action potential is able to propagate along the neurone at a higher rate than would be possible in unmyelinated neurons. The electrical signals are rapidly conducted from one node to the next, where is causes depolarisation of the membrane above the threshold and initiates another action potential which is conducted to the next node. In this manner an action potential is rapidly conducted down a neuron. This is known as saltatory conduction.</p>

                        <h3 id="neuromuscular-junction">Neuromuscular Junction</h3>
                        <p>At its simplest, the neuromuscular junction is a type of synapse where neuronal signals from the brain or spinal cord interact with skeletal muscle fibers, causing them to contract. The activation of many muscle fibers together causes muscles to contract, which in turn can produce movement. The neuromuscular junction then, is a key component in the body's ability to produce and control movement. Amazingly, processes at the neuromuscular junction take place at speeds that allow movements to occur with no appreciable delay or lag.</p>

                        <h4>Components</h4>
                        <p>Each muscle is surrounded by a thin sheet of connective tissue or fascia known as epimysium. Within the muscle, bundles of muscle fibers or cells, known as fascicles, are bound together by another layer of connective tissue known as the perimysium. Every muscle fiber or cell within a fascicle is itself encased in a layer of connective tissue called endomysium.</p>
                        <p>Each individual muscle fiber is innervated (supplied) and controlled by a motor neuron. This motor neuron, which has its cell body located within the central nervous system, will have axons that enter the muscle and penetrate the perimysium.</p>
                        <p>At this point, each axon of the motor neuron will divide into branches called axon terminals. Towards the end of the axon terminal, closest to the muscle fiber, the tip of the axon terminal enlarges and becomes known as the synaptic end bulb. It is the synaptic end bulb of the motor neuron that comprises the nervous system component of the neuromuscular junction. The muscular component is a region of the muscle fiber referred to as the motor end plate. Between the synaptic end bulbs of the neuron and the cell membrane of the muscle fiber (the sarcolemma) lies a space known as the synaptic cleft, which is the final component of the neuromuscular junction.</p>

                        <h4>The synaptic end bulb</h4>
                        <p>The presence of the synaptic cleft between the synaptic end bulb of the neuron and the motor end plate of the muscle fiber, means that the electrical signal or action potential, arriving from the central nervous system, needs to somehow transverse (cross) this space. The neuromuscular junction accomplishes this by turning the electrical signal from the nervous system into a chemical signal that can be moved across the synaptic cleft.</p>
                        <p>The chemical in this case is acetylcholine (ACh), an example of a neurotransmitter that allows neurons to communicate with other cells. ACh is stored inside the synaptic end bulb within membrane-enclosed sacs known as synaptic vesicles. As the electrical signal approaches the synaptic end bulb, it stimulates the inflow of calcium (Ca2+) by opening voltage-gated channels in the cell membrane of the neuron.</p>
                        <p>The increase of Ca2+ within the cytosol of the synaptic end bulb causes the synaptic vesicles to move towards and fuse with the neuron's cell membrane. Once fused, the synaptic vesicles exocytose (release) their contents - ACh - into the synaptic cleft. The ACh then moves across the synaptic cleft towards the motor end plate of the muscle fiber.</p>

                        <h4>The motor end plate</h4>
                        <p>Across the synaptic cleft from the synaptic end bulb is a specialized region of the muscle fiber sarcolemma known as the motor end plate. There is one neuromuscular junction associated with each muscle fiber, and it is typically located near the middle of the fiber. This means that the motor end plate will also be located near the midpoint of the muscle fiber.</p>
                        <p>The motor end plate has two specializations that make it ideal for receiving ACh released from the synaptic end bulb.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">The first specialization at the motor end plate is the presence of junctional folds, which are deep invaginations or grooves of the sarcolemma that provide a large surface area where the ACh from the synaptic end bulb can interact.</div></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><div class="list-content">Secondly, within the region of the motor end plate, the sarcolemma of the junctional folds contains 30 to 40 million acetylcholine receptors. These receptors are integral transmembrane proteins that function as an ion channel once activated.</div></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The binding of two molecules of ACh to an acetylcholine receptor, opens the ion channel in the receptor and allows the influx of sodium $(\mathrm{Na}+)$ into the muscle fiber. It is this influx of $\mathrm{Na}+$ that once again initiates an electrical impulse or action potential that travels outwards from the synaptic cleft.</p>

                        <h4>The synaptic cleft</h4>
                        <p>Up until now the synaptic cleft has merely been a space between the neural and muscular components of the neuromuscular junction. It does however, house an enzyme that is imperative for the proper function of muscles. If ACh remained within the synaptic cleft, it would continue to bind to acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plate region causing continued muscle contraction. Instead, the synaptic cleft contains acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that breaks down ACh into acetyl and choline, neither of which can activate the acetylcholine receptors.</p>

                            <p>A neurotransmitter is the body's chemical messenger. They are molecules that transmit signals from neurons to muscles, or between different neurons. The transmission of signals between two neurons occurs in the synaptic cleft. The electrical signals that travel along the axon are briefly converted into chemical signals through neurotransmitters.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>Excitatory Neurotransmitters</h4>
                            <p>These type of neurons increase the chances of the neuron firing an action potential. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the two excitatory neurotransmitters.</p>

                            <h4>Inhibitory Neurotransmitters</h4>
                            <p>These have inhibitory effects on the neurons and have fewer chances of the neuron firing an action potential. For eg., serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p>
