However note down important points like dates, presence of psychopathological symptoms as it may be difficult to recall this later.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>When do you interview the family?</strong><br>In severely disturbed patients, it is important to involve the family during the initial interview. So much information may be obtained from the family, which may not be readily available from the patient.</p>

                            <h4>2. Chief Complaint</h4>
                            <p>A brief statement of why the patient seeks help. It should contain the description of the problem and should be stated in the patient’s own word.</p>

                            <h4>3. History of Presenting Illness</h4>
                            <p>The patient’s problems are explored in detail and in chronological order. Contains psychosocial stress factors, physical illness, and relationship with presenting symptoms. Ask about onset, duration, allegations, and pre-morbid history.</p>

                            <h4>4. Past Medical and Psychiatric History</h4>
                            <p>Medical conditions the patient has suffered and previous incidences of admission into a mental unit/hospital and outcome of treatment.</p>

                            <h4>5. Family History</h4>
                            <p>Components depend on family type. Note name, age, sex, marital status, occupation, relationship with patient, current health condition. Check for economic dependence and history of mental illness in nuclear or extended family.</p>

                            <h4>6. Personal History</h4>
                            <p>The past period of the life of the patient should be reviewed.</p>
