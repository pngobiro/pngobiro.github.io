                        <h3>Classical Conditioning - Pavlov</h3>
                        <p>A stimulus is presented in order to get a response: S for stimuli and <strong>R</strong> for response</p>
                        
                        <h4>Pavlov's Conditioned Reflex</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Conditioning -- a stimulus that initially produces no response can acquire the ability to produce one.</li>
                            <li>Learning occurs through pairing in time and place of one stimulus with another stimulus that produces a response</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Conditioned Response (CR)</h4>
                        <p>The learned response, similar to the UCR, an involuntary reflex</p>
                        <p>Pavlov distinguished several key processes that are involved in classical conditioning. These are known as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Acquisition,</li>
                            <li>extinctistimulus, generalisation,</li>
                            <li>stimulus discrimination and</li>
                            <li>spontaneous recovery.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Acquisition</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Each paired presentation of the CS with UCS is referred to as a trial.</li>
                            <li>Acquisition is the overall process during which the organism learns to associate 2 events.</li>
                            <li>The rate of learning is often very fast in the early stages of the acquisition phase.</li>
                            <li>Timing of the CS and UCS pairing is critical.</li>
                            <li>Pavlov found that a very short time between presentations of the 2 stimuli was most effective.</li>
                            <li>Acquisition is more rapid when the CS occurs and remains present until the UCS is presented.</li>
                            <li>The end of the acquisition stage is said to occur when the CS alone produces the CR.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Extinction</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A conditioned stimulus-response association can fade over time or disappear altogether.</li>
                            <li>Extinction is the gradual decrease in the strength or rate of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented.</li>
                            <li>Extinction occurs when a CR no longer occurs following presentation of the CS.</li>
                            <li>E.g. Pavlov's dogs ceased salivating (CR) in response to the bell (CS) presented alone after a number of trials in which the food (UCS) did not follow the sound of the bell).</li>
                            <li>There is some variation between individuals in the rate at which extinction of the same conditioned response will occur.</li>
                            <li>There is also considerable variation between the rates at which different response will be extinguished</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Spontaneous Recovery</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Extinction of a CR is not always permanent.</li>
                            <li>In CC, spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a CR when the CS is presented, following a rest period after the CR appears to have been extinguished.</li>
                            <li>Spontaneous recovery does not always occur and when it does it is often short-lived.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore the CR tends to be weaker than it was originally.</li>

                            <li>Pavlov observed that his dogs salivated to other noises that sounded like a bell.</li>
                            <li>This is known as stimulus generalisation which is the tendency for another stimulus to produce a response that is similar to the CR.</li>

                            <li>The greater the similarity between stimuli, the greater the possibility that a generalisation will occur.</li>
                            <li>E.g. is a stimulus generalisation to the sounds of a bell occurred with one of Pavlov's dogs, the dog might also salivate in response to the ringing of the front-door bell</li>
                            <li>However, the amount of saliva produced by the dog would tend to be less than the amount produced by the original bell to which the dog was conditioned.</li>

                            <li>E.g. in a CC experiment, stimulus discrimination would be observed when a dog salivated</li>

                            <li>Behaviours that have been classically conditioned may occur so automatically that they appear to be reflexive.</li>
                            <li>CC behaviours are like reflexes in that they occur involuntarily, but they are unlike reflexes in that they are learned.</li>
                            <li>A conditioned reflex -an automatic response that occurs as the result of previous experience.</li>
                            <li>A conditioned reflex involves little conscious thought or awareness on the part of the learner. E.g listening for thunder when you see lightning</li>
