                            <li>The word psychology comes from the roots 'psyche' and 'logos', which means knowledge and
                                study respectively.</li>
                            <li>Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes, behavior and the relationship
                                between them.</li>
                            <li>It's the social science of the human mind and it's interaction with the environment.
                            </li>
                            <li>It's not an absolute science because it deals with human thoughts, feelings and behavior
                                and as we are aware, humans are not always predictable and reliable.</li>
                            <li>Behavior means all that people do. Considers physical activities, attitudes and
                                emotional changes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We study behavior when we want to understand why the particular behavior occurs</p>
                        <p>People behave the way they do for various reasons. It may be learning, physical problems, or
                            psychological problems</p>

                        <h3>Historical background</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Psychology began as philosophy which entails attempting to understand behavior through
                                reasoning.</li>
                            <li>Philosophy is defined as the study of the mind.</li>
                            <li>Philosophy did not involve observations or experiments.</li>
                            <li>Behavior was explained through reasoning and arguments.</li>
                            <li>Socrates is known for questioning everything and supplying no answers.</li>
                            <li>Plato's student attempted to explain why people dream and how people operate</li>
                            <li>The Greeks were the first to define psychology as the study of the mind or the soul.
                            </li>
                            <li>Aristotle, a Greek philosopher thought that the highest form of reasoning and thinking
                                came from the heart.</li>
                            <li>But during the $19^{\text {m }}$ century Psychology became a science and an academic
                                discipline when people who wanted to learn more about human behavior and mental
                                processes</li>
                            <li>During this time a German scientist Wilhelm Wundt opened the first laboratory and
                                faculty of Psychology in the University of Leipzig in 1879 and established the first
                                Psychological Journal in 1881.</li>
                            <li>He was the first to apply the scientific method to the field.</li>
                            <li>His work focused on consciousness - or the awareness of immediate experience.</li>
                            <li>However, it applied the efforts of the scientific process in the same way physics or
                                chemistry would.</li>
                            <li>Later, one of his students G. Stanley Hall brought the science of psychology to America.
                            </li>
                            <li>He founded the American Psychological Association and became its first president.</li>
                            <li>He started America's first research laboratory at John's Hopkins University in 1883, and
                                published the first journal of psychology in America.</li>

                            <li>Describe - what is the nature of this behavior?</li>
                            <li>The first goal is to observe behavior and describe, often in as much detail as possible,
                                what was observed as objectively as possible.</li>
                            <li>Through describing the behavior of humans and other animals, we are able to understand
                                it and gain a better perspective on what is considered normal and abnormal.</li>
                            <li>Explain -why does it occur?</li>
                            <li>While descriptions come from observable data, psychologists must go beyond what is
                                obvious and explain their observations. In other words, why did the subject do what he
                                or she did?</li>
                            <li>Predict -</li>
                            <li>Another primary goal of psychology is to make predictions.</li>
                            <li>Once we know what happens, and why it happens, we can begin to speculate what will
                                happen in the future.</li>
                            <li>There's an old saying, which very often holds true: "the best predictor of future
                                behavior is past behavior."</li>
                            <li>Control -The fourth goal of psychology is to control, modify or change the existing
                                behavior. Influencing behavior in a helpful manner.</li>
                            <li>Once we know what happens, why it happens and what is likely to happen in the future, we
                                can expect control over it.</li>
                            <li>E.g, if your father was abusive, you are likely to choose an abusive partner, and can
                                therefore intervene to change this negative behavior</li>
                            <li>Improve -Not only do psychologists attempt to control behavior, they want to do so in a
                                positive manner, they want to improve a person's life, not make it worse. This is not
                                always the case, but it should always be the intention.</li>

                            <li>The first formal school of thought in Psychology,</li>
                            <li>Structuralists were led by Edward Titchner, one of Wundt students who believed that the
                                task of psychology was to analyze consciousness into its basic elements and study how
                                these were related. These elements would include ideas like sensations, emotions, and
                                images.</li>

                            <li>An early school of thought concerned with how humans and animals use mental processes in
                                adapting to their environment.</li>
                            <li>It was formed as a reaction to the theories of structuralism school of thought.</li>
                            <li>William James, one of the founders of functionalism, set out to explain why we think the
                                way we do.</li>
                            <li>He felt that psychology should have practical values and that psychologists should find
