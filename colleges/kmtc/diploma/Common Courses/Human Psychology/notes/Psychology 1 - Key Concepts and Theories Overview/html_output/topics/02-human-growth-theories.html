                        <p>Erik Erikson believed in the importance of early childhood. However, Erikson believed that personality development happens over the entire course of a person's life.In the early 1960s, Erikson proposed a theory that describes eight distinct stages of development.According to Erikson, in each stage people face new challenges and the stage's outcome depends on how people handle these challenges. These challenges are commonly referred to as crisis.Erikson named the stages according to these possible outcomes:</p>

                        <h4>Stage 1: Trust vs. Mistrust</h4>
                        <p>In the first year after birth, babies depend completely on adults for basic needs such as food, comfort, and warmth. If the caretakers meet these needs reliably, the babies become attached and develop a sense of security. Otherwise, they may develop a mistrustful, insecure attitude.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 2: Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt</h4>
                        <p>Between the ages of one and three, toddlers start to gain independence and learn skills such as toilet training, feeding themselves, and dressing themselves. Depending on how they face these challenges, toddlers can develop a sense of autonomy or a sense of doubt and shame about themselves.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 3: Initiative vs. Guilt</h4>
                        <p>Between the ages of three and six, children must learn to control their impulses and act in a socially responsible way. If they can do this effectively, children become more self- confident. If not, they may develop a strong sense of guilt.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 4: Industry vs. Inferiority</h4>
                        <p>Between the ages of six and twelve, children compete with peers in school and prepare to take on adult roles. They end this stage with either a sense of competence or a sense of inferiority.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 5: Identity vs. Role Confusion</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>During adolescence, which is the period between puberty and adulthood, children try to determine their identity and their direction in life.</li>
                            <li>Depending on their success, they either acquire a sense of identity or remain uncertain about their roles in life.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Stage 6: Intimacy vs. Isolation</h4>
                        <p>In young adulthood, people face the challenge of developing intimate relationships with others. If they do not succeed, they may become isolated and lonely.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 7: Generativity vs. Self-Absorption</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>As people reach middle adulthood, they work to become productive members of society, either through parenting or through their jobs.</li>
                            <li>If they fail, they become overly self-absorbed</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Stage 8: Integrity vs. Despair</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In old age, people examine their lives. They may either have a sense of contentment or be disappointed about their lives and fearful of the future.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Based on her research, she identified four major styles of attachment that children have to their parents or caregivers.</p>
                        <p>These are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Secure Attachment</li>
                            <li>Anxious-Resistant Insecure Attachment</li>
                            <li>Anxious-Avoidant Insecure Attachment</li>
                            <li>Disorganized/Disoriented Attachment:</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Secure Attachment:</h4>
                        <p>This happens when a child is very attached to the mother.</p>
                        <p>Usually this child will explore and engage with others when the mother is in the room, but, when the mother leaves, this child will show negative emotions.</p>
                        <p>When left alone with the stranger, the child will avoid him.</p>

                        <h4>Anxious-Resistant Insecure Attachment:</h4>
                        <p>This child becomes irritated when the stranger appears in the room, while mother is still near by and when mother leaves, the child cannot explore and continue play.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>He is very distressed. However, when mother comes back, child acts resentful and upset to the mother, he tries to move away from her.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Anxious-Avoidant Insecure Attachment:</h4>
                        <p>This child seems careless.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>He doesn't show much emotions whether mother is in the room or not.</li>
                            <li>He doesn't want to be played with or held. He acts the same with the stranger as well.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Disorganized/Disoriented Attachment:</h4>
                        <p>This child might be distressed when the mother leaves the room and be relieved when she comes back. However, the child may not want to be held or may show anger once the mother approaches.</p>
                        <p>He might hit or rock.</p>
                        <p>Further research revealed that more than half of the mothers with a child who fell into this category had suffered a trauma immediately before the birth of the child and had developed depression because of that trauma.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Kohlberg's theory includes three levels of moral reasoning. These are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Level 1: Pre-Conventional morality,</li>
                            <li>Level 2: Conventional Morality,</li>
                            <li>Level 3: Post-Conventional morality.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB:Each of these levels are further divided into two stages, making for a total of six stages</p>

                        <h3>Level 1 - Pre-Conventional</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It's the first level, in children between the ages of 4 and 10 years old.</li>
                            <li>This level consists of Stage 1 and Stage 2.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stage1:</strong> "orientation toward punishment and obedience." Children in this stage tend to obey rules only to avoid punishment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> "instrumental purpose and exchange." children's actions are based on consideration for what others can do for them. They follow rules simply out of selfinterest .</p>

                        <h3>Level 2 - Conventional</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The second level, achieved between ages 10 and 13 , though some individuals never move beyond this level.</li>
                            <li>This level includes Stage 3 and Stage 4.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stage 3 :</strong> "maintaining mutual relations, approval of others, and the golden rule."</p>
                        <p>children evaluate acts according to the motives behind them and can take circumstances into account. They want to help others, can judge the intentions of others, and can develop their own ideas regarding morality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 4 :</strong>"social concern and conscience."</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>At this stage, individuals are concerned with respecting authority, maintaining social order, and doing their duty within society.</li>
                            <li>In this stage, an act is considered wrong if it harms others or violates a rule or law.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Level 3 - Post-Conventional</h3>
                        <p>The final level, reached in early adolescence or young adulthood, though some never reach this level.</p>
                        <p>comprised of Stage 5 and Stage 6.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 5 :</strong>"morality of contract, of individual rights, and of democratically accepted law."Individuals value the will of the majority and the well-being of society.</p>
                        <p>Though individuals at this stage can recognize that there are times when human need and the law are conflicted, they believe that it is better if people simply follow the law.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stage 6:</strong>"morality of universal ethical principles." Individuals do what they think is right, even if it is in conflict with the law. They act according to their internalized standards of morality .</p>
                        <p>Because so few people attain Level 3, Kohlberg questioned the validity of this level, though he later proposed an additional seventh stage, which he described as the "cosmic" stage, in which individuals are able to consider the effect of their actions on the universe as a whole.</p>

                            <li>Gilligan challenged Kohlberg's claim that all moral reasoning is "justice reasoning."</li>
                            <li>Gilligan argued that women's moral judgments include feelings of compassion and empathy for others, as well as concern for commitments that arise out of relationships.</li>
                            <li>Women engage in "care reasoning," not "justice reasoning," and thus consider their own and other's responsibilities to be grounded in social context and interpersonal commitments.</li>
                            <li>According to Gilligan, the male voice emphasizes independence ("separation") and responsibility for oneself.</li>
                            <li>Whereas the female voice emphasizes interdependence ("connection") and responsibility to others.</li>
                            <li>Males are encouraged to be active agents, females to be passive recipients.</li>
                            <li>When faced with moral problems, males seek solutions that are just and fair; females seek solutions that are caring and compassionate.</li>
                            <li>For males, moral wrongness is linked to the violation of rights and justice; whereas for females, its linked to a failure to communicate and to respond.</li>
                            <li>For males, moral interactions take place primarily at the political and legal level, in the realm of abstract laws and social contracts; for females, moral interactions take place primarily at the level of personal relationships, in the family and the social network of the community in which they live.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Gilligan identified the following stages of moral development.</p>

                            <li>Level 1: Self-Oriented</li>

                        <h4>Level 1: Self-Oriented</h4>

                            <li>Focus is on the needs of oneself.</li>
                            <li>Survival of oneself is of sole concern.</li>
                            <li>The transition to level 2 begins with the recognition of the conflict between one's own needs and the needs of others (i.e., what one owes to oneself vs. what one owes to others).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Level 2: Other Oriented</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Focus is on the needs of others.</li>
                            <li>Self-adopts the traditional conception of feminine goodness, the maternal morality of self-sacrifice.</li>
                            <li>The good is equated with caring for others.</li>
                            <li>Consequently, one's own needs become devalued.</li>
                            <li>The transition to level 3 begins with the recognition that the self cannot be left out, but must also be an object of one's caring.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Level 3: Universal Oriented</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Focus is on the universal obligation of caring.</li>
                            <li>Care is a self-chosen principle that condemns exploitation, violence, and neglect and demands active response to suffering.</li>
                            <li>Caring for oneself and others is seen as intertwined because the self and others are recognized as interdependent.</li>
                            <li>Thus, all acts of caring are seen as beneficial to both self and others.</li>
