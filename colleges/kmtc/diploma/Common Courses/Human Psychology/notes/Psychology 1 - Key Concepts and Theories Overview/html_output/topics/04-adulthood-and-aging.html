                        <p>The aging process, although not obvious, begins.</p>
                        <p>Around the age of 30 , many changes begin to occur in different parts of the body.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>For example, the lens of the eye starts to stiffen and thicken, resulting in changes in vision (usually affecting the ability to focus on close objects).</li>
                            <li>Sensitivity to sound decreases; this happens twice as quickly for men as for women.</li>
                            <li>Hair can start to thin and become gray around the age of 35 , earlier for some individuals and later for others.</li>
                            <li>The skin becomes drier and wrinkles start to appear by the end of early adulthood.</li>
                            <li>The immune system becomes less proficient at fighting off illness, and reproductive capacity starts to decline.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Cognitive Development</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Cognitive changes over a person's lifespan, peak at around age 35 and slowly decline in later adulthood.</li>
                            <li>Because we spend so many years in adulthood (more than any other stage), cognitive changes are numerous during this period.</li>
                            <li>Research suggests that adult cognitive development is a complex, ever-changing process that may be even more active than cognitive development in infancy and early childhood (Fischer, Yan, & Stewart, 2003).</li>
                            <li>Our cognitive abilities remain relatively steady throughout early and middle adulthood.</li>
                            <li>Research has found that adults who engage in mentally and physically stimulating activities experience less cognitive decline in later adult years .</li>
                            <li>Have a reduced incidence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Beyond Piaget's Theory</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>According to Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, the establishment of formal operational thinking occurs during early adolescence and continues through adulthood.</li>
                            <li>This kind of thinking is characterized by the ability to think in abstract ways, engage in deductive reasoning and create hypothetical ideas to explain various concepts.</li>
                            <li>Since Piaget's theory, other developmental psychologists have suggested a fifth stage of cognitive development, known as <strong>postformal operational thinking</strong>.</li>
                            <li>In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and logic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts</li>
                            <li>This kind of thinking includes the ability to think in dialectics, and differentiates between the ways in which adults and adolescents are able to cognitively handle emotionally charged situations</li>
                            <li>Its a time of relativistic thinking, in which young people begin to become aware of more than simplistic views of right vs. wrong.</li>
                            <li>They begin to look at ideas and concepts from multiple angles and understand that a question can have more than one right (or wrong) answer.</li>
                            <li>The need for specialization results in <strong>pragmatic thinking</strong>-using logic to solve real-world problems while accepting contradiction, imperfection, and other issues.</li>
                            <li>Finally, young adults develop a sort of expertise in either education or career, which further enhances problem-solving skills and the capacity for creativity.</li>
                            <li>Physical maturation is complete, however height and weight may increase slightly.</li>
                            <li>Physical abilities are at their peak, i.e muscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning.</li>
                            <li>Most professional athletes are at the top of their game</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>the aging process becomes more apparent.</li>
                            <li>Around the age of 60 , the eyes lose their ability to adjust to objects at varying distances, known as presbyopia.</li>
                            <li>Most people between the ages of 40 and 60 will need some form of corrective lenses for vision deficits.</li>

                            <li>Women experience a gradual decline in fertility as they approach the onset of menopause-the end of the menstrual cycle-around 50 years old.</li>
                            <li>This process involves hormonal changes and may last anywhere from six months to five years.</li>
                            <li>Due to the shifting hormone levels, women going through menopause often experience a range of other symptoms, such as anxiety, poor memory, inability to concentrate, depressive mood, irritability, mood swings, and less interest in sexual activity. Among other physiological symptoms.</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Two forms of intelligence-crystallized and fluid-are the main focus of middle adulthood.</li>
                            <li>Our <strong>crystallized intelligence</strong> is dependent upon accumulated knowledge and experience-it is the information, skills, and strategies we have gathered throughout our lifetime.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This kind of intelligence tends to hold steady as we age-in fact, it may even improve. For example, adults show relatively stable to increasing scores on intelligence tests until their mid30s to mid-50s.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Fluid intelligence</strong>, on the other hand, is more dependent on basic information-processing skills and starts to decline even prior to middle adulthood.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cognitive processing speed slows down during this stage of life, as does the ability to solve problems and divide attention.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>However, practical problem-solving skills tend to increase. These skills are necessary to solve real-world problems and figure out how to best achieve a desired goal.</li>

                            <li>There are many theories about the social and emotional aspects of aging. Some aspects of healthy aging include activities, social connectedness, and the role of a person's culture.</li>
                            <li>According to many theorists, including George Vaillant (2002), who studied and analyzed over 50 years of data, we need to have and continue to find meaning throughout our lives.</li>
                            <li>For those in early and middle adulthood, meaning is often found through work (Sterns & Huyck, 2001) and family life .</li>
                            <li>These areas relate to the tasks that Erik Erikson referred to as generativity vs. stagnation and intimacy vs. isolation</li>

                            <li>Most adults identify themselves through their relationships with family-particularly with spouses, children, and parents.</li>
                            <li>While raising children can be stressful, especially when they are young, research suggests that parents reap the rewards down the road, as adult children tend to have a positive effect on parental well-being .</li>
                            <li>Having stable intimate relationships has also been found to contribute to well-being throughout adulthood.</li>
                            <li>A lack of positive and meaningful relationships during adulthood can result in what Erikson termed the crisis of intimacy vs. isolation in his theory of psychosocial development.</li>
                            <li>In young adulthood (i.e., 20s and early 30s), people tend to be concerned with forming meaningful relationships.</li>

                            <li>often revolves around the challenges that arise from young adults newly living life on their own and feeling overwhelmed with new responsibilities;</li>
                            <li>Can also happen after the birth of a child or if a person graduates from college and cannot find a job in their chosen field.</li>
                            <li>In this stage of life, young people may worry about their future, wonder if they've made poor choices, or wonder what life might hold for them now.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Mid-life crisis:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The main triggers for a mid-life crisis include problems with work, trouble in a marriage, children growing up and leaving the home, or the aging or death of a person's parents.</li>
                            <li>This is likely to occur during Erikson's stage of generatively vs. stagnation, a time when people think about the contribution they are making to the world.</li>
                            <li>Generatively involves finding one's life's work and contributing to the development of others through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and raising children;</li>
                            <li>those who do not master this task may experience a feeling of stagnation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Individuals having a mid-life crisis may experience some of the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A search for an undefined dream or goal;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Some who experience a quarter- or mid-life crisis struggle with how to cope and may engage in harmful behaviors, such as abuse of alcohol or drugs or excessive spending of money.</li>
                            <li>Others may experiment with different aspects of their personality, explore new hobbies, or otherwise seek out change in their lives</li>
                            <li>Many adults find meaning in and define themselves by what they do-their careers.</li>
                            <li>Earnings peak for many during adulthood.</li>
                            <li>However research has found that job satisfaction is more closely tied to work that involves contact with other people, is interesting, provides opportunities for advancement, and allows some independence than it is to salary.</li>

                        <h3>Levinger's Model of Relationships</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>One of the most influential models of relationship development was proposed by psychologist George Levinger.</li>
                            <li>The model was formulated to describe heterosexual, adult romantic relationships, but it has been applied to other kinds of interpersonal relationships since then.</li>
                            <li>According to the model, the natural development of a relationship follows five stages:</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Acquaintance and Acquaintanceship:</strong> Becoming acquainted depends on previous relationships, physical proximity, first impressions, and a variety of other factors. If two people begin to like each other, continued interactions may lead to the next stage, but acquaintance can continue indefinitely. Another example is association.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buildup:</strong> During this stage, people begin to trust and care about each other. The need for intimacy, compatibility, and such filtering agents as common background and goals will influence whether or not interaction continues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuation:</strong> This stage follows a mutual commitment to strong and close long-term friendships, romantic relationship, or even marriage. It is generally a long, relatively stable period. Nevertheless, continued growth and development will occur during this time. Mutual trust is important for sustaining the relationship.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deterioration:</strong> Not all relationships deteriorate, but those that do tend to show signs of trouble. Boredom, resentment, and dissatisfaction may occur. Individuals may communicate less and avoid selfdisclosure. Loss of trust and betrayals may take place as the downward spiral continues, eventually ending the relationship. Alternately, the participants may find some way to resolve the problems and reestablish trust.</li>
                            <li><strong>Termination:</strong> The final stage marks the end of the relationship, either by breakup, death, or spatial separation and severing all existing ties of either friendship or romantic love.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Knapp's theory of Relational Development</h3>
                        <p>Another theory, developed by M. L. Knapp, known as the model of relational development. It consists of two main stages, each with several parts.</p>

                        <h4>Coming Together</h4>
                        <p>Coming together consists of five phases:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Initiating:</strong> first impressions are made; physical factors play a large role in this phase. People often want to portray themselves as easy to talk to, friendly, and open to discussion. This phase tends to be superficial as people are trying to make a good first impression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> the two people attempt to find some common ground between each other's lives, such as common interests and hobbies. People start to open up more and ask more personal questions as they get to know one another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intensifying:</strong> people open themselves up fully in the hope of being accepted by the potential mate. During this phase, people may reveal secrets about themselves or others in order to test the trust level of potential partners</li>
                            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> involves people merging their lives together and solidifying a relationship status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> people recognize a commitment to one another (traditionally through marriage, though many alternative forms of commitment exist) and the relationship lasts until death, breakup, or divorce.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Coming Apart</h4>
                        <p>Coming apart consists of five stages:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Differentiating:</strong> involves focusing more on differences rather than similarities. This can lead to an increasing emotional distance between the parties involved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Circumscribing:</strong> the primary focus of the relationship shifts from differences to setting limits and boundaries on communication between the two people. This further pushes two people apart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stagnation:</strong> is when two people have reached a "stand-off" phase-nothing changes and neither party is willing to change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> occurs when people engage in limited communication and take steps to distance themselves from one another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Termination:</strong> the relationship is ended.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Changes in the Brain</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The aging process results in changes and lower functioning in the brain.</li>
                            <li>This leads to problems like memory loss and decreased intellectual function. Age is a major risk factor for most common neurodegenerative diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Lou Gehrig's disease.</li>
                            <li>Molecular changes are due in part to a reduction in the size of the brain, as well as loss of brain plasticity.</li>
                            <li>Brain plasticity is the brain's ability to change structure and function.</li>
                            <li>The brain's main function is to decide what information is worth keeping and what is not; if there is an action or a thought that a person is not using, the brain will eliminate space for it.</li>
                            <li>Brain size and composition change along with brain function.</li>
                            <li>Computed tomography (CT) studies have found that the cerebral ventricles expand as a function of age in a process known as ventriculomegaly.</li>
                            <li>More recent MRI studies have reported age-related regional decreases in cerebral volume.</li>
                            <li>The brain begins to lose neurons in later adult years;</li>
                            <li>The loss of neurons within the cerebral cortex occurs at different rates, with some areas losing neurons more quickly than others.</li>
                            <li>The frontal lobe (which is responsible for the integration of information, judgment, and reflective thought) and corpus callosum tend to lose neurons faster than other areas, such as the temporal and occipital lobes.</li>
                            <li>The cerebellum , which is responsible for balance and coordination, eventually loses about 25 percent of its neurons as well.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Cognitive development</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A general decline in memory is very common, due to the decrease in speed of encoding, storage, and retrieval of information.</li>
                            <li>This can cause problems with short-term memory retention and with the ability to learn new information.</li>
                            <li>In most cases, this absent-mindedness should be considered a natural part of growing older rather than a psychological or neurological disorder.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Changes in Memory</h3>
                        <p>Memory also degenerates with age, and older adults tend to have a harder time remembering and attending to information. In general, an older person's procedural memory stays the same, while working memory declines.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Procedural memory</strong> is memory for the performance of particular types of action; it guides the processes we perform and most frequently resides below the level of conscious awareness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Working memory</strong> is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind where they can be manipulated. The reduced capacity of the working memory becomes evident when tasks are especially complex.</li>
                            <li><strong>Semantic memory</strong> is the memory of understanding things, of the meaning of things and events, and other concept-based knowledge.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This type of memory underlies the conscious recollection of factual information and general knowledge about the world, and remains relatively stable throughout life.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>a broad category of brain diseases that cause a gradual long-term decrease in the ability to think and remember to the extent that a person's daily functioning is affected.</li>
                            <li>While the term "dementia" is still often used in lay situations, in the DSM-5 it has been renamed "neurocognitive disorder," with various degrees of severity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Neurocognitive disorders</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Neurocognitive disorders most commonly affect memory, visual-spatial ability, language, attention, and executive functions(e.g., judgment and problem-solving).</li>
                            <li>Most of these disorders are slow and progressive; by the time a person shows signs of the disease, the changes in their brain have already been happening for a long time.</li>
                            <li>About $10 \%$ of people with dementia have what is known as mixed dementia, which is usually a combination of Alzheimer's disease and another type of dementia.</li>
                            <li>Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of neurocognitive disorder, accounting for $50 \%$ to $70 \%$ of cases.</li>
                            <li>There is no cure for dementia, but for people who suffer from these disorders and for their caregivers, many measures can be taken to improve their lives.</li>
                            <li>These can include education and support for the caregiver and daily exercise programs or cognitive or behavioral therapies for the person with the disorder.</li>

                            <li>Many elderly people need assistance in meeting daily needs as they age, and over time they may become dependent on caregivers such as family members, relatives, friends, health professionals, or employees of senior housing or nursing care.</li>
                            <li>Many older adults spend their later years in assisted living facilities or nursing homes, which can have social and emotional impacts on their well-being.(Developed Countries)</li>
                            <li>Older adults may struggle with feelings of guilt, shame, or depression because of their increased dependency, especially in societies where caring for the elderly is viewed as a burden.</li>
                            <li>If an elderly person has to move away from friends, community, their home, or other familiar aspects of their life in order to enter a nursing home, they may experience isolation, depression, or loneliness.</li>
                            <li>Increased dependency can also put older adults at risk of elder abuse.</li>
                            <li>This kind of abuse occurs when a caretaker intentionally deprives an older person of care or harms the person in their charge.</li>
                            <li>The elderly may be subject to many different types of abuse, including physical, emotional, or psychological.</li>
                            <li>Approximately one in ten older adults report being abused, and this number rises in the cases of dementia or physical limitations.</li>
                            <li>Despite the increasing physical challenges of old age, many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves and accomplish activities of daily living (ADL).</li>
                            <li>Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (preventing the person from getting tired in the shower and falling), bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed), and ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).</li>
                            <li>Advances in this kind of technology offer increasing options for the elderly to continue functioning independently later into their lives.</li>

                            <li>A central aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support. As we get older, Socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number, but remain as close as, if not closer than, in our earlier years (Carstensen, 1992)..</li>
                            <li>Many older adults contend with feelings of loneliness as their loves ones, partners, or friends pass away or as their children or other family members move away and live their own lives.</li>
                            <li>Loneliness and isolation can have detrimental effects on health and psychological well-being.</li>
                            <li>Many adults counteract loneliness by having active social lives, living in retirement communities, or participating in positive hobbies. Staying active and involved in life counteracts loneliness and helps increase feelings of self-esteem and selfworth.</li>

                        <p>Kübler-Ross (1969), who worked with the founders of hospice care, described in her theory of grief the process of an individual accepting their own death. She proposed five stages of grief in what became known as the Kübler-Ross model: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.</p>

                        <h3>Kübler-Ross model</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Denial:</strong> People believe there must be some mistake. They pretend death isn't happening, perhaps live life as if nothing is wrong, or even tell people things are fine. Underneath this facade, however, is a great deal of fear and other emotions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger:</strong> After people start to realize death is imminent, they become angry. They believe life is unfair and usually blame others (such as a higher power or doctors) for the state of being they are experiencing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bargaining:</strong> Once anger subsides, fear sets in again. Now, however, people plead with life or a higher power to give them more time, to let them accomplish just one more goal, or for some other request.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> The realization that death is near sets in, and people become extremely sad. They may isolate themselves, contemplate suicide, or otherwise refuse to live life. Motivation is gone and the will to live disappears.</li>
