                            <li>To psychologists, intelligence is the capacity to understand the world, think rationally, and use resources effectively when faced with challenges (Wechsler, 1975).</li>
                            <li>Psychologists who study intelligence have focused much of their attention on the development of intelligence tests, and have relied on such tests to identify a person's level of intelligence. These tests have proven to be of great benefit in identifying students in need of special attention in school, in diagnosing cognitive difficulties, and in helping people make optimal educational and vocational choices. At the same time, their use has proven quite controversial, raising important social and educational issues.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Mental age:</strong> The average age of individuals who achieve a particular level of performance on a test</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronological age:</strong> Physical age</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The forerunner of the modern IQ test was based on an uncomplicated, but completely wrong, assumption: that the size and shape of a person's head could be used as an objective measure of intelligence. The idea was put forward by Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), an eminent English scientist whose ideas in other domains proved to be considerably better than his notions about intelligence.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Galton's motivation to identify people of high intelligence stemmed from his prejudices. He sought to demonstrate the natural superiority of people of high social class (of which he was one) by showing that intelligence was inherited. He hypothesized that head configuration, being genetically determined, was related to brain size, and therefore related to intelligence.</li>
                            <li>Galton's theories proved wrong on virtually every count. Head size and shape were not related to intellectual performance, and subsequent research has found little relationship between brain size and intelligence. However, Galton's work did have at least one desirable result: He was the first person to suggest that intelligence could be quantified and measured in an objective manner.</li>
                            <li>Following Galton's efforts, the first intelligence tests were developed by Alfred Binet (1857-1911). His tests followed a simple premise: If performance on certain tasks or test items improved with chronological, or physical, age, then performance could be used to distinguish more intelligent people from less intelligent ones within a particular age group. Using this principle, Binet, a French psychologist, devised the first formal intelligence test, which was designed to identify the "dullest" students in the Paris school system in order to provide them with remedial aid.</li>
                            <li>On the basis of the Binet test, children were assigned a score relating to their mental age, the average age of individuals who achieve a particular level of performance on a test. For example, if the average 8 -year-old answered, say, 45 items correct on a test, anyone who answered 45 items correct would be assigned a mental age of 8 years. Consequently, whether the person taking the test was 20 years old or 5 years old, each would have the same mental age of 8 years.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Assigning a mental age to students provided an indication of their general level of performance. However, it did not allow for adequate comparisons among people of different chronological ages. By using mental age alone, for instance, we might assume that a 20 -year-old responding at a 18 -year-old's level would be as bright as a 5 -year-old answering at a 3 -yearold's level, when actually the 5 -year-old would be displaying a much greater relative degree of slowness.</p>
                        
                        <p>A solution to the problem came in the form of the intelligence quotient, or IQ, a score that takes into account an individual's mental and chronological ages. To calculate an IQ score, the following formula is used, in which MA stands for mental age and CA for chronological age:</p>
                        <p>Although the basic principles behind the calculation of an IQ score still hold, IQ scores actually are figured in a different manner today and are known as deviation IQ scores. First, the average test score for everyone of the same age who takes the test is determined, and this average score is assigned an IQ of 100. Then, with the aid of statistical techniques that calculate the differences (or "deviations") between each score and the average, IQ scores are assigned.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Remnants of Binet's original intelligence test are still with us, although it has been revised in significant ways. Now in its fourth edition and called the Stanford-Binet IV, the test consists of a series of items that vary in nature according to the age of the person being tested (Hagen, Sattler, & Thorndike, 1985; Thorndike, Hagan, & Sattler, 1986). For example, young children are asked to copy figures or answer questions about everyday activities. Older people are asked to solve analogies, explain proverbs, and describe similarities that underlie sets of words.</li>
                            <li>By examining the pattern of correct and incorrect responses, the examiner is able to compute an IQ score for the person being tested. In addition, the Stanford Binet provides separate subscores, providing clues to a test-taker's particular strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                            <li>The IQ test most frequently used in the United States was devised by psychologist David Wechsler and is known as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, or, more commonly, the WAIS-III. There is also a children's version, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III, or WISC-III. Both the WAIS-III and the WISC-III have two major parts: a verbal scale and a performance (or nonverbal) scale. The two scales include questions of very different types. Verbal tasks consist of more traditional kinds of problems, including vocabulary definition and comprehension of various concepts. In contrast, the performance (nonverbal) part involves the timed assembly of small objects and arranging pictures in a logical order. Although an individual's scores on the verbal and performance sections of the test are generally within close range of each other, the scores of a person with a language deficiency or a background of severe environmental deprivation may show a relatively large discrepancy between the two scores. By providing separate scores, the WAIS-III and WISC-III give a more precise picture of a person's specific abilities than other IQ tests (Kaufman & Lichtenberger, 1999).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Achievement and Aptitude Tests</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An <strong>achievement test</strong> is a test designed to determine a person's level of knowledge in a given subject area. Rather than measuring general ability, as an intelligence test does, an achievement test concentrates on the specific material that a person has learned. High school students sometimes take specialized achievement tests in particular areas such as world history or chemistry as a college entrance requirement; lawyers must pass an achievement test (in the form of the bar exam) in order to practice law.</li>
                            <li>An <strong>aptitude test</strong> is designed to predict a person's ability in a particular area or line of work. Most of us take one of the best-known aptitude tests in the process of pursuing admission to college: the SAT(Scholastic Achievement Test). The SAT is meant to predict how well people will do in college, and the scores have proven over the years to be moderately correlated with college grades.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Reliability and Validity</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In the same way, we hope that psychological tests have <strong>reliability</strong>-that they measure consistently what they are trying to measure. We need to be sure that each time we administer the test, a test-taker will achieve the same resultsassuming that nothing about the person has changed relevant to what is being measured. A test has <strong>validity</strong> when it actually measures what it is supposed to measure. Knowing that a test is reliable is no guarantee that it is also valid. For instance, Sir Francis Galton assumed that skull size was related to intelligence, and he was able to measure skull size with great reliability. However, the measure of skull size was not valid-it had nothing to do with intelligence. In this case, then, we have reliability without validity. In Canada, the Nelson-Denny reading test and a working memory test were the best predictors of SAT scores (Daneman and Hanon, 2001).</li>
                            <li>On the other hand, if a test is unreliable, it cannot be valid.</li>
                            <li>Test validity and reliability are prerequisites for accurate assessment of intelligence-as well as for any other measurement task carried out by psychologists.</li>
                            <li>Assuming that a test is both valid and reliable, one further step is necessary in order to interpret the meaning of a particular test-taker's score: the establishment of norms. Norms are standards of test performance that permit the comparison of one person's score on the test to the scores of others who have taken the same test. For example, a norm permits test-takers to know that they have scored, say, in the top 15 percent of those who have taken the test previously. Tests for which norms have been developed are known as standardized tests.</li>
                            <li>There is now a computerized version of the SAT. Using adaptive testing, the computer will generate easier or more difficult questions depending on the test-takers answers on the previous questions.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>One central question addressed by researchers is whether intelligence is a single, unitary factor, or whether it is made up of multiple components. Early psychologists interested in intelligence assumed that there was a single, general factor for mental ability, which they called <strong>g</strong>, or <strong>g-factor</strong> (Spearman, 1927). This general intelligence factor was thought to underlie performance on every aspect of intelligence, and it was the g -factor that was presumably being measured on tests of intelligence (Jensen, 1998; Mackintosh, 1998).</li>
                            <li><strong>Fluid and crystallized intelligence.</strong> More recently, some psychologists have suggested that there are really two different kinds of intelligence: fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence (Cattell, 1967, 1987). Fluid intelligence reflects information processing capabilities, reasoning, and memory. If we were asked to solve an analogy, group a series of letters according to some criterion, or to remember a set of numbers, we would be using fluid intelligence.</li>
                            <li>In contrast, crystallized intelligence is the accumulation of information, skills, and strategies that people have learned through experience and that they can apply in problem-solving situations. We would be likely to rely on crystallized intelligence, for instance, if we were asked to participate in a discussion about the solution to the causes of poverty, a task that allows us to draw upon our own past experiences and knowledge of the world. The differences between fluid and crystallized intelligence become particularly evident in the elderly, who-as we will discuss further in Chapter 10-show declines in fluid, but not crystallized, intelligence (Schaie, 1993, 1994; Schretlen, 2000).</li>
                            <li>In his consideration of intelligence, psychologist Howard Gardner has taken a very different approach from traditional thinking about the topic. Gardner argues that rather than asking "How smart are you," we should be asking a different question: "How are you smart?" In answering the latter question, Gardner has developed a theory of multiple intelligences that has become quite influential (Chen & Gardner, 1997).</li>
                            <li>Gardner argues that we have eight different forms of intelligence (described in Figure 7-11), each relatively independent of the others. He suggests that each of the multiple intelligences is linked to an independent system in the brain (Gardner, 1997, 1999).</li>
                            <li>Although Gardner illustrates his conception of the specific types of intelligence with descriptions of well-known people, each of us has the same eight kinds of intelligence, although in different degrees. Moreover, although the eight are presented individually, Gardner suggests that these separate intelligences do not operate in isolation. Normally, any activity encompasses several kinds of intelligence working together.</li>
                            <li>Gardner's theory has led to the development of intelligence tests that include questions in which more than one answer can be correct, providing the opportunity for test takers to demonstrate creative thinking. These tests are based on the idea that different kinds of intelligence may produce different-but equally valid-responses to the same question.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Information Processing Intelligence?</h3>
                        <p>Cognitive psychologists believe intelligence is indicated by how information is processed:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The processes used to produce intelligent behaviour</li>
                            <li>Encoding, identifying parts of problems, etc</li>
                            <li>The speed of processing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Practical Intelligence</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Practical intelligence is intelligence related to overall success in living</li>
                            <li>Noting that traditional tests were designed to relate to academic success, Sternberg points to evidence showing that IQ does not relate particularly well to career success</li>
                            <li>Sternberg argues that career success requires a very different type of intelligence from academic success. Whereas academic success is based on knowledge of a particular information base obtained from reading and listening, practical intelligence is learned mainly through observation of others' behaviour. People who are high in practical intelligence are able to learn general norms and principles and apply them appropriately. See Figure 7-12.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Emotional intelligence is the set of skills that underlie the accurate assessment, evaluation, expression, and regulation of emotions (Goleman, 1995; Mayer & Salovey, 1997; Salovey & Sluyter, 1997).</li>
                            <li>According to psychologist Daniel Goleman (1995), emotional intelligence underlies the ability to get along well with others. It provides us with the understanding of what other people are feeling and experiencing, and permits us to respond appropriately to others' needs. Emotional intelligence is the basis of empathy for others, self-awareness, and social skills.</li>
                            <li>Canadian Steven Stein distinguishes intrapersonal aspects (being emotionally self-aware) of emotional intelligence from interpersonal aspects (recognizing emotions in others (Stein & Book, 2000)).</li>
                            <li>Abilities in emotional intelligence may help explain why people with only modest IQ scores can be quite successful, despite their lack of traditional intelligence. High emotional intelligence may enable an individual to tune into others' feelings, permitting a high degree of responsiveness to others.</li>

                            <li>Although sometimes thought of as a rare phenomenon, mental retardation occurs in 1 to 3 percent of the population. There is wide variation among those labeled as mentally retarded, in large part because of the inclusiveness of the definition developed by the American Association on Mental Retardation. The association suggests that mental retardation exists when there is significantly below-average intellectual functioning, plus limitations in at least two areas of adaptive functioning involving communication skills, self-care, ability to live independently, social skills, community involvement, self direction, health and safety, academics, or leisure and work (AAMR, 1992; Burack, Hodapp, & Zigler, 1998).</li>
                            <li>In Canada, mental retardation is now referred to as intellectual disability or developmental disability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intellectual disability</strong> refers to who have mild deficits (poor daily living and social skills, but functional reading and mathematics skills). These are most biological in origin (Down Syndrome, FAS, lack of oxygen at birth)</li>
                            <li><strong>Developmental disability</strong> refers to those who have profound disability (moderate to severe intellectual deficits as well as physical challenges.</li>
                            <li>While below average intellectual functioning can be measured in a relatively straightforward manner-using standard IQ tests-it is more difficult to determine how to gauge limitations in particular adaptive skill areas. Ultimately, this imprecision leads to a lack of uniformity in how experts apply the label of "mental retardation." Furthermore, it has resulted in significant variation in the abilities of people who are categorized as mentally retarded, ranging from those who can be taught to work and function with little special attention, to those who virtually cannot be trained and must receive institutional treatment throughout their lives (Durkin & Stein, 1996; Negrin & Capute, 1996; Detterman, Gabriel, & Ruthsatz, 2000).</li>

                        <h3>Identifying Roots of Mental Retardation</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In most of Canada and the USA, legislation supports mainstreaming which is the full integration of individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities into regular classrooms. This was in part to remove the isolation and stigma experienced in special education classes.</li>
                            <li>The most common biological cause of retardation is <strong>Down syndrome</strong>. Down syndrome occurs due to the presence of an extra chromosome. In other cases of mental retardation, an abnormality occurs in the structure of a chromosome. Birth complications, such as a temporary lack of oxygen, may also cause retardation (Simonoff, Bolton, & Rutter, 1996; Selikowitz, 1997).</li>
                            <li>The majority of cases of mental retardation are classified as <strong>familial retardation</strong>, in which no known biological defect exists, but there is a history of retardation within the family. Whether the family background of retardation is caused by environmental factors, such as extreme continuous poverty leading to malnutrition, or by some underlying genetic factor, is usually impossible to determine.</li>
                            <li>Regardless of the cause of mental retardation, important advances in the care and treatment of those with retardation have been made in the last several decades. In this USA federal law, Congress ruled that people with retardation are entitled to a full education and that they must be educated and trained in the least restrictive environment. The law increased the educational opportunities for individuals with mental retardation, facilitating their integration into regular classrooms as much as possible-a process known as mainstreaming (Hocutt, 1996; Lloyd, Kameenui, & Chard, 1997).</li>
                            <li>Mandatory legislation was in place in Saskatchewan in 1971, Nova Scotia in 1973 and in Ontario in 1980. This legislation supported mainstreaming which is the full integration of individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities into regular classrooms. This was in part to remove the isolation and stigma experienced in special education classes. Regular classrooms will improve their educational opportunities, increase their social acceptance, and facilitate their integration into society.</li>

                        <h3>Intellectually Gifted</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Composing 2 to 4 percent of the population, the intellectually gifted have IQ scores greater than 130 .</li>
                            <li>Although the stereotype associated with the gifted suggests that they are awkward, shy, social misfits unable to get along well with peers, most research indicates that just the opposite is true. The intellectually gifted are most often outgoing, well-adjusted, popular people who are able to do most things better than the average person</li>
                            <li>For example, in a long-term study by psychologist Lewis Terman that started in the early 1920s and is still going on, 1500 children who had IQ scores above 140 were followed and examined periodically over the next sixty years ( Terman & Oden, 1947; Sears, 1977). From the start, members of this group were more physically, academically, and socially capable than their nongifted peers. They were generally healthier, taller, heavier, and stronger than average. Not surprisingly, they did better in school as well. They also showed better social adjustment than average. And all these advantages paid off in terms of career success: As a group, the gifted received more awards and distinctions, earned higher incomes, and made more contributions in art and literature than typical individuals.</li>
                            <li>Of course, not every member of the group Terman studied was successful. Furthermore, high intelligence is not a homogeneous quality; a person with a high overall IQ is not necessarily gifted in every academic subject, but may excel in just one or two. A high IQ, then, is no universal guarantee of success (Shurkin, 1992; Winner, 2000).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Individual Differences in Intelligence</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In an attempt to produce a culture-fair IQ test, one that does not discriminate against members of any minority group, psychologists have tried to devise test items that assess experiences common to all cultures or emphasize questions that do not require language usage. However, test makers have found this difficult to do, because past experiences, attitudes, and values almost always have an impact on respondents' answers.</li>
                            <li>Members of certain racial and cultural groups consistently score lower on traditional intelligence test than members of other groups (MacKenzie, 1984; Humphreys, 1992). Blacks tend to average 10-15 IQ points lower than whites. To combat this with the Cree of James Bay, Mawhinney and collaborators from the Cree people developed the Cree Picture Vocabulary Test (Mawhinney, 1983).</li>
                            <li>The efforts of psychologists to produce culture-fair measures of intelligence relate to a lingering controversy over differences in intelligence between members of minority and majority groups. In attempting to identify whether there are differences between such groups, psychologists have had to confront the broader issue of determining the relative contribution to intelligence of genetic factors (heredity) and experience (environment)-the nature-nurture issue that we first discussed in Chapter 1</li>
                            <li>Richard Herrnstein, a psychologist, and Charles Murray, a sociologist, fanned the flames of the debate with the publication of their book, <em>The Bell Curve</em>, in the mid-1990s. They argued that an analysis of IQ differences between whites and blacks demonstrated that, although environmental factors played a role, there were also basic genetic differences between the two races.</li>
                            <li>Figure 7-13 indicates that Intelligence in general shows a high degree of heritability, a measure of the degree to which a characteristic is related to genetic, inherited factors.</li>
                            <li>However, many psychologists reacted strongly to the arguments laid out in <em>The Bell Curve</em>, refuting several of the book's contentions. For one thing, even when attempts are made to hold socioeconomic conditions constant, wide variations remain among individual households. Furthermore, no one can convincingly assert that living conditions of blacks and whites are identical even when their socioeconomic status is similar.</li>
                            <li>It is also crucial to remember that IQ scores and intelligence have greatest relevance in terms of individuals, not groups. In fact, considering group racial differences presents some conceptually troublesome distinctions. Consequently, drawing comparisons between different races on any dimension, including IQ scores, is an imprecise, potentially misleading, and often fruitless venture. By far, the greatest discrepancies in IQ scores occur when comparing individuals, and not when comparing mean IQ scores of different groups.</li>
                            <li>Other issues make the heredity-versus-environment debate somewhat irrelevant to practical concerns. For example, as we discussed earlier, there are multiple kinds of intelligence, and traditional IQ scores do not tap many of them.</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, IQ scores are often inadequate predictors of ultimate occupational success.</li>
                            <li>IQs have been steadily improving since 1920s. This may be due to better nutrition, better parenting, improved education, improved social environment, increased skills related to technological changes or some combination of these factors.</li>
