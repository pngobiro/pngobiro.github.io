                            <li>Our ability to make sense out of nonsense, if the nonsense follows typical rules of language, illustrates both the sophistication of human language capabilities and the complexity of the cognitive processes that underlie the development and use of language. The use of language-the communication of information through symbols arranged according to systematic rules-clearly represents an important cognitive ability, one that is indispensable for communicating with others. Not only is language central to communication, it is also closely tied to the very way in which we think about and understand the world, for there is a crucial link between thought and language. It is not surprising, then, that psychologists have devoted considerable attention to studying the topic of language (Forrester, 1996; Velichkovsky & Rumbaugh, 1996; Barrett, 1999; Owens, 2000).</li>
                            <li><strong>Syntax</strong> refers to the rules that indicate how words and phrases can be combined to form sentences. Every language has intricate rules that guide the order in which words may be strung together to communicate meaning. English speakers have no difficulty recognizing that "Radio down the turn" is not an appropriate sequence, while "Turn down the radio" is. The importance of appropriate syntax is demonstrated in English by the changes in meaning that are caused by the different word orders in the following three utterances: "John kidnapped the boy," "John, the kidnapped boy," and "The boy kidnapped John" (Lasnik, 1990).</li>
                            <li>The third major component of language is <strong>semantics</strong>. Semantics refers to the rules governing the meaning of words and sentences (Larson, 1990; Hipkiss, 1995; O'Grady & Dobrovolsky, 1996). Semantic rules allow us to use words to convey the subtlest of nuances. For instance, we are able to make the distinction between "The truck hit Laura"</li>

                            <li>Children <strong>babble</strong>-make speechlike but meaningless sounds-from around the age of 3 months through 1 year. While they babble they may produce, at one time or another, any of the sounds found in all languages, not just the one to which they are exposed.</li>
                            <li>Babbling increasingly reflects the specific language that is being spoken in an infant's environment, initially in terms of pitch and tone, and eventually in terms of specific sounds. Some theorists suggest there is a critical period for language development early in life, in which a child is particularly sensitive to language cues and during which language is most easily acquired.</li>
                            <li>By the time the child is approximately 1 year old, sounds that are not in the language to which the infant is exposed disappear. It is then a short step to the production of actual words. In English, these are typically short words that start with a consonant such as "b," "d," "m," "p," or "t". Of course, even before they produce their first words, children are capable of understanding a fair amount of the language they hear.</li>
                            <li>After the age of 1 year, children begin to learn more complicated forms of language. They produce two-word combinations, which become the building blocks of sentences, and the number of different words they are capable of using increases sharply. By the age of 2 years, the average child has a vocabulary of more than fifty words. Just six months later, that vocabulary has grown to several hundred words. At that time, children can produce short sentences, although they use <strong>telegraphic speech</strong>-sentences that sound as if they were part of a telegram, in which words not critical to the message are left out. Rather than saying, "I showed you the book," a child using telegraphic speech might say, "I show book"</li>
                            <li>By age 3, children learn to make plurals by adding "s" to nouns and to form the past tense by adding "ed" to verbs. This ability also leads to errors, since children tend to apply rules too inflexibly. This phenomenon is known as <strong>overgeneralization</strong>, whereby children apply rules even when the application results in an error. Thus, although it is correct to say "he walked" for the past tense of "walk," the "ed" rule doesn't work quite so well when children say "he runned" for the past tense of "run" (Marcus, 1996)</li>

                            <li><strong>Noam Chomsky</strong> (1968, 1978, 1991), a linguist argued that humans are born with an innate linguistic capability that emerges primarily as a function of maturation. According to his analysis, all the world's languages even for deaf children, share a similar underlying structure. Chomsky suggests that the human brain has a neural system, the <strong>language-acquisition device</strong>, that both permits the understanding of the structure of language and provides strategies and techniques for learning the unique characteristics of a given native language.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>learning-theory approach</strong> suggests that language acquisition follows the principles of reinforcement and conditioning discussed in Chapter 5. For example, a child who utters the word "mama" is hugged and praised by her mother, which reinforces the behaviour and makes its repetition more likely. This view suggests that children first learn to speak by being rewarded for making sounds that approximate speech. Ultimately, through a process of shaping, language becomes more and more like adult speech (Skinner, 1957).</li>
                            <li>Canada has two official languages but there are many languages spoken by Canadians. Bilinguals have distinct advantages compared to monolinguals. See Exploring Diversity and Pathways Through Psychology sections.</li>
                            <li>The learning theory approach is less successful when it comes to explaining the acquisition of language rules. Children are reinforced not only when they use proper language, but also when they respond incorrectly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Canadian teachers have used the whole language approach, the basic skills approach, or a combination of the two.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The <strong>whole language approach</strong> stresses the use of whole and meaningful materials. This 'top-down' processing means that children develop a story orally. Then the teacher prints the story and they read it.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>basic skills approach</strong> emphasizes the recognition of words in isolation. This 'bottom-up' processing means that the children learn the rules, the sound units into words and then the words into sentences.</li>
                            <li>Research by Betty Ann Levy, McMaster University indicates both basic skills and whole language approaches contribute to reading acquisition.</li>
                            <li>Levy and Lysynchuk (1997) instructed one group of beginning readers in the acquisition of an initial word set using whole language approach. They instructed a second group using the basic skills approach. They found that word set was learned more quickly and accurately by readers instructed by the basic skills approach than by the whole language approach. Also, they found that the thoroughness by which the children learned the word set determined how well they read new words. Single word practice enabled the children to read stories with these words more quickly and with better comprehension.</li>
