\section*{HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY.}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY.}

\section*{What is psychology?}

According to the American psychological association, psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior.

It is the study of the mind how it works, and how it affects behavior.

\section*{Historical background.}

Psychology started around thousands years ago in ancient Greece, Egypt, India, Persia and China.

In 387BCE Plato suggested that the brain is where mental process takes place while in 335BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.

It is said that the first hospitals were set up Islamic doctors during the medieval times whereby Avicenna who was the famous Muslim doctor studied and treated epilepsy, nightmares and poor memory.

The first patient with mental problems was released from confinement by Philippe Pinel in 1793 a move that signaled a step towards human treatment.

1879 Wilhelm Wundt- who is known as the father of psychology from Germany founded psychology as an independent experimental field of study and he was the one who set up the first laboratory that carried out psychological research exclusively at Leipzing University.

1890 William James who was an American Philosopher published a book called principles of psychology which was discussed by psychologists worldwide. This same year New York state passed the state care act in which people with mental health problems were to leave poor houses and enter the hospital for treatment.

1890 Stanley Hall founded the American Psychological Association.
1850-1909 Herman Abbingaus worked at the University of Berlin and studied memory extensively.

1849-1936 Ivan Pavlor carried an experiment which shows that dogs salivate when they expect food (concept of conditioning).

1856-1939 Sigmund Freud introduced a field of psychoanalysis which is a type of psychotherapy and argued that unconscious was responsible for most of the people's thoughts and behavior and for mental health problems.

1890s John Dewey's wrote about educational theory which was another hallmark in the development of psychology.

1890s Hugo Munsterburg began writing about the application of psychology to industry law and other fields.

1890s Lightner Witmer established a psychological clinic.
1890s James Mackeen Cattel generated the program of mental testing.
Later in 1900s psychology became a new independent science that was systematically organized into different schools of thought.

\section*{GOALS OF HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY.}

\section*{Describe}

It describes behavior. Through describing the behavior of humans and other animals we are at a better place to consider what is normal and abnormal.

\section*{Explain}

It helps explain about a certain behavior.
- Why people do the things they do.
•

\section*{Predict}

It helps to make predictions about how we think and act.
When we understand more about what happens we can use that information to predict about when. Why and how it might happen again in the future.

\section*{Change}

Psychology strives to change, influence or control behavior to make constructive and lasting changes in people's lives.

\section*{SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN PSYCHOLOGY.}
1) Psychoanalytic school.

Was founded during the late 1800s and early1900s by Sigmund Freud.

Psychoanalysis was based on the theory that behavior is determined by powerful inner forces most of which are buried in the unconscious mind.
According to Freud and other psychoanalysts from early childhood people repress (force out of conscious awareness) any desire or needs that are unacceptable to themselves or to society.
The repressed feelings can cause disturbances, self-destructive behavior or even physical symptoms.
Freud developed several techniques to bring repressed feelings to the level of conscious awareness by using a method called free association where the patient relaxes and talks about anything that comes to mind while the psychologist listens to clue to the person's inner feelings.
Psychoanalysts also try to interpret dreams which they regard as a reflection of unconscious drives and conflicts.
The goal is to help the patient understand and accept repressed feelings and find ways to deal with them.

\section*{2) Structuralism school.}

This grew up from the work of William James, Wilhelm Wundt and their associates. They believed that the chief purpose of psychology was to describe, analyze and explain conscious experience particularly feelings and sensations.

They used techniques such as introspection (the observation or examination of one's own mental and emotional process) to analyze the inner process of the human mind.

\section*{3) Behaviorist school.}

This was based upon the work of thinkers such as Ivan Pavlor, B.F Skinner
This school suggests that all behavior can be explained by environmental causes rather than internal forces.
Behavior is focused upon observable behavior. The theories such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning were used here.
This school of thought had a lot of influence in the course of psychology and many of the ideas and techniques emerged from this school and are still widely used today e.g. behavioral training, token economies.

\section*{4) Humanistic school.}

It developed as a response to psychoanalysis and behaviorism.
This school focused on individual free will personal growth and concept of self-actualization.

The psychologist behind this school were Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.
This school of thought is centered on helping people living with happier and more fulfilling lives.

\section*{5) Cognitive school.}

This is the school of psychology that studies mental processes including how people think, perceive, remember and learn.
The most influential theories of this school of thought was stages of cognitive development by Jean Piaget.
- Jean Piaget theory of cognitive development suggests that children move through 4 different stages of mental development. His theory not only focuses on understanding how children acquire knowledge but also understanding the nature of intelligence.

\section*{6) Gestalt school.}

This school was founded by Max Wertheimer who was a German Psychologist.
He believed that human beings and other animals perceive the external world as an organized pattern and not as individual sensations.
The gestalts believe that behavior should be studied as an organized pattern rather than a separate incidence of stimulus and response.

\section*{7) Existentialism school.}

It was founded by Gabriel Marcel.
This school of thought was interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversions to escape from boredom.[ they also considered the role of making free choices particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.
Individual invent their own values and create the very terms under which they excel. To escape meaninglessness individual should learn to come up with meaning for their existence despite the circumstances.

\section*{8] Eclectic approach.}

Many psychologists don't associate themselves with a particular school or theory instead they select and use what seems best from a wide variety of sources and approach called eclectic approach.

This is because every school of thought and every theory of personality has something significant to contribute in the understanding of human behavior.

\section*{CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES}
1) Psychodynamic approach.

This is an approach that was developed by Sigmund Freud. Freud believed that human behavior connected to drives and forces within the body and mind most of which were unconscious workings.
He also felt these drives were prominent in childhood and that difficulties at different stages of development would shape a humans personality later in life.
Freud worked with patients suffering from anxiety and depression and noticed that most of the trauma suffered stemmed from issues in childhood. He believed if he would get to the root of the behavior through means such as talk therapy and dream interpretation he could cure his patients and this was the base of Freud's theory.
2) Biological approach

This focuses on a person's genetics and literal biology as a way to understand human behavior.
Researchers using this approach look at the brain and the body through MRIs, scans and genetic variables in blood panels to access personality and individual choice.
In this approach researchers often create and use various pharmaceutical drugs for further research and help patients with issues such as depression, anxiety and chemical imbalances.
3) Cognitive approach.

This approach aims to understand functions such as memory, language, attention and even thinking. This approach looks at the brain as a computer and information processor.
Researchers using this approach create information processing models to better understand behavior.
In this approach scientists were aiming to understand the inner workings of the brain that can be observed.
The theorist behind this is known as Albert Bandura (social learning theory) bridged the gap between behaviorism and cognitive approach he felt that while behaviors could and are conditioned responses, there was a process happening behind the scenes that showcased how and why learning occurred.
4) Evolutionary approach.

This looks at the human behavior through the process of evolution. It states that the human body and mind have both evolved over time to better fit their environments and adapt to survive.
Evolutionary psychologists believe current human behaviors occurred because of evolution as a way to adapt to an ever changing environment.

\section*{5) Humanistic approach.}

This focuses on an individual as a whole, looking at all aspects of a human life. This includes their biology, environment, the way their brain works and their ancestral lineage.
This approach centers on free will and the idea that all humans have the capability to change and grow.
This approach was brought about by Abraham Maslow whereby his work depicted as a pyramid, layered the necessary physical and mental challenges humans would encounter. He felt hat if a person could get the basic necessities and safety to live, they would find motivation along the way and work towards a positive self-image and reflects a healthy and happy individual.

\section*{6) Behaviorist approach.}

This approach looks at a person's environment as a cause of how and why a person behaves in a certain way.
Behaviorists believe that all behaviors are learned and focus on the things they can see instead of what can't inside the brain\body.

\section*{METHODS USED IN STUDYING PSYCHOLOGY.}

\section*{1) Observation method.}

This is useful where experiments cannot be conducted. In this method the observer will observe and collect data.
This method is useful to study the children, mentally ill and unconscious patients. Sometimes the observer will go to natural settings or situations. This is because in natural settings the person being observed will not be aware that he is being observed. His behavior will be natural/original.
To observe the natural behavior the observer may have to spend more time, energy and money.

\section*{2) Experimental method.}

In this method experiments are conducted in the laboratories under controlled conditions.
In this method there will be some other variables which are not wanted by the experimenter and their interference may affect the result of the experiment. The disadvantages are that conducting the experiment is very expensive and time consuming and also the experiment cannot be conducted outside the laboratory.

\section*{3) Survey method.}

This is used to gather information from large number of people. This method can be used to know information pertaining medical profession like awareness about diseases, malnutrition, opinions, about health needs, health facilities available etc. Questionnaires, checklists, rating scales and inventories are used to collect the required information.

\section*{4) Genetic method.}

Also known as development method. Some of our behaviors are as a result of earlier experiences. In order to understand some behavior we need to know their developmental aspects e.g. in order to understand the behavior of adults we need to know their childhood development.

\section*{5) Testing method.}

Tests are developed by psychologists to study various aspects of behavior. The interests, attitudes, abilities, intelligence, adjustments, personalities and other factors that influence behavior can be studied by administering the suitable tests.

\section*{6. Clinical method/ case history method.}

It is a method that is commonly used in hospitals and education settings. This information that is used in this method can be obtained from the patient, his close relatives like parents, siblings or others who accompany the patient e.g. in hospital when a patient is admitted a medical practitioner can collect the detailed information pertaining to the disease of the patient. The information includes the past medical history, treatment taken already, any improvement after medication, present condition, causes, signs and symptoms etc.

\section*{BRANCHES OF PSYCHOLOGY}

\section*{1) Abnormal psychology.}

This is the study of certain behavioral abnormalities in a person's mind such as neurosis, psychoses and mental retardation.
Abnormal psychology is one of the basic forms of psychological study and is taught in law and human resource management.

\section*{2) Behavioral psychology.}

This is the more popular term used for behavioral neuroscience or psychobiology. It studies the mental processes and behavioral patterns of humans as well as non-human subjects. This branch of psychology is more concerned with the physical functioning of the brain and its cells.

\section*{3) Clinical psychology.}

This is the scientific study of the prevention, understanding and relieving of psychological disorders.
Clinical psychologists conduct assessments of abnormal behavior by administering psychological tests through systematic interviewing or through observation. After assessment they give diagnosis and then conduct psychotherapy as a means of treatment.
Clinical psychologists mostly work in hospital settings where they work hand in hand with psychiatrists and medical doctors for the purpose of referral because they don't prescribe psychiatric medication.

\section*{4) Counselling psychology.}

This is the scientific study of prevention, understanding and relieving psychological problems that come about from the challenges of daily living.
Counselling psychologists work more with families, institutions and communities.
While they may diagnose, assess and treat adjustment difficulties like clinical psychologists. They often address problems which are more moderate than these encountered by clinical psychologists.
Clients of counselling psychologists are people who need help coping with stress of everyday life and the focus is on strengthening their existing resources rather than overcoming disorders or deficiencies.
Counselling psychologists also stress a great deal on research, teaching, advocacy, consultation, forensic testimony, program development and administration. Clinical psychologists and counselling psychologists are the general practitioners of the psychological field.

\section*{5) Cognitive psychology.}

This is a branch of psychology that deals with the internal mental process of thought such as visual processing, memory, problem solving and language. It basically looks over the information processing function of the brain. It looks into concepts such as perception, aging memory, emotions and decision making.

\section*{6) Community psychology.}

It studies the psychology of individuals and the dynamics in a community. It studies the concepts that are characteristic to community oriented behavior.it studies adaptation, succession and interdependence. It helps a community understand empowerment, social justice and citizen participation.

\section*{7) Developmental psychology.}

This is the study of the systematic changes that occur in a human being and his psyche over the course of life.it is also concerned with early child development and care.
Each individual goes through certain changes during their life. Developmental psychology of the branch of psychology that studies this progression and helps understand these changes, their causes and effects better.
8) Educational psychology.

His id the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational intervention, the psychology of teaching and the social psychology of schools as organizations. Educational psychology is concerned with how students learn and develop often focusing on sub groups such as gifted children and those subject to specific disabilities.
9) Evolutionary psychology.

This is a branch of psychology that studies the most primal psychological stimuli in human beings. It is believed by evolutionary scientists that while it is absolutely natural for human beings to pick out linguistic skills, the same does nit hold for reading and writing. They are adaptive skills. It is also natural for human beings to gauge another human beings emotional state of mind and the ability to recognize kin from another.
10) Forensic/legal psychology.

Legal psychologists assist in the process of crime investigation. Forensic psychologists often work within the judicial system in such diverse areas as determining an inmate's readiness for parole, evaluation of rehabilitation programs, criminal competency, eye witness testimony and evidence.
11) Personality psychology.

This is a branch of psychology that governs the legitimate (I.Q) intelligence quotient and personality test that one takes to understand themselves better.it also studies specific personality disorders like borderline personality disorders. It helps an individual see themselves in more objective light after which an individual can maximize on his/her strength and work on the weakness.
12) Experimental psychology.

Experimental psychologists work to understand the underlying causes of behavior by studying humans and animals.
13) Health psychology.

Medical psychology focuses on the clinical treatment of the patients with physical illnesses offering practical advice people can use in order to improve their health.
14) Industrial/organizational psychology.

Psychologists on this field may be employed by companies to administer tests which measure employee aptitude or skills in hiring and placement.
15) Social psychology.

Is the study of human interaction. Social psychology seeks to understand human behavior in social settings.

\section*{RELEVANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY IN HEALTH CARE PRACTICE.}

Helps psychologists assess, diagnose and treat the psychological problems and behavior dysfunctions resulting from or related to physical and mental health.

It plays a major role in the promotion of healthy behavior, preventing diseases and improving patient's quality of life.

Help in performing clinical roles according to vigorous ethical principles and code of conduct.
