                        <p>Psychology started around thousands years ago in ancient Greece, Egypt, India, Persia and China.</p>
                        
                        <p>In 387BCE Plato suggested that the brain is where mental process takes place while in 335BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.</p>
                        
                        <p>It is said that the first hospitals were set up Islamic doctors during the medieval times whereby Avicenna who was the famous Muslim doctor studied and treated epilepsy, nightmares and poor memory.</p>
                        
                        <p>The first patient with mental problems was released from confinement by Philippe Pinel in 1793 a move that signaled a step towards human treatment.</p>
                        
                        <p>1879 Wilhelm Wundt- who is known as the father of psychology from Germany founded psychology as an independent experimental field of study and he was the one who set up the first laboratory that carried out psychological research exclusively at Leipzing University.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890 William James who was an American Philosopher published a book called principles of psychology which was discussed by psychologists worldwide. This same year New York state passed the state care act in which people with mental health problems were to leave poor houses and enter the hospital for treatment.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890 Stanley Hall founded the American Psychological Association.</p>
                        
                        <p>1850-1909 Herman Abbingaus worked at the University of Berlin and studied memory extensively.</p>
                        
                        <p>1849-1936 Ivan Pavlor carried an experiment which shows that dogs salivate when they expect food (concept of conditioning).</p>
                        
                        <p>1856-1939 Sigmund Freud introduced a field of psychoanalysis which is a type of psychotherapy and argued that unconscious was responsible for most of the people's thoughts and behavior and for mental health problems.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890s John Dewey's wrote about educational theory which was another hallmark in the development of psychology.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890s Hugo Munsterburg began writing about the application of psychology to industry law and other fields.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890s Lightner Witmer established a psychological clinic.</p>
                        
                        <p>1890s James Mackeen Cattel generated the program of mental testing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Later in 1900s psychology became a new independent science that was systematically organized into different schools of thought.</p>

                        <h3>1) Psychoanalytic School</h3>
                        <p>Was founded during the late 1800s and early1900s by Sigmund Freud.</p>
                        
                        <p>Psychoanalysis was based on the theory that behavior is determined by powerful inner forces most of which are buried in the unconscious mind.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to Freud and other psychoanalysts from early childhood people repress (force out of conscious awareness) any desire or needs that are unacceptable to themselves or to society.</p>
                        
                        <p>The repressed feelings can cause disturbances, self-destructive behavior or even physical symptoms.</p>
                        
                        <p>Freud developed several techniques to bring repressed feelings to the level of conscious awareness by using a method called free association where the patient relaxes and talks about anything that comes to mind while the psychologist listens to clue to the person's inner feelings.</p>
                        
                        <p>Psychoanalysts also try to interpret dreams which they regard as a reflection of unconscious drives and conflicts.</p>
                        
                        <p>The goal is to help the patient understand and accept repressed feelings and find ways to deal with them.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>2) Structuralism School</h3>
                        <p>This grew up from the work of William James, Wilhelm Wundt and their associates. They believed that the chief purpose of psychology was to describe, analyze and explain conscious experience particularly feelings and sensations.</p>
                        
                        <p>They used techniques such as introspection (the observation or examination of one's own mental and emotional process) to analyze the inner process of the human mind.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>3) Behaviorist School</h3>
                        <p>This was based upon the work of thinkers such as Ivan Pavlor, B.F Skinner</p>
                        
                        <p>This school suggests that all behavior can be explained by environmental causes rather than internal forces.</p>
                        
                        <p>Behavior is focused upon observable behavior. The theories such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning were used here.</p>
                        
                        <p>This school of thought had a lot of influence in the course of psychology and many of the ideas and techniques emerged from this school and are still widely used today e.g. behavioral training, token economies.</p>

                        <h3>4) Humanistic School</h3>
                        <p>It developed as a response to psychoanalysis and behaviorism.</p>
                        
                        <p>This school focused on individual free will personal growth and concept of self-actualization.</p>
                        
                        <p>The psychologist behind this school were Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.</p>
                        
                        <p>This school of thought is centered on helping people living with happier and more fulfilling lives.</p>

                        <p>This is the school of psychology that studies mental processes including how people think, perceive, remember and learn.</p>
                        
                        <p>The most influential theories of this school of thought was stages of cognitive development by Jean Piaget.</p>

                            <li>Jean Piaget theory of cognitive development suggests that children move through 4 different stages of mental development. His theory not only focuses on understanding how children acquire knowledge but also understanding the nature of intelligence.</li>

                        <p>He believed that human beings and other animals perceive the external world as an organized pattern and not as individual sensations.</p>
                        
                        <p>The gestalts believe that behavior should be studied as an organized pattern rather than a separate incidence of stimulus and response.</p>

                        <p>This school of thought was interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversions to escape from boredom.[ they also considered the role of making free choices particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.</p>
                        
                        <p>Individual invent their own values and create the very terms under which they excel. To escape meaninglessness individual should learn to come up with meaning for their existence despite the circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Many psychologists don't associate themselves with a particular school or theory instead they select and use what seems best from a wide variety of sources and approach called eclectic approach.</p>
                        
                        <p>This is because every school of thought and every theory of personality has something significant to contribute in the understanding of human behavior.</p>

                        <p>This is an approach that was developed by Sigmund Freud. Freud believed that human behavior connected to drives and forces within the body and mind most of which were unconscious workings.</p>
                        
                        <p>He also felt these drives were prominent in childhood and that difficulties at different stages of development would shape a humans personality later in life.</p>
                        
                        <p>Freud worked with patients suffering from anxiety and depression and noticed that most of the trauma suffered stemmed from issues in childhood. He believed if he would get to the root of the behavior through means such as talk therapy and dream interpretation he could cure his patients and this was the base of Freud's theory.</p>
