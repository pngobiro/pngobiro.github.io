      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "The WHO ladder starts with simple analgesics. If pain persists, a weak opioid is added. For severe pain, strong opioids like Morphine are used.",
      "hint": "Start with what you would take for a simple headache."

      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "Opioids cause respiratory depression (dangerous), constipation (very common), and pinpoint pupils (a sign of overdose). They act on the gut to slow motility, causing constipation, not diarrhea.",
      "hint": "Opioids 'slow things down'—breathing, bowel movements, and pupil size."

      "caseSensitive": false,
      "partialMatch": true,
      "explanation": "Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. It binds to opioid receptors without activating them, effectively displacing the opioid drug and reversing the overdose effects immediately.",
      "hint": "It sounds similar to 'Naltrexone' but is used for acute reversal."

      "explanation": "Topical is surface level. Infiltration is local tissue. Epidural is outside the dura. Spinal is deeper, into the CSF.",
      "hint": "Spinal goes into the fluid; Epidural goes 'upon' or outside the dura."

      "points": 10,
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Paracetamol is NOT an NSAID. It acts centrally in the brain and does not inhibit peripheral prostaglandins significantly, so it does NOT cause the gastric side effects associated with NSAIDs.",

        { "id": "d", "text": "The patient will become immune to the drug.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Long-term steroid use suppresses the body's natural production of cortisol (adrenal atrophy). Sudden withdrawal leaves the body with no steroids, leading to a life-threatening adrenal crisis. Doses must be tapered slowly.",
      "hint": "The body forgets how to make its own 'stress hormones' when you take them as pills."

      "explanation": "Methotrexate is a DMARD. Paracetamol and Codeine treat pain but do not stop the disease process. Diazepam is a muscle relaxant/anxiolytic.",

      "hint": "They protect the stomach but might hurt the heart."
