    {

        { "id": "d", "text": "Histamine and Adrenaline", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Monoamine hypothesis suggests depression arises from low levels of 'feel good' monoamines: Serotonin (mood/sleep) and Noradrenaline (energy/drive).",
      "hint": "Antidepressants like SSRIs target one of these."

      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "Lignocaine is standard. Bupivacaine lasts longer (good for labor/surgery). EMLA is for skin. Adrenaline keeps the drug local by constricting vessels.",

      "explanation": "Typical antipsychotics are 'dirty drugs' hitting many receptors. They cause movement disorders (dopamine block), sedation (histamine block), and dry mouth (acetylcholine block).",
