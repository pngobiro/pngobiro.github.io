      "explanation": "Beta-blockers block the sympathetic nervous system. The signs of low blood sugar (shaking, racing heart) are sympathetic responses. If blocked, the patient may not know their sugar is low until it's too late.",

      ],
      "explanation": "Diuretics make the kidneys excrete sodium and water. Less fluid in the blood vessels means lower pressure and less work for the heart.",
