                    <h2 class="section-title">Diabetes</h2>
                    <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of metabolism caused by either an insufficient production of insulin in the body or an insufficient effect of insulin in the peripheral tissues. The main problems stem from a wide fluctuation in the range of blood glucose levels which leads to a number of short- and long-term difficulties for the individual. There are two main forms of diabetes: type I and type II.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes professionals will refer to type I diabetes as 'juvenile' because it usually starts before the age of 40 and is most common in the teenage years.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In <strong>type I diabetes</strong> the body produces little or no insulin in cells contained in the pancreas and known as the 'Islets of Langerhans' or the beta cells. The pancreas is a specialized gland that lies just behind the stomach. Its functions range from regulating the amount of sugar (glucose) you have in your blood to producing enzymes that help break down and digest proteins, carbohydrates and fats. It is thought that the beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the body's own immune response: hence diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Someone with type I diabetes will be required to take insulin for the rest of their lives.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes you will hear people refer to type II diabetes as 'maturity onset' as it occurs in people over the age of 40.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In <strong>type II diabetes</strong> the beta cells may produce small amounts of insulin but not enough to control the levels of glucose in the plasma. In addition, the cells of the body, and particularly in the periphery, cannot utilize insulin properly. This means that glucose is not allowed to enter peripheral cells, so increasing the glucose levels in the plasma. This type of diabetes is linked to the problem of obesity.</p>

                    <p>It is estimated that approximately 2 million people in the UK are currently being treated for type II diabetes. However, researchers suggest that there are as many people who are under-diagnosed. The risk of this type of diabetes is also higher if it runs in the family or if the patient is overweight. From this perspective, it is clear that prevention of obesity will also lead to prevention of type II diabetes.</p>

                    <p>Without treatment, the main symptoms of diabetes can be divided into two major areas: acute symptoms and chronic complications. There are a number of symptoms that could be referred to as 'classic'. These are excessive thirst (polydypsia), producing lots of urine necessitating many trips to the toilet (polyuria), blurring of vision, tiredness and weight loss due to muscle wasting.</p>

                            <p><strong>Macrovascular disease</strong> refers to damage to the larger blood vessels and results in coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease. <strong>Microvascular disease</strong> refers to damage to smaller vessels, resulting in eye problems (retinopathy) and kidney damage (nephropathy).

                    <h3>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</h3>
                    <p>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition that comes as a complication of diabetes. A patient with DKA will have high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia), high levels of ketone bodies in their plasma (ketosis), and because these ketone bodies are acidic the patients' blood becomes more acidic (metabolic acidosis). DKA occurs mostly in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).</p>
                    
                    <p>If left unchecked the condition can progress to cerebral oedema, coma, and death. Insulin deficiency can be described as absolute (e.g. missed dose) or relative (e.g. increased demand due to infection). Stressors that can cause this relative imbalance include acute infection such as pneumonia or myocardial infarction. Certain drugs are also implicated in causing DKA including corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics and sympathomimetics.</p>

                    <h3>Treatment of DKA</h3>
                    <p>The most urgent goals are:</p>

                    <p>Intravenous fluids are needed immediately as intravascular volume should be restored to raise blood pressure and ensure kidney perfusion. Once initial fluids are given, the remaining deficits are corrected more slowly over 24-36 hours.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hyperglycaemia needs correcting by giving the patient regular insulin (e.g., Humulin, Novolin). Initially the patient may require 0.1 unit/kg as an IV bolus, followed by a continuous IV infusion. As the patient improves, they will be switched to subcutaneous insulin.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Medicine management of diabetes</h2>
                    <p>The overall aim of treatment is to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range (normoglycaemia). This relieves acute symptoms and minimizes chronic complications. Lifestyle changes like exercise and smoking cessation are advisable. However, the most important key is diet, used alone or combined with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p>

                    <h3>Insulin</h3>
                    <p>Insulin is released in the body in response to raised blood glucose. It is the key that allows glucose to enter cells. It also promotes conversion of glucose to glycogen (storage) and limits fat breakdown (lypolisis).</p>

                            <p>Insulin is destroyed in the GI system, which is why you never see it given by mouth as a tablet. It is usually given by subcutaneous (SC) injection.</p>

                    <p>At one time insulin was extracted from cattle or pigs, but today it is almost entirely human, produced via recombinant DNA technology. Once absorbed, insulin has a short half-life of approximately 10 minutes, so long-acting forms are required for control.</p>

                    <p>The main problem is <strong>hypoglycaemia</strong> (blood sugar lowered too much), which can cause brain damage. Patients may become dizzy, faint, sweat, and appear drunk.</p>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Give sugar (sweet drinks, glucose tablets). If unconscious, IV glucose or intramuscular glucagon is required.</p>

                    <h3>Insulin Pumps</h3>
                    <p>An insulin pump is portable and delivers insulin through a cannula under the skin. It uses fast-acting insulin to deliver:</p>
