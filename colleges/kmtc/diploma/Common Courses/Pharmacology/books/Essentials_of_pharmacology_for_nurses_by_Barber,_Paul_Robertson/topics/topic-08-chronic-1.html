                            <p>Asthma is the leading chronic disease in developed countries and its incidence is increasing. The condition is brought on by a reversible obstruction of the airways which in turn causes the individual to become breathless and start to cough or wheeze. Asthma may be described as being acute or chronic. Severe acute asthma (known as status asthmaticus) is not reversed very easily and, as a result, continues to be fatal and requires prompt treatment. Chronic asthma usually has an intermittent pattern of breathlessness (dyspnoea), coughing and wheezing.</p>
                            <p>In acute asthma the main reason for obstruction of the airways is bronchoconstriction caused by a substance called histamine. Further significant obstruction of the airways is brought about by inflammatory changes in the mucosa which cause an increase in mucous production, more epithelial cells being shed and swelling of the tissues within the respiratory passages.</p>
                            <p>Asthma symptoms are thought to be caused by what doctors describe as hyper-reactivity or hyper-responsiveness of the cells lining the air passages. It seems that bronchiolar tissue in certain individuals is more sensitive to certain trigger factors than other people in the general population. Trigger factors include irritant chemicals, exposure to foreign proteins called allergens, and cold air.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Pathological changes in asthma</h3>
                            <p>The changes in the respiratory system that bring about asthma are initiated by an allergic reaction.</p>
                            <p>The trigger factor stimulates the body's immune response and as part of this the body produces a type of white cell called a B-lymphocyte. Some of these B-lymphocytes mature into a type of cell called a plasma cell. These cells produce a chemical called immunoglobulin E which is a type of antibody. These antibodies in turn attach themselves to a type of tissue cell called a mast cell.</p>
                            <p>These mast cells are now stimulated to produce a substance called histamine. Histamine is a potent constrictor of the muscles in the air passages, causing them to become narrowed. This is called bronchoconstriction. Histamine also causes local blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable so that other inflammatory cells in the plasma can move into the tissues. Not only does histamine cause constriction of bronchial smooth muscle, it also leads to swelling of the tissues.</p>
                            <p>Another specific group of white cells thought to be involved in asthma are the eosinophils. This group of cells are implicated in the inflammatory response by releasing a range of chemicals that contribute to the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, permeability of small blood vessels and excessive secretion of mucous. It is also suggested that the eosinophils produce chemicals that have a toxic effect on the epithelial lining of the airways and are responsible for the greater amount of epithelial shedding associated with this condition.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Asthma in children</h3>
                            <p>Asthma is the leading cause of chronic illness in children. It affects as many as 15 per cent of children in the UK and, for unknown reasons, is steadily increasing. It can begin at any age, but most children have their first symptoms by age 5. Children still die from asthma - there were 27 recorded deaths in 2005 - and there is still significant disability associated with the disease, particularly severe childhood asthma, despite pharmacological advances.</p>

                                    <p>You will probably be asked to give a child asthma medications using a nebulizer while on placement. A nebulizer delivers asthma drugs, usually bronchodilators, by changing them from a liquid to a mist. The child gets the drug by breathing it in through a facemask. These breathing treatments usually take about 10-15 minutes and are given several times a day. Children may be able to use a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer. A spacer is a chamber that attaches to the MDI and holds the burst of medication (see Figure 8.1).</p>

                            <h3>Beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists</h3>
                            <p>These drugs are referred to as bronchodilators. They open the air passages by directly activating beta receptors, relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchioles. This allows a more normal movement of air between the atmosphere and the alveoli. This group of drugs is available in both short- and long-acting forms. An example of a short-acting form in this class is salbutamol.</p>

                                    <p>Beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists are often referred to as 'rescue remedies' because they ease the difficult breathing (dyspnoea), shortness of breath and wheezing associated with an asthma attack. Generally, these drugs have a short period of action.</p>
                                </div>
                            </aside>

                            <p>Most short-acting beta 2 agonists are available as aerosols to inhale by mouth several times a day. Most are also available as solutions that can be used with a special apparatus called a nebulizer. The maximum effect occurs within 30 minutes and the duration of action is between four and six hours. The patient is usually prescribed the drug on a 'prn' (pro re nata - as required) basis.</p>

                                    <p>The longer-acting drugs in this class are often called 'controllers' because they help people with moderate to severe asthma control their symptoms. The effects of these drugs are longer-lasting at around 12 hours. An example of a drug in this class is salmeterol.</p>

                            <h3>Methylxanthines</h3>
                            <p>The drug from this family most commonly employed in the clinical setting is theophylline, which works as a bronchodilator by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscle. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed but it is still unclear how this drug produces its effects. Recently theophylline has also been shown to have some antiinflammatory activity, especially with regard to mast cell activity. Theophylline is a useful drug in that it produces bronchial dilation so reducing the symptoms of chronic asthma, reducing the dosage of oral corticosteroids and reducing the requirement for symptomatic use of beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists.</p>
                            <p>Deaths associated with theophylline have been reported and are due to the serious cardiovascular side-effect of dysrhythmia. Seizures are also a further life-threatening side-effect and can occur in concentrations only just above the therapeutic level.</p>

                            <h3>Muscarinic receptor antagonists</h3>
                            <p>The parasympathetic nervous system causes bronchoconstriction; therefore, if these effects on the bronchioles of the lungs were blocked dilatation would take place. This is the basic premise of this group of drugs. The compounds are used mainly in asthma, chronic bronchitis and COPD.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Ipratropium</h4>
                            <p>This medicine comes as a solution to inhale by mouth, either as an aerosol or in a nebulizer. The aerosol is usually prescribed four times a day. The bronchodilator effect begins after approximately 45 minutes and lasts for about three to five hours. This drug can cause side-effects ranging from leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth and/or a dry mouth to rashes, hoarseness and chest pain.</p>

                            <h3>Inhaled corticosteroids</h3>
                            <p>Glucocorticoids are dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6. They do not bring about bronchodilatation and are not given as an immediate response to the trigger factor. However, inhaled corticosteroids are now a regular therapy in asthma management. Two drugs commonly used are beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide. Both have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity. When inhaled they prevent the production of a chemical called arachidonic acid which in turn leads to the reduced formation of prostaglandins and leucotrienes, reducing the inflammatory response (see Chapter 6). Both drugs when taken regularly reduce the frequency of 'rescue' bronchodilator intake.</p>

                            <h3>Cromoglicate</h3>
                            <p>This medicine is not a bronchodilator, however if given prior to an asthmatic attack it prevents the immediate and later bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled allergens by stopping the release of mediators such as histamine from mast cells. It is thought that this medicine blocks calcium channels from opening in the mast cells. As calcium is blocked from entering the cells, so in turn is the release of inflammatory mediators. However, its exact mode of action is still not known.</p>

                            <p>COPD is a general term which includes the conditions chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is the preferred term, but you may also hear it called 'chronic obstructive airways disease' (COAD). Chronic bronchitis and emphysema commonly occur alongside each other, leading to the airways becoming narrowed and a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs, causing shortness of breath. In clinical practice, COPD is defined by its characteristically low airflow in lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, this limitation is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time. In England, approximately 1 person in 59 is diagnosed with COPD at some point in their lives.</p>
                            <p>The most common cause of COPD is smoking. Once you give up smoking, you gradually reduce the chances of suffering from COPD, and you slow down its progress if you already have it.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Drugs used in treating COPD</h3>
                            <p>Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. A patient may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. Many of these medicines have been covered under the section on asthma such as beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists, methylxanthines, muscarinic receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids. However there are other drugs that you will come across when nursing someone with COPD that you will need to know about.</p>

                            <h4>Inhaled long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs)</h4>
                            <p>Examples of medicines in this category that you are likely to come across are formoterol and salmeterol. They improve the function of the lungs, the patient will also state that they feel breathing is easier for them and they feel generally less breathlessness. Formoterol and salmeterol have 12-hour durations of action; this compares to 4-6 hours in salbutamol.</p>
                            <p>Indacaterol is a new LABA that is being developed with the characteristics that we have just outlined. Indacaterol has a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation and rapid onset of action.</p>

                            <h4>Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)</h4>
                            <p>It is not only LABAs that have increased the quality of life for patients with COPD but also the advent of long-acting anti-muscarinic drugs such as tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium.</p>
                            <p>Tiotropium is probably the drug you are most familiar with. This was the first to be formulated in this classification of drugs. It has been shown by many studies to be an effective bronchodilator which has a long-lasting effect on the tissues. Tiotropium provides consistent 24-hour bronchodilation.</p>

                            <p>If we could pharmacologically inhibit the inflammatory response in this disease then we would improve the symptoms for the patient and his quality of life. This is what the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors do. They are a relatively new addition to the treatment of COPD and their mode of action is anti-inflammatory in nature. Examples of drugs in this class are cilomilast and roflumilast - described as potent and selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors.</p>
