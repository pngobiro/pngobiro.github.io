                            <p>Infectious disease is a major cause of death and disability throughout the world. Many micro-organisms live either inside or on the outside of the human body. These cause disease only when our resistance is lowered through other diseases or when our natural barriers have been affected by disease or trauma. Other micro-organisms are present in the external environment and are taken into our bodies through eating and drinking, breathing or on physical contact.</p>
                            <p>Infectious micro-organisms are categorized into four main groups: bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Bacteria and fungi are capable of existing independently of their host - i.e. us. Some protozoa and certainly viruses need the mechanisms from our cells in order to replicate and grow. A further category of infectious agent is called a prion. These have been particularly press-worthy over the years as they cause bovine spongioform encephalopathy (BSE).</p>

                            <p>We are surrounded by bacteria, most of which are harmless. Having said this, it is probably safe to say that more deaths and disease have been caused by bacteria than any other cause.</p>
                            <p>Bacteria are classified into a number of types based on how they appear through a microscope i.e. the shape of them. Some look like rods, and are called bacilli. Some are round in shape and are called cocci. Others have a spiral or corkscrew shape and are known as spirochaetes. Bacteria are also categorized by whether they take up a stain called gram stain. Bacteria that absorb this stain are termed gram positive, while those that do not are gram negative.</p>
                            <p>Bacteria cells are different from those of humans. Bacteria do not have a nucleus and so are called prokaryotes. Our cells do have a nucleus and are called eukaryotes. This and other differences between bacteria and human cells is important as antibiotics are designed to target these differences, thus destroying the bacteria while leaving our own cells intact.</p>

                            <p>Antibiotics are often described as being bactericidal: in other words, they kill bacteria, usually very rapidly. They are also bacteriostatic, which means that the antibiotic prevents the growth of an infection but does not eradicate it totally. Instead it gives the body's natural defence mechanisms time to recognize and deal with the infection.</p>

                            <h3>Interference with folate</h3>
                            <p>Folate is a vitamin required by both bacterial and human cells. Human cells have evolved a mechanism to directly take up folate from the interstitial fluid. Bacteria, on the other hand, have to make their own folate and cannot absorb it directly from the environment.</p>
                            <p>A group of antibiotics called sulfonamides exploit this difference between bacterial and mammalian cells. Bacteria need a substance called PABA (see Chapter 4) in order to make the folate they need. Sulfonamides fool the bacteria into taking up a substance that looks identical to PABA but cannot be used by the bacteria. In this way, they prevent the cell reproducing and are therefore bacteriostatic in nature.</p>
                            <h4>Trimethoprim</h4>
                            <p>This sulfonamide drug is sometimes given as a combination called co-trimoxazole. Trimethoprim is given orally as it is well absorbed by the GI system. The drug is usually given to treat urinary and respiratory infections and may be prescribed with sulfamethoxazole as co-trimoxazole.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Beta-lactam antibiotics</h3>
                            <p>Peptidoglycan makes up to 50 per cent of the cell wall in bacteria. In some cells this wall is very thick. However, certain antibiotics stop the bacterial cell from making this substance, thus rendering the cell useless. This is how drugs such as penicillins and cephalosporins work.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Penicillins</h4>
                            <p>The first penicillin was the naturally occurring benzylpenicillin, and is still used today. The main drawback with this drug is that it is poorly absorbed from the GI tract so can only be administered by injection. Also, due to the length of time it has been used, many bacteria have developed enzyme systems to combat its effects. Therefore, various semi-synthetic versions have been prepared by altering the basic biochemistry of the drug. Examples include flucloxacillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin.</p>

                                    <p>Pencillin drugs are fairly free from side-effects. The main problem is with hypersensitivity, which is why you must always ask the patient if they have any allergy to penicillin. This information must be documented on the prescription chart and in the nursing records. Skin rashes and fever are common contraindications; much more serious is acute anaphylactic shock.</p>

                            <h4>Cephalosporins</h4>
                            <p>These drugs are chemically related to the penicillin group. They work in the same way as penicillin in that they affect the production of the peptidoglycan wall of the bacterium. Some cephalosporins may be given orally; for example, cefalexin. However, most of this group of drugs are given via the IV or SC routes; for example, cefuroxime and cefotaxime.</p>

                            <h4>Clavulanic acid</h4>
                            <p>Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes that are produced by some bacteria and are responsible for their resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillins. When combined with a penicillin group antibiotic it gives the potential to overcome certain types of antibiotic resistance.</p>

                            <p>Protein synthesis takes place in the ribosomes. However, ribosomes are different in eukaryotes (i.e. our cells) than in prokaryotes (i.e. bacterial cells). This is another difference that can be exploited by antibiotic therapy.</p>

                            <p>This group of drugs acts by stopping bacterial cells from making essential proteins. The group includes tetracycline, oxytetracycline and minocycline.</p>

                                    <p>Tetracycline binds to calcium and also to metals such as magnesium, iron and aluminium. This stops its absorption into the body. Therefore you should advise a patient not to take milk with the tablets. You should also inform them that many OTC antacid remedies contain magnesium and aluminium so should be avoided during the course of treatment.</p>

                            <h4>Chloramphenicol</h4>
                            <p>This antibiotic is similar in action to the tetracycline group. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic which can be used against gram positive and gram negative organisms. The most important unwanted effect of this drug is that it causes a severe depression of the bone marrow. Chloramphenicol should only be given to babies with extreme caution as they do not have the capacity to metabolize and excrete the drug. This may result in a combination of signs and symptoms called 'grey baby syndrome'.</p>

                            <h4>Aminoglycosides</h4>
                            <p>This group of antibiotics includes gentamycin, streptomycin, tobramycin and neomycin and acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. One of the most common drugs in this group is gentamycin. The main problem with this drug is its serious toxic effects. It can have a devastating effect on the apparatus in the inner ear (ototoxicity). The second major side-effect is damage to the kidney tubules (nephrotoxicity).</p>

                            <p>In order for the bacteria to survive through replication this information needs to be copied. To do this an enzyme is needed to uncoil parts of the supercoiled material. The enzyme that brings this about in the bacterial cell is called topoisomerase II.

                            <p>One of the foremost concerns in modern medicine is antibiotic resistance. Simply put, if an antibiotic is used long enough, bacteria will emerge that cannot be killed by that antibiotic. There is an alarming rise in the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. For example, Staphylococcus aureus is a prevalent bacterium carried by humans that can cause a number of problems. In 2002, the WHO reported that more than 95 per cent of this bacterium worldwide is resistant to penicillin, and 60 per cent to its derivative methicillin.</p>
                            <p>Misuse of antibiotics occurs in medicine, agriculture and household products. Common examples include erroneous antibiotic prescriptions for non-bacterial infections and the addition of antibiotics to livestock feed and cleaning agents, which have helped create a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>

                            <p>TB is usually caused by inhaling the mycobacterium tuberculosis organism. This bacteria has a very tough envelope and can survive for long periods in dry conditions. The damage to our tissues is usually due to the body's inflammatory response to the infection rather than the result of any toxin released by the organism.</p>

                            <p>This drug is specific against mycobacteria and is therefore very helpful in the treatment of TB. It is bacteriostatic when the organisms are not active, but becomes bacteriocidal when they start to divide and multiply. Side-effects are related to the dose given, the commonest being skin problems. Isoniazid affects enzymes in the liver that break down certain anti-convulsant drugs.</p>

                            <p>This drug also stops the virus passing on its genetic code from a piece of RNA to a piece of DNA. However, it targets a different type of virus, the cytomegalo virus.

                            <h4>Amantadine</h4>
                            <p>This drug is active against the influenza A virus but not the B virus. It works by stopping the virus gaining entry to the host cell and also by stopping any newly made viruses from leaving the cell after replication.</p>

                            <h4>Immunoglobulins</h4>
                            <p>Immunoglobulins contain antibodies against specific viruses that the patient may encounter in the population. These antibodies set to work on the viral envelope and attempt to destroy it.</p>

                            <p>Amphotericin works by targeting fungi and some protozoa. This specificity is thought to occur as the drug likes a substance called ergosterol, the main lipid in the membrane of a fungus.

                            <p>This is an antibiotic that disrupts the membrane of the fungus. It is very poorly absorbed from the GI system and so its use is limited to fungal infections of the GI tract - for example, oral thrush. Nystatin can also be effective against candidal infections of the vagina and penis.</p>

                            <h4>Griseofulvin</h4>
                            <p>Griseofulvin only has a narrow range of activity. It can be useful in treating dermatophyte infections of the skin and nails due to its ability to be taken up by the basal cells in the epidermis and concentrated in the substance keratin.</p>

                            <p>Protozoa are simple eukaryotic organisms which are made up of a single cell ('protozoa' literally means 'first animal').</p>
                            
                            <h4>Apicomplexa (Malaria)</h4>
                            <p>All members of this family of protozoa are parasitic. The condition known as malaria is caused by this group of protozoa. The bite of an infected female mosquito injects the protozoa into the bloodstream. <strong>Quinine</strong> was the first effective treatment of malaria. It is effective against the erythrocytic forms of all protozoa which cause malaria.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Flagellates</h4>
                            <p>This group of protozoa have flagella which allow them to move. Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted organism causing infection. <strong>Metronidazole</strong> interferes with the DNA of the protozoa so destroying its ability to reproduce. It is usually given orally.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Amoeboflagellates</h4>
                            <p>Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amoebic dysentery, an infection of the GI system. <strong>Tinidazole</strong> may be used in combination with metronidazole to treat amoebic dysentery.</p>
