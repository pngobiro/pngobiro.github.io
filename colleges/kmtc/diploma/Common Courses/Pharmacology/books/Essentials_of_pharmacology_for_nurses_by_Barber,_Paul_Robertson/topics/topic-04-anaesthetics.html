                            <p>Pain is a sensation that lets us know about damage occurring to our tissue. It is one of our defence mechanisms and is important to our survival. Therefore, when we consider modifying the experience of pain, it is important to remember that, although distressing and unpleasant, pain has a role to play in protecting us. Having said all this, it is possible to suffer severe pain without any obvious tissue damage or injury - for example, trigeminal neuralgia (severe burning or stabbing pain in the face arising from one of the nerves carrying sensation). On the other hand, pain may become a dominant feature in a person's life long after tissues have healed - for example, phantom limb pains. It is also possible that tissue damage in one part of the body can lead to pain being perceived in another part of the body. This is called referred pain.</p>
                            <p>Pain is therefore a very difficult concept to define. As it becomes more chronic in nature (i.e. more than six months in duration) it begins to affect all activities of daily living, not just from a physical but also from a psychological and sociological perspective. The nurse has a unique role to play in minimizing pain for patients. In order to carry out this role effectively, nurses need to have some understanding of the drugs used in pain relief.</p>
                            <p>However, before we plunge headlong into the classification of local anaesthetics and analgesics, we need to remind ourselves of the basic principles of, first, the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses, and second, the body's pain pathways and analgesic system.</p>

                            <h3>Neurones</h3>
                            <p>Neurones are specialized cells whose function is to transmit messages. A neurone has branch-like processes called dendrites that convey incoming messages (action potentials) towards the cell body (see Figure 4.1). The cell body houses the nucleus and therefore is the metabolic centre. Conducting impulses away from the cell body we have structures known as axons, which terminate in axon terminals. Housed in the axon terminals are hundreds of small sacs (vesicles), which contain neurotransmitters. The nerve impulse therefore travels from the dendrites along the axon and finishes at the axon terminal where the impulse stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter.</p>

                            <p>Quite a number of neurones are covered with a substance called myelin, formed by supporting cells called Schwann cells, which wrap themselves around the axon. The myelin covering acts as an insulator for the nerve and also affects the speed at which messages can travel along individual neurones.</p>
                            <p>Neurones carrying messages from the internal organs and skin into the central nervous system are called sensory (afferent) neurones. Conversely, neurones carrying messages out of the central nervous system to the muscles, glands and internal organs are called motor (efferent) neurones.</p>

                            <h3>The nerve impulse</h3>
                            <p>At rest, the inside of a neurone has a negative charge compared to the outside, which is positive. This is because the inside of a neurone carries a lot of negatively charged particles called anions.</p>
                            <p>Anions are large particles that find difficulty in moving through the wall of the neurone. The outside of the neurone on the other hand contains lots of positively charged particles called cations. The major cation in our discussion here is sodium.</p>
                            <p>In order to trigger the sensation of pain, the inside of the neurone must become positively charged as compared to the outside. Chemicals liberated by damaged tissue (e.g. bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, potassium and other proteolytic enzymes) bring about a change in the neuronal membrane, allowing sodium to pass into the neurone. As the sodium enters, the membrane becomes even more permeable to sodium. This continues until the inside of the neurone is positively charged in relation to the outside. This build-up of positively charged sodium is termed depolarization.</p>
                            <p>At the synapse, where one neurone meets another, neurotransmitters must be released in order to stimulate the next neurone to continue to pass the message onwards. This process is important when considering analgesics and how they work. Once the neurone has converted to a positive environment, calcium channels in the membrane open, so allowing calcium to enter. The influx of calcium attracts small sacs called synaptic vesicles, which are full of neurotransmitters, towards the synapse. When these vesicles reach the synapse they fuse with the neurone membrane and pour their cargo of neurotransmitter into the synapse itself (see Figure 4.2).</p>

                            <p>The neurotransmitters which are important in the pain pathway are substance $P$, neurokinin $A$ and B, and glutamate. Once the neurotransmitter attaches itself to receptors on the other side of the synapse, this neurone then becomes permeable to sodium and the process continues (see Figure 4.3).</p>
                            <p>Having discussed the initiation and transmission of a nerve impulse, we need now to consider the body's pain pathways.</p>

                            <h3>Pain reception</h3>
                            <p>Pain is received via specialist receptors called nociceptors, which are free nerve endings that lie in the tissues. They are most plentiful in the skin; as you move deeper into the tissues of the body, they become fewer in number. Nociceptors are stimulated by mechanical, thermal and chemical means and have a high threshold. This means that only stimuli indicating some degree of tissue damage are perceived as pain. For example, if you were to apply a heat pad to your skin you would not stimulate your nociceptors until it reached a heat of $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, at which point you would feel a sensation of pain. Nociceptors are non-adapting, which means they are stimulated at the same level of intensity each time the threshold level is reached. In other words, you do not raise the threshold at which the nociceptors are stimulated just because the pain is constant. This is an important aspect to our survival.</p>
                            <p>In addition to noxious stimuli like heat and pressure, nociceptors can become sensitive to a variety of chemicals which are present after local tissue injury. These substances include potassium, serotonin, bradykinin, histamine and prostaglandins.</p>
                            <p>Prostaglandins are normally produced by the body to ensure the smooth running of our internal environment (homeostasis). They are of particular importance when considering certain medicines, such as NSAIDs.</p>
                            <p>Painful stimuli are received by the nociceptors and then transmitted by two different types of nerve fibres: A delta fibres and C fibres. A delta fibres are myelinated fibres, small in diameter, which are stimulated by mechanical means. A myelinated nerve is one covered by a fatty insulating substance called myelin. As the fibres are myelinated they convey impulses very quickly. Stimulation of these fibres leads to sharp prickling pain that the person can easily localize. C fibres are also small diameter fibres but are unmyelinated and so convey impulses more slowly, resulting in a 'burning' or 'aching' pain which is harder to pinpoint. It will tend to be more general in nature, and a good example is abdominal pain.</p>
                            <p>Both A delta and C fibres synapse with the next neurone in the pathway in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It is in this area of the dorsal horn (i.e. the substantia gelatinosa) that Melzack and Wall (1965) proposed a gate-controlled entry for the sensation of pain into the central nervous system. If the gate was opened a person would perceive pain; if the gate was closed a person would not.</p>
                            <p>The sensation of pain is then carried by what are referred to as the spinothalamic tracks, which carry impulses from the spinal cord up to the thalamus. One track carries information from the A delta fibres and the other from the C fibres. These tracks once again synapse in the thalamus and the impulses are conveyed to a number of areas including the sensory cortex, where they are interpreted as pain (see Figures 4.4 and 4.5).</p>

                            <h3>The body's analgesic system</h3>
                            <p>As with other sensory systems in the body, the pain pathway has a descending mechanism (see Figure 4.6). This mechanism constitutes the body's attempt to modify the pain we interpret. In other words, it is our inbuilt analgesic system.</p>
                            <p>This analgesic system commences at an area of the brain called the periaqueductal grey (PAG). This is a tiny part of grey matter that lies in the mid-brain. It receives input from a number of brain areas, among them the hypothalamus, cortex and thalamus. The PAG is thought to be the mechanism by which the gate to pain can be closed. It would certainly explain in physiological terms why psychological approaches to pain management are successful.</p>

                            <p>The PAG connects to an area in the medulla called the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM). This in turn sends fibres down the spinal cord and they interact at the dorsal horn. Therefore, higher brain centres have the infrastructure to open or close the gate to pain in the substantia gelatinosa.</p>
                            <p>While we suggested that substance $P$ was a neurotransmitter which has been implicated in the transmission of pain, there are also a number of peptides that have been discovered which have been implicated in the brain's analgesic system. The three families of these peptides are endorphins, dynorphins and enkephalins. The discovery of these proteins has been very valuable in our understanding of why opiate drugs, such as morphine, have such a unique effect on the body.</p>

                            <h3>Nociceptive (tissue) pain</h3>
                            <p>Nociceptive pain results from tissue damage. Intact pain pathways report this damage via their neurons, and pain is experienced. Nociceptive pain can further be subdivided into somatic and visceral (gut) pain. It can be experienced as sharp, dull, or aching. There may be radiation of the pain, especially visceral pain, but it will not be in a direct nerve distribution. For example, gall bladder pain can radiate to the tip of the left scapula. Nociceptive pain generally responds to NSAIDs and opioids, both of which will be introduced further in this chapter. Conditions associated with inflammation, bone pain and joint disease are particularly responsive to NSAIDs.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Neuropathic (nerve) pain</h3>
                            <p>Neuropathic pain may occur when there is either damage to or dysfunction of nerves in the peripheral or central nervous system. This results in faulty signals being sent to the brain and experienced as pain. Neuropathic pain can be either peripheral (outside the central nervous system) or central (spinal cord and brain) in origin. Examples of neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic zoster pain (peripheral pains) and thalamic pain syndrome (a central pain). Neuropathic pain frequently exists alongside nociceptive pain. Examples include trauma that damages tissue and nerves, burns (that burn skin as well as nerve endings) and external nerve compression. Examples of the latter include tumours that press on (compress) nerves and the pain of sciatica, caused by herniated intervertebral discs pressing on nerves.</p>
                            <p>Patients often describe neuropathic pain as a 'burning sensation'. They may also describe it as feeling like an electric shock or lightning bolt.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes stimuli that usually do not cause pain, such as light touch, may elicit a painful response. A light stroke of the cheek that results in the sudden pain of trigeminal neuralgia is an example of this type of pain. Sometimes patients do not describe the sensation as being 'painful' but rather as feeling unpleasantly strange or 'tingly', rather like an arm feels when it wakes up from 'going to sleep'. This is called a dysesthesia. Diabetic neuropathy commonly results in this type of sensation.</p>
                            <p>Neuropathic pain in the peripheral nervous system frequently follows a nerve distribution. This distribution may follow a particular nerve, as in sciatic pain or trigeminal neuralgia, or may represent the distribution of terminal nerve endings, as in the 'stocking-glove' distribution of peripheral neuropathies. Neuropathic pain is relatively resistant to NSAIDs and opioids, although they may be helpful in certain cases. The other major classes of medications useful for neuropathic pain, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and sodium channel blockers are referred to as adjuvant therapy which will be discussed later.</p>

                            <p>Pain can also be classified in terms of how long a person can feel it for. A relatively short duration and it would be classed as an acute pain whereas a longer duration would lead it to be called chronic pain.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Acute pain</h3>
                            <p>Acute pain starts immediately and the person often refers to it as being sharp or stabbing in nature, they may even describe it as being like an electric shock. As we have discussed earlier, this is like an alarm bell to the body that something is not right and that damage to cells may be occurring. Examples of situations that would lead to acute pain would be:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">fractures of bones;</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">after having surgery;</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">following first degree burns;</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">lacerations to the skin (consider how painful even a paper cut is);</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">dental surgery.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Acute pain can be measured on a scale. It might be a generally mild pain that soon disappears, or it might go to the other end of the scale where a person describes it as excruciating and this pain might last for a number of weeks or months. However, in most cases the cut-off point generally for acute pain would be a period of six months. If it continued longer than this it would probably be considered to be chronic in nature. Also, acute pain usually disappears when the underlying cause of the pain has been treated or healing has taken place.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Chronic pain</h3>
                            <p>If the person continues to complain of pain for longer than a six-month period then it would be classified as becoming chronic in nature. Also in some individuals the pain may persist despite the injury appearing to have healed. Pain signals may remain active in the nervous system for months or years. Chronic pain also leads to other physiological effects in the body therefore the person might also complain of tense muscles, a lack of energy, limited mobility and changes in appetite.</p>
                            <p>Many writers on the subject of pain point out that people start to have an emotional component to their pain when it becomes chronic in nature. Therefore, it would be quite common for the person to become depressed, angry, anxious, or fear re-injury. Such strong emotional responses to the pain may also hinder a person's ability to return to normal work or leisure activities. Chronic pain therefore becomes a very complex phenomenon to treat. Examples of common chronic pain complaints include:</p>

                            <p>Chronic pain might have originated as acute pain, perhaps due to an initial trauma, injury or infection. However, some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of a past injury or physiological evidence of body damage. Indeed, as in arthritis or phantom pain, there might be no known cure for the disease. Chronic pain is sometimes difficult to treat and for health care personnel to understand when the cause of pain is unknown or poorly understood.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Local anaesthetics</h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Local anaesthetics are analgesic drugs designed to be used clinically to produce a reversible loss of sensation in a particular part of the body. Generally, there are two classes of local anaesthetic: ester agents, such as cocaine, procaine and amethocaine, and amides such as lignocaine, pilocaine and bupivacaine. The difference between the two comes down to biochemistry.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Esters are more unstable in solution than amides and are relatively quickly broken down by enzymes in the plasma. One of the products produced when this group of drugs is broken down is a compound known as para-amino benzoate acid (PABA). Unfortunately, this has been associated with allergic responses and hypersensitivity reactions.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The amide group do not have any of the above problems. Therefore, you may find in practice that you come across more drugs from this class.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Mode of action</h3>
                            <p>Local anaesthetics block the sodium channels in the neuronal membrane. We can quite clearly link this back to our discussions on initiating an action potential. If sodium cannot move over the semipermeable membrane then the inside of the neurone does not become depolarized - i.e. the environment remains negative rather than becoming positively charged. Local anaesthetics tend to block conduction more effectively in small diameter nerve fibres and this makes them perfect for the A delta and C fibres described earlier. Therefore, pain is blocked more effectively than other sensations, such as touch. Also, this makes it possible for the doctor to provide a good level of analgesia without too much loss of motor function. You can observe this for yourself in your patients or may even have experienced it following an epidural anaesthetic during labour.</p>

                            <h3>Preparations of local anaesthetics</h3>
                            <p>Local anaesthetics are usually dissolved in a solution which also contains a preservative and fungicide. The dilute preparations are usually presented as percentage solutions of the drug. For example, lignocaine 1 per cent contains 1 g of lignocaine in every 100 ml. The number of $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ can easily be calculated by multiplying the percentage of the strength by 10. Therefore, a 1 per cent solution of lignocaine contains 10 mg of lignocaine to every ml of solution.</p>
                            <p>One of the problems encountered when giving a local anaesthetic is that many of them cause the surrounding vessels to dilate. This leads to rapid absorption of the drug, reducing its effect. For this reason, a vasoconstrictor is sometimes added to increase potency and prolong action. Vasoconstrictors also decrease the chance of systemic side-effects, making local anaesthetics safer. The most common drug added to local anaesthetics is adrenaline.</p>
                            <p>The effect of vasoconstrictors on the potency and duration of action of local anaesthetics varies according to the drug being given and the site at which it is being used.</p>

                            <p>Local anaesthetics are produced that are effective for the skin, eyes, ears, nose and mouth (e.g. pilocaine, lignocaine and amethocaine). When used topically, the onset of action is around 5 to 10 minutes, the drug action lasting between 30 and 60 minutes. This method of application numbs a small area of skin so is ideal for relieving pain from sunburn, minor burns and insect bites. Topical application can also be administered to the surface of the eye allowing certain operative procedures to take place. It must be remembered that these drugs can be absorbed in a significant amount, especially if applied to very vascular areas.</p>

                                <p>If you work in paediatric practice, you will come across EMLA cream. This is a cream eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics, which is usually used to provide surface anaesthesia of the skin in children prior to insertion of a cannula. EMLA cream is a mixture of equal proportions of lignocaine and pilocaine. The medicine should be applied to the skin under an occlusive dressing and should be left for 60 minutes before the procedure. Amethocaine gel is an alternative preparation, which may cause some vasodilation, so being advantageous when inserting a needle into a vessel.</p>

                            <h3>Infiltration anaesthesia</h3>
                            <p>This technique is used to provide anaesthesia for minor surgical procedures such as dental work. Lignocaine and pilocaine are again frequently used and the result is that the patient will feel pressure but no pain. The onset of action is very rapid, while the duration depends on the drug being used, pilocaine having the shortest period of action (15-30 minutes), while lignocaine provides a moderate length of anaesthesia (60 minutes). Bupivacaine has the longest duration of action, at around 200 minutes. Often the effects of the local anaesthetic continue after the procedure is concluded, so providing extra pain relief. As discussed earlier, the addition of adrenaline will increase the quality and duration of these anaesthetics.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Nerve blockade (conduction anaesthesia)</h3>
                            <p>As the name implies, in conduction anaesthesia, the nerves relating to the area being operated upon are blocked with a local anaesthetic. The blockade may be minor (e.g. intercostals) or deep (e.g. brachial plexus). Drugs such as lignocaine are used for minor blocks and have an onset of $5-10$ minutes and duration of 1-2 hours. In a major blockade, the onset can be more variable so communication with the patient is paramount. The local anaesthetic in this case takes a little longer to act ($10-15$ minutes), but has a more pronounced period of analgesia, at about 3-4 hours. Bupivacaine can be effective for up to 10 hours. The advantages of this approach are that a relatively small amount of the drug can be administered to achieve a wide area of anaesthesia. Nerve blockade can also be used in conjunction with a general anaesthetic to reduce the amount of drugs used in the procedure and the resulting side-effects.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Extradural, epidural and caudal anaesthesia</h3>
                            <p>For these procedures, the local anaesthetic is injected between the dura (the outside covering of the brain and spinal cord) and the periosteum of the bones lining the vertebral cord. Either lignocaine or bupivicaine are used in this technique. The advantage of an epidural approach is that a carefully placed needle can achieve a painfree band from about the mid-chest to the midthighs but at the same time allowing the legs to maintain their normal strength. A further local anaesthetic can be administered into a reservoir connected to a fine tube placed in the patient's lower back.</p>

                            <p>This is a specialized procedure which anaesthetizes the lower half of the body and does not maintain leg strength: the patient is unable to move their legs. The local anaesthetic in this case is put directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. The drugs are rapidly taken up, which leads to a faster onset and requires a smaller dose. Care must be taken if using this route of administration in pregnant women, as the volume of the subarachnoid space (see Figure 4.7) is diminished; therefore, reduced doses are required.</p>

                            <p>This is sometimes referred to as a Biers block. First, the limb is elevated to encourage drainage of blood. Further exsanguination is possible by applying a large rubber bandage called an esmachs bandage. A blood pressure cuff would have been applied prior to the procedure and this is now inflated to above the arterial pressure.</p>
                            <p>The local anaesthetic (pilocaine 40 ml of 5 per cent strength) is then injected into a previously cannulated vessel. The anaesthetic agent infiltrates the tissues below the level of the blood pressure cuff. The onset of action is almost immediate, giving excellent anaesthesia for any procedure (for summary of local anaesthetic administration please see Box 4.1).</p>

                            <p>Local anaesthetics are relatively safe as long as they are administered in an appropriate dosage and given into the correct anatomical area. The main areas of unwanted effects from this group of drugs are the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system.</p>
                            <p>It is not surprising that such drugs have a profound effect on the central nervous system considering their mode of action on cell membranes. Initial mild symptoms may include a feeling of dizziness, leading to sensory disturbances. Severe central nervous system responses to local anaesthetics include major convulsions, followed by acute central nervous system depression indicated by respiratory arrest and coma.</p>
                            <p>The cardiovascular effects tend to be associated with myocardial depression and vasodilation. The myocardium loses its ability to contract effectively and coupled with the dilation of vessels this leads to a rapid and life-threatening fall in blood pressure.</p>

                            <p>Before discussing further analgesics it is useful to consider whether a framework exists to help in planning the pharmacological pathway a patient in pain may tread. The WHO (1966) offers what is commonly known as the analgesic ladder. This is a step-by-step escalation of a variety of analgesics depending upon the severity of pain experienced and is administered in standard doses at regular intervals. Step 1 commences with the use of paracetamol and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. If the pain continues the patient moves on to Step 2. This step involves giving the patient a weak opioid such as codeine. If the pain is still not controlled, the final step in the ladder is to administer a strong opioid such as morphine. Progress up the ladder frequently involves using analgesic drugs in combination (see Figure 4.8).</p>

                            <p>NSAIDs are a group of drugs commonly given to patients who complain of mild to moderate pain. These drugs are also known to lower the body temperature (they are antipyretic) and have anti-inflammatory properties (see Chapter 6). Earlier we discussed tissue injury (see p. 44) and how prostaglandin release is implicated in this. When cells are damaged, they release a substance called arachidonic acid. This in turn is utilized in two metabolic pathways, one of these being the cyclooxygenase pathway which creates a number of products, among them prostaglandins (we will revisit these pathways in Chapter 6). Prostaglandins, especially the prostaglandin E series, are responsible for making the nociceptors more sensitive. As a result, when pain producing products, such as bradykinins, are released, greater pain is felt by the individual.</p>
                            <p>NSAIDs are thought to decrease the amount of prostaglandins produced by blocking the cyclooxygenase pathway. Hence this group of drugs is effective for a range of conditions, such as pain from arthritis, toothache, periods and even cancer. The blockage of the pathway is useful in terms of the amount of pain we feel; however, it also produces side-effects.</p>
                            <p>Prostaglandins contribute to our natural balance (homeostasis) and have important roles to play within the body. The prostaglandin E series is responsible for ensuring the mucous lining of our digestive tract remains effective. It also has a role to play in the kidneys, where it helps to maintain the correct pressure for the kidneys to filter water and waste products. Therefore, interference with prostaglandin production has a price and this is shown in the gastrointestinal and renal sideeffects of using this group of drugs.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Aspirin</h3>
                            <p>Aspirin was the first drug to be discovered in this category. It has a long history, going back to the fifth century BC and the Greek physician Hippocrates. Aspirin is a weak acid; therefore, it is absorbed better in an acid environment such as the stomach, although the small intestine absorbs the greatest amount of the drug due to its large surface area.</p>
                            <p>For adults, doses of 300 to 1000 mg are generally given four times a day. The correct dose of aspirin naturally depends on the condition being treated. For mild to moderate pain it is usually given at a dose of 300 to 600 mg four times a day. Due to its gastrointestinal side-effects, it is best given with or after food in an enteric coated form which discourages breakdown in the stomach and small intestine.</p>

                                <p>Aspirin is no longer routinely used with children due to its link with a condition known as Reyes syndrome. This is a rare disorder which affects the liver and central nervous system, usually following an acute viral illness. However, the mortality rate is high at up to 40 per cent.</p>

                            <p>Other contraindications are also associated with aspirin. The drug should be avoided in patients with known allergies to ibuprofen and naproxen, or with kidney disease, peptic ulcers and gastritis. Patients with a tendency to bleeding disorders (e.g. haemophilia) should also avoid this drug. Taking aspirin with other drugs, such as warfarin (see Chapter 7) is also known to increase the chances of gastrointestinal bleeding. Asthmatic patients should be alerted to the possibility of it causing a severe reaction. It is estimated that one in five patients who suffer from asthma run the risk of having a severe reaction to the drug. Aspirin also has a number of other side-effects which are dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Ibuprofen</h3>
                            <p>Ibuprofen is another drug that blocks the enzyme that makes prostaglandins, resulting in lower levels of these in the body. Ibuprofen is prescribed for mild to moderate pain, caused by many and diverse conditions. The usual dose for minor aches and pains, including painful periods and a high temperature, is 200 to 400 mg every four to six hours.</p>
                            <p>As with other drugs in this class ibuprofen is usually enteric coated and should be taken with or just following food. The drug does have suspected interactions. If taken with lithium (a mood stabilizer) it may lead to increased levels of lithium due to its influence on lithium excretion by the kidneys. Ibuprofen has a similar effect on an antibiotic known as gentamycin. Gentamycin levels may rise, thus increasing the risk of sideeffects. It should also be avoided during pregnancy as no adequate studies have been completed on its safety during this period.</p>
                            <p>Side-effects are similar to other drugs in this category, such as rash, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and heartburn (dyspepsia). Renal function is also affected so ibuprofen should be used cautiously in patients who already have a degree of renal impairment or congestive cardiac failure.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Diclofenac</h3>
                            <p>Diclofenac is another NSAID that you will come across on a regular basis. It is frequently prescribed to patients who have pain and inflammation due to rheumatic disease and is often the drug of choice for musculoskeletal pain in the joints, muscles and tendons. It is also becoming increasingly popular as a post-operative analgesic.</p>
                            <p>Diclofenac comes as an immediate-release tablet, a liquid-filled capsule and an extend-ed-release (long acting) tablet to take by mouth. Some diclofenac tablets have an enteric coating designed to prevent the absorption of the drug in the stomach, and thus reduce the risk of stomach irritation and indigestion.</p>

                                <p>Diclofenac dispersible tablets are dissolved in water before taking. The diclofenac solution is rapidly absorbed from the gut, so this type of tablet provides pain relief more quickly than the other types. However, the solution is more likely to irritate the stomach lining, because it doesn't have the advantage of the protective enteric coat. The dispersible tablets are therefore most suitable for shortterm use and should not be used for longer than three months.</p>
                            </div>
                        </aside>

                            <p>Extended release tablets contain a higher dose of diclofenac and are designed to release this slowly and continuously over a few hours. This provides more prolonged pain relief, and these tablets are usually taken once a day, less commonly twice a day.</p>
                            <p>Diclofenac immediate release tablets and capsules are usually taken two to four times a day. Diclofenac can also be given in suppository form or as a gel which is absorbed by the skin.</p>
                            <p>Diclofenac should be taken with food to reduce stomach irritation. The recommended dose for most conditions is $100-200 \mathrm{mg}$ daily. However, the dosing intervals depend on the formulation used and the condition being treated.</p>
                            <p>Like other NSAIDs diclofenac is associated with several suspected or probable interactions that affect the action of other drugs. The most common side-effects of diclofenac involve the gastrointestinal system. The drug can cause ulcerations, abdominal burning, pain, cramping, nausea, gastritis and even serious gastrointestinal bleeding and liver toxicity, rash, kidney impairment, ringing in the ears and lightheadedness are also seen. People who are allergic to other NSAIDs should not use diclofenac. NSAIDs reduce the flow of blood to the kidneys and impair their function. The impairment is most likely to occur in patients with already reduced kidney function or congestive heart failure, and use of NSAIDs in these patients should be approached cautiously. Individuals with asthma are more likely to experience allergic reactions to diclofenac and other NSAIDs.</p>

                            <p>As with ibuprofen, diclofenac may increase the blood levels of lithium by reducing the excretion of lithium by the kidneys. Increased levels of lithium may lead to lithium toxicity. This is particularly important to bear in mind if the patient is being treated with lithium for other problems. Diclofenac may also reduce the blood pressure, lowering effects of blood pressure medications. This may occur because prostaglandins play a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Individuals taking oral anticoagulants such as warfarin should avoid diclofenac because it also affects the clotting cascade by its actions on prostaglandins, which in turn could increase the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) (see Chapter 7).</p>

                            <p>Paracetamol relieves pain and fever in adults and children and is probably the most widely used medicine in fulfilling this role. It can be prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist, but generally it is bought as an OTC medicine. It is over 100 years since the drug was first discovered and we are still learning what the mechanism of action is.</p>
                            <p>Paracetamol does not appear to have any significant action on either of the cyclooxygenase pathways. This helps to explain why it has freedom from the gastrointestinal side-effects typical of other NSAIDs. A third previously unknown pathway is initiated by an enzyme found in the brain and spinal cord. This enzyme is specifically affected by paracetamol and it is this effect that explains its effectiveness in relieving pain and reducing fever without GI side-effects.</p>

                                <p>The recommended adult dose for paracetamol is 1000 mg six hourly, and no more than eight tablets in a 24 -hour period. As long as this dose is adhered to, there are no toxic effects. There are no groups of people who should not take paracetamol and interactions with other medicines are rare.</p>

                            <p>Paracetamol is quickly absorbed by the body and its peak serum levels occur within approximately 30 minutes to two hours after ingestion. Elimination is also rapid: paracetamol has a halflife of about two hours. It is vital that the recommended dose be adhered to, because a substantial overdose of paracetamol is likely to result in liver damage and requires immediate treatment. When paracetamol is broken down by the liver it produces an active byproduct. In order to neutralize this, the liver attaches a substance known as glutathione to it. In overdose, the rate of the byproduct increases far quicker than the liver can manufacture glutathione. Eventually the liver stores are exhausted and the reactive byproduct starts to damage the liver tissue itself.</p>
                            <p>Treatment of overdose requires skilled hospital management. An antidote called n-acelylcysteine is available and is given intravenously. This restores the liver's capacity to produce glutathione and, therefore, protects the liver tissue from damage. It is important that the antidote is administered quickly and it is best given within 12 hours of ingestion. However, it has been shown that even 48 hours post-ingestion the antidote has beneficial effects.</p>

Pharmacies are limited to a maximum 32 -tablet pack and shops are limited to packs of 16 . Multiple packs can be purchased, however, if more than 100 tablets are needed, but a doctor's prescription will be necessary.</p>

                            <p>These drugs commence where the NSAID group finish. Therefore, they are given for moderate to severe pain (please refer to the WHO analgesic ladder). Opioid drugs are a class of natural, synthetic and semi-synthetic agents and are used for their analgesic, anti-tussive (stop you coughing) and anti-diarrhoeal properties. This class of drug is derived from the opium poppy and its properties have been used for centuries.</p>

                                <p>You may find a number of terms that are used interchangeably when describing drugs in this category: 'narcotic', 'opiate' and 'opioid'.</p>

                            <p>All opioids exert their effect through binding with specific receptors called opioid receptors located in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or peripherally in the GI tract. There are four types of opioid receptor and they are designated by the Greek letters $\mu$ (mu), $\kappa$ (kappa), $\sigma$ (sigma) and $\delta$ (delta). Different opioid analgesics bind in different ways with a variety of these receptors, so explaining why a range of effects and side-effects can occur.</p>
                            <p>Opioid drugs are agonistic in nature: they mimic our own endorphins, bringing about a similar analgesic reaction. There are numerous opioid analgesic preparations, some natural (e.g. morphine and codeine) and some synthetic (e.g. diamorphine, methadone, fentanyl and meperidine). We will focus on morphine as a strong agonistic opioid, fentanyl as a synthetic opioid and codeine as a moderate agonist or weak opioid.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Morphine</h3>
                            <p>Opioid drugs are thought to work through a number of mechanisms. You will recall that at the beginning of this chapter we discussed the importance of calcium channels opening in order to bring about the transmission of a nerve signal across a synapse. Morphine is thought to block these channels from opening so that the pain signal breaks down. It is also thought that morphine opens potassium channels in neurones, so making the inside more negative, a condition known as hyperpolarization. This makes the firing of a pain neurone more difficult.</p>
                            
                            <p>The most important effects of morphine occur on the central nervous system and the GI tract and include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Analgesia.</strong> This term refers to the loss or relief of pain but without the loss of consciousness. Morphine is useful in both acute and chronic types of pain. It not only raises the level at which pain is initiated (higher threshold) but also alters the brain's perception of the pain. The person is still aware of the pain but does not recognize it as an unpleasant sensation.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Euphoria.</strong> When a person takes morphine it makes them feel a powerful sense of contentment and well-being, often described as a 'rush'. This in itself is a useful effect as pain often leads to anxiety and agitation. Euphoria tends to be present in patients who are prescribed the drug for acute pain, whereas patients with chronic longstanding pain may lose this effect.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Respiratory depression.</strong> This is caused by the respiratory centre in the brain stem becoming less sensitive to the respiratory drive of carbon dioxide. It is one of the more troublesome side-effects that you need to be aware of, particularly as it can occur with therapeutic doses. It is the commonest cause of death in acute opioid poisoning.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Depression of the cough reflex.</strong> This does not match the analgesic or respiratory depressive effects of morphine. Therefore, weaker opiates, such as codeine, can be used in antitussive preparations.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Nausea and vomiting.</strong> This occurs in up to 40 per cent of people who are prescribed morphine when they first start to take the drug. As they become tolerant of the medicine this effect is reduced. These side-effects are thought to be brought about by morphine's effects on a particular area of the brain known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Pupillary constriction.</strong> 'Pinpoint pupils' are caused by morphine. The drug stimulates a pair of cranial nerves called the occulomotor nerves which cause this phenomenon.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Effects on the GI tract.</strong> Morphine reduces the rate at which the GI system moves (motility). This leads to constipation, which is often severe and very troublesome for the patient. All patients receiving morphine should be considered for an aperient. Morphine also affects the smooth muscle of the biliary tract, causing a rise in the pressure within this system. It is due to this effect that morphine should be avoided in people suffering from biliary colic due to gallstones: if morphine is given it might actually increase the pain rather than lessen it. The general slowing of the gut may affect the absorption of other drugs.</span></li>

                            <p>Despite its side-effects, morphine is still regarded as the gold standard by which other analgesic medications are measured. Absorption of the drug from the GI tract is not particularly good. Significant first pass effect occurs in the liver, and therefore subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injections are usually given.</p>
                            <p>Repeated doses of morphine cause tolerance, resulting in the need to prescribe a higher dose of the drug to achieve the same effect. Physical and psychological dependence does occur.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Fentanyl</h3>
                            <p>Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opiate analgesic similar to but approximately 100 times more potent than morphine, with 100 mcg of fentanyl approximately equivalent to 10 mg of morphine. It is typically used to treat patients with severe pain, or to manage pain after surgery. It is also used to treat people with chronic pain who are physically tolerant to opiates.</p>
                            <p>Fentanyl is a narcotic analgesic acting predominately at the $\mu$-opiate receptor. Apart from analgesia, the fentanyls as a group produce drowsiness and euphoria, the latter being less pronounced than with morphine. The most common side-effects include nausea, dizziness, vomiting, fatigue, headache, constipation, anaemia and peripheral oedema. Tolerance and dependence develop rapidly after repeated use. Characteristic withdrawal symptoms (sweating, anxiety, diarrhoea, bone pain, abdominal cramps, shivers or 'goose flesh') occur when use is stopped.</p>
                            <p>Serious interactions can occur when fentanyls are mixed with heroin, cocaine, alcohol and other central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines. The use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors such as ritonavir has been reported to increase plasma levels and reduce elimination of co-administered fentanyl. As with morphine, overdose results in respiratory depression which is reversible with naloxone.</p>
                            <p>As it has a wide range of uses for both acute and chronic pain, fentanyl comes in a number of formulations, including intravenous injection, lozenges and transdermal patches. Such skin patches should only be used to control moderate to severe chronic (around-the-clock, long-lasting) pain that cannot be controlled by the use of other pain medications in people who are tolerant to narcotic pain medications. Fentanyl patches should not be used to treat mild pain, short-term pain, pain after an operation or medical or dental procedure, or pain that can be controlled by medication that is taken as needed. Patches are usually applied to the skin once every 72 hours. The doctor may start the patient on a low dose and gradually increase this, not more often than once every three days at first, and then not more often than once every six days.</p>

                            <p>Fentanyl skin patches can be habit forming. The patient should be reminded not to apply more than one patch at a time, nor to wear them for any longer than the period prescribed. Equally they should not cease usage without consulting their doctor, as there is a danger of symptoms of withdrawal such as restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, hair standing on end, muscle aches, large pupils, irritability, anxiety, backache, pain in the joints, weakness, stomach cramps, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, fast heartbeat and rapid breathing.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Codeine</h3>
                            <p>Codeine is a less potent analgesic than morphine, and is frequently referred to as a weak opioid. However, it has an advantage over morphine in that it is well absorbed when taken orally, although when increased to higher doses for severe pain the analgesic effect does not increase above a certain range. Large amounts of the drug do not provide extra analgesia; therefore, it is only suitable for mild to moderate pain. Codeine has a lower potential for dependency making abuse of the drug less likely, although cases have been reported. The drug has a good anti-tussive quality at doses that do not produce analgesia; therefore, it has the potential for use in cough medicines. However, in most non-prescription cough medicines it has been replaced by newer drugs such as dextromethorphan, a synthetic narcotic, which has the same anti-tussive properties. Codeine is used in drugs which are classed as analgesic mixtures. For example, co-codamol tablets contain codeine phosphate 8 mg and paracetamol 500 mg. Another example that you may come across regularly is co-dydramol, which contains dihydrocodeine 10 mg and paracetamol 500 mg per tablet.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Opioid antagonists</h3>
                            <p>As discussed above, respiratory depression is a side-effect of opiates. Therefore, in opioid overdose, an antidote is necessary. This comes in the form of a drug called naloxone which has great attraction to all three opioid receptors. Naloxone blocks the actions of morphine and our own endorphins by occupying the opioid receptors but not bringing about any response, so effectively stopping anything else connecting to the receptor. Naloxone therefore quickly reverses the effects of opioid drugs.</p>

                                <p>The main clinical use of naloxone is to treat respiratory depression caused by opioid drugs in overdose, whether accidental or intentional. It is usually given intravenously and its effects are immediate. It has a relatively short half-life as it is quickly metabolized by the liver. Therefore, when treating a patient you may see the drug repeatedly used in order to maintain respiratory function.</p>

                            <p>Opioid antagonists are used in combination with non-opioid and opioid drugs to facilitate the management of pain in patients, particularly complicated and chronic pain. They can be divided into two broad categories: co-analgesic drugs and drugs that are used to relieve the side-effects of analgesics.</p>
                            <p>Co-analgesics include drugs such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, local anaesthetic agents and anxiolytics. Drugs commonly used to treat side-effects include laxatives, antihistamines, neuroleptics and antiemetics.</p>
