      "question": "Arrange the four pharmacokinetic processes (ADME) in the chronological order they typically occur in the body:",
      "points": 15,
      "items": [
        { "id": "item1", "text": "Absorption", "correctPosition": 1 },

      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "Pharmacokinetics follows the ADME sequence: Absorption (entering the body), Distribution (moving to tissues), Metabolism (biotransformation, usually in the liver), and Excretion (elimination, usually via kidneys).",
      "hint": "Think about the journey of a drug from swallowing a tablet to leaving the body."

      "question": "Which term describes the phenomenon where a drug is metabolized by the liver before it reaches the systemic circulation?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Protein binding", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "First pass metabolism occurs when drugs absorbed from the GI tract enter the portal circulation and pass through the liver, where they are metabolized before reaching the rest of the body. This significantly reduces the bioavailability of drugs like Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN).",
      "hint": "This effect is the main reason why GTN is given sublingually rather than swallowed."

      ],
      "explanation": "Anaphylaxis to penicillin is a Type B (Bizarre) reaction because it is not an extension of the drug's normal effect, is unpredictable, and is not dose-dependent. Bleeding, hypotension, and hypoglycemia are Type A (Augmented) reactions—they are exaggerated versions of the drug's intended therapeutic effect.",

      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Both neonates and the elderly have lower levels of plasma proteins (like albumin). Since only 'free' (unbound) drug is active, a reduction in binding proteins means more drug is free to act, potentially leading to toxicity at normal doses.",
      "hint": "Think about protein binding acting as a temporary storage—if storage is low, more active drug is floating around."
