      "points": 10,
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Viruses are intracellular parasites. They live *inside* human cells and use the host's machinery to replicate, making them very difficult to target without damaging human cells. They do not have a cell wall like bacteria.",

      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "1. Vessel constricts to limit flow. 2. Platelets stick together. 3. Fibrin mesh locks it in place. 4. Plasmin eventually dissolves the clot once healed.",
