                        <h3>B. Drug idiosyncrasies:</h3>
                        <p>➢Idiosyncratic reactions are defined as those reactions that occur in patients who have abnormal genes which cause this abnormal response to that drug. Reaction may be excessive and unusual.</p>
                        <p>➢Example: Succinylcholine, a muscle relaxant drug, usually is broken down rapidly by enzymes in the plasma and liver so that the effects of the drug last for only a few minutes. In few patients, a normal dose of this drug produces profound muscle relaxation and suppression of respiration, which may last few hours. Those patients have a genetic defect that produces unusual enzymes & the drug is not broken down.</p>

                        <h3>C. Drug Hypersensitivity:</h3>
                        <p>➢It occurs when the patient shows extreme sensitivity to an effect of the drug. The response is the usual pharmacological effect, however the effect is intense and exaggerated. A simple decrease in the dose may be sufficient to eliminate this type of reactions.</p>

                        <h3>D. Drug toxicity:</h3>
                        <p>➢Excess dosage may be either accidental or intentional, results in an exaggerated response to this drug. It may be sever & may lead to respiratory depression. Cardio-vascular collapse and death may occur if the drug is not withdrawn and adequate treatment is started.</p>

                        <h3>E. General side effects:</h3>
                        <p>➢Unpleasant or unwanted reaction to a drug is termed as side-effects.</p>

                        <h3>Types of orders</h3>
                        <p>➢It is probably obvious, that outpatients are free to medicate themselves with any accessible medication. Many Over the Counter (OTC) drugs are available for the public without the need for a prescription.</p>
                        <p>➢Once an individual is admitted to a clinical institution, usually neither the patient nor the nurse may legally administer any medication without a written order.</p>
                        <p>➢Use of variant or non-standard abbreviations should be avoided because of the danger of misinterpretation.</p>

                            <h4>1. Routine Order:</h4>
                            <p>➢The most common type of orders. It means that the drug, as ordered, is to be regularly administered until a formal discontinuation order is written, or until a specified termination date is reached.</p>
                            <p>➢Automatic termination or stop may be explicit in agency policy; e.g. narcotic analgesics 3 days, Antibiotics 5 days, steroids 7 days ………</p>
                            <p>➢The policies act as a stimulus to the prescriber to evaluate continued need for these drugs that require especial close attention.</p>

                            <p>➢Drug is to be administered once at the time indicated.</p>
                            <p>➢e.g. a preoperative medication (Atropine) 0.4 mg IM on call to OR.</p>

                            <p>➢These drugs are to be administered by the nurse as necessary within the order criteria specified by the doctor order. The decision of when to give the drug is left to the nurse’s judgment.</p>
                            <p>➢Medications to reduce the perception of pain make up the bulk of prn orders.</p>
                            <p>➢Keeping nursing assessment of the pain is required to carry out these prn orders appropriately.</p>
