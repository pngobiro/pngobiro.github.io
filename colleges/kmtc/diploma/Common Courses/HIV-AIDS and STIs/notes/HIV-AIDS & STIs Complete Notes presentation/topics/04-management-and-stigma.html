                        </ul>

                        <h3>1. Nucleoside/ Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)</h3>
                        <p>NRTIs inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase from converting viral RNA into viral DNA, thereby halting HIV replication.</p>
                        <p>Examples;</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <h3>2. Non- Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIS)</h3>
                        <p>NNRTIs inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase by binding directly to it, blocking the reverse transcription process</p>
                        <p>Example are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Integrase Inhibitors</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>They target viral enzyme integrase</li>
                            <li>Integrase is responsible for inserting viral DNA into the host chromosome</li>
                            <li>Integrase inhibitors stop the virus from inserting itself into the DNA of human cells</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Dolutegravir</li>

                        </ul>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Protease inhibitors work by blocking the activity of the viral enzyme protease</li>
                            <li>HIV uses protease to break up large polyproteins into smaller pieces required for assembly of new viral particle</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples:</p>

                            <li>Lopinavir</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>5. Fusion Inhibitors</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>They act by stopping the virus from attaching to the host cell by blocking the $\mathrm{CD}_{4}$ receptors on T cell</li>
                            <li>The virus must attach to CD4 receptors to gain entry into the cells</li>

                            <li>HIV related stigma is part of a " process of devaluation " off people either love living with or associated with HIV and AIDS</li>
                            <li>HIV related stigma is usually pronounced when behavior causing disease is perceived to be under individual's control ( sex work or injecting drug use)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Certain groups ( men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs ) bear heaviest burden of HIV - related stigma- people who are HIV - infected are often assumed to be members of these groups whether they are not or not.</p>

                        <h3>Manifestations of stigma in health facilities</h3>
                        <p>Many studies around the world have documented stigma and discrimination taking place in the health care settings here some examples:</p>
                        <ol type="i" class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Neglect</li>

                            <li>Testing and disclosing HIV status without consent</li>
                            <li>Verbal /abuse/ gossip/ harassment</li>
                            <li>Avoiding and isolating HIV - positive patient</li>
                            <li>Referring patients for HIV testing without counseling</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Other forms of stigma and discrimination</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Informing family members of a patient's HIV status without his her consent</li>
                            <li>Doing the following only with HIV - positive patient
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Burning their bedding upon discharge</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Even loving and surprise caregivers may stigmatize and discriminate against people with HIV ( blaming scolding saying those poodle ) and so may not recognize behavior of as stigmatizing. Stigmatizing happens even among health care workers opposed to HIV related stigma who are not aware of their attitude</p>

                        <h3>Reducing stigma in health facilities</h3>
                        <p>So as to reduce stigma and discrimination, especially in health care setting, interventions must focus on three aspects.</p>
                        <ol type="i" class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Individual level</li>

                            <li>Policy level</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>1. Individual level</h4>

                            <li>At the individual level, it is important to among health care workers on stigma and its consequences ( reduced quality of care, unwillingness to disclose its HIV status and adhere to treatment regimens)</li>
                            <li>Benefits of reducing stigma for the country</li>
                            <li>It is also important to address health care about HIV transmission by giving the complete information about how HIV is and is not transmitted and enforcing the use of the universal precautions</li>

                        <p>Issues of association of HIV and AIDS with assumed immoral and improper behaviors can be addressed by:</p>

                            <li>Helping health care workers to dissociate PLHIV from the behaviors considered improper or immoral often associated with HIV infection.</li>

                        <p>Health care workers should serve as role model by</p>

                            <li>Sometimes, we treat people badly because of how they look or we suspect they do. We isolate them , e.g refusing to sit beside a person suspected to have HIV in the clinic, or we gossip about them and call them names because of the way they look.when we isolate or make fun of other propels, this is called stigma.</li>
                            <li>Stigma is the process in which we ( society) create a " spoiled identity" for an individual or a group of persons. We identify a difference in a person or group, such as physical differences ( physical disfiguration) or a behavior difference ( people having lots of sex) and then mark the difference as a sign of disgrace. This allows us to stigmatize the person or groups. Stigmatized people loose status because of these assigned signs of shame that other people consider indications or evidence of sinful or immoral behavior</li>
                            <li>Stigma is the belief or attitude that leads to discrimination. The action resulting from stigma is discrimination unfair treatment such as people living with HIV getting fire, kicked out of house or they get refused to be treated at the clinic.</li>
                            <li>When we stigmatize people living with HIV, we judge them saying that they have broken social norms hence they should be ashamed, sad, and rejected. They feel unwanted and lose confidence. As a result, they might take less in protecting their health ( e.g stop using clinics and condoms)</li>
