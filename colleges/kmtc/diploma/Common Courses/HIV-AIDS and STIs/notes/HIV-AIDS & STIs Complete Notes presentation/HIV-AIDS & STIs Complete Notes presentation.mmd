HIV/AIDS AND STI's
}

BY
ROBERT ATAADA
MME (continuing)/BMLS/DMLS
Lecturer, KMTC

\section*{MODULE COMPETENCE}
- This module is designed to enable the learner understand the concepts of HIV/AIDS and STIs

\section*{MODULE OUTCOMES}

By the end of this module, you should have gained sufficient skills to:
1. Define common terms used in HIV/AIDS/STIs
2. Appreciate the fundamentals of HIV and AIDS
3. Understand the preventive measures of HIV and AIDS
4. Describe the management of HIV and AIDS
5. Explain Strategic Behavior Change Communication (SBCC)
6. Understand Home and Community-Based Care (HCBC)
7. Understand the concepts of STIs

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
- It is a Retrovirus. HIV Infection is the state where the virus is in the body. In most instances this is the asymptomatic state, which is a prelude to AIDS
- AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
- "Acquired" means it is transmissible, and "Immune-Deficiency" means it damages the body defense system "Syndrome" refers to a group of illnesses

\section*{HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF HIV}
- 1981 - Doctors in the United States recognized it in homosexual males
- 1984- The first case in Kenya was described
- 1986 - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was accepted as the international designation for the retrovirus in a WHO consultative meeting
- 1996 - ARVs became available in the world.
- 1997 - ARVs became available in the private sector in Kenya.
- 1999 - HIV was declared a national disaster in Kenya
- 2003 - ARVs became available in public sector in Kenya

\section*{HIV EPIDEMIC UPDATE 2018 - KENYA}

Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 survey indicated:
- That Kenya's HIV prevalence now stands at 4.9\%.(15-49 yrs)
- The prevalence of HIV in women is at $6.6 \%$, twice that in men at $3.1 \%$.
- The gender disparity in the burden of HIV is even greater than 3 times in between the ages of 20-34 years.
- The top five HIV high-prevalence counties with a prevalence of more than $9 \%$ were Homa Bay, Kisumu, Siaya, Migori and Busia; while prevalence was lowest in nine counties of Samburu, Tana River, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Kiambu, West Pokot, and Baringo

\section*{Most at Risk populations for HIV infection}
- This are populations at highest risk for sexual acquisition/transmission of HIV due to either the number of partners that they have or the higher risk sex that they engage in.
- 30\% of new infections occur among these populations and the vulnerable
1. Intravenous Drug Users
2. Commercial sex workers
3. Men who have sex with men (MSM)
4. Vulnerable: Prisoners; transgender persons, children, women and girls and persons with disability
5. Young people and adolescents. WHY?

\section*{Vulnerable Populations}

These are people who because of their circumstances, are at an increased risk of contracting HIV. They include;
i. Widows and widowers
ii. Opharns and vulnerable children
iii. Families and children living in the streets
iv. Young women aged $15-24$ years
v. Service men and women
vi. Refuges and displaced migrants persons
vii. Fisher folks
viii. Truckers
ix. Alcoholic

\section*{Key determinants of HIV Prevalence}
- Socio cultural Factors like high HIV stigma and discrimination, negative attitude towards consistent use of condoms and gender inequalities.
- High risk sexual behavior characterized by high incidences of concurrent sexual relations linked to mobility, intergenerational sex, transactional sex, denial and marginalization of LGBTQ groups.
- Biological factors including male circumcision and high prevalence of STIs are among the key risks

\section*{Origin of HIV}
- Scientists believe that HIV originally came from a virus particular to chimpanzees in West Africa during the 1930s, and originally transmitted to humans through the transfer of blood through hunting. Over the decades, the virus spread through Africa, and to other parts of the world
- However, it wasn't until the early 1980s, when rare types of pneumonia, cancer, and other illnesses were being reported to doctors that the world became aware of HIV and AIDS.

\section*{Properties of the HIV Virus}
- It is an obligate intracellular parasite, that cannot survive outside the host cell for long
- It depends on the host cell for multiplication/replication.
- It is classified as a prokaryotic - does not have normal cellular organization
- Contains RNA genetic material
- As a retrovirus, it inserts a copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus changing the genome of the host cell
- The structures on its surface (surface antigens) helps the virus attach to host cells
- It is quickly destroyed by heat, and common disinfectants such as JIK (Sodium hypochlorite)

\section*{STRUCTURE OF HIV CELL}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-012.jpg?height=620&width=921&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=460)

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 are responsible for attachment to the host cell
- p17 helps in replication of the virus
- p24 is a distinctive HIV antigen. It is a structural protein that makes up most the of the HIV viral core, or capsid.
- Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that the HIV virus uses to convert its RNA into viral DNA, in a process known as reverse transcription
- Integrase enzyme helps the virus integrate (incorporate) its viral DNA into the host genome
- Protease enzyme is used by the virus to manufacture proteins during viral maturation i.e. processing of the gag and gag-pol polyproteins
- The RNA is the genome of the virus. It plays a central role in viral replication, serving as a template for Gag/Gag-Pol translation and as a genome for the progeny virion

\section*{How HIV Infects the Body}

HIV makes contact with cells located within the genital mucosa

Virus is carried to regional lymph nodes (1-2 Days)

Exponential viral replication

Widespread systemic dissemination to the brain, spleen, distant lymph nodes, etc. (5-11 Days)

\section*{How HIV Affects the Immune System}

HIV attaches to cells of the immune system with special surface markers called CD4 receptors. Immune cells with CD4 receptors include:
- T-helper Lymphocytes
- Macrophages
- Monocytes
- Dendritic cells
- Microglial cells
- The hallmark of HIV/AIDS is profound immunodeficiency as a result depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes.
- The CD4+ T cell dysfunction is two fold ;
- Reduction in numbers
- Impairment in function

\section*{Immune suppression}
- HIV attacks white blood cells, called CD4 cells, that protect body from illness
- Over time, the body's ability to fight common infections is lost
- Opportunistic infections occur

\section*{HIV Disease}

Progression of HIV disease is measured by:
1. CD4 + count
-Degree of immune suppression
- Lower CD4+ count means decreasing immunity
2. Viral load
- Amount of virus in the blood
- Higher viral load means more immune suppression

\section*{HIV Disease}

Severity of illness is determined by amount of virus in the body (increasing viral load) and the degree of immune suppression (decreasing CD4+ counts)

Higher the viral load, the sooner immune suppression occurs
When the body's immunity is suppressed, there will be increased clinical symptoms (such as opportunistic infections)

\section*{Adult problems}

Adults infected with HIV often experience the following clinical problems
* Depending on the stage of HIV infection, PTB can occur at any time.
* As HIV disease progresses, HIV patients develop;

✓ Bacteriat infection (acute respiratory infection, pneumonia, and skin infection)
✓ Fungal infection
More severe conditions occur as immune system deteriorates. Conditions including the following may develop:

✓ Chronic diarrhea
✓ Wasting
✓ PCP
✓ Extra pulmonary TB
✓ Cryptococcal meningitis
✓ Kaposi sarcoma

\section*{HIV Disease: Summary}
- HIV multiplies inside the CD4+ cells, destroying them
- As CD4+ cell count decreases and viral load increases, the immune defences are weakened
- HIV-infected people become vulnerable to opportunistic infections
- HIV is a chronic viral infection with no known cure
- Without ARV treatment, HIV progresses to symptomatic disease and AIDS

\section*{Key Points}
- HIV is a global pandemic and the number of people living with HIV continues to increase worldwide.
- HIV epidemic is especially severe in poor populations
- HIV is a virus that destroys the immune system, leading to opportunistic infections.
- The progression from initial infection with HIV to end-stage AIDS varies from person to person and can take more than 10 years.

\section*{Key Points (continued)}
- The most common main route of transmission worldwide is heterosexual transmission.
- Women of childbearing age are at particular risk for acquiring HIV through unprotected sex
- HIV-positive women who are pregnant are at risk of passing HIV infection to their newborn.
- Risk of HIV transmission from mother-to-child can be greatly reduced through effective PMTCT programs

\section*{HIV Life Cycle}

When the virus infects body, it attacks and multiplies within the host cells (CD4 group of lymphocytes). The host cell eventually gets destroyed when new virus particles are released and proceed to infect other cells
The steps involved are;
1. Binding, fusion and entry
2. Reverse transcription
3. Integration
4. Transcription and translation
5. Assembly, budding and maturation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-025.jpg?height=661&width=1268&top_left_y=102&top_left_x=246)

\section*{1. Binding, fusion and entry}
- During this step, viral gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor on the host surface
- The binding facilitates the fusion of viral and host cell membrane thereby facilitating the entry of viral nuclear material into the host cell

\section*{2. Reverse transcription}
- Viral RNA is reverse transcribed to viral DNA
- This process is mediated by the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT)
- This enzyme has no proof-reading function, and therefore the process is error-prone and responsible for development of drug-resistant mutations

\section*{3. Integration}
- The viral DNA is inserted into host cell DNA using the viral enzyme integrase
- This is the process that establishes replication-competent virus in the body and makes HIV incurable even with effective ART
- Further, drug-resistant virus that occurs in patients on ART may also be achieved in the same way, establishing a permanent pool of resistant viruses.

\section*{4. Transcription and Translation}
- Host cell enzymes transcribe viral DNA into viral RNA
- Viral RNA uses host cell energy and synthetic pathways to make viral proteins

\section*{5. Assembly, budding and maturation}
- Viral proteins and RNA aggregate on the cell surface for assembly into a mature viral particle by budding through host cell membrane

\section*{Types of HIV Virus}

There are two types of HIV.
HIV - 1
- Is found worldwide
- Is the main cause of the worldwide pandemic

HIV - 2
- Is mainly found in West Africa, Mozambique and Angola.
- Causes a similar illness to HIV - 1
- Less efficiently transmissible
- Less aggressive with slower disease progression

\section*{43 (Natural Progression of HIV Disease)}
Natural History of HIV Infection

The natural history of HIV infection refers to the stages in the progression of HIV to AIDS if HIV is left untreated. There are 5 stages;
1. Infection stage - a person gets infected
2. Acute seroconversion: 2-3 weeks
3. Asymptomatic HIV infection (clinical latency): 8 yrs (Avg.)
4. Symptomatic HIV infection/AIDS: 1.3 yrs (Avg.)
5. AIDS

\section*{Cont'd: Progression of HIV Disease}
1. Infection stage - no signs and symptoms
2. Acute seroconversion:
- The body begins to produce antibodies against
- Fever, rash and adenopathy
- Usually 3-6 weeks after exposure
3. Asymptomatic HIV (clinical latency):
- Patient often unaware of infection, antibodies detectable.
- Immune system able to control virus to limited extent and CD4 $>350 / \mathrm{cu} . \mathrm{mm}$
- Able to transmit HIV to others
4. Symptomatic HIV:
- Minor to moderately severe symptoms
- Recurrent symptoms
5. AIDS:
- Severe immuno-suppression associated with opportunistic infections or cancers

Depending on the rate of progression of the HIV infection, there are 4 types of progressors;

Typical progressors - where AIDS develops in 8-10 yrs
Rapid progressors - where AIDS develops within 3 years of infection
Slow progressors - may take up to 15 years to develop AIDS
Long-term non-progressors - where HIV-infected people maintain high CD4+ and CD8+T-cell counts. Take longer than 15 years to develop AIDS

\section*{WHO Clinical Staging of HIV/AIDS}

What is an opportunistic infection?
- An opportunistic infection (OI) is a disease caused by microorganism that does not normally cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system, but that may cause serious disease when the immune system is weakened.
- For example, as the immune system of people living with HIV weakens, they become susceptible to a number of opportunistic infections at different stages of HIV disease progression

\section*{118 - persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL).}

There is an increase of at least two lymph nodes in two different groups, excluding inguinal nodes in adults up to size more than 1 cm , in children more than 0.5 cm in diameter, persisting for at least three month. In stage IIB PGL. is the only clinical manifestation. tymph nodes can decrease and again increase, that is perhaps the alternation of PGL and asymptomatic phase

\section*{PREVENTION OF HIV/AIDS}

\section*{Introduction}
- Although most STIs can be cured except HIV/ AIDS , it is more cost effective to prevent them
- Community education on the risk factors and promotion of behavior change in prevention and control of STIs and HIV are important.
- HIV/AIDS/STIs prevention measures revolve around intervention on sexual behavior of individuals.
- Various intervention measures are needed to control the spread of HIV/AIDS/STIs

\section*{HIV/AIDS Prevention Strategies}
- Despite many years of research, there is no cure for AIDS.
- Hope for fighting the scourge continues to be in prevention of transmission.
- Preventive strategies are therefore aimed at curtailing transmission via known routes of transmission

\section*{Primary Prevention Strategies (activities)}

Primary prevention strategies seek to prevent transmission of HIV to individuals who are not infected yet. The measures include;
1. Sexual behavior change - promoting the adoption of safe sex practices
2. Condom promotion and availability
3. Early treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections
4. Voluntary Counseling and Testing of HIV
5. Voluntary male circumcision
6. Prevention of mother to Child Transmission
7. Blood Safety, screening for HIV
8. Stigma reduction through attitude change
9. Harm reduction for Injecting drug users
10. HIV prophylaxis - PEP and PreP

\section*{Secondary Prevention Strategies}

Secondary prevention strategies target persons who are HIV positive to become partners in the fight to prevent spread of HIV to the general population. This is a holistic approach that involves physical, social, psychological and spiritual interventions. The strategies include;
1. Attitude change - by linking the newly diagnosed to support groups
2. The provision of care for sexually transmitted diseases to PLWHA
3. The provision of Anti-Retro viral medications
4. Provision of care for opportunistic infections
5. Reducing fertility. This alludes to encouraging women who have the infection not to have children
6. Prevention with positives - involving HIV patients in HIV advocacy
7. Health promotion strategies must be pursued aggressively

\section*{75. The ABCD of HIV Prevention}
1. A-Abstinence
2. B - Be faithful to one partner with known HIV Status
3. C-Correct and consistent condom use
4. D - Delayed Sexual Debut

\section*{Barrier Methods and Dual Protection}
- Both male and female condoms, used correctly and consistently can provide protection against STIs, reduce the risk of HIV transmission and also prevent unintended pregnancy.
- Dual protection is the use of one or more methods of contraception that prevent STIs, including HIV and unintended pregnancies. Examples include: birth control pills would be a single method while use of birth control pills and Barrier protection (condoms) would be dual protection.
- The use of dual protection by HIV -infected couples can also protect then from re- infection with variant strains of HIV and effectively help to space their children.

\section*{PMTCT}
- Stands for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV
- Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV may occur at any stage during pregnancy, labour and delivery, or breastfeeding
- PMTCT can be achieved by:
i. Use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) - PreP and PEP
ii. Appropriate infant feeding practices
iii. Safe obstetrical practices

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection during pregnancy, labour and delivery or through breastfeeding is also refer to as vertical or perinatal transmission.
- The overall MTCT rate is approximately $40 \%$ without intervention.

\section*{79 Maternal factors that may increase the risk of HIV}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Pregnancy & labour and delivery & Breastfeeding \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
i. High maternal viral load \\
ii. Viral or bacterial infection \\
iii. STIs \\
iv. Maternal malnutrition \\
v. Anemia
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
i. High maternal viral load \\
ii. Ruptured of membranes \\
iii. Invasive delivery procedures \\
iv. External cephalon version \\
v. Premature delivery \\
vi. Low birth weight \\
vii. Broken skin
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
i. High maternal viral load \\
ii. Duration of breastfeeding \\
iii. Mixed feeding (food or fluids) \\
iv. Breast abscesses \\
v. Poor maternal nutrition status \\
vi. Oral disease in the baby
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Elements of comprehensive PMCTC approach}
i. Element 1: primary prevention of HIV infection
ii. Element 2: Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women infected with HIV
iii. Element 3: Prevention of HIV transmission from women infected with HIV to their infants
iv. Element 4: Provision of treatment,care, and support to women infected with HIV, their infants and their families

\section*{Feeding Options in PMTCT}

Feeding options: exclusive breastfeeding for 6 Months
Benefits of breastmilk;
a) Easily digestable and has all the nutrients and water they need.
b) Available
c) Protects infants against diarrhea and pneumonia
d) Improves brain growth
e) Gives close contact
f) Lowers risk of passing HIV
g) Reduces the mother from getting breast cancer

\section*{82 Other methods of feeding}
- Exclusive breast feeding and early cessation. There is replacement feeding.
- Wet nursing (to breastfeed another's child)
- Expressing and heat treatment of milk

\section*{Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC)}
- This is complete removal of the foreskin of the skin penis by surgical means.
- Though VMMC may be conducted for a number reasons, evidence from research has shown that medical male circumcision can significantly reduce (but not eliminate) men's risk of acquiring HIV through sex.
- HIV prevalence in uncircumcised men ( $16.9 \%$ ) was five times higher than that of circumcised men $(3.1 \%)$. Among men who had sex across all age groups, HIV prevalence was approximately seven times higher among uncircumcised men ( $22.5 \%$ ) compared with those who were circumcised $(3.4 \%)$.

\section*{Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PreP)}

Write short notes on this

\section*{85}

\section*{Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)}
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the administration of antiretroviral therapy to HIV- uninfected persons to reduce their chance of acquiring HIV.

\section*{Overview of HIV Testing and Counselling}

\section*{HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC)}

HIV testing provides:
- Information about HIV status
- Opportunity to identify persons with HIV and empower them to live normal life
- Opportunity to identify persons who are HIV negative and empower them to remain negative

\section*{Definitions}
- HIV testing: process of determining if client is infected with HIV
- HIV counselling: confidential dialogue between an individual or a couple and a healthcare worker (HCW) to help clients examine their risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV
- HIV counselling is tailored to the risk behaviour, circumstances and special needs of the client

\section*{Guiding Principles in Counselling and Testing}
1. Confidentiality
2. Informed consent
3. Post-test support and services

\section*{Guiding Principles}
1. Confidentiality
- Keeping private information shared between HCW and client
- It is an essential element in establishing and maintaining client trust

\section*{Guiding Principles}
2. Informed Consent
- Process during which clients receive clear and accurate information about HIV testing to make an informed decision about whether to accept or decline testing
Consent may be written or oral
The client must give informed consent before being tested

\section*{Guiding Principles}
3. Post-test counselling support and services
- Provide both HIV-negative and HIV-positive clients with test results and counselling
- Inform client that follow-up treatment, care, support are available, including support for disclosure when needed

\section*{Provider-initiated and Client-Initiated Approaches to HIV Testing}
- There are two basic approaches to HIV testing:
1. Provider-initiated
2. Client-initiated
- Both approaches include
- Basic information about providing HIV testing
- Risks and benefits of testing

\section*{Provider-Initiated Approach}
- Also referred to as "opt-out"
- All clients provided with pre-test information
- Testing is still voluntary under the providerinitiated approach
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-094.jpg?height=458&width=355&top_left_y=284&top_left_x=1233)

\section*{Client-Initiated Approach}
- Client specifically requests HIV test
- Also referred to as "opt-in"
- Only clients who specifically request to be tested are provided with HIV testing
- Client gives verbal or written consent
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-095.jpg?height=503&width=342&top_left_y=284&top_left_x=1155)

Counselling Skills

\section*{Role of the HCW in Counselling}

Role of Counsellor: to support and assist client's decision-making process by:
- Listening to client
- Understanding the choices client needs to make
- Helping client explore her/his circumstances and options
- Helping client develop self-confidence to carry out her/his decision about testing

\section*{Role of the HCW in Counselling}
(Continued)

Counsellor is not responsible for:
- Solving all of the client's problems
- The client's decisions

\section*{Counselling Skills: Active Listening}

\section*{Active listening helps establish a trusting relationship with the client}

It involves:
- Listening to and understanding the client
- Taking note of client's non-verbal behaviour
- Listening for client's social and cultural context
- Listening to client's negative comments or feelings-make note of things that may have to be challenged

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills}

Skill 1: Use helpful non-verbal communication
- Includes all aspects of message not conveyed by literal meaning of the words
- It includes the Impact of gestures, gaze, posture and expressions that convey information
- Reflects attitude
- Helpful non-verbal communication encourages client to feel HCW is interested in her

\section*{Non-Verbal Communication}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline R & A relaxed and natural attitude with clients \\
\hline 으 & Open posture should be adopted-it shows that you are open to the client and to what client is saying \\
\hline $\underline{\mathrm{L}}$ & Leaning forward toward the client is a sign of involvement \\
\hline E & Maintain culturally appropriate eye contact \\
\hline S & Sit squarely facing client to show involvement \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills}
(Continued)

Skill 2: Ask open-ended questions
- Open-ended questions begin with "how?" "what?" "when?" "where?" or "why?"
- Encourages responses that lead to further discussion
- Try to avoid questions with a "yes" or "no" answer

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills}
(Continued)

Skill 2: Ask open-ended questions, examples of closed-ended questions:
- You know what HIV is, don't you?
- Do you have any other questions about MTCT?
- Are you going to tell your partner that you tested for HIV today?
- Is your husband your only partner?
- Do you plan to replacement feed?
- How would you revise these questions so that they are open-ended?

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Closed-ended & Open-ended \\
\hline You know what HIV is, don't you? & What is HIV? \\
\hline Do you have any other questions about MTCT? & What other questions do you have about MTCT? \\
\hline Are you going to tell your partner about your HIV test result? & Who are you going to tell about your HIV test result? \\
\hline Is your husband your only partner? & How many partners have you have in the last 3 months? \\
\hline Do you plan to replacement feed? & How do you plan to feed your baby? \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills ${ }_{\text {Conterned }}$}

Skill 3: Use gestures and responses that show interest
- Gestures: nodding and smiling
- Responses: "Mmm," "Aha"
- Attending skills: clarifying and summarizing-invite client to relax, talk about herself and her problems
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-105.jpg?height=527&width=300&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=1102)

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills \\ (Continued)}

Skill 4: Reflect back what the client says
- Encourages client to say more
- Shows HCW is actively listening, encourages dialogue, gives HCW opportunity to better understand client's feelings
- Say what client said in a slightly different way

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills \\ (Continued)}

Skill 5: Empathize-show you understand how she feels
- Used in response to an emotional statement
- Encourages mother to discuss the issue further
- If client says, "I just can't tell my partner that I have HIV," HCW could respond with "You sound like you are afraid to tell your partner your HIV test result"
- HCW is not empathizing if she responds with a question that has a factual answer

\section*{Listening and Learning Skills}

Skill 6: Avoid words that sound judging
- Words like: right, wrong, well, badly, good, enough, properly
- Using these words may make client feels she is wrong, or that there is something wrong with her baby
- BUT, sometimes HCW needs to use "good" judging words to build a mother's confidence

\section*{Common Mistakes in Counselling}
- Controlling the discussion
- Judging the client
- Preaching to a client
- Labelling a client instead of finding out their individual motivations, fears or anxieties
- Reassuring a client without knowing

\section*{Common Mistakes ${ }_{\text {(contersed) }}$}
- Not accepting the client's feelings
- Advising before client has arrived at a personal solution
- Interrogating
- Encouraging dependence
- Persuading or coaxing

\section*{Pre-test Information and Counselling}

\section*{Pre-test Information}
- The purpose of the pre-test session is to provide the client or couple with adequate information to make an informed decision about HIV testing
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-112.jpg?height=410&width=508&top_left_y=309&top_left_x=1072)

\section*{Pre-test Information}

Objectives and components of the pre-test session:
- Help client understand HIV
- Explain importance and benefits of HIV testing
- Explain HIV testing procedures
- Explain importance of partner testing, discordance, disclosure
- Explain risk reduction and available services (sexual, MTCT) and provide referrals
- Encourage continuous healthcare attendance (ANC and post-delivery)

\section*{Delivery of Pre-test Information}

Pre-test session models:
- Group information
- Individual counselling
- Couple counselling
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-114.jpg?height=571&width=409&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=989)

\section*{Couple Pre-test Session}

Advantages of couple counselling:
◯ Partners hear messages together → shared understanding
◯ Environment is safe to discuss concerns
◯ HCW can ease tension and diffuse blame
◯ Post-test counselling messages reflect the test results of both partners
◯ Neither is burdened with disclosure or partner referral
◯ Facilitates risk reduction such as condom use
◯ Prevention (including PMTCT), care and treatment decisions can be made together

\section*{Overview of HIV Testing Technologies}

\section*{Overview of HIV Testing}

HIV tests detect antibodies or antigens associated with HIV in whole blood, saliva, or urine
- Blood sampling is the most common method of testing

HIV tests are very accurate
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-117.jpg?height=461&width=701&top_left_y=385&top_left_x=862)

\section*{Significance of HIV Testing}

HIV testing is important for the following reasons;
1. Helps individuals know their HIV status
2. Helps prevent the spread of HIV - persons who know their status are better informed on preventive measures
3. Helps assess the prevalence of HIV in general population
4. Facilitates initiation of HIV management in infected persons
5. Helps monitor the effectiveness of ARVs (by testing for CD4 and viral load)

\section*{Types of HIV Tests}

Broadly, rapid and non-rapid tests are used to test for HIV

Assignment:
Differentiate between Rapid and Non-rapid HIV tests

\section*{HIV Rapid Tests (Antibody Tests)}
- After infection with HIV, the body makes antibodies to fight the virus
- It may take 4 to 6 weeks, but occasionally up to 3 months for antibodies to become detectable in the blood
- During this time, a person can still transmit the virus to others
- Rapid HIV tests are the most common tests in VCT and PMTCT settings

Examples;
i. Western blot
ii. Determine
iii. Unigold
iv. Genie II
v. Hema-strip
vi. Ora-Quick

\section*{Cont'd: Rapid tests}
- Accurate results within 20-40 minutes
- Can be done in the clinic setting
- Accurate when performed correctly
- Usually performed on serum or whole blood (by fingerprick or venous sample); some rapid HIV tests use saliva
- No batching required
- HCWs can be trained to perform the tests
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-121.jpg?height=408&width=363&top_left_y=197&top_left_x=1191)
- Usually do not require special equipment, electricity or refrigeration

\section*{Body Fluids Used for HIV Rapid Testing}
- Serum
- Plasma
- Whole blood
- Oral fluids

\section*{Interpreting Rapid Test Results}

There are only three possible outcomes for single HIV antibody tests:
1. Reactive or "Positive"
- Test band
- Control band
2. Non-reactive or "Negative"
- Control band only
3. Invalid
- No control band present
- Test has failed. Repeat with new device.

\section*{Reading Results: Determine \\ \section*{Reading Results: Determine}}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-124.jpg?height=709&width=993&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=273)

\section*{cont'd...}
- A positive HIV test means that antibodies to HIV are present. It does not mean that the client has AIDS
- A negative HIV test can mean:
- The person is not infected with HIV, or
- The person is infected with the virus but is in the window period

A negative test does not mean that person cannot become infected. There is no such thing as immunity to HIV infection

\section*{Rapid HIV Testing Algorithms}
1. Serial testing
- Blood sample taken and tested once
- If first test result is non-reactive, result is given to client as HIV-negative
- If first test result is reactive, blood sample is tested again using different brand of rapid test
- If second test is reactive, result is reported as HIV-positive
- If second test is negative, a third test known as a "tiebreaker" is performed

\section*{Rapid HIV Testing (Serial testing)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-127.jpg?height=529&width=845&top_left_y=273&top_left_x=413)

\section*{Rapid HIV Testing Algorithms}
2. Parallel testing
- Two HIV tests are performed on same sample at the same time, e.g., in parallel
- If both are non-reactive, client reported HIV-negative
- If both are reactive, client reported HIV-positive
- If one is reactive and the other non-reactive, a "tiebreaker test" is performed

\section*{Rapid HIV Testing (Parallel Testing)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-129.jpg?height=423&width=963&top_left_y=305&top_left_x=373)

\section*{HIV Rapid Tests: Advantages}
i. Rapid tests increase access to HIV prevention (VCT) and interventions (PMTCT)
ii. Supports increased number of testing sites
iii. Same-day diagnosis and counseling
iv. Robust and easy to use
v. Test time under 30 minutes
vi. Most require no refrigeration
vii. None or one reagent
viii. Minimal or no equipment required
ix. Minimum technical skill

\section*{Cont'd....}
x. On-site testing and same day results
xi. Lower risk of administrative error
xii. Widely accepted by clients
xiii. Fewer resources required:
- Human resources
- Resources at the facility
- Financial resources

\section*{HIV Rapid Tests: Disadvantages}
i. Only a few tests can be done concurrently
ii. Need for quality assurance/quality control at multiple sites
iii. Test performance varies by product
iv. Refrigeration required by some products, e.g., Capillus
v. There may be reader variability in interpretation of results
vi. Limited end-point stability of test results (results may appear different after some time)

\section*{Non-rapid Tests (HIV Viral Tests)}
- Viral tests detect the presence of HIV in blood
- Viral tests are performed by trained personnel in the laboratory
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-133.jpg?height=319&width=232&top_left_y=474&top_left_x=1098)

\section*{HIV Viral Tests}
- There are two types of viral tests:
- p24 antigen test: measures one of the HIV proteins used for screening blood and for infant diagnosis
- PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests:
- DNA PCR detects presence of HIV in blood and is used for infant diagnosis
- RNA PCR detects and measures amount of virus in blood (viral load)

\section*{Assignment}
1. What are the advantages of HIV antigen tests over antibody/rapid tests?
2. What are the demerits of HIV antigen tests

\section*{CD4 T-Lymphocyte Counts}

CD4 T-lymphocyte counts used for:
-Determining clinical prognosis
- Assessing criteria for antiretroviral therapy
- Monitoring therapy
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-136.jpg?height=412&width=427&top_left_y=341&top_left_x=1204)

\section*{Viral Load Test}
- The viral load test measures amount of HIV in blood
- Used to:
- Predict disease progression
- Assist with deciding when to initiate anti-retroviral therapy
- Monitors response to anti-retrovirals

\section*{Discordant couple}
- Refers to situation where one of the sex partners is HIV positive whereas the other one is HIV negative.
- The HIV negative partner is at risk for HIV acquisition and so requires a coupe specific HIV prevention package
- In line with the WHO guidelines, the HIV negative client should be retested 4 weeks after initial testing then after 6 months and thereafter annually

Post-test Counselling

\section*{Post-test Counselling}
- All HIV test results, whether positive or negative, must be given in person, privately (as a single client or couple)
- Put the client or couple at ease
- Where possible, provide a quiet and private room for the discussj
- Ideally, the same HCW who conducted the pre-test session will also conduct the post-test session
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-140.jpg?height=491&width=519&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=898)

\section*{When Client Tests HIV-negative}

Post-test counselling provides an opportunity for client to:
- Learn how to protect themselves from HIV infection

\section*{When Client Tests HIV-negative ${ }_{\text {(continues) }}$}

Objectives of the post-test session:
1. Provide HIV test result and assess understanding of result
2. Identify and address client questions
3. Discuss:
- Partner HIV testing and disclosure
- Safer sex and risk reduction
- Exclusive breastfeeding
- Antenatal care, post-delivery care
- Importance of delivering in a healthcare facility
- Infant care
4. Provide referrals, take-home information

\section*{When Client Tests HIV-positive}
- Client reactions to results can range from acceptance to disbelief
- Remain non-judgemental, supportive and confident throughout the counselling process
- Encourage client to return for visits and follow-up HIV post-test counselling

\section*{When Client Tests HIV-positive ${ }_{\text {(continues) }}$}

Objectives of the post-test session:
- Same as for post-test session when client tests HIV-negative, but counselor should additionally discuss:
- ARV therapy or prophylaxis
- Infant feeding options
- Treatment and support services for client and family

\section*{Disclosure of HIV Status}
- Disclosure is informing others of a test result
- Clients who disclose are in a better position to:
- Encourage partner(s) to be tested
- Prevent transmission of HIV to partner(s)
- Access PMTCT interventions
- Receive support from partner(s) and family

\section*{It is important to respect client's choice regarding timing and process of disclosure}

\section*{Management of HIV/AIDS}

\section*{DRUGS FOR HIV/AIDS}
- Drugs which suppress HIV have been named antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) due to their ability to slow down HIV activity. Therapy that uses ARVS is called ART (antiretroviral therapy)
- ART is once of the components of comprehensive HIV care, it works best when other components are in place.
- ARVS improve the quality of life by stopping the virus from multiplying and allow the body to recover.
- Although patients on ARVS may appear healthy, and gain weight, they can still infect other people.
- Side effects and other problems may occur due to ART

\section*{Goals of ART}

The goal of antiretroviral therapy is to;
i. Reduce the amount of HIV virus in the body
ii. Support and restore the immune system
iii. Reduce HIV illnesses and death
iv. Improve the quality of life
v. Reduce general risk of transmission in the public

\section*{Types of ARVs and How They Work}
- ARVS act on the HIV virus by interfering with its viral cycle.
- There are 5 classes of ARVs currently in use namely;
- Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
- Non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
- Integrase inhibitors
-. Protease inhibitors
- Fusion inhibitors

\section*{1. Nucleoside/ Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)}

NRTIs inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase from converting viral RNA into viral DNA, thereby halting HIV replication.
Examples;
- Abacavir (ABC)
- Zidovudine (AZT)
- Lamivudine(3TC)
- Tenofovir

\section*{2. Non- Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIS)}

NNRTIs inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase by binding directly to it, blocking the reverse transcription process
Example are:
- nevirapine (NVP)
- efavirenz (EFV)
- Etravirine

\section*{3. Integrase Inhibitors}
- They target viral enzyme integrase
- Integrase is responsible for inserting viral DNA into the host chromosome
- Integrase inhibitors stop the virus from inserting itself into the DNA of human cells

Examples
- Dolutegravir
- Raltegravir
- Cabotegravir

\section*{4. Protease Inhibitors (PIs)}
- Protease inhibitors work by blocking the activity of the viral enzyme protease
- HIV uses protease to break up large polyproteins into smaller pieces required for assembly of new viral particle

Examples:
- Lopinavir
- Atazanavir
- indinavir

\section*{5. Fusion Inhibitors}
- They act by stopping the virus from attaching to the host cell by blocking the $\mathrm{CD}_{4}$ receptors on T cell
- The virus must attach to CD4 receptors to gain entry into the cells

Example (only one available): Fostemsavir

HIV STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION

\section*{Stigma and discrimination}
- HIV is not only the greatest public health challenge of our time, but it is also the greatest human rights challenges.
- People love going with HIV are burdened not only with the disease but also with stigma and discrimination
- Stigma and discrimination remain major barriers to,preventing HIV transmission and providing treatment, care and support to,people who are HIV - infected and their families.
- The most effective responses to HIV epidemic are those that work to prevent stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and protect the human rights of people living with HIV and those at risk

\section*{What is stigma and discrimination?}
- Stigma refers to unfavorable attitudes and beliefs directed towards someone or something.
- HIV related stigma refers to unfavorable attitudes and beliefs directed towards people living with HIV, their family and friends social groups, and communities.
- HIV related stigma is part of a " process of devaluation " off people either love living with or associated with HIV and AIDS
- HIV related stigma is usually pronounced when behavior causing disease is perceived to be under individual's control ( sex work or injecting drug use)

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Certain groups ( men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs ) bear heaviest burden of HIV - related stigma- people who are HIV - infected are often assumed to be members of these groups whether they are not or not.
- Members of these groups are already heavily stigmatized and are more likely to fade desrimination than others when diagnosed with HIV infection, especially when the behavior linked to the origin of the infections is perceived to be under the individuals control such as sex work, gay sex or injection of drugs.

\section*{The main forms of stigma include}
i. Physical and social isolation from family, friends and community
ii. Shaming and blaming people by condemning them for their behavior
iii. Depriving people of their right and decision making
iv. Self - stigma :- when people blame and isolate themselves
v. Secondary stigma :- th bus,ily and friends of people living with HIV are also stigmatized.
vi. Stigma by looks appearance, or by types of occupation or lifestyle

\section*{EXAMPLE OF SELF STIGMA}

Examples of self stigma and stigmatizing attitude are numerous;
i. Believing HIV is Devine punishment for moral misconduct
ii. Thinking women are responsible for transmitting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in the community
iii. Feeling "dirtied" by contact with PLHIV
iv. Stigma in language : referring to AIDS as "that disease" or to PLHIV as "walking corpses" or "those expected to die"

\section*{CAUSES OF HIV - RELATED STIGMA}

Research conducted all round the world has revealed 3 key causes of HIV -related stigma in the community setting
i. Lack of awareness of what stigma looks like and why it was damaging
ii. Fear of causal contact stemming from incomplete knowledge about HIV transmission ( with high levels of fear of contagion among health workers) (fear of death)
iii. Values linking people with HIV to improver or immoral behavior
iv. Fear and ignorance - people do not have clear idea of how HIV can and cannot be transmitted
v. Gender and poverty: women get stigmatized more than men and rich people.

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Appearance: person living with HIVs appearance e.g thinness, and ski rashes is used as a basis of stigmatizing
- Media images: images of horrible death make people afraid of people living with HIV

\section*{Fear of stigma stops people from;}
- Getting tested
- Disclosing to partners
- Accessing treatment for opportunistic infections
- Fear of stigma keeps HIV underground

\section*{Effect of stigma}
- Personal effect : shame, isolation, withdraw, feeling excluded, loss of self esteem , rights, reputation and hope
- Feeling unproductive:- self blame,self hatred, take more risks, stress, anger, violence, alcoholism, depression, suicide
- Family : family quarrels, blame, and conflicts,,Devore and separation
- Community : fired from work, forced to leave community drop out of school

\section*{Strategies for fighting stigma}

✓ Deal with the stigmatizer privately not publicly
✓ Do not get upset
✓ Do not crisis the stigmatizer
✓ Help the stigmatizer to know how it feels to be treated like this
✓ Empower the person living with HIV to speak for his elf
✓ Get other family members to hep challenge the stigma

\section*{DISCRIMINATION}
- Discrimination: the treatment of an individual or group with prejudice preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.
- Discrimination includes the denial of basic human rights such as health care, employment, legal services and social welfare benefits
- People living with HIV are kicked out of the family, home work or organization's

\section*{Example of discrimination}
i. Health care worker denies services to person who is HIV -infected
ii. Family or village rejects wife and children of man who died of AIDS
iii. Man loses job because people Learn that he is HIV -related
iv. Community rejects woman who decides not to breastfeed because they assume she is HIV - infected.
v. HIV-infected clients receive poor care are clinic because of health care worker's fears about caring for people infected with HIV.

\section*{Stigma and discrimination are linked}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_19_d298b32674afbb45dceeg-170.jpg?height=669&width=1527&top_left_y=139&top_left_x=89)

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Stigma is an attitude directed towards a person but discrimination is an act
- Discrimination follows stigma and is the unfair and unjust treatment of an individual based on his her real or perceived HIV status.

\section*{Human rights in relation to HIV}
i. All people have a right to make decides about sexual and reproductive health
ii. People have the right to HIV testing and counseling and to know their HIV status
iii. People have a right to chose not to be tested or to choose not to be told their test results.

\section*{Manifestations of stigma in health facilities}

Many studies around the world have documented stigma and discrimination taking place in the health care settings here some examples:
i. Neglect
ii. Different treatment
iii. Denial of care
iv. Testing and disclosing HIV status without consent
v. Verbal /abuse/ gossip/ harassment
vi. Avoiding and isolating HIV - positive patient
vii. Referring patients for HIV testing without counseling

\section*{Other forms of stigma and discrimination}
- Informing family members of a patient's HIV status without his her consent
- Doing the following only with HIV - positive patient

✓ Burning their bedding upon discharge
✓ Charging them for the cost infection control supplies
✓ Using gl bed during all interactions,regardless

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Even loving and surprise caregivers may stigmatize and discriminate against people with HIV ( blaming scolding saying those poodle ) and so may not recognize behavior of as stigmatizing.
- Stigmatizing happens even among health care workers opposed to HIV related stigma who are not aware of their attitude

\section*{Reducing stigma in health facilities}
- Stigma and discrimination are now recognized as one of the greatest challenges to slower no the spread of the diseases key barriers to the delivery of quality services by health providers and their utilization.
- HIV -related stigma is particularly harmful to any efficient response.
- The pervasive effects of HIV -related stigma and discrimination are devastating in many ways and have been documented in many studies

\section*{Cont'd...}

So as to reduce stigma and discrimination, especially in health care setting, interventions must focus on three aspects.
i. Individual level
ii. Environmental level
iii. Policy level

\section*{Individual level}
- At the individual level, it is important to among health care workers on stigma and its consequences ( reduced quality of care, unwillingness to disclose its HIV status and adhere to treatment regimens)
- Benefits of reducing stigma for the country
- It is also important to address health care about HIV transmission by giving the complete information about how HIV is and is not transmitted and enforcing the use of the universal precautions

\section*{Cont'd...}

Issues of association of HIV and AIDS with assumed immoral and improper behaviors can be addressed by:

✓ Helping health care workers to dissociate PLHIV from the behaviors considered improper or immoral often associated with HIV infection.
✓ Providing health care workers with a safe space to reflect on the underlying values that lead to the shame and blame

\section*{Cont'd...}

Health care workers should serve as role model by
✓ Treat PLHIV same clients assumed to be HIV - negative
✓ Be aware of own feelings,thoughts attitudes about HIV
✓ Ensure feelings, thoughts, attitudes do no have negative effect on care provided

\section*{2. ENVIRONMENTAL LEVEL}
- At the environmental level, it's important to ensure availability to health workers of the information, supplies and equipment necessary to practice universal precautions and prevent occupational transmission of HIV
✓ Gloves for invasive procedures
✓ Sharp containers
✓ Adequate water and soap or disinfectant for hand washing
✓ Post-exposure

\section*{Cont'd...}

At the policy level, policies need to be enacted that protect the safety of patients, as well as health workers, to prevent discrimination against PLHIV

✓ Developed in a participatory manner
✓ Clearly communicated to staff
✓ Routinely monitored after implementation
* All staff members need to be involved, not just health professional. This included doctors, nurses, guards cleaners, and supportive staff
- Training needs to be provided on both stigma and universal precautions

\section*{Summary}
- Sometimes, we treat people badly because of how they look or we suspect they do. We isolate them , e.g refusing to sit beside a person suspected to have HIV in the clinic, or we gossip about them and call them names because of the way they look.when we isolate or make fun of other propels, this is called stigma.
Stigma is the process in which we ( society) create a " spoiled identity" for an individual or a group of persons. We identify a difference in a person or group, such as physical differences ( physical disfiguration) or a behavior difference ( people having lots of sex) and then mark the difference as a sign of disgrace. This allows us to stigmatize the person or groups. Stigmatized people loose status because of these assigned signs of shame that other people consider indications or evidence of sinful or immoral behavior

\section*{Summary}
- Stigma is the belief or attitude that leads to discrimination. The action resulting from stigma is discrimination unfair treatment such as people living with HIV getting fire, kicked out of house or they get refused to be treated at the clinic.
- When we stigmatize people living with HIV, we judge them saying that they have broken social norms hence they should be ashamed, sad, and rejected. They feel unwanted and lose confidence. As a result, they might take less in protecting their health ( e.g stop using clinics and condoms)

\section*{SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE COMMUNICATION (SBCC)FOR HIV PREVENTION}
- Social Behaviour Change Communication is the use of communication to change behaviours including service utilization, by positively influencing peoples' knowledge, attitudes and social norms.
- Reducing the spread of HIV and improving care and treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS requires addressing social factors and behaviors that put people at risk.
- Social and behavior change communication (SBCC) goes beneath the surface to uncover the causes of the behaviors as well as the social structures that drive the epidemic and the factors that increase risk and vulnerability

\section*{Cont'd...}
- The key principle of social behaviour change approach is promoting positive behaviour change. Community engagement, ownership and empowerment at the community level are needed for the behaviour change approach, which focuses on activities that create and sustain an enabling environment for behaviour change.
- Behavior change communication (BCC) is an approach used to support individual' ability to adopt and maintain a new positive behavior.
- This approach aims at increasing knowledge, stimulating dialogue and ensuring that people are given accurate and timely information about HIV and AIDS in their preferred language or medium.

\section*{Cont'd...}
- The shift in terminology from BCC to SBCC is a recent milestone in health communication
- SBCC puts emphasis on improving health outcomes through more healthful individual and group behaviours, as well as strengthening the social context, systems and processes.

\section*{Evolution of Behaviour Change}

Health Education
- BCC

SBCC
- Older approaches tried to persuade individuals to change their behaviours
- Newer approaches try to create an enabling environment to encourage healthy behaviours
- New approaches look for tipping points of change that need to address social change as much as individual behaviour change

\section*{Cont'd}
- BCC approaches that ensure young people have the knowledge, skills, self esteem and support (through youth-friendly comprehensive reproductive health services) to make appropriate and responsible sexuality decisions that empower them to avoid HIV infection.
- Involving young people themselves, parents, teachers, the religious community and policymakers is essential in reversing the current trend and changing the epidemic's course.

\section*{Key Elements of SBCC}
1. Communication using channels and themes that fit the target audience's needs and preferences.
2. Behaviour change through efforts to make specific health actions easier, feasible, and closer to an ideal, that will protect or improve health outcomes.
3. Social change to achieve shifts in the definition of an issue, people's participation and engagement, policies, and gender norms and relations.

\section*{THE PROCESS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE}

\section*{Behaviour Change and Sexual Health}
- Behaviour plays an important role in a person's health.
- Behaviour is the way in which a person acts in response to a particular situation or stimulus
- Human behaviour determines the health of the individual and the community
- Some of the human behaviours can have a major impact on community mortality and morbidity (eg: unprotected sexual behaviours can cause Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) including HIV infections and unwanted pregnancies).
- Many health interventions use Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) to change the behaviour in a positive way to improve the health of the community

\section*{Cont'd...}
- Human sexual behaviour is any activity occurring in solitude, between two persons, or in a group, that induces sexual arousal
- Sexual behaviours are very sensitive and private in each one's life
- however, it is important to promote desirable sexual behaviours to promote health.

\section*{Cont'd...}

Social behaviour change communication aimed to achieve UNAIDS targets of 90-90-90 by 2020 i.e.
1. $90 \%$ of all people living with HIV to know their HIV status
2. $90 \%$ of people diagnosed with HIV to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and
3. $90 \%$ of people receiving Anti Retroviral Theraphy (ART) to have viral suppression

\section*{Continuum of HIV Services}
- Continuum of HIV services refers to a comprehensive package of HIV prevention, diagnostic, treatment, care and support services provided for people at risk of, or living with HIV, and their families.
- Examples of these services include combination of HIV prevention including preexposure prophylaxis, HIV testing and linkage to care, management of opportunistic infections and other co-morbid conditions, initiating, maintaining and monitoring ART, switching to second-line and third-line ART, and palliative care.
- Continuum of HIV care refers to a comprehensive package of HIV services for people living with HIV (PLHIV).

\section*{Goals of SBCC}

Generally, the goals of SBCC are to;
1. Increase condom use.
2. Increase appropriate STI care seeking behavior.
3. Delay sexual debut.
4. Reduce number of partners.
5. Increase perception of risk or change attitudes towards use of condoms.
6. Increase demand for services.
7. Create demand for information on HIV and AIDS.
8. Create demand for appropriate STI services
9. Interest policymakers in investing in youth -friendly VCT services.
10. Promote acceptance among communities of youth sexuality and the value of reproductive health services for youth.

\section*{Desirable Behaviors in SBCC}
- Acceptance and use of VCT services
- Using condoms and using a separate one for each sexual activity
- Using lubricants for anal sex by MSM
- $100 \%$ adherence to ART
- Regular CCC follow-ups
- Involving partners/clients in HIV/STI interventions
- Empathy of general population towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs)

\section*{Guiding Principles for SBCC}
i. SBCC should be integrated with all HIV program goals from the start
ii. Formative BCC assessments must be conducted to improve understanding of the needs of target populations, as well as of the barriers to and supports for behavior change that their members face
iii. The target population should participate in all phases of SBCC development and in much of implementation.
iv. Stakeholders need to be involved from the design stage.
v. Having a variety of linked communication channels is more effective than relying on one specific one.
vi. Pre-testing is essential for developing effective BCC materials.
vii. Planning for monitoring and evaluation should be part of the design of any BCC program.
viii. SBCC strategies should be positive and action-oriented.
ix. PLHA should be involved in BCC planning and implementation.

\section*{199 Steps for developing an HIV/AIDS BCC program}

Step 1; Advocacy and stakeholder involvement
Step 2: Identification and segmentation of target populations
Step 3: Formative assessment for SBCC

Aims to secure much needed financial resources and improve existing policies, guidelines and procedures by influencing concerned public leaders and other stake holders.

Example of targeted advocacy activities include:
i. engaging policy makers in review of policies and legislation
ii. educating community leaders or sensitization of the media.

\section*{2. Behavior communication intervention}
- Seeks to increase awareness, influence social norms, induced behavior change among targeted sub-populations and improve interpersonal communication and Counseling between service providers and the target community.
- Specific BCI activities may include disseminating accurate information and addressing misconceptions about HIV-related risky behaviors, educating and encouraging key population groups to individuals to access the available health services and promoting peer-based approaches that enhance service uptake

\section*{3. Social Mobilization}
- Aims to change societal norms, to improve services and build community support by bringing groups together to fight stigma and address underlying social problems at the community level.
- Specific activities may include promoting dialogue and health seeking behavior through awareness - raising at community level.

\section*{Strategies used in BCC}
1. Media campaigns
2. Use of interactive media and multiple channels to facilitate behaviour change
3. Use of mass media to reach a broad audience and introduce new desirable behaviours
4. Combining education with entertainment to engage young people and also connecting youth with parents or other role models, schools, communities and religious groups.
5. Empowering young people in planning and implementing youth-related HIV and AIDS interventions
6. Use of peer counseling
7. Use of community outreaches
8. Changing gender norms by building partnerships between men and women that transform attitudes and beliefs about gender that fuel the epidemic

\section*{? ?}

\section*{SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIs)}

\section*{Definition}
- The abbreviation STIs stand for sexually-transmitted infections
- They are viral, bacterial or parasitic infections that are spread from person to person during sexual contact.
- Other modes of transmission may be through blood transfusion, and from mother-to-child during pregnancy or delivery
- There are so many STIs in the world which are curable but HIV is the most serious STI.

\section*{224}

\section*{Epidemiology of STIs}
- More that 1 million people acquire STIs everyday around the world
- The most common STIs in Kenya are;
i. Chlamydia
ii. Gonorrhoea
iii. Syphilis
iv. Herpes
v. Genital warts
vi. Trichomonas vaginalis
- Chlamydia is the most prevalent, affecting mostly those aged 25-29 years.
- Candidiasis is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be transmitted during vaginal intercourse

\section*{Risk factors for STIs}

\section*{A. Behavioral risk factors}
1. Having multiple sex partners
2. Sex with commercial sex workers
3. Having unprotected sexual intercourse

\section*{B. Biological Risk factors for STIs}

\section*{Biological risk factors include;}
1. Age
2. Sex of the individual
3. Low immune status of the host
4. Virulence of the organism causing STI

\section*{C. Socio-cultural Risk Factors for STIs}
1. Occupations involving a lot of travelling e.g. long distance drivers
2. In some societies, where men's risky behavior of multiple sexual partners is tolerated
3. Early girl-child marriages to adults exposes the girl to infection
4. High numbers of single poorly paid and unemployed young people
5. Rural-urban migration
6. Sexual intercourse for pleasure and gain

\section*{Complications Associated with STIs}

Failure to diagnose and treat STIs may result in serious complications
i. Increased risk of acquiring HIV
ii. They may cause infertility in both men and women
iii. Increased risk to cervical cancers
iv. They cause pregnancy complications e.g. ectopic pregnancy
v. Still birth
vi. Neonatal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum caused by maternal gonorrheoa)
vii. Urethral stricture which can lead to renal failure in men
viii. Painful intercourse
ix. Congenital blindness \& congenital malformations
x. Death- HIV infection within 10yrs or more or within 1-2yrs after onset of serious illness

\section*{Reasons why STIs are prevalent}
1. Avoiding treatment
- Lack of symptoms- failure to recognise $\mathrm{s} / \mathrm{s}$
- Lack of access of health care
- Preference to traditional healers
- Fear of stigma, lack of confidence on health workers
2. Reluctance to refer partners
- People with STI are reluctant to refer their partners

\section*{3. Reluctance to use condoms}
- Lack of familiarity with condoms
- Stigma associated with condom use
- Cultural and religious prohibition
- Fear that sex is less enjoyable
- Fear of side effects (allergy)

\section*{Modes of transmission of STIs}

\section*{Sexual Exposures}
1. Unprotected sexual intercourse (over 80\%)
2. Blood transfusion or contact with contaminated blood or blood products (3 to 5\% )
3. Transplant of contaminated organs
4. Use unsterile needles skin piercing implants including surgical instrument
5. From mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding e.g. HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, herpes

Non sexual exposures
6. Tattooing
7. Traditional circumcision
8. Traditional delivery with unsterile equipment
9. Intravenous (IV) Drug Use (5-10\%)
10. Occupational Exposure to HIV infected

Material/specimens e.g. accidental needlestick injury

\section*{Association Between HIV/AIDS and STI/RTI}
- STI primarily disrupt the integrity of the skin/mucosal barrier, enabling HIV easy access to the body.
- The presence of genital ulcers is known to increase the risk of HIV transmission by upto 10 to 100 times.
- STIs that primarily cause inflammation, such as gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, and Chlamydia, and thus weaken the skin barrier to HIV.
- Increased viral shedding has been reported in genital fluids of patients with STI/RTI.
- STI/RTI treatment has been demonstrated to significantly reduce HIV viral shedding.

\section*{HIV infection effect on STIs:}
- HIV alters the response of STIs pathogens to antibiotics. This has been reported for chancroid and syphilis.
- HIV alters the clinical appearance and natural history of STI/RTI as in genital herpes and syphilis.
- HIV-infected individuals have increased susceptibility to STI/RTI.
- Number of sexual partners and high risk partner selection, and are associated with increased heterosexual HIV transmission.

Due to this epidemiological synergy, STI/RTI control is considered a key strategy in the primary prevention of HIV transmission.

\section*{Classification /Categories of STIs}

There are 4 classes of STIs based on aetiology (cause);
1. Bacterial: Chlamydia, Syphilis, Gonorrhoea
2. Fungal: Candidiasis
3. Viral: Hepatitis, Genital Herpes Simplex, HIV, Genital Warts
4. Protozoa: Trichomoniasis

\section*{Common STIs/STDs}
1. Bacterial vaginosis (BV)
2. Chlamydia
3. Gonorrheoa
4. Syphilis
5. HIV
6. Genital ulcer disease (GUD)
7. Ophthalmia neonatorum
8. Genital herpes
9. Genital warts
10. Pubic lice
11. Non-specific urethritis
12. Candidiasis (thrush)
13. Trichomoniasis
14. Chancroid

\section*{1. Urethral Discharge Syndrome}
- Urethral discharge is one of the most common STI/RTI syndromes among men, and is associated with serious complications.
- This syndrome is commonly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in over 98\% of cases.
- Other infectious agents include Trichomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma spp.
- Mixed infections, especially of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, occur.

\section*{Cont'd...}

\section*{240}
- It is characterized by purulent urethral discharge with or without dysuria.
- The amount of discharge varies depending on the causative pathogens as well as prior antibiotic treatment.

\section*{Cont'd...}
- If the discharge is not readily apparent, it may be necessary to milk the penis and massage it forwards before the discharge becomes apparent.
- In uncircumcised patients, examination with the foreskin retracted will ascertain whether the discharge is from the urethra or from beneath the prepuce.

\section*{Management}
- Norfloxacin 800 mg stat (or Ciprofloxacin 500 mg stat) and Doxycycline 100 mg BD × 7 days

\section*{ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT}
- IM Spectinomycin 2g stat (or IM Ceftriaxone $125-250 \mathrm{mg}$ single dose) and Doxycycline 100 mg BD × 7 days
- Emphasize 4Cs - counselling, compliance, contact tracing, and condom use
- Offer or refer for HIV testing services.

\section*{Assignment}

Write short notes on the following STis:
1. Gonorrhoea
2. Chlamydia
3. Candidiasis

\section*{2. Genital Ulcer Disease}
- Genital ulcer disease is one of the most common syndromes that affect men and women.
- Genital ulcers have an epidemiologically synergistic relationship with HIV.
- HIV alters the natural history of syphilis and chancroid, where more aggressive lesions may manifest.
- HIV transmission, on the other hand, is enhanced in presence of ulcerative STI/RTI.

- In men, GUD occurring under the prepuce may present as a discharge.
- Similarly, GUD in women may also present as a discharge, underlying the importance of clinical examination.
- Genital herpes manifest with more persistent lesions.
- Single or multiple ulcers can present.

\section*{a. Chancroid}
- Chancroid is caused by a bacterium known as Haemophilus Ducreyi.
- Both males and females with chancroid develop painful genital ulcers.
- In males, ulcers are commonly found on the edge of the glans-penis, but can appear anywhere on the external genitalia.

In females, ulcers may be found anywhere on the external genitalia including around the vulva, clitoris, and anus, or inside the vagina and on the cervix.

A chancroid ulcer is painful while a syphilitic ulcer is not.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Ulcer
- Enlarged, red, hot lymph nodes in the groin, called buboes. They should be aspirated with a wide-bore needle every two days if necessary.
- When a bubo is ready for aspiration, the skin overlying it is shiny and the area underneath it is soft.

\section*{b. Syphilis}
- The disease is caused by a bacterium known as Treponema Pallidum.
- It can affect all organs of the body. It occurs in two forms: early (primary) and late syphilis.

In early syphilis a client is infectious to his/her sexual partners. During late syphilis, the client is not infectious to sexual partners.

\section*{1. Primary Syphilis}

\section*{253}

253
- Three weeks after contact with an infected partner, the ulcer develops at the site of infection. This is the primary chancre.
- It may be found anywhere on the penis in males. In females it is found on the external genitalia, the vaginal opening, inside the vagina, or on the cervix.
- In both men and women, it is a painless, single, firm ulcer with a punched-out appearance.

\section*{$\mathrm{Ct}, 1^{0}$ syphilis}
- It may heal without treatment but the client can still infect others and may develop serious cardiac and CNS symptoms later. The client needs to be treated.

\section*{2. Secondary Syphilis}
- Between two and four months following initial infection, clients may develop secondary syphilis.
- The first sign is a non-itchy rash all over the body which may become papular(round, solid raised lesion), pustular(infected pimples), or may develop into flat warts (condylomata lata).

\section*{Manifestations of $2^{0}$ syphilis}

\section*{256}

256

There may be whitish lines on the tongue and mucous membrane of the mouth called snail track ulcers. They may be generalised lymph node enlargement.

Neurologic infection- cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, loss of vibration sense, and auditory/ophthalmic abnormalities, which might occur through the natural history of untreated infection

\section*{257}

\section*{3. Latent Syphilis}
- During this stage, there are no signs or symptoms but a blood test is positive and the client should be treated.
Late syphilis
- Untreated syphilis may progress. After two to 15 years, the heart and brain may be affected.
- The patient may develop mental problems
- At this time the disease cannot be passed to other people.

\section*{C. Genital Herpes}
- Infection is caused by the herpes simplex virus.
- In males, the client develops itchiness at the site of infection. This may be on the foreskin, the shaft of the penis, or the glans-penis. A small area of redness appears which develops into small blisters. This may break down to reveal painful, shallow ulcers.
- In the first attack, lesions are more extensive and cause severe pain. The attacks heal after about two to three weeks.
- In females, the lesions are on the cervix, the labia, the vagina, or around the anus. During the first attack, there may be quite extensive inflammation of the cervix, the vulva, and the vagina.

\section*{$\mathrm{Ct}^{\prime}$}

\section*{260}

Recurrence of lesions occurs in about 50\% of clients; lesions are usually less extensive and heal within five to seven days.

Recurrences in both males and females may follow sexual contact and stress. In females they may also follow the menstrual period.

\section*{$\mathrm{Ct}^{\prime}$}

\section*{261}
- There is no effective cure. Clients should be reassured, but warned that a recurrence of ulceration is possible and that they should not have sexual intercourse while lesions are present.
- Herpes simplex virus can be passed on when there are ulcers.
- Tell the client to keep the lesions clean and dry and wash with soap and water.

\section*{3. Vaginal Discharge}

Physiological discharge: normal
- Clear or white
- Viscous in consistency
- Located in the posterior fornix of the vagina

Microscopy of normal vaginal secretions reveals:
- Superficial epithelial cells
- Lactobacilli with long rods
- Few white blood cells

Physiologic vaginal discharge requires no Rx

\section*{Abnormal Vaginal Discharge}
- Abnormal vaginal discharge is one of the most common STI/RTI syndromes among women, but also one of the most complicated to manage.
- All women have a physiological vaginal discharge which may increase during certain situations.
- Normally, women will only complain if they perceive the discharge to be abnormal.

\section*{Aetiology}
- The symptom of abnormal vaginal discharge is highly indicative of vaginitis and poorly predictive of cervicitis
- Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis are the most common causes of vaginitis
- Gonococcal and chlamydial infections cause cervicitis.

Distinction between the two on clinical grounds is usually difficult.

\section*{Possible causes of vaginal discharge}
1. Neisseria Gonorrhoea-Greenish-yellow discharge
2. Chlamydia trachomatis- Scanty muco-purulent or purulent discharge
3. Trichomonas vaginalis- Frothy, profuse, greenish-yellow foul-smelling discharge
4. Candida albicans-White, curd-like discharge
5. Gardnerella vaginalis- Profuse foul-smelling and homogenous greyish-white discharge

\section*{4. Lower Abdominal Pain Syndrome (PID)}
- This is one of the most common and most serious STI syndromes among women, with very serious reproductive health and socioeconomic consequences.
- PID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis

\section*{Causes}
- Sexually transmitted organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, are implicated in many cases; however, microorganisms that comprise the vaginal flora (e.g., anaerobes, G. vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negative rods, and Streptococcus agalactiae) have been associated with PID

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Abdominal pain,
- abnormal cervical or vaginal mucopurulent vaginal bleeding
- Dyspareunia
- fever, and sometimes vomiting.

N/B
Patients should be carefully evaluated for abdominal tenderness, cervical motion and adnexial tenderness, enlargement of uterine tubes, and tender pelvic masses.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- A thorough history and examination to exclude other surgical and/or gynaecological emergencies must be done.
- Bimanual vaginal examination

\section*{Management}
- Norfloxacin 800 mg stat (or Ciprofloxacin 500 mg single dose)
- Doxycycline 100 mg BD × 7 days
- Metronidazole 400 mg BD $\times 10$ days

\section*{5. Ophthalmia Neonatorum}
- This refers to conjunctival infection of neonates.
- Neonates acquire this infection during passage through an infected birth canal during delivery.
- Occurs between 4-7 days of life, but can occur anytime in the first 28 days.
- Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea(GC) or Chlamydia trachomatis(Chlamydia).

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- This disease is often characterized by bilateral purulent eye discharge. In early stages, the discharge may be "sticky," causing the eyelids to be stuck together in the morning, rather than the thick, greenish pus seen later.
- The conjunctiva is inflamed and eyelids swollen.
- Corneal scarring may occur if treatment is delayed.
- Blindness in children is associated with high infant morbidity and mortality.

\section*{Treatment}
- $1 \%$ TETRACYCLINE eye ointment TDS $\times 10$ days

\section*{6. OTHER STI SYNDROMES}
- Inguinal Buboes
- Painful scrotal swelling
- Balanitis
- Bartholin'sabscess
- Genital warts
- Congenital syndromes

\section*{Genital warts}
- Genital warts are caused by a virus -human papilloma virus.
- They usually have the appearance of flesh-coloured cauliflower-like growths on the genitals.
- The penis and foreskin (men) and the labia or vagina (women) are the most common sites of the warts.
- The warts can be variable in number and size, either few or multiple, small to very large.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}

\section*{282}

282
- Are usually asymptomatic, but depending on the size and anatomic location, they can be painful or pruritic.
- Genital warts are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths on the genital mucosa
- Genital warts occur commonly at the introitus in women, under the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and on the shaft of the circumcised penis.

\section*{Management}
- Warts are treated with local application of podophyllin(10-25\% solution) once a week.
- After treatment of warts, the medication must be washed off within 2-4 hours to avoid developing sores at the site of treatment.
- Podofilox 0.5\% solution or gel

OR
- Imiquimod 5\% cream

OR
- Sinecatechins $15 \%$ ointment

\section*{Association Between HIV/AIDS \& STIs}
- STIs primarily disrupt the integrity of the skin /mucosal membrane barrier, enabling easy HIV access to the body.
- The presence of genital ulcers Is known to increase the risk of HIV transmission by 10 to 100 times.
- Some STIs cause inflammation such as Gonorrhoea trichomoniasis and chylamdia thus weakening the skin barrier to HIV
- Increased viral shedding has been reported in genital fluids of patients with STIs

\section*{288}

\section*{Prevention and Control of STIs Introduction}

The prevention and control of STIs are based on the following five major strategies:
i. Education and counseling of persons at risk on ways to avoid STIs through changes in sexual behaviors and use of recommended prevention services.
ii. Identification of asymptomatically infected persons and of symptomatic persons unlikely to seek diagnostic and treatment services.
iii. Effective diagnosis, treatment, and counseling of infected persons.
iv. Evaluation, treatment, and counseling of sexual partners of persons who are infected with an STD
v. Barrier methods - the consistent use of condoms
vi. Pre-exposure vaccination of persons at risk for vaccine-preventable STIs. Vaccines are available for 2 STIs - Hepatitis B and HPV

\section*{1. Primary Prevention}
- Primary prevention of STIs begins with promoting changes to risky sexual behaviors that increase the risk of infection.
- Health care providers have a unique opportunity to provide education and counseling to their patients.
- As part of the clinical interview, health care providers should routinely and regularly obtain sexual histories from their patients and address management of risk reduction.

\section*{Primary Preventive Measures}
- Some of the measures one can employ to avoid STI include:
1. Abstinence
2. Mutual monogamy
3. Correct and consistent use of condoms
4. Safer sex practices

\section*{1. ABSTINENCE}
- This might be total abstinence from sex or, for groups such as students and youth not yet married, one should encourage "postponed sex" till one is ready for marriage.

\section*{2. MUTUAL MONOGAMY}
- Mutually faithful sexual relationship or what is usually termed as "Zero grazing" if both partners are not already infected.
3. CORRECT AND CONSISTENT USE OF CONDOMS

This intervention is recommended for those who cannot abstain and yet cannot have a mutually faithful relationship.

\section*{4. SAFER SEX PRACTICES}
- Safer sex practices are many and varied but all revolve around the principle of avoiding exchange of sexual or body fluids, yet enabling the individual(s) to obtain what they desire out of sex.

Use of condoms is an important safe sex practice

\section*{SECONDARY PREVENTION}
1. Early diagnosis and prompt and correct treatment of STI
2. Promotion of STI care-seeking behaviour, including reduction of barriers to care
3. Notification of partners and treatment/contact tracing
4. Screening for asymptomatic cases

\section*{2. Secondary Prevention}
- Secondary prevention curtails STIs onset and transmission through early diagnosis and treatment.
- Risk-reduction counseling must screen clients for infection, discourage risky sexual activities, and encourage partner notification of infections.
- Patient-initiated partner notification may encourage partner referral for STIs etiological evaluation and treatment.
- Where appropriate laboratory facilities for investigations are unavailable the syndromic management approach is recommended.

\section*{3. Tertiary Prevention}
- Tertiary prevention requires medical treatment focuses on reduction of local complications (e.g. urethral stricture) or systemic complications (e.g. pelvic inflammatory diseases and AIDS), and sequelae associated with untreated or incompletely treated infections.

298 Risk factors for STIs acquisition and transmission
1. Participation in unprotected vaginal, oral or anal sex(no condom used)
2. Genital to genital sexual contact
3. Previous history of STIs
4. Having multiple sexual partners
5. Use of non-barrier contraceptives, such as
6. Spermicides especially those containing $n-9$ due to disruption of the genital epithelium

\section*{Risk factors, Ct..}
7. Use of injection drugs, alcohol or other substances that can impair decision making ability
8. Use of prep which may lead to decreased use of condoms hence increased risk
9. Inconsistent and irregular use of condoms during sex
10. Vaginal practices e.g. Douching
11. Group sex

\section*{Vulnerable groups / Risk factors for STIs}
1. Having primary education or less for an individual and/or their spouse
2. Lack of formal employment
3. Poverty
4. Low income
5. Alcohol and substance abuse
6. Individuals and/or partners with multiple sex partners
7. Gender based violence
8. Mental and physical disability

\section*{Vulnerable groups in STIs}
9. Childhood sexual abuse
10. Child marriage
11. Out of school adolescents
12. Early sexual debut
13. Disempowerment of women
14. People living with hiv
15. Conflict situations
16. Refugees/internally displaced persons and immigrants

\section*{Management of STIs Introduction}

STIs can be managed through aetiological, clinical and syndromic approaches; or through a combination of these approaches. The management of any STI through all of these approaches should follow these standard steps:
1. History taking
2. Physical examination
3. Establishment of diagnosis and treatment plan
4. Education and counseling to prevent re-infection

\section*{Cont'd...}
5. Education and counseling to enhance compliance
6. Condom promotion, demonstration and dispensing
7. Assisted partner notification

The last 4 steps are commonly referred to as 4Cs namely: Counseling, Compliance, Condoms and Contact Tracing. In addition, irrespective of the approach of management used, all STI patients should be provided with HIV testing services.

\section*{What are the 4 cs ?}
i. Counseling : Empathize with the patient
ii. Compliance: Your patients should avoid self medication, take full course of medicine and not share and follow instructions as advised.
iii. Contact tracing: Encourage disclosure and tell her or his sexual,partners to seek medication
iv. Condoms
