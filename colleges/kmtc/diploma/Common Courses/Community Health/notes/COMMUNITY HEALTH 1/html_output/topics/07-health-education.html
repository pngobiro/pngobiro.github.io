                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In role play, some of the participants take the roles of other people and act accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Role play is usually a spontaneous or unrehearsed acting out of real-life situations where others watch and learn by seeing and discussing how people might behave in certain situations.</li>
                            <li>Learning takes place through active experience, it is not passive.</li>
                            <li>It uses situations that the members of the group are likely to find themselves in during their lives.</li>
                            <li>You use role playing because it shows real situations.</li>
                            <li>It is a very direct way of learning, participants are given a role or character and have to think and speak immediately without detailed planning, because there is usually no script.</li>
                            <li>In a role playing situation people volunteer to play the parts in a natural way, while other people watch carefully and may offer suggestions to the players.</li>
                            <li>Some of the people watching may decide to join in with the play.</li>

                            <li>The purpose of a role play is that it is acting out real-life situations in order that people can better understand their problems and the behavior associated with the problem.</li>
                            <li>Role play is usually undertaken in small groups of 4 to 6 people.</li>
                            <li>Remember role play is a very powerful thing.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Role play works best when people know each other.</li>
                            <li>Don't ask people to take a role that might embarrass them.</li>
                            <li>Role play involves some risk of misunderstanding, because people may interpret things differently.</li>
                            <li>When doing role plays members of the group should be careful and stick to the play rules and regulations.</li>

                            <li>Drama is a very valuable method that you can use to discuss subjects where personal and social relationships are involved.</li>
                            <li>Basic ideas, feelings, beliefs and values about health can be communicated to people of different ages, education and experience.</li>
                            <li>It is a suitable health promotion method for people who cannot read, because they often experience things visually.</li>

                            <li>Keep the script simple and clear.</li>
                            <li>Identify an appropriate site.</li>
                            <li>Say a few words at the beginning of the play to introduce the subject and give the reasons for the drama.</li>
                            <li>Encourage questions and discussions at the end.</li>

                        <h4>3). Songs.</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A song is a work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections.</li>
                            <li>Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs.</li>
                            <li>A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony.</li>
                            <li>Songs may be written for one or more singers to sing without instrumental accompaniment or they may be written for performance with instrumental accompaniment.</li>
                            <li>A song should be clear, loud enough and convey the intended message to the target population.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>4). Poems.</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A poem is an art form in which human language is used in addition to, or instead of its notional and semantic content.</li>
                            <li>It consists largely of oral or literary works in which language is used in a manner that is felt by its user and audience to differ from ordinary prose.</li>
                            <li>There are certain ingredients that are important when composing a poem;
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li><strong>a) Message.</strong><br>
                                    What are you trying to say?. The message of your poem is the most important part.
                                    It could be something as simple, or it could be something more complex, like a relationship.
                                    Whatever it is, your message should be clear to the audience.</li>

                                    <li><strong>b). Form/Structure.</strong><br>
                                    Will the length/shape of each stanza enhance the poem in any way? Think carefully about how the poem is formulated. A poem particularly a concrete one can be a piece of art and should be attractive and friendly to listeners.</li>

                                    <li><strong>c). Point of View.</strong><br>
                                    Whose perspective are you writing your poem from? The perspective you write your poem from can dramatically change its meaning and impact on the audience.</li>

                                    <li><strong>d). Voice/Tone.</strong><br>
                                    Voice is important in everything that you write or speak, and poem is no different.
                                    The important thing is to make sure that the tone you've chosen fits the poem and the message you want to get across. Don't write or say something in a serious way if you're trying to be funny and don't go overboard with the jokes if you're trying to be serious.</li>

                                    <li><strong>e). Rhythm.</strong><br>
                                    You may find that your poem naturally fits into or suits a particular rhythm. Perhaps the most vital element of sound in poetry is rhythm. Often, the rhythm of each line is arranged in a particular manner.</li>

                                    <li><strong>f). Grammar.</strong><br>
                                    Grammar is incredibly important in a poem. Its absence can tell you as much as its usage. This allows you to manipulate it to your advantage and even alter the meaning of your poem.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Barraza is a Swahili word that describes the semi-formal and mostly regular public open air meetings convened by a local Chief/Leader for purposes of addressing local issues and facilitating the percolation of state agenda and policy down to the grass-roots.</li>

                                    <li>d) Queue. There's literally no queue and the informal setting means information is passed easily and quickly.</li>
                                    <li>e) Message: Message should be simple and clear.</li>
                                    <li>f) Questions: Allow the target group to ask questions at the end of the talk for clarification.</li>

                        <p>The groups may be of men, women, youth or mix-up groups.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Group discussion involves the free flow of communication between a facilitator and two or more participants.</li>
                            <li>Often a discussion of this type is used after a slide show or following a more formal presentation.</li>
                            <li>This type of teaching method is characterized by participants having an equal chance to talk freely and exchange ideas with each other.</li>
                            <li>Group discussions do not always go smoothly and sometimes a few people dominate the discussion and do not allow others to join in.</li>
                            <li>Your job as the facilitator is to establish ground rules and use strategies to prevent this from happening.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>How can you prevent a few people from dominating a group discussion?</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The key skill in group work that may prevent such domination is by encouraging full participation of everyone in the group.</li>
                            <li>For example, by using questioning and other methods that facilitate active participation and interaction.</li>
                            <li>Quiet participants need to be brought into the discussion, perhaps by asking them easy questions so that they gain in confidence.</li>
                            <li>Conversely, any community member dominating the discussion excessively should be restrained, possibly by recognizing his or her contribution.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Group disruption.</strong></p>
                        <p>Groups can be disrupted by several types of behavior:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>People who want a fight: Do not get involved. Explore their ideas, but let the group decide their value.</li>
                            <li>Would like to help: Encourage them frequently to give ideas, and use them to build on in the discussion.</li>
                            <li>Focuses on small details: Acknowledge his or her point but remind them of the objective and the time limit for the discussion.</li>
                            <li>Just keeps talking: Interrupt tactfully. Ask a question to bring him or her back to the point being discussed and thank them for their contribution.</li>
                            <li>Seems afraid to speak: Ask easy questions. Give them credit to raise their confidence.</li>
                            <li>Insists on their own agenda: Recognize the person's self-interest. Ask him or her to focus on the topic agreed by the group.</li>
                            <li>Is just not interested: Ask about their work and how the group discussion could help.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>A buzz group is a way of coping if a meeting is too large for you.</li>
                            <li>In this situation it is better to divide the group into several small groups, of not more than 10 or 12 people.</li>
                            <li>These are called buzz groups.</li>
                            <li>You can then give each small buzz group a certain amount of time to discuss the problem.</li>
                            <li>Then, the whole group comes together again and the reporters from the small groups report their findings and recommendations back to the entire audience.</li>

                        <h3>HEALTH TALKS.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Talking is often the most natural way of communicating with people to share health knowledge and facts.</li>
                            <li>In the part of your job that involves health education, there will always be many opportunities to talk with people.</li>
                            <li>Group size is also important.</li>
                            <li>The number of people who you are able to engage in a health talk depends on the group size.</li>
                            <li>However, you will find talks are most effective if conducted with small gatherings (5-10 people), because the larger the group the less chance that each person has to participate.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Preparing a health talk.</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>When you are preparing a talk there are many things to consider:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Know the group. Find out its needs and interests and discover which groups are active in your locality.</li>
                                    <li>Select an appropriate topic. The topic should be about a single issue or a simple topic. Always ensure that you have correct and up-to-date information and look for sources of recent information.</li>
                                    <li>List the points you will talk about: Prepare only a few main points and make sure that you are clear about them.</li>
                                    <li>Write down what you will say: If you do not like writing, you must think carefully what to include in your talk. Think of examples, proverbs and local stories to emphasize your points and which include positive health messages.</li>
                                    <li>Prepare visual aids: Visual aids are a good way to capture people's attention and make messages easier to understand. Well-chosen posters and photos that carry important health messages will help people to learn.</li>
                                    <li>Practice your talk beforehand: This should include rehearsing the telling of stories and the showing of posters and pictures.</li>
                                    <li>Determine the amount of time you need: The complete talk including showing all your visual aids should take not more than about 20 minutes. Allow another 15 minutes or more for questions and discussions. If the talk is too long people may lose interest.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>LECTURE.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>You may have the opportunity to give a lecture, perhaps in your local school or in another formal setting.</li>
                            <li>A lecture is usually a spoken, simple, quick and traditional way of presenting your subject matter, but there are strengths and limitations to this approach.</li>
                            <li>The strengths include the efficient introduction of factual material in a direct and logical manner.</li>
                            <li>However, this method is generally ineffective where the audience is passive and learning is difficult to gauge.</li>

                            <li>You may have the opportunity to give a lecture and include a follow-up discussion, perhaps in a local formal setting or during a public meeting.</li>
                            <li>It is always useful to involve your audience after the lecture in asking questions, seeking clarification and challenging and reflecting on the subject matter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DEMONSTRATION.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In your work as a health promoter, you will often find yourself giving a demonstration.</li>
                            <li>This form of health education is based on learning through observation.</li>
                            <li>There is a difference between knowing how to do something and actually being able to do it.</li>
                            <li>The aim of a demonstration is to help learners become able to do the skills themselves, not just know how to do them.</li>
                            <li>Some health related things that would be best taught through demonstration include;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The whole process of measuring blood pressure.</li>
                                    <li>How to use a mosquito net.</li>
                                    <li>Putting/Inserting a condom.</li>
                                    <li>Giving a child medicine.</li>
                                    <li>Proper breast feeding, etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p><strong>Sharing skills.</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>You should be able to find ways to make health related demonstrations a pleasant way of sharing skills and knowledge.</li>
                            <li>Although demonstration sessions usually focus on practice, they also involve theoretical teaching as well 'showing how, is better than telling how', thus;
                                <br>"If I hear, I forget".
                                <br>"If I see, I remember".
                                <br>"If I do, I know".
                            </li>

                            <li>You remember $90 \%$ of what you hear, see and do.</li>
                            <li>With repetition, close to $100 \%$ is remembered (Tell them, tell them, tell them what you have told them, tell them, tell them, for them to hear and remember).</li>

                            <li>There are four steps to a demonstration:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Explaining the ideas and skills that you will be demonstrating.</li>
                                    <li>Giving the actual demonstration.</li>
                                    <li>Giving an explanation as you go along, doing one step at a time.</li>
                                    <li>Asking one person to repeat the demonstration and giving everyone a chance to repeat the process.</li>

                                    <li>The demonstration must be realistic,</li>
                                    <li>It should fit with the local culture and it should use familiar materials.</li>
                                    <li>You will need to arrange to have enough materials for everyone to practice and have adequate space for everyone to see or practice.</li>
                                    <li>People need to take enough time for practice and for you to check that everyone has acquired the appropriate skills.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
