                            <li><strong>Immunisation:</strong> Is the process of reinforcing someone's immune system by the use of vaccines or related substances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prophylaxis:</strong> Refers to the administration of drugs or vaccines for prevention rather than curative purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antigen:</strong> Is any substance which is capable, under appropriate conditions, of inducing a specific immune response. E.g. toxins, foreign proteins, microorganisms and tissue cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Antibody:</strong> Antibody is a special protein (immunoglobulin) found in tissue fluid and blood serum. It is produced in response to specific antigen for protection against the specific antigen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immunity:</strong> This is the ability of the body to resist harmful disease organisms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vaccine:</strong> A vaccine is made of an organism or a toxin which is either killed or attenuated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Attenuated:</strong> Refers to reduced power/ virulence micro-organisms depriving them of their pathogenic properties without killing them, or inactivating their antigenicity properties.</li>

                            <li><strong>Passive immunity:</strong> This is when one is protected temporarily by use of "borrowed" antibodies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Active immunity:</strong> A type of immunity developed by own production of antibodies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Herd immunity:</strong> This develops when a high proportion of the community, $80 \%$ or more, have been immunized.</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural immunity:</strong> This is immunity conferred by antibodies produced naturally i.e. With no human intervention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Artificial immunity:</strong> This is immunity conferred by antibodies produced through human intervention.</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Worldwide, millions of children die as a result of disease such as TB, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, Hepatitis B, HIB(meningitis), pneumonia, yellow fever and vitamin A deficiency.</li>
                            <li>Many more children become disabled through complications caused by these diseases which could be prevented through immunisation.</li>
                            <li>Immunisation has proved to be a cost-effective weapon in the control, prevention and even elimination of these diseases.</li>
                            <li>WHO, UNICEF and other agencies came with strategies to strengthen, improve and expand the existing immunisation services and thus the basis for expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI).</li>
                            <li>Increased immunisation coverage.</li>
                            <li>Use of potent vaccines.</li>
                            <li>Training health workers who offer immunisation services.</li>
                            <li>Availing human and material resources for immunisation activities.</li>
                            <li>Community participation in the programme.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and evaluation.</li>
                            <li>Provide immunisation against the EPI target diseases and Tetanus toxoid for pregnant women or women of child-bearing age.</li>
                            <li>Promote immunisation programmes, including vaccine production and quality control.</li>
                            <li>Intensify implementation of the immunization activities and sustainability within the framework of the maternal and child health services.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI).</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Kenya is a member of the WHO and thus following the EPI programme initiative.</li>
                            <li>The government adopted the Programme and called it the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunisation.</li>
                            <li>The name has since changed to Division of vaccines and Immunization.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Objectives of DVI.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Immunisation coverage of at least $95 \%$ i.e. $95 \%$ of children to be fully immunized before the age of 1 year.</li>
                            <li>Eradication of poliomyelitis.</li>
                            <li>Eradication of Neonatal tetanus.</li>
                            <li>Control of Measles.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Components of DVI.</h3>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Training: Refresher post basic courses, basic training and on job trainings (OJT).</li>
                            <li>Cold chain: Accurate records of the functioning of the cold chain to enable the detection of any breaks in the chain, training of technicians for maintenance of cold chain equipment.</li>
                            <li>Supervision: Decentralised to sub-county level. Supervisory check lists and vehicles have been provided.</li>
                            <li>Surveillance: Sub-counties should send returns for DVI targeted diseases (measles, poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus).</li>
                            <li>Health communication: This includes health education and social mobilization.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation of all aspects of the programme at all levels are designed as on-going functions.</li>
                            <li>Logistics and Supplies: This includes vaccines, child health cards, reporting forms, cold chain equipment, transport, gas, syringes, needles, etc.</li>
                            <li>Integration: Integration of immunization with maternal and child health services was done from the outset.</li>
                            <li>Social mobilisation: To achieve the DVI objectives, we need to convince families to bring children for immunisation so as to increase community involvement and participation.</li>
