                            <li>Includes food ingestion, food and nutrient digestion, nutrient metabolism and nutrient utilization by body cells and tissues to support growth, repair and maintenance of body tissue.</li>
                            <li>Nutrients are compounds in foods that are needed by human body for energy to work, for growth of body tissue, for repair and maintenance of body tissues and also to support body's immune function all that works towards a healthy living.</li>
                            <li>Basically, nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, human nutrition is the study of food in relation to health of individual and groups of people particularly the infants, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers(vulnerable groups) and functioning of the body organs and provide the energy the body requires.</li>

                            <li>Food required by the foetus to grow and production of milk must come from the mother.</li>
                            <li>A child born to a poorly nourished mother is likely to have low birth weight.</li>
                            <li>During pregnancy there is an increase in the weight of the woman and the basal metabolic rate also increases.</li>
                            <li>Hence the increase requires extra food to provide extra energy, proteins and other nutrients.</li>
                            <li>Anaemia is common among pregnant women hence need to give iron supplements routinely to expectant mothers in form of ferrous sulphate.</li>

                            <li>Vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is bad for the baby hence multivitamin tablets should be given during pregnancy and encourages pregnant women to eat foods rich in Vitamin A.</li>
                            <li>Mothers who have just delivered need to eat foods rich in Iron and Vitamin A.</li>
                            <li>The nutritional cost of pregnancy and lactation is great as the woman's store of nutrients is depleted.</li>
                            <li>Repeated pregnancy, combined with heavy work quickly makes a woman weak and sick.</li>
                            <li>To prevent this, the woman must be well fed during their reproductive years.</li>
