\section*{DEPARTMENT OF CLINICAL MEDICINE. MARCH 2019 CLASS. COMMUNITY HEALTH 1.}

\section*{PRIMARY HEALTH CARE (PHC) AND COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH CARE.}

AIM: To equip the learner with knowledge, skills and attitudes to be able to involve communities in planning, implementing and evaluating community health interventions.

\section*{Specific objectives.}

At the end of the course the leaner should be able to:
- Define terms used in PHC/CBHC.
- Describe PHC/CBHC and its evolution.
- Discuss the concept of health and development.
- Describe organizational structure of health services in Kenya.
- Undertake a needs/capacities assessment (situation analysis).
- Describe participatory methodologies used in community appraisal.
- Explain the demographic profile of a community.
- Outline community health project development and management process.

\section*{Definitions.}
- Primary Health Care: This is an essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound, and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participations and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination.
- Community: This is a group of people living together in the same geographical area, sharing common interests.
- Community participation/involvement: It implies sensitizing the people to their health problems, increasing their receptivity and ability to prevent disease, death and handicap.
- Community based programs: These are public Health interventions that are designed, implemented and evaluated with the participation of the community representatives and with the guidance of professional experts.
- Essential health care: Group of functions essential for the health of the people given at lower level of health service. E.g. Medical care, MCH/FP, school health, environmental health, control of communicable diseases, health education, referral, etc.
- Scientifically sound: Scientifically explainable and acceptable.
- Socially acceptable methods and technology: Intervention should consider the local value, culture and belief.
- Universally accessible: Because of the inequitable distribution of the available resources, the services are not reachable by all who need them. Only a few can afford or within the reach to use them, while the majority are excluded from the service. Therefore, PHC being
health care as close as possible to where people live and work, guarantee universal accessibility.

\section*{Historical development of PHC.}

\section*{Early Approaches.}
- In the 1950's, there were vertical health service strategies that included mass campaigns, specialized control programs for communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), etc., but the strategy was very expensive and so unsuccessful.
- The concept of basic health service came into being in the mid1960s. This gives more attention to rural areas through the construction of health centers and health stations providing both curative and preventive services.
- Early 1970: Integration of specialized disease control programs with basic health services came to appear. However, even this approach was disease oriented, based on high cost health institutions and requires advanced technology.

\section*{Summary on effect of health services and programs during 1950-1970s.}
- Despite health being a fundamental human right the health status of hundreds of millions people in the world was unacceptable.
- In spite of the tremendous efforts in medicine and technology, the health status of people in disadvantaged areas of most countries remained low.
- The organized limited health institutions failed to meet the demands of those most in need who are usually too poor or geographically or socially remote to benefit from such facilities (Accessibility).
- The health services often created were in isolations, neglecting other sector (Agriculture, Education, Water Supply etc.), which are relevant to the improvement and development of health.
- Health institutions stressed curative services with insufficient priority to preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care.
- The community has already been given the opportunity to play an active role in deciding the types of activities they want and have not participated in the actual services they receive.
- All the above facts summed up and led WHO and UNICEF to evaluate and reexamine the existing policies in 1978, Alma-Ata, and the concept of PHC.

\section*{Elements of primary health care from the Alma-Ata declaration (1978).}
- Education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of preventing and controlling them.
- Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition.
- An adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation.
- Maternal and child health care, including family planning.
- Immunization against the major infectious diseases.
- Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases.
- Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries.
- Provision of essential drugs.

\section*{Additional elements incorporated after Alma-Ata.}
- Dental Health.
- Mental Health.
- Use of traditional medicine.
- Occupational health.
- HIV/AIDS.
- Community -based Rehabilitation.

\section*{PHC PRINCIPLES.}

Emphasized principles in PHC are:
1. Inter-sectoral collaboration.
2. Community participation.
3. Use of appropriate technology.
4. Equity.
5. Focus on prevention and promotion of health.
6. Decentralization.

\section*{1. Inter-sectoral collaboration:}
- Means a joint concern and responsibility of sectors responsible for development in identifying problems, programs and undertaking tasks that have important bearing on human well-being.
- Inter-sectoral collaboration is very important, as the intrinsic relationship of health to other sectors is evident. That is low level of education, poor access to transport, limited access to safe water supply can affect health status.
- Similarly, development in these sectors cannot process smoothly without health development.

\section*{Benefit of Inter-sectoral collaboration.}
- It enhances communication and good relationship among the sectors.
- It avoids resource wastage by minimizing duplications of projects and programs.
- Encourages a forum for exchanging and sharing ideas, skills, resources and technologies.
- It leads to a successful project implementation.
- Avoids confusion of the community.
- As a long term outcome it promotes integrated and fast development of a country.

\section*{2. Community participation:}
- Community is a group of people living together in the same geographical area, sharing common interests.
- Community participation/involvement implies sensitizing the people to their health problems, increasing their receptivity and ability to prevent disease, death and disability.
- This helps them to respond to development programmers and encourages local initiatives.
- Community participation/involvement in programs is a spectrum that ranges from receiving the benefits to actually planning and evaluating them.

\section*{Types of community participation/involvement.}
- Marginal: Participation of people in the health programs in a limited and transitory way.
- Substantial: The community plays active role in determining priorities and helping in carrying out health related activities, such as, health education, provision of drinking water and maintenance of good personal and food hygiene.
- Structural: Participation of the community in health care becomes an integral part of the program and a major basis for health activities.

\section*{Interpretations on community involvement.}
- At a WHO sponsored meeting on community participation in health, held at Brioni, Yugoslavia, in 1985, two broad and distinct interpretations on community involvement were identified.

\section*{Those were:}
i. Creating awareness and understanding, regarding the causes of poor health, thus making it a basis for their involvement in health related activities.
ii. Ensuring easy access to information and knowledge about health service programs and projects.
Therefore, in this approach, people have the right and duty to actively involve themselves in:
- Solving their own health problems.
- Assessing their health needs.
- Taking responsibility for mobilizing local resources.
- Supporting new approaches and solutions to their problems.
- Creating and maintaining local organizations.
- Administration and financing of the health services.

\section*{Advantages of a community participation approach.}
- It is a cost-effective way of extending a health care system to the geographical and social periphery of a country.
- Communities that begin to understand their health status objectively rather than fatalistically may be moved to take a series of preventive measures.
- Communities that invest labor, time, money and materials in health-promoting activities are more committed to the use and maintenance of the things they produce, such as water supplies.
- Health education is most effective as part and parcel of village activities.
- Community health workers, if well chosen, have the people's confidence because they know the most effective techniques for achieving commitment from their neighbors and they are not likely to exploit them.

\section*{Factors that hinder involvement of the community in health:}
- Rigid professional behavior of health service providers, which need to be tempered to allow greater community involvement.
- The professional staff generally takes decisions in health services and there is no tradition of allowing people to be involved in decision making.
- Wrong assumption by health staff that community does not know what is good for them and that only health staff can determine their needs.
- Lack of flexibility in health service and general unwillingness to change.

\section*{Mechanisms for supporting community Involvement.}
- Political commitment: National health policy should clearly design the need and support of community involvement in health care, and lay down working arrangement. The government should assure full political support.
- Reorientation of bureaucracy: Bureaucracy has the power to make all decisions. Their role should be changed and they should learn to seek community involvement in health, so that people can determine their own priorities and decide on the process to achieve their goals.
- Support to the community in managing health project: Management support and guidance should be given to the community to help the people in overseeing primary health care activities in their area.
- Inputs: There should be critical minimum inputs for basic health services and coverage to ensure co-operation of the community. People can be involved in health activities only if these are available to their satisfaction.
- Partnership: Genuine partnership between health professionals and people is necessary for success.
- Leadership: Individual and collective leadership at the community level should be promoted.
- Active community involvement: Community involvement in decision making should be at a realistic level so that it is sustainable and durable.
- Decentralization: There should be decentralization of administrative and decision making functions. This should be accompanied by shift of resources to the locality.
- Safeguards: Sufficient safeguards should be built in to prevent local political and elite from exploiting the resource for their own end benefits.

\section*{3. Use of appropriate technology.}
- It takes account of both the health care and the socio-economic context of the country.
- This must include consideration of cost (efficiency and attractiveness) in dealing with the health problem.
- It should also take consideration of the acceptability of the health care approach to both target community and health service technology and it does not necessarily mean low cost.

\section*{Criteria for technology appropriateness.}

To be appropriate, a technology must be;
- Effective, i.e should meet its objectives.
- Culturally acceptable and valuable.
- Affordable.
- Locally sustainable: We should be not over dependent on important skills and supplies for its continuous function, maintenance and repair.
- Environmentally accountable: The technology should be environmentally harmless or at least minimally harmful.
- Measurable: - The impact and performance of technology should be measurable.
4. Equity.
- This is to close the gaps between the "haves and have nots" which will help to achieve more equitable distribution of health resources.
- If all cannot be served, those most in need should have priority.
- While planning for equity in PHC, one requires the identification of groups, which are currently disadvantaged in terms of health services access and utilization of service.
- Generally, it implies that the rural and peri-urban poor population should also have a reasonable access to health service.

\section*{5. Focus on prevention.}
- In addition to the fact that prevention is better, cheaper and easier than cure, the main health problems plaguing developing countries are preventive in nature. Community should engage more on preventive services.

\section*{6. Decentralization.}
- It is sharing and transferring power and decision away from the center to the periphery.
- It brings decision closer to the communities served and the field level providers of services.
- It leads to greater efficiency in service provision

\section*{THE BAMAKO INITIATIVE.}

\section*{BACKGROUND}
- In 1987 Sub-Saharan Africa was in a deep political and economic crisis. In several Countries child mortality rates exceeded 200 per 1,000 live births. The debt service obligations were crashing stagnant economies. National budgets for health, education and other social services were declining, despite a rapidly increasing population.
- The Government financial allocation to public health, in the best cases, was barely enough to pay the salary of the staff. As a result the availability of public health services was deteriorating fast.
- During this period, the philosophy of Primary Health Care (PHC) was the main strategy to improve health service delivery. However, African countries were bogged down by the lack of resources and of practical implementation strategies.
- In many African Ministries of Health, PHC became one of the several, externally financed, vertical programs.
- At that time, the World Bank was tentatively moving into the health sector with little experience, a strong ideological framework based on privatization, cost recovery and big loans.
- This led to the introduction of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The ideology of SAPs was to assist the third world countries in using donor money prudently. The health sector was much affected.
- The Bamako Initiative (BI) was a pragmatic strategy to implement primary health care (PHC) in the era of economic structural adjustment.
- UNICEF, then under the leadership of Mr. James P. Grant, had embarked in a strong advocacy effort (Adjustment with a Human Face) to call the world's attention to the need of rescheduling the debt and of guaranteeing that under the adjustment program imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) social safety nets were solidly in place.
- Mr. Grant had launched the Child Survival Revolution, which was accused by the WHO of lacking the comprehensiveness of Primary Health Care and thus missing the sustainability component.
- The surprise launch of the Bamako Initiative during the September 1987 WHO Regional Meeting of the African Ministers of Health was his response to the critics of the Growth Monitoring, Oral Rehydration, Immunization, Family Planning, Female Education approach and his attempt to focus the world attention to the African situation.
- The Bamako Initiative (BI) was a pragmatic strategy to implement primary health care (PHC) in the era of economic structural adjustment.
- Championed by UNICEF's charismatic leader, James Grant, it sought to fill the gap created by WHO's open-ended approach to health for all and a hard economic reforms pursued by the World Bank and IMF.
- Economic reforms virtually destroyed social services and safety nets. The idea of BI was to select a few critical elements of PHC for child survival, which would be funded partly through community contributions.
- These contributions were expected to be in addition to donor and Government expenditure.
- Grant's proposal was based on the awareness that many health facilities lacked the medicines and the cash in hand to function. As a result, the health workers were merely prescribing drugs to be bought from private outlets, very often unlicensed an unsupervised.
- Many patients were not even bothering to turn up, when sick, to the inefficient public clinics. They were just buying drugs in pharmacies and markets or visiting private clinics, where they were available and affordable.
- So in Grant's mind several questions were urgently in need of practical answers.
- E.g. How could we increase and sustain the progresses in immunization?
- How could we ensure that diarrhea, respiratory infections and, maybe, malaria, could get properly addressed in an efficient way?
- How could we guarantee that drugs were always available in public facilities to attract a large number of clients to the curative and preventive services required to drastically reduce child mortality?
- The core of the challenge was to promote additional donor investment, stop and reverse the decline of Government expenditure and attract back into the public health system the money spent by people to purchase drugs in the private and informal sector.
- The communities were not expected to contribute more resources out of their pocket, but on the contrary to receive better quality services, curative as well as preventive, from a fraction of what they were already spending in the informal system.
- The cost reduction was to be achieved by improvement of the infrastructure, supply of drugs and consumables, training of the staff (all financed by donors) and by introducing a mechanism of oversight, run by community representatives.
- The expected advantages of this reform process were the availability of a limited, but lifesaving package of health services, both preventive and curative and a community of users responsible for running their basic health units, while primed for health action at community level.

\section*{INTRODUCTION OF USER FEES FOR HEALTH}
- One principal vehicle for implementation of user fees is the Bamako Initiative (BI), adopted by African health ministers in 1987, and aimed primarily at increasing availability of resources for essential drugs.
- The Initiative was promoted by the UNICEF and the WHO, and stressed the need for community and individual self-reliance and participation in planning, organization, operation and control of primary healthcare, making fullest use of local, national and other available resources.
- The BI proposed decentralizing health decision making to the district level; establishing a realistic national drug policy; and providing basic essential drugs.
- It advocated a combination of financing by users, communities, districts and the central government, depending on the specific circumstances in each country.
- It stipulated that fees collected from patients should not replace existing health budgets. The community would control locally generated funds with consideration for protecting the poorest.
- The BI recognized that fees could be a barrier to treatment for low-income districts or households, and included ways of dealing with this. Charges were supposed to be set at a level which is modest in relation to household income, but which still generates enough income to allow for a proportion of patients not to pay anything.
- Community health committees or the government could subsidize those on low incomes.
- Preventive care, such as vaccinations, could be given free or heavily subsidized.
- Charges for less essential but very popular treatments, such as injections, were allowed to be higher than for vital treatments. It was also expected that low-income areas would receive larger government subsidies.
- The emphasis of the resolution adopted by African health ministers was on community participation in the financing of health services, through "drug revolving funds" (in which an initial supply of drugs is provided to a community, and proceeds from the sale of these drugs are used to buy further supplies).
- Although countries followed different paths in implementing the Bamako Initiative, in practice they had a common core objective: providing a basic package of integrated services through revitalized health centers that employ user fees and community co-management of funds.
- A number of common support structures were organized around this core agenda, including the supply of essential drugs, training and supervision, and monitoring.
- The pace of expansion of BI varied depending on the availability of internal and external resources, local capacity, the need to work at the speed of community needs and pressure from governments and donors.
- Most of the sub-Saharan countries that adopted the BI employed some form of phased scaling up, and several countries - most notably Benin, Mali and Rwanda - achieved significant results.
- In essence, implementing the BI was a political process that involved changing the prevailing patterns of authority and power.
- Community participation in the management and control of resources at the health-facility level was the main mechanism for ensuring accountability of public health services to users.
- Health committees representing communities were able to hold monitoring sessions during which coverage targets, inputs and expenditures were set, reviewed, analyzed and compared.
- It is estimated that the initiative improved the access, availability, affordability and use of health services in large parts of Africa, raised and sustained immunization coverage, and increased the use of services among children and women in the poorest fifth of the populace.

\section*{LIMITATIONS OF BAMAKO INITIATIVE}
- The application of user fees to poor households and the principles of cost recovery drew strong criticism, and though many African countries adopted the approach, only in a handful were initiatives scaled up.
- Even in those countries where BI has been deemed a success, poor people viewed price as a barrier in the early 2000s, and a large share did not use essential health services despite exemptions and subsidies.
- Public accountability is now well recognized as a non-optional component in the production of public goods and can be achieved in several ways depending on the cultural and political context. The group of people with a vested interest in public health, i.e. local community, creates a system of checks and balances. The users and providers are both accountable. If the users are powerless, the system works for the provider's exclusive interest.
- The user power is not free to have and it needs to be maintained. A substantive amount of control by the users of the resources needed for the functioning of the health unit is a prerequisite for accountability.
- If money is essential, information is equally important. In the BI, health committees representing communities were able to hold monitoring sessions in which coverage targets, inputs and expenditures were set, reviewed, analyzed and compared. The health staff acted as technical resources, not as masters of the facilities.
- To gain the popular support needed to win over the resistance of staff to changes of their power, it is important to start by producing rapid improvements at the service delivery end. In the BI experience, the bulk of resources were invested in the basic health units to improve availability, quality and affordability of services to gain a rapid support of the people in the early phase of the process.
- The challenge to provide quality services for the poor is compounded today by the AIDS pandemic. Health statistics in Africa are worse today than they were in 1987.
- Africans are today more aware that it is up to them to hold their leaders accountable. The experience gained in implementing the BI could provide them with few practical hints of how to assert their rights to essential social services.

\section*{ALMA ATA DECLARATION.}
- International Conference on Primary Health Care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 6-12 September 1978.
- It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all the people of the world.
- It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care.
- The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) as the key to achieving the goal of "Health for All".

\section*{The declaration.}
1) The Conference strongly reaffirms that health, is a fundamental human right.
2) The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people, is politically, socially, and economically unacceptable and is, therefore, of common concern to all countries.
3) Economic and social development, is of basic importance to the fullest attainment of health for all and to the reduction of the gap between the health status of the developing and developed countries.
4) The people have a right and duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning and implementation of their health care.
5) Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures. A main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole world community should be the attainment by all peoples by the year 2000 .
6) Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound, and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of selfreliance and self-determination.
7) An acceptable level of health for all the people of the world by the year 2000 can be attained through a fuller and better use of the world's resources, a considerable part of which is now spent on armaments and military conflicts.
8) All governments should formulate national policies, strategies and plans of action to launch and sustain PHC as part of a comprehensive national health system and in coordination with other sectors.
9) All countries should cooperate in a spirit of partnership and service to ensure PHC for all people since the attainment of health by people in any one country directly concerns and benefits every other country.

\section*{PHC LEVELS OF CARE.}
1) Primary health care.
2) Secondary health care.

\section*{HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED CARE.}

\section*{Outline.}
- Definition and principles of home and community based care.
- Needs of HCBC patients.
- Components of home-based care.
- Advantages of HCBC.
- Key players in HCBC.
- Management of various patients requiring home-based care.
- Resources needed for effective and sustainable home-based care.
- HCBC referral and networking system.
- Describe the process of community mobilisation.

\section*{Definition.}

HCBC is Care of persons with chronic or terminal illnesses extended from health facility to the patients' home through family participation and community involvement within available resources and in collaboration with health care workers.

\section*{Why HCBC?}
- Most patients with chronic and terminal illnesses are discharged before full recovery and therefore the need for continuity of care.
- Health institutions have many limitations such as shortage of health workers and bed capacity.
- Most care providers at home lack basic knowledge on self-protection when caring for patients especially those with HIV and other infectious infections.
- HCBC helps reduce the stigma attached to some chronic diseases.
- There is need to offer continuity of care to prolong lives and reduce suffering of patients with chronic/terminal illness.

\section*{Objectives of HCBC.}
1) To facilitate the continuity of the client's care from the health facility to the home and community.
2) To promote family and community awareness of disease prevention and care related to chronic illnesses.
3) To empower the clients, the family and the community with the knowledge needed to ensure long-term care and support.
4) To raise the acceptability of terminally ill patients by the family/community, hence reducing the stigma.
5) To streamline the patient/client referral from the institutions into the community and from the community to appropriate health and social facilities.
6) To facilitate quality community care.
7) To mobilize the resources necessary for sustainability of the service.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED CARE.}
1) Ensure appropriate, cost-effective access to quality health care and support to enable persons living with chronic illnesses to retain their self-sufficiency and maintain quality of life.
2) Encouraging the active participation and involvement of the patient and their family.
3) Fostering the active participation and involvement of those most able to provide support to the community at all levels.
4) Ensuring respect for the basic human rights.
5) Instituting measures to ensure the economic sustainability of home and community care support.
6) Building and supporting referral networks/linkages and collaboration among participating entities.
7) Building capacity at the household, community and institutional levels.
8) Addressing the differential gender impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other chronic illnesses and care.
9) Developing the vital role of home and community based care as the link between prevention and care.
10) Taking a multi-sector approach to care and support.
11) Addressing the reproductive health needs of persons living with chronic illnesses.
12) Targeting social assistance to all affected families especially children.
13) Caring for caregivers, in order to minimise the physical and spiritual exhaustion that can come with the prolonged care of the terminally ill (Avoid burn-out).

\section*{HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED CARE NEEDS.}
1. Physical Needs.
- Drugs.
- Clinical care such as regular check-ups.
- Basic needs e.g. clothing, housing, food, fuel/energy, water, education for children and income.
- General nursing care - toilet needs, observation of vital signs, care of wounds, personal and oral hygiene and comfort.
- Nutritional needs.

- This will prolong their life and make it bearable by;
- Positive living and making decisions on the basis of informed choice.
- Reducing stress and anxiety for both the patients and their families.
- Helps people to understand and deal with their problems and communicate better with those around them.
- Helps clients to cope with their feelings.

\section*{Component 4: Social Support.}
- Information and referral to support groups such as church organisations, youth groups and other social organisations.
- Clients need assurance and acceptance by their families and the community.
- They should get involved in family/community activities depending on their capabilities.
- They should be provided with legal advice and material assistance.
- Should be given opportunities to write their own wills.

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF HCBC.}

\section*{- Patient.}
- The patient is cared for in a familiar environment hence less stress and more ability to bear the illness.
- When people are in their homes, they continue to participate in family matters.
- When one is at home close to family members, friends and relatives, there is a sense of belonging.
- one is in close contact with familiar people they are likely to accept their conditions and illnesses.
- Family and community.
- Caring for sick people at home prevents separation and holds family members together.
- Less expensive.
- Helps them to understand these diseases better and accept the patients.
- Community cohesiveness is maintained.
- Health institutions.
-less cost and pressure on resources.

\section*{PLAYERS IN HCBC.}
1. Patient-Identifies care giver, gives consent, participates in care.
2. Family Members and Caregiver.
3. Health care Team.
4. Health facility.
5. Community.
6. Government.

\section*{Resources Needed for Home-based Care.}
1. Money.
2. Materials.
3. Time.
4. Manpower.

\section*{Networking for Home-based Care.}

Network- is a group of individuals or organisations that work together, undertake joint activities, or exchange information in order to strengthen and extend their individual capacities.

\section*{Reasons for referring a patient.}
1. When services or resources within reach are not able to meet the patients' immediate needs.
2. In cases where the acute phase of the disease has been dealt with, and it is considered safe to transfer care to other caring services/organisations within the community.
3. When the caregiver experiences burnout and has no access to counselling services for personal growth.
4. When the caregiver has limitations in meeting certain needs of the patient, for example, based on religious beliefs.
5. For better, more competent management in the next stage of referral.
6. For specialised care in a hospital setting, especially if the patient is deteriorating.

\section*{Referral constraints.}
1. Competition among various organisations, so that they do not disclose what they are doing and which services are offered. They prefer to work in isolation.
2. Lack of evenly distributed community HCBC programmes, with the result that some areas lack services and some are overcrowded.
3. Lack of resources needed for patients to travel from one point to another.
4. Lack of referral and networking guidelines as well as standardised referral procedures.
5. Ignorance among family members about HCBC due to lack of awareness and proper guidance.
6. Fear of breach of confidentiality.

\section*{COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION.}

Definition: The process of getting the community incorporated to fully participate in the programmes for the purpose of ownership and sustainability. The community must participate and get involved in the decision making process, planning, organisation, and implementation and monitoring of activities associated with HCBC.

\section*{The importance of Community Mobilization.}
1. Prepare the community for participatory action.
2. Create awareness about their health problems, causes, prevention and care required.
3. Identify problems together with the community and seek means of solving them.
4. Gather information about the community's beliefs', feelings, myths and misconception of their problems.
5. Identify available resource and how the resources can be used to solve the problems.
6. Establish relationships within the community.
7. Ownership and sustainability of the programme.

\section*{Factors that can hinder Community Mobilization.}
1. Lack of involvement in problem identification.
2. Lack of appropriate information.
3. Lack or mismanagement of resources.
4. Insecurity.

6. Communication barriers.
7. Poor health.
8. Lack of ownership.
9. Lack of interest.
10.Poor infrastructure.
11.Lack of knowledge of other partners.
12.Social differences (religious, education, cultural, economic, political, tribal, etc).
13.Poor leadership.
14.Man-made or natural disasters.
15. Poor timing.

\section*{Mobilizers.}

3. Religious leaders.
4. Organised groups, for example, religious groups (women's guild), youth groups, women groups (the Maendeleo ya Wanawake organisation).
5. Community based health workers.
6. Community Own Resource Persons (CORPs), for example, traditional birth attendants and traditional healers.
7. Other ministries workers like social workers, school teachers, etc.
8. Patients themselves.

\section*{Ways of mobilizing the community:}
1. Meeting at specific prefixed times, e.g community barrazas.
2. Existing committees, such as the village development committee.
3. Home visits to groups and individuals.
4. Announcements at church, mosque, temple, and school.
5. Use of mass media electronic/print.

\section*{Process of Mobilization.}
1. Planning and organizing.
2. Community entry.
3. Conducting community mobilization sessions.
4. Evaluation and reinforcement.

\section*{COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY.}

\section*{What is Community Health Strategy?}
- It is the mechanism through which households and communities strengthen their role in health and health development by increasing their knowledge, skills and participation.
- Community participation will eventually contribute to socio-economic development of their community and the Country Kenya.
- Approach also recognizes the pivotal role of the health system in supporting community efforts.

\section*{Service charter for community health strategy.}

Vision: The vision for community health strategy is "healthy people living healthy and good quality lives in robust and vibrant. A community that makes up a healthy and vibrant nation".

Mission: The mission for community health strategy is for the community health approach to become the modality for social transformation for development from community level by establishing equitable, effective and efficient community units (CU's) all over Kenya.

\section*{Aims of the community health strategy.}
1. To empower Kenyan household and communities to take charge of improving their own health.
2. To build the capacity of households not only to demand services from all providers but to know and progressively realize their rights to equitable, good quality health care.

\section*{Overall goal for community health strategy.}
"Address community health problems".

\section*{Strategic objectives of community health strategy.}

Overall objective: Establish sustainable community level (Level 1) services aiming at promoting and empowering households and communities to take charge of their own health.

\section*{Specific objectives:}
1. Provide level one health services as per national health sector strategic plan 2005/2010.
2. Strengthen the capacity of community health volunteers.
3. To strengthen the linkage between community and facility based services.

\section*{Challenges/ Rationale.}
- Rising infant mortality rate from 64 per 1,000 live births in 1993, to 72 in 1998, 74 in 2000 and 77 per 1,000 live births in 2003 (KDS 2003).
- Rising under five mortality rate from 90.9 per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 115 per 1,000 live births in 2003 (KDS 2003).
- High maternal mortality rate of 590 per 100,000 in 1998 and 414 in 2002 per 100,000 live births (MOH 2005).

\section*{Specific challenges- KDHS 2003.}
- $30.7 \%$ of the children under 5 years were stunted.
- Only $2.6 \%$ children were still exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months while $56.8 \%$ (of $2.6 \%$ ) were still breastfeeding by end of 2003.
- Only 59.2 per cent of children in the second year of life were fully immunized.
- Only $4.3 \%$ under-fives and $4.5 \%$ pregnant mothers sleep under ITNs respectively.
- Only 40.8 per cent of deliveries were assisted by a health professional and only 39.4 per cent occur in health facilities.
- There were rising levels of communicable diseases (Malaria, TB, HIV etc).
- There was poor state of sanitation and water supply.
- Community members take care of preventive, promotive and some of the critically ill cases.

\section*{Justification of community health strategy.}
- Studies in Tanzania and Malawi have shown that $70 \%$ of child deaths occur at home, caused by preventable or easily curable diseases such as malaria, measles, ARI, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition.
- Formal health providers are supply driven (assume what they advised or give has been accepted or is practical), usually not true.
- Traditional and non-formal care is the first option for many people and they compete with formal health care system at community level.
- An effort to strengthen community level health care has been scattered, uncoordinated and vertically managed by various actors resulting on weak public health interventions.
- These contributed to the deterioration of health indices.

\section*{What does community health strategy entail?}
1. Establishing a level one care community unit to serve a local population of about 5000 people (CU).
2. Instituting a cadre of well-trained community health volunteers (CHVs) who will each provide level one service to about 20 households.
3. Supporting every 25 CHVs with a community health extension worker (CHEW) ensuring that the recruitment and management of CHVs is carried out by village and community health committees.

\section*{Community health strategy guiding principles.}
1. Organize communities into functional units of 1000 households.
2. Use CHVs who will work on voluntary basis.
3. Incentives to CHVs to include protective wear, where necessary, drug kits, reimbursement of direct costs and periodic reward for excellent performance.
4. CHV to be nominated by the communities on the basis of pre-defined criteria.
5. Community heath extension workers (CHEWs) to be on government payroll and facilitated (e.g. transport and lunches).
6. Community to play a leading role in joint health actions.
7. Coordination structure to bring all actors at all levels.
8. Strengthen effective communication through advocacy, social mobilization and interactive communication.

\section*{Workforce involved in implementation of community health strategy.}

CHVs - Expected to be mature, responsible and respected members of the community, men or women chosen by the community to provide basic health care. They should be good communicators and leaders who have shown signs of healthy practices as a parent or caregiver in their own households.

CHEWs - Are trained health personnel with certification in Nursing or Public health. They supervise CHVs and are ministry of health employees.
CHCs - Community health committees are a group of people who are charged with responsibility of leading community health action at the community unit level. They are composed of 9 to 11 people selected from the community. The CHEW is the secretary to CHC and the CHV is the treasurer in the committee.

\section*{Norms and standards for the community units (CUs).}
1. One CHV will serve 20 households or 100 people.
2. One community health extension worker- CHEW (trained PHT, PHO, Community Nurse, registered nurse) will supervise and support 25 CHVS .
3. One level one unit (Community Unit) will serve 5000 people and requires;
- 50 CHVs .
- 2 health extension workers.

\section*{Strategy.}
- This is a new dimension of health service delivery.
- There is need to develop a comprehensive message (for all the services: including Malaria, HIV/AIDS, RH, etc) for a CHV to deliver for their catchment's population and covering different cohorts.
- Provide them with one comprehensive Kit to go with while providing health services.

NB: Kenya's NHSSP II (2005-2010) defined a new approach to the way the health sector will deliver health care services to Kenyans by introducing Kenya essential package of health (KEPH). Subsequently, KEPH introduced $\mathbf{6}$ lifecycle cohorts and $\mathbf{6}$ service delivery levels.

\section*{Life cycle cohorts.}
1. Pregnancy and new born (Up-to 2wks of age).
2. Early childhood ( 2 wks to 5 years).
3. Late childhood (6 to 12 years).
4. Youth and adolescents ( 13 to 24 years).
5. Adulthood ( 25 to 59 years).
6. Elderly (60+ years).

\section*{Service delivery levels.}

\section*{Level 1 services include the following;}
- Disease prevention and control to reduce morbidity, disability and mortality.
- Communicable disease control - HIV/AIDS, STI's, TB, Malaria, Epidemics.
- First Aid and emergency preparedness/ treatment of injuries/ trauma.
- IEC materials for community health promotion and disease prevention.

- Promoting early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months.
- Defaulter tracing on immunization and vitamin A supplementation.
- Growth monitoring and referral of moderately and severely malnourished children.
- Promoting utilization of MCH/FP services including ANC, skilled birth attendance, post natal care, immunization and nutrition.
- Non communicable diseases control, nutritional deficiencies, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neoplasms (tumors), anemia, mental health, etc.
- Community based referral system for women and children requiring intervention by skilled workers.

\section*{3. Hygiene and Environmental sanitation.}
- Promotion of use of latrines for waste disposal.
- Protection of water supply, including protection of springs.
- Promotion of household water treatment, control of insects and rodents.
- Promotion of hand washing at critical times (before eating, after visiting toilets, before preparation of foods).
- Promoting Healthy home environment - environmental sanitation.
- Organize community health days.

\section*{Roles of households in health.}
1. Disease prevention.
2. Care seeking and compliance with treatment and advice.
3. Health promotion within members.
4. Governance and management of health services.

\section*{Interventions.}
1. Establish L1 service package for each implementing unit.
2. Distribute supplies according to guidelines and controls.
3. Promote early service seeking behavior.
4. Facilitate health promotion.
5. Facilitate environmental sanitation, safe water supply and personal hygiene.
6. Provide first aid and treatment of common ailments.
7. Establish a referral mechanism and identify and refer clients.

\section*{Policy issues.}
- All programs to buy into this strategy and minimise provision of messages vertically.
- PHTs, PHOs, RNs and ECHNs to be retrained and deployed as health extension workers.
- Allow committees to identify CHVs.
- Let there be a plan to retain the CHVs.
- Incentives for CHVs to be sustained.

\section*{VISION 2030, MILENIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.}

\section*{The Kenya health policy 2012-2030.}

Goal- Attaining the highest possible health standards in a manner responsible to the population needs.
Aims- To achieve this goal through supporting provision of equitable, affordable and quality health related services at the highest attainable standards to all Kenyans.
- This policy gives Kenyans direction to ensure significant improvement in overall status of health in line with vision 2030 and the constitution.
- The policy is based on three pillars;
1. Political.
2. Economical.
3. Social.

\section*{The 3 pillars of vision 2030.}

The adoption of the vision 2030 by Kenya came after a successful implementation of the economic recovery strategy (ERS) for wealth and employment creation. This increased GDP from 0.6\% in 2002 to $6.1 \%$ in 2006.
1. Economic pillar: The aim is to improve prosperity of all Kenyans through economic development programme in all regions of Kenya. It also aimed at achieving a GDP growth rate of $10 \%$ per annum beginning 2012.
2. Social pillar: Seeks to build a just and cohesive social equity in a clean and secure environment.
3. Political pillar: It aims to realize a democratic political system founded on issue based politics that respects the rule of law and protects the right and freedom of every individual in Kenyan society.

\section*{NB: The vision 2030 is to be implemented in successive five-year medium term plans; Five year medium term plans;}

$1^{\text {st }}$ period $\quad$ - $\quad 2008-2012$.
$2^{\text {nd }}$ period - $\quad 2012-2017$.
$3^{\text {rd }}$ period - $\quad 2017-2022$.
$4^{\text {th }}$ period - $\quad 2022-2027$.
$5^{\text {th }}$ period - $2027-2030$.

\section*{MILLENIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGs).}

The millennium development goals were eight in number, namely;
1. Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty.
2. Achieve universal primary education.
3. Gender equality and women empowerment.
4. Reduce child mortality indicators.
5. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
6. Improve maternal health.
7. Ensure environmental sustainability.
8. Develop a global partnership for development.

\section*{Change of MDGs to SDGs - (Sustainable development goals).}

By 2015 the goals of MDG s were not met, thus a meeting was held in Sept 2015 and came up with the 17 sustainable development goals (SDG s).
- The new set of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aimed to end poverty and hunger by 2030.
- World leaders, recognizing the connection between people and planet, have set goals for the land, the oceans and the waterways.
- The world is also better connected now than it was in 2000 , and is building a consensus about the future we want.
- That future is one where everybody has enough food, and can work, and where living on less than $\$ 1.25$ a day is a thing of the past.

\section*{THE 17 SDGs.}
1. SDG 1 No poverty.
2. SDG 2 Zero hunger.
3. SDG3 Good health and well-being.
4. SDG 4 Quality education.
5. SDG 5 Gender equality.
6. SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation.
7. SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy.
8. SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth.
9. SDG 9 Industry innovation and infrastructure.
10.SDG 10 Reduced inequalities.
11.SDG 11 Sustainable cities and communities.
12.SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production.
13.SDG 13 Climate action.
14.SDG 14 Life below water.
15.SDG 15 Life on land.
16.SDG 16 Peace, justice and strong institutions.
17.SDG 17 Partnership for the goals.
1. End poverty in all its forms.
- End of extreme poverty in all forms by 2030.
- In 2000, the world committed to cutting the number of people living in extreme poverty by half in 15 years and we met this goal.
- However, more than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $\$ 1.25$ a day, that's about the equivalent of the entire population of Europe living in extreme poverty.

\section*{2. Improve food security and nutrition.}
- In the past 20 years, hunger has dropped by almost half.
- Many countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of their most vulnerable people.
- That means doing things such as promoting sustainable agriculture and supporting small farmers.
- It's a tall order but for the sake of the nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth who go to bed hungry every night, we've got to try.

\section*{3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being.}
- We all know how important it is to be in good health.
- Since 1990, we've made big strides, preventable child deaths are down by more than half, and maternal mortality is down by almost as much.
- Some other numbers remain tragically high, like every year 6 million children die before their fifth birthday.
- AIDS is the leading cause of death for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.
- We have the means to turn that around and make good health more than just a wish.

\section*{4. Ensure equitable quality education.}
- Poverty, armed conflict and other emergencies keep many kids around the world out of school.
- In developing regions, kids from the poorest households are four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest house- holds.
- Since 2000 , there has been enormous progress on the goal to provide primary education to all children world- wide.
- The primary school enrolment rate in developing regions reached $91 \%$.
- More girls are in school now compared to the year 2000.
- Most regions have reached gender parity in primary education.
- This goal aims to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere.

\section*{5. Ensure gender equality and women empowerment.}
- Women and girls continue to suffer from distribution and violence in every part of the world.
- 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages 15-49 have reported experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner.
- Many countries have no laws protecting women from domestic violence.
- Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work and representation in political and economic decision-making processes.
- Many countries have taken action to track budget allocation for gender equality.

\section*{6. Ensure availability of water and sanitation.}
- Everyone on earth should have access to safe and affordable drinking water.
- That's the goal for 2030.
- Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, and that number is projected to go even higher as a result of climate change.
- If we continue the path we're on, by 2050 at least one in four people are likely to be affected by recurring water shortages.
- Diarrhea, caused by inadequate access to water and sanitation, is the fifth leading cause of death in the world.
- Unsafe water and sanitation facilities account for most of the 1.2 million deaths of children under five each year caused by diarrhea.
- They also cause great suffering in both adults and children through diseases associated with intestinal parasites.

\section*{7. Ensure access to affordable energy.}
- Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity increased by 1.7 billion. That's progress to be proud of.
- As the world's population continues to rise, more people will need cheap energy to light their homes and streets, use phones and computers and do their everyday business.
- The way we get energy is an issue. Fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions (e.g Water vapour, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, methane, nitrous oxide, Ozone, etc) are making drastic changes in the climate, leading to big problems on every continent.

\section*{8. Promote sustainable economic growth.}
- An important part of economic growth is that people should have jobs that pay enough to support themselves and their families.
- The middle class is growing worldwide, almost tripling in size in developing countries in the last 25 years.
- But in 2015, there was widening inequalities where over 200 million people had no jobs.
- We can promote policies that encourage entrepreneurship and job creation.

\section*{9. Build infrastructure and sustainable industrialization.}
- Technological progress helps us address big global challenges such as creating jobs and becoming more energy efficient.
- The world is becoming ever more interconnected and prosperous through internet.
- The more connected we are, the more we benefit from the wisdom and contributions of people everywhere on earth.

\section*{10. Reduce inequality among countries.}
- The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.
- We can and must adopt policies that create opportunity for everyone, regardless of whom they are or where they come from.
- Income inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions.
- That means improving the regulation of financial markets and institutions, sending development aid where it is most needed and helping people migrate safely so they can pursue opportunities.

\section*{11. Make cities and human settlements safe.}
- More than half the world's population now lives in cities and that figure will go to about two- thirds of humanity by the year 2050 .
- In 1990 there were ten "mega-cities" with 10 million inhabitants or more.
- In 2014, there were 28 mega-cities, home to 453 million people.
- To make cities sustainable for all, we can create good affordable public housing, upgrade slum settlements, invest in public transport, create green spaces and get involved in urban planning decisions.

\section*{12.Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.}
- A big share of the world population is consuming too little to meet even their basic needs.
- We can have a world where everybody gets what they need to survive and thrive.
- We can consume in a way that preserves our natural resources so that our children can enjoy them.
- Help countries that have not consumed a lot to move towards more responsible consumption patterns.

\section*{13. Take action to combat climate change and its impacts.}
- Every country in the world is seeing the drastic effects of climate change, some more than others.
- The impact of global warming is getting worse.
- On average, the annual losses from earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones and flooding count in hundreds of billions of dollars.
- This goal lays out a way for countries to work together to meet this urgent challenge.

\section*{14. Conserve and use marine resources for sustainable development.}
- More than 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal diversity for their livelihoods.
- Today we are seeing nearly a third of the world's fish stocks overexploited.
- Oceans absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide that humans produce.
- We are producing more carbon dioxide than ever before and that makes the oceans more acidic, $26 \%$ more, since the start of the industrial revolution.
- This goal targets for the managing and protecting the life below the water.

\section*{15. Protect and restore ecosystems.}
- Humans and other animals rely on other forms of life on land for food, clean air, clean water, and as a means of combating climate change.
- Plant life makes up $80 \%$ of the human diet.
- Forests, which cover $30 \%$ of the earth's surface, help keep the air and water clean and the earth's climate in balance.
- Plants and forests are home to millions of animal species.
- Arable land is disappearing 30 to 35 times faster than it has historically.
- Deserts are spreading.
- Animal breeds are going extinct.
- This goals aims to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, dry lands and mountains by 2020 .

\section*{16. Promote peace, justice and strong institutions.}
- People cannot eat, learn, work and raise families without peace.
- A country cannot have peace without justice, without human rights, without government based on the rule of law.
- This goals aims to reduce all forms of violence and propose that governments and communities find lasting solutions to conflict and insecurity.

\section*{17. Strengthen partnership for the goals.}
- The world is more interconnected today than ever before by internet, travel and global institutions.
- 193 countries agreed on these Goals.
- This final goal lays out a way for Nations to work together to achieve all the other goals.

\section*{IMMUNIZATION.}

\section*{Definition of Terms.}

Immunisation: Is the process of reinforcing someone's immune system by the use of vaccines or related substances.
Prophylaxis: Refers to the administration of drugs or vaccines for prevention rather than curative purposes.
Antigen: Is any substance which is capable, under appropriate conditions, of inducing a specific immune response. E.g. toxins, foreign proteins, microorganisms and tissue cells.
Antibody: Antibody is a special protein (immunoglobulin) found in tissue fluid and blood serum. It is produced in response to specific antigen for protection against the specific antigen.
Immunity: This is the ability of the body to resist harmful disease organisms.
Vaccine: A vaccine is made of an organism or a toxin which is either killed or attenuated.
Attenuated: Refers to reduced power/ virulence micro-organisms depriving them of their pathogenic properties without killing them, or inactivating their antigenicity properties.

\section*{Types of immunity.}

Passive immunity: This is when one is protected temporarily by use of "borrowed" antibodies.
Active immunity: A type of immunity developed by own production of antibodies.
Herd immunity: This develops when a high proportion of the community, $80 \%$ or more, have been immunized.
Natural immunity: This is immunity conferred by antibodies produced naturally i.e. With no human intervention.
Artificial immunity: This is immunity conferred by antibodies produced through human intervention.

\section*{Introduction.}
- Worldwide, millions of children die as a result of disease such as TB, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, Hepatitis B, HIB(meningitis), pneumonia, yellow fever and vitamin A deficiency.
- Many more children become disabled through complications caused by these diseases which could be prevented through immunisation.
- Immunisation has proved to be a cost-effective weapon in the control, prevention and even elimination of these diseases.
- WHO, UNICEF and other agencies came with strategies to strengthen, improve and expand the existing immunisation services and thus the basis for expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI).
- Increased immunisation coverage.
- Use of potent vaccines.
- Training health workers who offer immunisation services.
- Availing human and material resources for immunisation activities.
- Community participation in the programme.
- Monitoring and evaluation.
- Provide immunisation against the EPI target diseases and Tetanus toxoid for pregnant women or women of child-bearing age.
- Promote immunisation programmes, including vaccine production and quality control.
- Intensify implementation of the immunization activities and sustainability within the framework of the maternal and child health services.

\section*{The Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI).}
- Kenya is a member of the WHO and thus following the EPI programme initiative.
- The government adopted the Programme and called it the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunisation.
- The name has since changed to Division of vaccines and Immunization.

\section*{Objectives of DVI.}
- Immunisation coverage of at least $95 \%$ i.e. $95 \%$ of children to be fully immunized before the age of 1 year.
- Eradication of poliomyelitis.
- Eradication of Neonatal tetanus.
- Control of Measles.

\section*{Components of DVI.}
1. Training: Refresher post basic courses, basic training and on job trainings (OJT).
2. Cold chain: Accurate records of the functioning of the cold chain to enable the detection of any breaks in the chain, training of technicians for maintenance of cold chain equipment.
3. Supervision: Decentralised to sub-county level. Supervisory check lists and vehicles have been provided.
4. Surveillance: Sub-counties should send returns for DVI targeted diseases (measles, poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus).
5. Health communication: This includes health education and social mobilization.
6. Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation of all aspects of the programme at all levels are designed as on-going functions.
7. Logistics and Supplies: This includes vaccines, child health cards, reporting forms, cold chain equipment, transport, gas, syringes, needles, etc.
8. Integration: Integration of immunization with maternal and child health services was done from the outset.
9. Social mobilisation: To achieve the DVI objectives, we need to convince families to bring children for immunisation so as to increase community involvement and participation.

\section*{Policy issues.}
- Integration of the KEPI programme within the MCH services.
- Sterilize all immunization equipment's/supplies using steam sterilizers for the recommended period of 20 minutes.
- Use of disposable, sterile syringe and needle per injection.
- Use potent vaccines kept at 0 degrees to +8 degree centigrade.
- Keep vaccines on ice-packs during vaccination sessions.
- Discard all opened and unused vaccines at the end of the day.
- BCG should be discarded at the end of 4 hrs of reconstitution.
- Hold vaccination sessions daily in fixed facilities from 8 a.m. to 5p.m supplemented by outreach services as appropriate.
- No child above 9 months should be discharged from the hospital without having immunization status checked.

- $3^{\text {rd }}$ Dose

6 months after $2^{\text {nd }}$ dose or in next pg
- $4^{\text {th }}$ Dose

1 yr after $3^{\text {rd }}$ dose or in subsequent pg.
- $5^{\text {th }}$ Dose

1 yr after $4^{\text {th }}$ dose or in subsequent pg.

\section*{Determining Vaccination Coverage.}
- This mainly indicates how many children or mothers were actually immunised in comparison to the targeted population.
- Target population: The number of children that need immunization in a catchments area. In Kenya.
- It is assumed that the number of children born in any catchments area is $4 \%$ of the total population.
- Catchment area: The geographical region and the population within the region, that a health facility is mandated to serve.

\section*{Determining Vaccination Coverage. Formula.}
- Number of doses of vaccine given to children under 1yr, divided by the target population of children under 1 yr multiplied times 100 .
- This will then give you the percentage of the target population covered with the vaccine.

\section*{Example.}
- If Kora community had used 2,400 doses of Pentavalent 1 on children below one year during the year 2010, while their target population was estimated at 2800, find out percentage coverage of Pentavalent vaccine for that year.
$2400 \times 100=86 \%$.
2800

\section*{Preparation of Vaccine Service Delivery Site/Facility.}
- Should be clean, and not directly exposed to sunlight, rain or dust.
- Should be easily accessible.
- It should be quiet enough for the health worker to carry out health education.
- There should be necessary furniture e.g. a table and chairs.
- The place should be spacious enough.
- It should be equipped with sufficient supplies of syringes, needles, gloves, disinfection equipment and a safety box.

\section*{Cold Chain.}
- The cold chain is a systems/ process of maintaining the vaccine in a potent state from the time it is manufactured and as it passes through various suppliers and stores to reach its final recipient, that is, the mother and child.
- Vaccines are very delicate and easily loose their potency, when exposed to high temperature, sunlight or freezing conditions.

\section*{Elements of the Cold Chain System.}
- Trained, skilled and motivated staff.
- Efficient and reliable equipment.
- Efficient distribution of vaccines.

\section*{VACCINE STORAGE.}

NB: Different vaccines are damaged by different conditions;
- Polio vaccine is damaged by heat.
- Measles and BCG are damaged by direct sunlight.
- DPT, TT and HB can be damaged if frozen.

\section*{Cold Chain Equipment.}
- Cold room and its accessories- This is used for bulky storage at central stores.
- Refrigerators - These are used mainly for storage at the health facility level.
- Cold boxes- These are used for storage, especially during transportation.
- Vaccine carriers - These are only used for temporally storage during short distance transportation and service delivery.
- Ice packs - These are needed to maintain low temperature in cold boxes and vaccine carriers and placement of vaccines during service delivery.
- Thermometers - These are needed to monitor the temperatures at all times.

\section*{Cold Chain System Monitoring tools.}
- Temperature Recording- Done twice daily (morning and afternoon).
- Cold Chain Monitor Cards.
- These cards are used to monitor the process and ensure that the cold chain is maintained.
- They irreversibly change colour if the vaccines are exposed to temperatures above the safe limit of $\mathbf{1 0}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} \mathbf{C}$.
- Commonly used to monitor temperature during transport and in storage.
- Manufacturers should pack a CCM card or manufacturer-validated monitor in each carton of vaccine shipped.
- The recommended temperatures for cold chain is $+2-+\mathbf{8}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$.

\section*{Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM).}
- A vaccine vial monitor (VVM) is a label on a vaccine vial that changes color when exposed to heat over a period of time.
- Health workers check the VVM before they open a vial to see whether the vaccine has been damaged by heat.

\section*{The Freeze Watch Indicator.}
- A freeze watch indicator consists of a small vial of red liquid attached to a white card and covered in plastic.
- The vial breaks releasing the liquid if the temperature where the indicator is located drops below $\mathbf{0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ for more than one hour, and the vaccine must then be destroyed.

\section*{Shake Test.}
- The sedimentation rate of a suspect vial is compared with a similar Tetanus Toxoid vial that is known to have been stored at the correct temperature.
- Shake the two vials vigorously and inspect carefully in strong light.

\section*{STOP watch refrigerator monitors.}
- A combination of a Cold Chain Monitor card and Freeze Watch.
- Indicator is used to continuously monitor temperature range in vaccine refrigerators.
- The heat indicator irreversibly records cumulative heat exposures of $+10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- The freeze component bursts at temperatures below $-4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{MISSED OPPORTUNITIES IN IMMUNIZATION.}

\section*{Definition.}
- It's a situation whereby an eligible child or woman comes to a health facility and does not receive a vaccine dose (s) for which he/ she is eligible for.

\section*{Methods of reducing missed opportunities.}
- Identification of missed opportunities by examining health records and immunization cards and conducting surveys to measure missed opportunities.
- Checking the immunization status of every child 0-23 months and pregnant women visiting health facilities for any season.
- Those in need should be immunized before leaving.
- Avoiding false contraindications to immunizations e.g. fever.
- Review of the national immunization schedule to ensure that it provides optimal protection at the earliest age.
- Ensuring that all eligible women and children have an immunization card and that they bring the card to every clinic visit and that these cards are checked by the health worker on every visit and the relevant details discussed with the guardian.
- Ensuring that those who are admitted are immunized on admission or before discharge.
- Adequate and competent staff.
- Integration e.g. in MCH clinic.
- Adequate supplies.
- Increasing accessibility of immunization services e.g. avoiding long waiting hours and long procedures and offering affordable services.

\section*{FAMILY PLANNING AND CONTRACEPTION.}

\section*{Broad Objective.}

By the end of this session you will be able to discuss all the available methods of family planning.

\section*{Specific Objectives.}
1. To define family planning and contraception.
2. To describe the various types of family planning methods in terms of;
- What it is.
- Effectiveness.
- Advantages.
- Disadvantages.
- Client instructions.
- Complications.
- Common medical barriers to service provision.
- Management and complications.

\section*{Introduction.}

Family planning: A basic human right for an individual or couple to;
- Exercise control over their fertility.
- Make informed and voluntary decision on the number of children they want to have.
- When to have the first and last pregnancy.
- The space between pregnancies.
- It is achieved through use of contraceptives.

\section*{Contraception is defined as:}
- The process through which family planning methods are provided to prevent pregnancy.

\section*{FAMILY PLANNING METHODS.}

\section*{1.Natural methods (fertility based awareness).}

There are two broad categories'
a) Calendar based methods.
- Standard Days Method.
b) Symptoms based methods.
- Two-day method.
- Cervical mucus or Billings Ovulation Method.
- Basal Body Temperature (BBT).
- Sympto-thermal method (Cervical mucus + BBT).

\section*{2.Hormonal methods.}
- Oral contraceptives - combined, progestin only.
- Injectable- Progestin only, Combined.
- Contraceptive.
- Vaginal rings.
- Implants.

\section*{3.Intrauterine devices}
- a) Copper T.
- b) Nova T.
- c) Multi load.
- d) Hormone releasing (Mirena).
- e) Gynea fix.

\section*{4.Barrier methods.}
a). Male condom.
b). Female condom.
c). Diaphragm.
d). Cervical cap.
e). Spermicides.

NB: c, d, and e above not in use and omitted in revised guidelines (2010).

\section*{5. Voluntary surgical contraception- BTL and Vasectomy.}

\section*{6.Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM).}
- Temporary method of FP based on lack of ovulation resulting from exclusive breastfeeding.
- Used during first 6 Months post-partum only when fertility is low and infant is fed exclusively on breast milk.
- $98 \%$ effective if used correctly.

\section*{LAM is defined by three criteria:}
- Woman's menses have not resumed.
- Baby is exclusively breastfed.
- Baby is less than 6 Months old.

If the above three are not met, use another FP method.

\section*{LAM: Advantages.}
- Protection against pregnancy as long as three LAM criteria are met.
- Does not interfere with sexual activity.
- Affordable-no direct cost for FP.
- Counseling for LAM encourages starting on a follow-up on method at the proper time.
- No systemic side effects.
- No medical supervision necessary.

\section*{LAM: Non-contraceptive benefits.}

\section*{For infant:}
- Passive immunization and protection from other infectious diseases.
- Best source of nutrition.
- Decreased exposure to contaminants in water, other milk or formulas, or on utensils

\section*{For mother:}
- Decreased postpartum bleeding.
- Postpartum Uterine involution is facilitated.
- Maternal bonding with the baby.

\section*{LAM: Limitations.}
- Effective only if the three criteria are met.
- Does not protect against STIs (e.g., HIV, etc).

\section*{Reasons that can make a mother not exclusively breastfeed;}
1. Breastfeeding can transmit HIV from mother to baby (Higher risk with mixed feeding).
2. If woman is taking certain drugs e.g. mood altering drugs, radio-active drugs, reserpine (antipsychotic), etc)
3. Exclusive breastfeeding may be difficult or inconvenient for working mothers.
4. The newborn who has a condition that makes it difficult to breastfeed e.g. preterm (premature), cleft lip and palate.

\section*{Medical eligibility Criteria for LAM.}
- Women whose babies are less than 6 months.
- Exclusively breastfeeding mother.
- Amenorrheic (non-menstruation).

\section*{Note:}
- Counsel woman in advance about future contraceptive options and to initiate another method as soon as;
- Menstruation begins.
- Baby is about to turn 6 months.
- Supplementary feeding begins (Weaning).

\section*{LAM: Client instructions on breastfeeding.}
- Breastfeed from both breasts on demand (about 6-10 times per day).
- Breastfeed at least once during night (no more than 6 hours should pass between any two feedings).
- Do not substitute other food or liquids for breast milk meal.
- If baby does not want to breastfeed 6-10 times per day or baby chooses to sleep through the night, LAM will be less effective as a contraceptive method.
- Once you substitute other food or drink for breastfeeding meals, the baby will suckle less, and LAM will no longer be an effective contraceptive method.

\section*{LAM: Client instructions for contraception.}
- Always keep a backup method of contraception, such as condoms, readily available.
- Use it if;
- Your menses returns.
- You begin supplementing your baby's diet.
- Your baby reaches 6 months of age.
- Consult your healthcare provider or clinic before starting another contraceptive method.
- If you or your partner is at high risk for STIs, including the HIV, you should use condoms as well as LAM.

\section*{HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS.}
- Methods containing synthetic hormones (estrogen, progestin or a combination of both hormones) similar to natural hormones in a woman's body.
- Mainly prevent ovulation or make cervical mucus too thick for sperm penetration.
- Do not protect against STIs including HIV and Hepatitis B.
- Dual protection is recommended.

NB:

\section*{Estrogen:}
- Carries messages for preparation of menses.
- It keeps vagina wet, breasts growth and female organs.
- It helps in storing fats in the muscles.
- It controls normal sex drive.
- Progestin:
- Is produced by ovary after ovulation.
- Decreases breast cell growth.
- Promote normal cell death hence prevents cancer.
- Stimulates normal sex drive.
- It promotes uterine muscle contraction.

The pills will inhibit ovulation and lessen menstrual flow.

\section*{Classification of hormonal contraceptives.}
1.Oral contraceptives.
a) Combined oral contraceptives (COC).
b) Progestin only pill (POP).
2.Injectable Contraceptives.
a) Combined injectable.
b) Progestin only.
3.Implants.
c) Jadelle (on the upper arm).
d) Implanon.
4.Contraceptive patches.
5.Vaginal rings.
6.Hormone releasing intrauterine contraceptive device.

\section*{Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs).}
- Pills containing synthetic estrogen and progestin similar to the natural hormones in a woman's body. The amount of constituent hormones varies in different preparations.

\section*{Types of COCs.}
- Packets of 21 or 28 tablets.
- In 28 pill packet only first 21 contain hormones, rest contain iron.

\section*{Low dose pills are available in three types.}
- Monophasic-Each active pill contains same amount of oestrogen and progestin e.g. microgynon, Nordette, Marvelon.
- Biphasic-Active pills contain two different dose combinations of oestrogen and progestin. E.g. 21 cycle-10 may contain one combination, another e.g. Ovanon, Normovlar.
- Triphasic- Active pills contain three different dose combinations of oestrogen and progestin e.g. 21 cycle- 6 one combination, 5 another and 10 a different combination. E.g. Logynon, Trinordial, Trigestrel, Triquillar.

\section*{COCs: Contraceptive benefits.}
- Highly effective and effective immediately when started within the first five days of the menstrual cycle.

COCs: Non-contraceptive benefits.
- Decreases menstrual flow (lighter and shorter periods) hence prevent anaemia.
- Decrease dysmenorrheal (Painful periods).
- Reduce symptoms of endometriosis (Misplaced endometrium).
- Treat acne (Red pimples on skin) and hirsuitism (unwanted female hair growth).
- Protects against ovarian and endometrial cancer.
- Provide possible protection against symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease.

- Condition needs evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment as appropriate.
- Client can continue using POPs while her condition is being evaluated.
- If the bleeding is caused by an STI or a PID, she can continue using POPs during treatment.
2. Starting Treatment with Anticonvulsants, Rifampicin, Rifabutin or Ritonavir.
- If medication require long term treatment client may choose an alternative method.
- If treatment is short term client may use a backup method in addition to POPs.
3. Migraine (Severe) headache.
- Migraine headaches without aura (disturbance), client can continue to use POPs if she wishes.
- Migraine headaches with aura, a client should stop taking POPs, and provider helps her choose a method without hormones.

\section*{4. Certain serious health conditions.}
- These might include liver disease, ischemic heart disease or stroke, breast cancer, etc.
- If the condition becomes worse after the client starts using POPs, she should stop immediately.
- Help her choose another method.

\section*{5. Suspected pregnancy.}
- Assess client for pregnancy and if pregnancy is confirmed including ectopic pregnancy instruct her to stop taking POPs.

\section*{EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION.}

What it is?.
- Contraceptive methods used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex

Also known as:
- Morning-After Pills
- Post-coital Contraception

Effective if taken within $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ hrs
- ECPs seem to prevent between75-95\% percent of pregnancies that would otherwise have occurred.
- The average chance of pregnancy resulting from one act of unprotected intercourse in the second or third week of the menstrual cycle is estimated at $8 \%$.
- After emergency oral contraception it is $1.2 \%$.
- ECPs prevent pregnancy through:
1. Preventing or delaying ovulation
2. Inhibiting or slowing down transportation of egg and sperm through the fallopian tubes which prevents fertilization and implantation.

\section*{Emergency Contraception:}

\section*{Types.}
- Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs):
- Low-dose ( $30-35 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ Ethinly Estradiol and $150 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ Levonogestrel) e.g. Microgynon- 4 tablets immediately, repeat dose after 12 hrs .
- High-dose ( $50 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ Ethinly Estradiol and $250 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ LNG) e.g. Eugynon- 2 tablets immediately, repeat dose after 12 hrs .
- Progestin-Only Pills (POPs):
- Levonogestrel (preferred e.g. Postinor 2-1 tablet, repeat after 12hrs or 2 tablets as single dose).
- Regular POPs (Microlut-20 tablets and repeat after 12 hrs ).
- Intra- Uterine- Device (IUDs): e.g TCu 380A, Multi-load 375, Nova T, Mirena.

\section*{Emergency Contraception:}

\section*{Advantages.}
- Safe, effective and easy to use.
- No medical examination or pregnancy tests are necessary or required.
- It can be used at any time during the menstrual cycle.
- ECPs are available in government, private, and NGO health facilities; and over the counter at pharmacies.

\section*{Emergency Contraception:}

\section*{Limitations.}
- ECPs are only effective if used within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.

- Requires daily record keeping.
- Vaginal infections make cervical mucus difficult to interpret.
- Basal thermometer needed for some methods.
- Does not protect against STIs (e.g., HBV, HIV and AIDS).

\section*{Who can use these methods?}

- Whose partner will not cooperate (abstain) during certain times in the cycle.
- Who dislike touching their genitals.

\section*{Conditions requiring precautions.}
- Irregular menses.
- Persistent vaginal discharge.
- Breastfeeding.

\section*{Client instructions for calendar method.}
- Monitor length of at least 6 menstrual cycles while abstaining or using another contraceptive method.
- Calculate when fertile days occur following the instructions below.
- From number of days in longest cycle, subtract 11.
- This identifies the last fertile day of cycle.
- From number of days in shortest cycle, subtract 18.
- This identifies the first fertile day of your cycle.
- For example, if the last 6 cycles were: $28,26,29,27,29$, and 27 days long:
- The first day of the fertile phase $=26-18=8$
- The last day of the fertile phase $=29-11=18$
- Accordingly, sexual intercourse should be avoided from days 8-18 of the menstrual cycle (both days inclusive).

\section*{Client instructions for BBT method.}

\section*{Thermal Shift Rule:}
- Take temperature at about same time each morning (before rising) and record temperature on chart provided by NFP instructor.
- Use temperatures recorded on chart for first 10 days of menstrual cycle to identify highest of "normal, low" temperatures (i.e., daily temperatures charted in typical pattern without any unusual conditions).
- Disregard any temperatures that are abnormally high due to fever or other disruptions.
- Draw a line $0.05-0.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ above highest of these 10 temperatures.
- This line is called the cover line or temperature line.
- The infertile phase begins on the evening of the third consecutive day that temperature stays above the cover line (Thermal Shift Rule).
- Abstain from sexual intercourse from the beginning of menstrual period until beginning of infertile phase.
- If any of 3 temperatures falls on or below cover line during 3-day count, this may be a sign that ovulation has not yet taken place.
- To avoid pregnancy, wait until 3 consecutive temperatures are recorded above cover line before resuming intercourse.
- After infertile phase begins, you may stop taking temperature until next menstrual cycle begins and continue to have intercourse until first day of next menstrual period.

\section*{Client instructions for Billings Method.}
- As mucus may change during the day, observe it several times throughout the day.
- Every night before going to bed, determine highest level of fertility and mark chart with appropriate symbol.
- Abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 1 cycle so that you will know the mucus days. Avoid intercourse during your menstrual period.
- During dry days after period, it is safe to have intercourse.
- As soon as any mucus or sensation of wetness appears, avoid intercourse or sexual contact.
- Mark last day of clear, slippery, stretchy mucus with an X.
- This is the peak day, the most fertile time.
- After the peak day, avoid intercourse for next 3 dry days and nights.
- These days are not safe.
- Beginning on the morning of the fourth dry day, it is safe to have intercourse until your menstrual period begins again.

\section*{Client instructions for symptom-thermal method.}
- After menstrual bleeding stops, you may have intercourse on the evening of every dry day during infertile days before ovulation.
- The fertile phase begins when wet vaginal sensations or any mucus appears.
- Abstain from intercourse until fertile phase ends.
- Abstain from intercourse until both peak day and thermal shift rules have been applied.
- When these rules do not identify the same day as being the end of the fertile phase, always follow rule that identifies the longest fertile phase.

\section*{Client instructions for standard days method (SDM).}
- To prevent pregnancy the couple abstains from sex, uses barrier method or withdraw on day 8 to 19 of the cycle formula based on computer analysis of thousands of menstrual cycles.
- The use of SDM is facilitated by cycle beads, a color coded strings of beads that represent the days of the cycle.
- Important to note is that this method works with women whose menstrual cycle is between 26 to 32 days.
- Breastfeeding women or those who are using, or recently have used, contraceptive injectables need to wait a few cycles before they can use SDM.

Coitus interruptus (Withdrawal method).
- What it is?
- The man withdraws his penis from his partner's vagina and ejaculates outside the vagina keeping his semen away from her external genitalia.

\section*{Client's instructions for coitus interruptus.}
- An alternative family planning method to be given until the man learns to use the withdrawal method correctly.
- Note men who have difficulty with sensing ejaculation and those who get premature ejaculation this method may be unfavorable.
- If ejaculation occurs before withdrawal, the female client must be referred for emergency contraception.

\section*{BARRIER METHODS.}

\section*{What are they?}
- These are methods that prevent the sperms from gaining access to the upper reproductive tract thus preventing it from meeting the egg.

\section*{Types of barrier methods:}
- Male condom.
- Female condom.

- This can be conducted on the male or female client.

\section*{VSC: Types.}
- Tubal Ligation (Female Volutary Sterilization).
- Laparoscopy.
- Minilaparatomy.
- Vasectomy (Male voluntary sterilization).

\section*{Mechanism of action.}
- Vasectomy: In men the tubes through which sperms travel from the testes to the penis (vas deferens) are tied and cut so that sperm can no longer enter the semen that is ejaculated.
- Tubal Ligation: In women both fallopian tubes are tied and cut using a modern operation Mini-Lap) so that the ovum cannot travel through them to meet the sperm and be fertilized.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{VSC: Effectiveness}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Vasectomy- advantages.}
- Surgery is relatively fast (usually less than 30 minutes).
- Very appropriate for couples who already have the number of children they want.
- Requires only a single procedure and therefore is inexpensive in the long term.
- Procedures are very safe, and major complications are rare.
- Does not require hospitalization.
- Does not interrupt love-making.

\section*{Vasectomy Disadvantages.}
- May cause pain and skin discoloration in area of incision (treatable).
- May cause swelling and discoloration of scrotum (treatable).
- Sexual relations must cease until 2 or 3 days after the procedure and can resume then only if there is no discomfort.
- A condom or another method should be used for 3 months following the procedure.

\section*{Protection against STI/HIV infection from vasectomy.}
- Vasectomy offers no protection against STI/HIV.

\section*{Vasectomy (WHO MEC Class 1 and 2).}

\section*{Who can have vasectomy?}
- In general, the majority of men who want vasectomy can have a safe and effective procedure in a routine setting, provided they have been counseled.
- They should also be able to give informed/written consent.

Men who may consider sterilization include:
- Those who are certain that they have achieved their desired family size.
- Men who want a highly effective permanent contraceptive method.
- Men whose wives face unacceptable risk in pregnancy.

\section*{Vasectomy (WHO MEC 4).}

\section*{Who should not have vasectomy?}
- There are no medical conditions that would absolutely restrict a man's eligibility for vasectomy.
- Some conditions and circumstances indicate that the procedure should be delayed, or that certain precautions be taken.
- Local infections (scrotal skin infection, balanitits, epididymitis, or orchitis).
- Current STI.
- Systemic infection or gastroenteritis.
- Men or couples who are not certain that they have completed their family size.

- Private.
- Permanent.
- Very appropriate for couples who already have the number of children they want.
- Requires only a single procedure and therefore is inexpensive in the long term.
- Procedures are very safe and major complications are rare.

\section*{Tubal Ligation: Disadvantages.}
- Large studies indicate that less than $1 \%$ case experience serious complications, which may include: anesthesia-related problems (mostly related to over-sedation); hemorrhage uterine perforation; bowel/bladder injury; infection; and failure to occlude the tube (sterilization failure).
- Ectopic pregnancy is a potential and serious long-term complication.
- Although pregnancy is a rare complication post-VSC, if a woman does become pregnant as a result of sterilization failure there is a significant chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic.
- Minor complications such as slight bleeding and wound infection occur in less than $5 \%$ of cases.
- Most complications can be avoided by provision of services which emphasize optimal infection practices thorough client screening and counseling; light sedation and local anaesthesia; careful monitoring of vital signs during and after the procedure (during recovery time); close attention to aseptic technique; and careful and gentle surgical technique.

\section*{Protection against STI/HIV infection from tubal ligation.}

\section*{NUTRITION.}

\section*{Course Objectives.}
- To classify foods by their nutrients supply/contents.
- To explain concepts of a balanced diet.
- To outline nutritional disorders and relate them to the causative factors.
- To outline vulnerable groups and specify their nutritional requirements.

\section*{Introduction.}
- Nutrition is the sum of all processes involved in how organisms obtain nutrients, metabolize them, and use them to support all of life's processes.
- Includes food ingestion, food and nutrient digestion, nutrient metabolism and nutrient utilization by body cells and tissues to support growth, repair and maintenance of body tissue.
- Nutrients are compounds in foods that are needed by human body for energy to work, for growth of body tissue, for repair and maintenance of body tissues and also to support body's immune function all that works towards a healthy living.
- Basically, nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.
- Therefore, human nutrition is the study of food in relation to health of individual and groups of people particularly the infants, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers(vulnerable groups) and functioning of the body organs and provide the energy the body requires.

\section*{Classification of foods by their nutrient supply.}
- Food groups are divided based on the nutritional properties they offer.
- Foods that humans take can be classified based on the amount of nutrients and the type of nutrients they provide for subsistence and survival.
- The major classes of nutrients include:
- Carbohydrates.
- Proteins.
- Fats.
- Vitamin.
- Minerals.
- The nutrient classes can be classified into macronutrients and micronutrients.
- Macronutrients are nutrients that are required in large quantities.
- These are energy yielding.
- They include:
- Proteins.
- Fats.
- Carbohydrates.
- Micronutrients are nutrients that are needed in small amounts.
- There are two classes of small non-energy yielding elements and compounds:
- Vitamins.
- Minerals.
- They are essential in very small amounts for regulation and control functions in cell metabolism and building certain body structures.

\section*{Carbohydrates.}
- Group of compounds of elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
- Found in foods either as sugars, starch or glycogen.
- The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk, fruits, and starchy vegetables like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities.
- Simplest form is monosaccharide (simple sugars).
- These are passed through the GI without being changed by digestive juices.
- Examples include:
- Glucose.
- Fructose.
- Galatose.
- Disaccharides examples:
- Sucrose.
- Lactose.
- Maltose.
- Polysaccharides are insoluble in water.
- Examples include:

- Excess is converted as fats and stored in the body.

\section*{Proteins.}
- Macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids.
- Amino acids are simple subunits composed of:
- Carbon.
- Oxygen.
- Hydrogen.
- Nitrogen.
- The food sources of proteins are meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant-based foods, most notably soy.
- Essential amino acids are those that can't be synthesized by the body whereas non-essential are those that can be synthesized by the body.

\section*{Functions.}
- Source of energy.
- Growth and development of the body.
- For body maintenance.

- A family of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
- They are insoluble in water.
- The three main types of lipids are:
- Triglycerides.
- Phospholipids.
- Sterols.
- Lipids are found predominately in butter, oils, meats, dairy products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods.

\section*{Functions.}
- To provide energy.
- Fat beneath the skin acts as an insulator against cold.
- Acts as a solvent for fat soluble vitamins.
- Maintenance of cell structure and synthesis of hormones.

- Minerals are solid inorganic substances that form crystals and are classified depending on how much of them we need.
- Trace minerals, such as molybdenum, selenium, zinc, iron, and iodine, are only required in a few milligrams or less.
- Macro minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, are required in hundreds of milligrams.

\section*{Functions.}
- Enzyme function.
- Others are used to maintain fluid balance, build bone tissue, synthesize hormones, transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles and protect against harmful free radicals.

\section*{Why is it important to eat healthy?}
- Best way to live a healthy life is to eat a balanced diety
- To provide nutrients that your body needs to function
- To give you more energy and alertness throughout the day
- To prevents future disease and sickness
- Diabetes, obesity and cancer
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/4450b428-5ae6-44d5-8227-58fe7f8e9315-088.jpg?height=891&width=1367&top_left_y=76&top_left_x=394)

\section*{Nutrition assessment.}
- Nutritional status is a condition in the body resulting from intakes absorption and use of food.
- Malnutrition is a term encompassing under nutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals) and over nutrition(obesity)
- Acute malnutrition (wasting) is the result of recent rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight and is associated with an increased risk of mortality.
- Can be moderate or severe.
- Chronic malnutrition (stunting) is the result of inadequate nutrition over a much longer period of time and is associated with an increased risk of disease/eventual death.
- Underweight is the outcome of wasting or stunting or a combination of both and is associated with poor growth and development.
- Under-nutrition can be identified by assessing an individual's nutritional status, meaning the internal state of an individual as it relates to the availability and utilization of nutrients at the cellular level.
- This state cannot be observed directly so observable indicators are used instead.
- There are four indicators; however none of them, by themselves or in combination, are capable of providing a full picture of an individual's nutritional status.
- They are instead proxy indicators of nutritional status.
- There are four indicators; however none of them, by themselves or in combination, are capable of providing a full picture of an individual's nutritional status.
- They are instead proxy indicators of nutritional status.

\section*{Anthropometry.}
- The method that is most widely used in an emergency.
- It implies assessing the attainment of growth based on measures of physical characteristics of the body (e.g., weight, height, etc.).
- Anthropometry is the use of body measurements such as weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), in combination with age and sex, to gauge growth or failure to grow.
- Anthropometry cannot be used to detect all forms of under-nutrition.
- It cannot be used to measure micronutrient malnutrition, but it can be used to assess:
- Wasting.
- Stunting.
- Underweight.

\section*{Wasting.}
- Wasted children are extremely thin for their height.
- Wasting is the result of recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight due to acute infection and/or inadequate dietary intake.
- Wasting is readily reversible once conditions improve.
- Wasting is evidence of acute malnutrition.
- Wasting is measured by the weight for height index or MUAC.
- Stunted children are short of their age.
- Stunted children may have a normal body proportions but may look younger than their actual age.
- Develops over a long period as a result of inadequate nutrition or repeated infections or both.
- Measured by height for age.

\section*{Underweight.}
- Underweight children are too light for their age.
- Underweight is due to either wasting or stunting or a combination of both.
- Underweight is measured by the weight for age index.

\section*{Individual assessment.}
- Growth monitoring and promotion as part of a mother and child health (MCH) program where the growth of infants and young children are monitored over time in order to identify and address growth faltering and growth failure.
- Nutritional screening - where each child is measured in order to identify and refer individuals for further check-ups or to services such as supplementary or therapeutic feeding as needed.

\section*{Population assessment.}
- Nutritional surveillance for famine early warning systems in order to measure changes in nutritional status of populations over time to mobilize appropriate preparation and/or response.
- Rapid nutrition assessments which are carried out to quickly in order to establish whether or not there is a major nutrition problem and to identify immediate needs.
- Nutrition surveys in emergencies in order to assess the extent of under-nutrition or estimate the numbers of children who might require supplementary and therapeutic feeding or other nutritional support.
- Nutritional indices are calculated by comparing an individual's measurements with that of a reference population.
- The nutritional indices commonly calculated for young children are:
- Weight for height, a measure of wasting or acute malnutrition.
- Height for age - a measure of stunting or chronic malnutrition.
- Weight for age - a measure of underweight or wasting and stunting combined.
- MUAC is also a measure of wasting or acute malnutrition. MUAC is not an index by itself.
- Oedema is the retention of water and sodium in the extra-cellular spaces.
- Generally, it accounts for $10-30 \%$ of bodyweight, but in the most severe cases of kwashiorkor, the proportion can reach 50\%.
- A child with oedema of both feet is automatically considered severely acutely malnourished.

\section*{Biochemical tests.}
- Assessing specific components of blood and urine samples of an individual.
- However, this is generally expensive and time consuming and not possible in an emergency.

\section*{Clinical signs.}
- Assessing signs and symptoms of illness (e.g. oedema).
- There are few 'field friendly' methods for clinical detection of micronutrient malnutrition in an emergency as it does not allow identification of those with subclinical levels of micronutrient malnutrition.

\section*{Dietary intake.}
- Assessing food intake of individuals over a specific period of time in order to determine whether the quantity or quality of intake is adequate.
- This information however can only reflect short term intake.

\section*{Nutrition in Vulnerable groups.}
- Vulnerability is the degree to which a population or organization is unable to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impacts of disasters (WHO ,2002).
- Certain vulnerable groups in the population have special nutritional needs.
i. Pregnant and lactating women.
ii. Infants and children.
iii. School age children.
iv. Refugees and displaced persons.

\section*{Pregnant and lactating mothers.}
- During pregnancy and lactation, a woman's nutritional needs are greater.
- Food required by the foetus to grow and production of milk must come from the mother.
- A child born to a poorly nourished mother is likely to have low birth weight.
- During pregnancy there is an increase in the weight of the woman and the basal metabolic rate also increases.
- Hence the increase requires extra food to provide extra energy, proteins and other nutrients.
- Anaemia is common among pregnant women hence need to give iron supplements routinely to expectant mothers in form of ferrous sulphate.
- Ferrous, one of the vitamin B is also required for making red blood cells is also given together with iron.
- Vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is bad for the baby hence multivitamin tablets should be given during pregnancy and encourages pregnant women to eat foods rich in Vitamin A.
- Mothers who have just delivered need to eat foods rich in Iron and Vitamin A.
- The nutritional cost of pregnancy and lactation is great as the woman's store of nutrients is depleted.
- Repeated pregnancy, combined with heavy work quickly makes a woman weak and sick.
- To prevent this, the woman must be well fed during their reproductive years.

\section*{HEALTH EDUCATION.}

\section*{Aims of Health education.}
1. Prevention.
2. Early diagnosis and management.
3. Utilization of available health services.

\section*{Terms.}
1. Health - A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO).
2. Health education - Process which affects changes in the health practices of people and in the knowledge and attitude related to such changes, so as to be interpreted into proper health behavior.
3. Communication - The process of creating a meaning or commonness between two or more people.
4. Behaviour - The way in which one acts or conducts oneself, especially toward others.
5. Attitude - a settled way of thinking or feeling about someone or something, typically one that is reflected in a person's behaviour.
6. Learning - the acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught and becoming changed.
7. Motivation - Willingness of action especially in behavior or an incentive or reason for doing something.
8. Perception - Conscious understanding of something or identification and interpretation of sensory information.

\section*{Community involvement.}
1. It has been realized that community should be involved in $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{E}$.
2. Community should be involved from planning to implementation.
3. Community participation and involvement is the only way to succeed in H/E.

\section*{Principles of health education:}
1. Interest.
2. Participation.
3. Motivation.
4. Comprehension (thorough).
5. Proceeding from the known to the unknown.
6. Reinforcement through repetition (Tell them, tell them $\_\_\_\_$ ).
7. Good human relations.
8. People (be knowledgeable), facts (be reliable) and media (be acceptable).

\section*{Health education approaches.}
- Health promotion is an important part of your work as a Health educator.
- Some of the key approaches used in health education are as follows;
1. Medical or preventive approach.
2. Behavior change approach.
3. Educational approach.
4. Empowerment approach.
5. Social change approach.

\section*{- The medical approach.}
- Aim is freedom from medically-defined disease and disability such as infectious diseases.
- It reduces morbidity and premature mortality.
- Involves medical intervention or risk education to prevent or ameliorate (improve) ill-health.
- Values preventive medical procedures and the medical profession's responsibility to ensure that patients comply with recommended procedures.
- This is done by seeking to increase medical interventions and compliance.
- It ignores social and environmental factors.

\section*{- The behavior change approach.}
- Aim is to encourage to change people's individual attitudes and behavior so that they adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors.
- It brings about changes in an individual's thinking or perception.
- It helps community change the behavior and help them make their own health-related decisions.
- This can be applied using locally available methods and media such as leaflets and posters.
- Considers a wider issues of health education such as individual perceptions of exposure to health risks and risky behavior.
- It also covers the benefits an individual can gain through health practices.
- Methods used is prompting, cueing (provoking), vicarious learning.
- It ignores social and economic factors.
- Proponent of this approach will be convinced that a healthy lifestyle is in the interest of their clients.
- They are responsible to encourage as many people as possible to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
- Examples include teaching people how to stop smoking, encouraging people to take exercise, eat the right food, look after their teeth etc.

\section*{- The educational approach.}
- Aim is to give information and ensure knowledge and understanding of health issues and to enable well-informed decisions to be made.
- Information about health is presented and people are helped to explore their values and attitudes and make their own decisions.
- Help in carrying out those decisions and adopting new health practices may also be offered.
- It requires participation of community members at every stage of the program.
- It is a collective action where community participate in assessing the needs of the community.
- It helps in the actions planning, targets and goals to meet those needs.
- Community participation is essential for health educators to understand and deal with many influences over health-related behaviors in community.
- Communities often have detailed knowledge about their culture and surrounding environment, so it is crucial to include them at all stages of community development activities.

\section*{Why is the community involved?}
- So that it become involved in the implementation of H/E activities successfully.
- To develop self-reliance, empowerment and problem-solving skills of community members.
- It also enables use of locally available resource.
- To creates better relationships with the people in the community you are working in.
- The method is done through small groups or mass media group discussions or role-plays.
- Proponent of this approach will value the educational process and respect the right of the individual to choose their own health behavior.
- Responsibility to raise with clients the health issues which they think will be in their client's best interests.

\section*{- Empowerment (Client- centered approach).}
- Aim is to work with clients in order to help them to identify what they want to know about and take action on.
- They will make their own decisions and choices according to their own interest and values.
- It involves identifying individual or community health needs and gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes to act upon them through a program of action.
- Self-empowerment is rooted in awareness and understanding that people can act to change their own lives on their own behalf.
- Health promoter's role is to act as a facilitator in helping people to identify their own concerns.
- They gain the knowledge and skills they require to make things happen.
- Clients are valued as equal who have knowledge, skills and abilities to contribute, and who have an absolute right to control their own health destinies.
- This approach provide tools needed for people to make their own choices about their health determinants.
- Such techniques include group work, problem solving, client-centered counselling, social skills training and educational drama.
- Methods applied are Counselling, problem solving, advocacy, public participation.
- The societal change approach.
- Aim is to effect changes on the physical, social and economic environment, in order to make it more conducive to good health.
- Focus is on changing society not on changing the behavior of individuals.
- Proponent of this approach value their democratic right to change society and be committed to put health on the political agenda.
- Methods applied includes lobbing, advocacy, policies, fiscal measures, etc.

\section*{PREPARATION FOR HEALTH EDUCATION}
A). Planning health education.
- Adequate preparation is very important before one sets out to give H/E.
- Do not assume people you're going to give H/E know nothing about your topic.
- Establish their level of understanding.
- H/E should be aimed at encouraging people develop confidence \& skills on how to help themselves.

\section*{Seven basic skills used for H/E.}

\section*{1. Collection of information.}
- Collect information from the community to identify the problem.

Kind of information to collect; -
- How many have health problems.
- Possible cause for the problem.
- Reason for such act.

\section*{2. Understanding the problem;}

When you are involving the community try to know the following; -
- Why are the problems there?
- How can the problems be addressed?

\section*{3. Decide on the priority need.}

It will help to know the area to talk on H/E.

\section*{4. Resources identification.}
- Resources within community.
- People in the community able to donate funds.
- Locally available materials.
- Skills in the community.
- Resources outside the community.
- Agencies \& ministries which can fund community activities.
- People with skills \& Materials.

\section*{5. Time table preparation.}
- Plans, tasks, who to do and when.

\section*{6. Selection of the appropriate methods.}

Which methods are applicable in solving the problems.

\section*{7. Evaluation.}
1. After giving $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{E}$ one should assess if there are any changes.
2. This can be done through data collection and comparing the actual and the expected.

\section*{B) Organizing.}
- When organizing $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{E}$, get what one needs for $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{E}$.
- People needed and materials.

\section*{C) Implementation.}
- This is the stage where you do the actual H/E activity.

\section*{Approach to health education.}

Health Education can be carried out in three levels; -
1. Individual level.
2. Group level.
3. Community level.

\section*{Methods of health promotion;}
1. Audio visual aids.
2. Role play.
3. Songs.
4. Poems.
5. Community barazas.
6. Schools.
7. Women and men groups.
8. Youth group etc.

\section*{HEALTH PROMOTION AIDS.}

Various teaching aids are used by health promoter to public about health issues.

\section*{Importance of health promotion aids.}
a) Faster to understand.
b) Stimulate learning.
c) Bring out conducive environment.
d) Bring out clarity of the concept.
e) Provide a welcome break for learners who have been sitting for a while and listening to an instructor lecture in front.
f) Pique (irritates) learners' interest and demonstrate how things work.

\section*{The promotion aids.}
1). Audio-visual aids.

Audio-aids.

Help in developing the listening skill of a learner.
- They are those aids which can be only listened to. E.g such types of aids include, radio, gramophone, tape recorder, audio-tapes, walk man, headphones etc.
- They are very useful for the blind people.

\section*{Tape recorder.}
- Consists mainly of three parts-the microphone, the amplifier and the receiver.
- The talks/speech can be recorded and reproduced in the teaching through this teaching aid.
- Important merit of this aid is that the speech of a person can be recorded at any time and it can be used for a number of times at will, again and again.

\section*{Radio.}
- General discussion or information on social issues, health and diseases, culture and life, about the events happening around the world etc, are broadcasted.
- As a follow-up activity, this program also supplement the presentation of a $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{E}$ whenever they are deemed fit for the discourse.

\section*{Cassettes:}
- Cassettes can be used for recitations of health messages e.g poems plays and stories, etc.

\section*{Audio -visual-aids.}

These are aids which require the involvement of learners' listening and visual senses. Examples, of such types of aids include viz. graphic aids, display boards, and print material, television, films, videos, etc.
- Right expressions and audio effects in the visual aids help people to understand the real situation.
- Audio-visual aids allow one to teach behavior and concepts without much strain.
- People are able to relate to the format and pictures.
- Visual aids can also be used to talk about many things e.g hand washing, breast cancer examination etc.
- Charts can be used for teaching.
- Emotions can be well taught with the help of flip charts and computer based games and this can be like happy or sad expression.
- People are able to relate to the expressions almost immediately but repeating the session reinforces the same in their minds.

\section*{Visual-aids only.}

These are good for the deaf people.

\section*{2).Role play/Drama.}
- In role play, some of the participants take the roles of other people and act accordingly.
- Role play is usually a spontaneous or unrehearsed acting out of real-life situations where others watch and learn by seeing and discussing how people might behave in certain situations.
- Learning takes place through active experience, it is not passive.
- It uses situations that the members of the group are likely to find themselves in during their lives.
- You use role playing because it shows real situations.
- It is a very direct way of learning, participants are given a role or character and have to think and speak immediately without detailed planning, because there is usually no script.
- In a role playing situation people volunteer to play the parts in a natural way, while other people watch carefully and may offer suggestions to the players.
- Some of the people watching may decide to join in with the play.

\section*{Purpose of role play.}
- The purpose of a role play is that it is acting out real-life situations in order that people can better understand their problems and the behavior associated with the problem.
- Role play is usually undertaken in small groups of 4 to 6 people.
- Remember role play is a very powerful thing.

NB:-
a) Role play works best when people know each other.
b) Don't ask people to take a role that might embarrass them.
c) Role play involves some risk of misunderstanding, because people may interpret things differently.
d) When doing role plays members of the group should be careful and stick to the play rules and regulations.

\section*{Drama:}
- Drama is a very valuable method that you can use to discuss subjects where personal and social relationships are involved.
- Basic ideas, feelings, beliefs and values about health can be communicated to people of different ages, education and experience.
- It is a suitable health promotion method for people who cannot read, because they often experience things visually.
- However, the preparation and practice for a drama may cost time and money.

\section*{General principles in drama are:}
- Keep the script simple and clear.
- Identify an appropriate site.
- Say a few words at the beginning of the play to introduce the subject and give the reasons for the drama.
- Encourage questions and discussions at the end.

\section*{3). Songs.}
- A song is a work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections.
- Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs.
- A song may be for a solo singer, a lead singer supported by background singers, a duet, trio, or larger ensemble involving more voices singing in harmony.
- Songs may be written for one or more singers to sing without instrumental accompaniment or they may be written for performance with instrumental accompaniment.
- A song should be clear, loud enough and convey the intended message to the target population.

\section*{4). Poems.}
- A poem is an art form in which human language is used for its aesthetic qualities in addition to, or instead of its notional and semantic content.
- It consists largely of oral or literary works in which language is used in a manner that is felt by its user and audience to differ from ordinary prose.
- There are certain ingredients that are important when composing a poem;
a) Message.

What are you trying to say?. The message of your poem is the most important part.
It could be something as simple, or it could be something more complex, like a relationship.
Whatever it is, your message should be clear to the audience.

\section*{b). Form/Structure.}

Will the length/shape of each stanza enhance the poem in any way? Think carefully about how the poem is formulated. A poem particularly a concrete one can be a piece of art and should be attractive and friendly to listeners.

\section*{c). Point of View.}

Whose perspective are you writing your poem from? The perspective you write your poem from can dramatically change its meaning and impact on the audience.

\section*{d). Voice/Tone.}

Voice is important in everything that you write or speak, and poem is no different.
The important thing is to make sure that the tone you've chosen fits the poem and the message you want to get across. Don't write or say something in a serious way if you're trying to be funny and don't go overboard with the jokes if you're trying to be serious.

\section*{e). Rhythm.}

You may find that your poem naturally fits into or suits a particular rhythm. Perhaps the most vital element of sound in poetry is rhythm. Often, the rhythm of each line is arranged in a particular manner.

\section*{f). Grammar.}

Grammar is incredibly important in a poem. Its absence can tell you as much as its usage. This allows you to manipulate it to your advantage and even alter the meaning of your poem.

\section*{5). Community Barraza.}
- Barraza is a Swahili word that describes the semi-formal and mostly regular public open air meetings convened by a local Chief/Leader for purposes of addressing local issues and facilitating the percolation of state agenda and policy down to the grass-roots.
- Apart from conflicts, barrazas are also called to address matters of public interest such as drug and substance abuse, illicit brews, HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns, missing children, lost animals, recruitments etc.
- Barrazas are very much a crucial component in the local resident's life.
- They are a crucial component in problem solving and dispute resolution because of various reasons i.e:
a) Inaccessibility aid - The common man is unable to get legal aid in conflict resolution and also health related matters like during disease outbreaks. This is possible in abarraza.
b) Simplicity - Barazas are very much informal settings where parties sit around and everyone is addressed as an "equal".
c) Speedy - Based on the nature of the issues resolved in Barazas and the entire setting, the process is usually pretty quick and speedy. Simply agree on a convenient date and time, see the chief/leader, and that's it.
d) Queue. There's literally no queue and the informal setting means information is passed easily and quickly.
e) Message: Message should be simple and clear.
f) Questions: Allow the target group to ask questions at the end of the talk for clarification.

\section*{6). Schools.}
- School health focuses on ensuring health promotion, conservation, protection and correction of abnormalities of the school population.
- A school health approach is advocated in the provision of health services as school children are easy to reach (captive audience).
- The message is also likely to have a multiplier-effect among the community members, through school children.

\section*{Organisation of School Health.}
- To organise a practical school health programme you need to involve the rest of the health team members, the school administration and the community.

\section*{Members of school health team:-}
- Teachers.
- Pupils and students.
- Parents.
- Community formal and informal leaders.
- Community health nurse/health worker.

\section*{Organization involves.}
- Assess the problems of school children.
- Establish practical goals for the school population.
- Carry out the needed activities.
- Evaluate the process and results of the programs.

\section*{Needs of school children which requires health promotion interventions.}
- A Stable Home: The home should provide basic needs especially shelter and security.
- Proper Nutrition: The child needs to grow well physically and mentally. It is therefore important for the child to take adequate nutrition at least three times a day.
- Freedom from Fatigue: The child needs to have enough rest at home from school activities.
- Clothing: This is normally provided as school uniform, which should be clean and tidy.
- Good Sight, Hearing and Speech: Defects of sight, hearing and speech interfere with the learning process of a child.
- Freedom from Infection: All school children should be immunised against childhood diseases.
- Pure and Safe Water: This should be provided in the school and at home to prevent water related diseases.
- Clean Buildings: The home and school environment should be kept clean.

\section*{Objectives of School Health}
- Promoting and maintaining the health of the school children.
- Promoting positive health behaviour among staff and students.
- Bringing up citizens who understand basic good health habits.
- Ensuring general community health by using the child as a channel for health messages to the family.
- Improving the physical and social environment of the school.
- Providing aspects of prevention of disease; Primary prevention, for example eating diets rich in vitamins A and C, iron and protein; Secondary prevention, that is, early diagnosis and treatment; Tertiary prevention which includes rehabilitation.

- Referral Services;
- This service is given to children who have ailments needing care outside the school.
- They are referred to the nearest health facility or hospital, depending on the nature of illness and if it requires to be seen by a specialist.
- Inspection of the School Environment;
- Since the children spend a lot of the time in school, it is important to ensure that their environment is safe and clean.
- Location of the School;
- Surroundings should be clean, free from noise pollution, away from industrial and other waste or swampy area.
- Sanitation;
- The school should have a good water supply, clean and enough latrines, and solid waste disposal systems.
- There should be separate toilets for female and male students.
- The environment should be clean and well maintained.
- Playground;
- It should be dry with no potholes or stones to prevent accidents.
- Classroom;
- This should be clean, well ventilated with adequate lighting.
- It should not be overcrowded and the students should be able to hear the teacher and see the black board from where they sit.
- Furniture;
- The seats should be simple and not attached to each other so that the pupils can move them.
- Promotion of Proper Nutrition;
- This consists of the importance of eating a balanced diet and good feeding habits.
- If there is a feeding programme observe the following:
- Methods of cooking and storage of food.
- Personal hygiene of food handlers and children.
- Cleanliness of the utensils.
- Cleanliness of the kitchen.
- Screening of the food handlers.
- Sharing Health Messages;
- You should identify and plan to share the appropriate health messages with the school population.
- The health messages shared should include, prevention of common health problems, such as, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, skin conditions amongst others.
- Promotion of Personal Hygiene;
- This is done by advising the children to do the following:
- Taking a daily bath.
- Brushing teeth after meals.
- Washing of hands before eating and after visiting the toilet.
- Keeping the hair and nails short and clean.
- Wearing clean clothes.
- Record Keeping;
- It is important to record every health activity that you undertake.
- This applies to school health service activities.
- These records are used for evaluation.
- The records should reflect:
- The number of schools covered.
- The number of pupils treated and types of ailments.
- The type of drugs dispensed.
- The number of pupils referred.
- Activities carried out.
- Health messages shared.
- Information on the environmental health.
- Effectiveness of the school health services.

\section*{7). Group discussion.}

The groups may be of men, women, youth or mix-up groups.
- Group discussion involves the free flow of communication between a facilitator and two or more participants.
- Often a discussion of this type is used after a slide show or following a more formal presentation.
- This type of teaching method is characterized by participants having an equal chance to talk freely and exchange ideas with each other.
- Group discussions do not always go smoothly and sometimes a few people dominate the discussion and do not allow others to join in.
- Your job as the facilitator is to establish ground rules and use strategies to prevent this from happening.

\section*{How can you prevent a few people from dominating a group discussion?}
- The key skill in group work that may prevent such domination is by encouraging full participation of everyone in the group.
- For example, by using questioning and other methods that facilitate active participation and interaction.
- Quiet participants need to be brought into the discussion, perhaps by asking them easy questions so that they gain in confidence.
- Conversely, any community member dominating the discussion excessively should be restrained, possibly by recognizing his or her contribution.

\section*{Group disruption.}

Groups can be disrupted by several types of behavior:
1. People who want a fight: Do not get involved. Explore their ideas, but let the group decide their value.
2. Would like to help: Encourage them frequently to give ideas, and use them to build on in the discussion.
3. Focuses on small details: Acknowledge his or her point but remind them of the objective and the time limit for the discussion.
4. Just keeps talking: Interrupt tactfully. Ask a question to bring him or her back to the point being discussed and thank them for their contribution.
5. Seems afraid to speak: Ask easy questions. Give them credit to raise their confidence.
6. Insists on their own agenda: Recognize the person's self-interest. Ask him or her to focus on the topic agreed by the group.
7. Is just not interested: Ask about their work and how the group discussion could help.

\section*{Buzz group.}
- A buzz group is a way of coping if a meeting is too large for you.
- In this situation it is better to divide the group into several small groups, of not more than 10 or 12 people.
- These are called buzz groups.
- You can then give each small buzz group a certain amount of time to discuss the problem.
- Then, the whole group comes together again and the reporters from the small groups report their findings and recommendations back to the entire audience.

\section*{OTHER METHODS OF HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE COMMUNITY.}

\section*{- HEALTH TALKS.}
- Talking is often the most natural way of communicating with people to share health knowledge and facts.
- In the part of your job that involves health education, there will always be many opportunities to talk with people.
- Group size is also important.
- The number of people who you are able to engage in a health talk depends on the group size.
- However, you will find talks are most effective if conducted with small gatherings (5-10 people), because the larger the group the less chance that each person has to participate.

\section*{Preparing a health talk.}
- When you are preparing a talk there are many things to consider:
1. Know the group. Find out its needs and interests and discover which groups are active in your locality.
2. Select an appropriate topic. The topic should be about a single issue or a simple topic. Always ensure that you have correct and up-to-date information and look for sources of recent information.
3. List the points you will talk about: Prepare only a few main points and make sure that you are clear about them.
4. Write down what you will say: If you do not like writing, you must think carefully what to include in your talk. Think of examples, proverbs and local stories to emphasize your points and which include positive health messages.
5. Prepare visual aids: Visual aids are a good way to capture people's attention and make messages easier to understand. Well-chosen posters and photos that carry important health messages will help people to learn.
6. Practice your talk beforehand: This should include rehearsing the telling of stories and the showing of posters and pictures.
7. Determine the amount of time you need: The complete talk including showing all your visual aids should take not more than about 20 minutes. Allow another 15 minutes or more for questions and discussions. If the talk is too long people may lose interest.

\section*{- LECTURE.}
- You may have the opportunity to give a lecture, perhaps in your local school or in another formal setting.
- A lecture is usually a spoken, simple, quick and traditional way of presenting your subject matter, but there are strengths and limitations to this approach.
- The strengths include the efficient introduction of factual material in a direct and logical manner.
- However, this method is generally ineffective where the audience is passive and learning is difficult to gauge.

\section*{Lecture with discussion.}
- You may have the opportunity to give a lecture and include a follow-up discussion, perhaps in a local formal setting or during a public meeting.
- It is always useful to involve your audience after the lecture in asking questions, seeking clarification and challenging and reflecting on the subject matter.
- DEMONSTRATION.
- In your work as a health promoter, you will often find yourself giving a demonstration.
- This form of health education is based on learning through observation.
- There is a difference between knowing how to do something and actually being able to do it.
- The aim of a demonstration is to help learners become able to do the skills themselves, not just know how to do them.
- Some health related things that would be best taught through demonstration include;
- The whole process of measuring blood pressure.
- How to use a mosquito net.
- Putting/Inserting a condom.
- Giving a child medicine.
- Proper breast feeding, etc.

\section*{Sharing skills.}
- You should be able to find ways to make health related demonstrations a pleasant way of sharing skills and knowledge.
- Although demonstration sessions usually focus on practice, they also involve theoretical teaching as well 'showing how, is better than telling how', thus;
"If I hear, I forget".
"If I see, I remember".
"If I do, I know".

\section*{Note that:}
- You remember $20 \%$ of what you hear.
