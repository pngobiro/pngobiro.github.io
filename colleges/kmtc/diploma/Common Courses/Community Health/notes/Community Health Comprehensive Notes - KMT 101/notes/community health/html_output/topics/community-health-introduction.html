                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Community development</strong> - The community development process is based on the philosophical belief that people and communities are entitled to have control over factors that affect their lives.</p>
                        <p><strong>Group</strong> - People who interact and share a common purpose or purposes. There is no clear distinction between a group and a community except that groups tend to have fewer members than a community.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community health standards</strong> - Promoting health; Building individual and community capacity; Building relationships; Facilitating access and equity; Demonstrating professional responsibility and accountability.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community Engagement</strong> - is the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interest, or similar situations to address issues affecting the well-being of those people. It is a powerful vehicle for bringing about environmental and behavioral changes that will improve the health of the community and its members. It often involves partnerships and coalitions that help mobilize resources and influence systems, change relationships among partners, and serve as catalysts for changing policies, programs, and practices.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cultural Influence</strong> - Health behaviors are influenced directly by elements of one's culture. As a result, social norms and other elements of community culture provide a potential tool for disease prevention and health promotion. Culture involves "the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, behavior, and material traits characteristic of a social group". An individual's culture influences his or her attitude toward various health issues, including perceptions of what is and is not a health problem, methods of disease prevention, treatments for illness, and use of health providers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community Participation</strong> - Concepts concerning community participation offer one set of explanations as to why the process of community engagement might be useful in addressing the physical, interpersonal, and cultural aspects of individuals' environments.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community Empowerment</strong> - Mobilizing and organizing individuals, grass-roots and communitybased organizations, and institutions, and enabling them to take action, influence, and make decisions on critical issues. It is important to note, however, that no external entity should assume that it can bestow on a community the power to act in its own self-interest. Empowerment takes place at three levels:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Individual,</li>
                            <li>Organizational or group, and</li>
                            <li>Community levels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Capacity Building</strong> - Another set of organizing concepts that can help guide approaches to effective engagement involves the process of capacity building. Individuals and organizations can gain control and influence and become players and partners in community health decision-making and action, they may need resources, knowledge, and skills above and beyond those they already bring to a particular problem.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community Organization</strong> - A "process by which community groups are helped to identify common problems or goals, mobilize resources, and in other ways develop and implement strategies for reaching goals they have set."</p>
