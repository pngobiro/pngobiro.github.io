                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand the role of environment in our health</p>
                        <p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe environmental factors that affect our health</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Environment</strong> - is anything that externally surrounds a man. This is where man lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines environment, as it relates to health, as "all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviors."</p>
                        <p><strong>Culture</strong> - Culture refers to the cumulative deposit of knowledge, experience, beliefs, values, attitudes, meanings, hierarchies, religion, notions of time, roles, spatial relations, concepts of the universe, and material objects and possessions acquired by a group of people in the course of generations through individual and group striving.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Importance of environmental health</h4>
                        <p>The goal of environmental health is to promote health for all through a healthy environment. It consists of preventing or controlling disease, injury, and disability related to the interactions between people and their environment. Poor environmental quality has its greatest impact on people whose health status is already at risk.</p>
