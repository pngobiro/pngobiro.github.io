                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Increase skills and knowledge on planning and evaluating community health programs</p>
                        <p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the concept of planning in community health</li>

                        <p><strong>Community Health Planning</strong> - is a systematic process of identifying the health needs of communities and developing evidence-based recommendations and strategies to promote and improve the health of individuals and communities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>A planning cycle in the development of a community health program</h4>
                        <p>A planning cycle that includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A situation analysis,</li>
                            <li>Formulation of objectives,</li>
                            <li>Selection of strategies,</li>
                            <li>Development of an operational plan,</li>
                            <li>Implementation and evaluation, which lead, in turn, to a new situation analysis.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Choosing Health Priorities</h4>
                        <p>Most communities do not have the resources to address all of their health problems and target groups at once. They must set priorities and plan to address some problems initially and others over time. Some issues to consider when ranking problems include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Legal and economic factors,</li>
                            <li>Political viability of the intervention,</li>
                            <li>Possibility of continued funding,</li>
                            <li>Probability of quick success,</li>
                            <li>Ability to build on community strengths,</li>
                            <li>Level of public concern.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Goal setting</strong> involves establishing specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-targeted (S.M.A.R.T ) goals. Setting goals helps people work towards their own objectives.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Goals</strong> are broad, abstract statements of intent that help create a vision of what you are striving to accomplish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Objectives</strong> are measurable, specific statements that lead toward program goals and define what change the community will try to achieve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each objective should answer these questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who will receive the intervention? (Whose health is its focus?)</li>
                            <li>What health benefit should these persons receive?</li>
                            <li>How much of that benefit should they receive?</li>
                            <li>By when should it be achieved?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <blockquote>By 1998, the prevalence of smoking among county residents aged 18 years and older will be reduced by 15% from 25% (BRFSS 1991 baseline) to 21%.</blockquote>
                        
                        <h4>Writing behavioral and intervention objectives</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral objectives</strong>-for the leading behaviors that contribute to death or disability and are the focus of the intervention</li>
                            <li><strong>Intervention objectives</strong>-for the interventions you wish to undertake</li>

                         <p>Although plans can be adapted to various health problems and communities, the phases of the process remain the same. Each of the five phases that constitute a plan is described hereafter.</p>
                         <ol>
                            <li><strong>Step I: Mobilizing the community</strong> - The community to be addressed is defined, participants are recruited, partnerships are formed, and a demographic profile of the community is completed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step II: Collecting and organizing data</strong> - Community members form working groups to obtain and analyze data on mortality, morbidity, community opinion, and behaviors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step III: Choosing health priorities</strong> - During this phase, objectives related to the health priorities are set. The health priorities to be addressed initially are selected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step IV: Developing a comprehensive intervention plan</strong> - Using information generated during steps II and III, the community group chooses, designs, and conducts interventions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step V: Build on existing services</strong> - The community group identifies and assesses resources, policies, environmental measures, and programs already focused on the risk behavior and target group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Step VI: Evaluating plans</strong> - Evaluation is an integral part of the planning process, serving to monitor progress and evaluate interventions.</li>

                        <p><strong>Community health evaluation</strong> is systematic studies conducted to assess how well a program is working in a community and why. Through evaluation, the implementers of community health services can:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Create more effective and efficient programs</li>
