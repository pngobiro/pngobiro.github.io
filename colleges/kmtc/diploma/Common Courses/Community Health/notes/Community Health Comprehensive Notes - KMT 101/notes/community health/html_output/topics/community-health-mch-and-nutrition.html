                        <h4>Immunization</h4>
                        <p>The basic principle of immunization is to administer into a healthy person a vaccine that will prevent that person from getting a certain disease.</p>

                        <p>The choice of one method of contraception against the other depend on: individual medical condition, taste of an individual or partner. Type of family planning and contraceptives can largely be divided into four categories:</p>

                            <li><strong>Natural Methods:</strong> Withdrawal, Safe Period (Rhythm), Breastfeeding Amenorrhea, Cervical Mucus, Basal Body Temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Barrier Methods:</strong> Male and Female Condoms, Spermicides, Diaphragms, Cervical Caps.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormonal Methods:</strong> Emergency contraception (e-pills), Ordinary pills, Injectable contraceptives, Contraceptive Implants, Hormone-releasing intrauterine systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Voluntary Surgical Contraception:</strong> Tubal Ligation, Vasectomy.</li>

                        <p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe nutrition and dietary requirements in our lives</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Nutrition</strong> is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. Good nutrition is an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Malnutrition</strong> is the condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Malnutrition</h4>
                        <p>Individuals are malnourished, or suffer from under nutrition if their diet does not provide them with adequate calories and protein for maintenance and growth, or they cannot fully utilize the food they eat due to illness. Growth failure malnutrition can take three serious types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Acute malnutrition or wasting</strong> arises out of sudden, drastic weight loss. It leads to three clinical malnutrition types:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Marasmus:</strong> this occurs when body fat and tissues degenerate at an alarming rate to compensate for the lack of nutrients.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Kwashiorkor:</strong> this is characterized by bilateral pitting oedema (fluid retention) in the legs and feet.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Marasmic-kwashiorkor:</strong> This is characterized by both severe wasting and oedema.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic malnutrition or stunting</strong> happens over a long period of time and has more long-lasting consequences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Micronutrient malnutrition</strong> implies a moderate to severe lack of Vitamins A, B, C and D, Calcium, Folate, Iodine, Iron, Zinc and Selenium.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Impact of Malnutrition on Health and Development</h4>
                        <p>Malnutrition and starvation have devastating impact on children, adults and especially on pregnant women. They also have severe and far-reaching socio-economic impacts.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Effects on children</strong> - Mental retardation, stunted growth, poor immune system, micronutrient deficiency, GI tract infections, anemia and inevitably - death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effects on pregnant women</strong> - Besides the health of the child being poor, a pregnant woman might have difficult labour, postpartum hemorrhage and anemia.</li>
                            <li><strong>General effects</strong> - Weak immunity, inactivity of muscles, apathy, depression, and kidney function impairment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long-Term Implications:</strong> The short-term implications of malnutrition eventually give way to long-term complications, such as growth and cognitive delays including attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, and decreased IQ scores.</li>
