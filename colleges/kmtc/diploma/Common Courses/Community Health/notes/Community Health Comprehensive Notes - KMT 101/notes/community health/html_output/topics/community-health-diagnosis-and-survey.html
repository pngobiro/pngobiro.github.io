                        <p><strong>Community</strong> - is a cluster of people with at least one common characteristic (geographic location, occupation, ethnicity, housing condition). It can also be defined as a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong> - is the identification and confirmation of a problem.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community diagnosis</strong> - Refers to the identification and quantification of health problems in a community as a whole in terms of mortality and morbidity rates and ratios, and identification of their correlates for the purpose of defining those at risk or those in need of health care.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Purpose of Community Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>The purpose of community diagnosis is to define existing problems, determine available resources and set priorities for planning, implementing and evaluating health action, by and for the community. The following are the importance of community diagnosis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyze the health status of the community</li>
                            <li>Evaluate the health resources, services, and systems of care within the community</li>
                            <li>Assess attitudes toward community health services and issues</li>
                            <li>Identify priorities, establish goals, and determine courses of action to improve the health status of the community</li>
                            <li>Establish an epidemiologic baseline for measuring improvement over time.</li>
                            <li>To act as a data reference</li>
                            <li>To provide an overall picture of the local community and the residents' concerns</li>
                            <li>To suggest priority areas for intervention and the feasible solutions</li>
                            <li>To indicate the resource allocation and the direction of work plans</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Definitions</h4>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Reasons for Carrying out a Survey</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gather information about residents, their opinion, attitude and knowledge</li>
                            <li>Measuring behaviors and population characteristics</li>
                            <li>Solicit community reaction to policies, proposals and solutions</li>
                            <li>Residents assess effectiveness of program, facilities and services</li>
                            <li>Make residence aware of problems and their effects</li>
                            <li>Provide residence access to policy making process</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Process of Planning and Conducting a Survey</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Decide on your goals:</strong> Form a clear picture of the expected outcome and identify the overall reasons for the survey.</li>
                            <li><strong>Design the methodology:</strong> Decide the procedures, sample size, and survey method (e.g., self-administered questionnaire or interview).</li>
                            <li><strong>Create a list of questions:</strong> Identify the questions you want the data to answer and develop the survey tools. Pre-test them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Invite the participants:</strong> Identify respondents and enumerators, train them, and assign responsibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gather your responses:</strong> Determine the data collection start time and distribute the survey forms, tracking the completion rate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analyze the results:</strong> Analyze data according to objectives, using visual representations like tables and graphs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Write a report:</strong> Explain your findings in a final report using a proper layout and provide a summary of your results.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Biased Samples</h4>
                        <p>A biased sample means a sample has some favors on a particular subject. The following are causes of biasness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Unrepresentative sample:</strong> Bias often occurs when the survey sample does not accurately represent the population (selection bias).</li>
                            <li><strong>Under coverage:</strong> Occurs when some members of the population are inadequately represented in the sample.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nonresponse bias:</strong> Individuals chosen for the sample are unwilling or unable to participate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Voluntary response bias:</strong> Occurs when sample members are self-selected volunteers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Measurement Error:</strong> A poor measurement process can also lead to bias.</li>
                            <li><strong>Response bias:</strong> Refers to the bias that results from problems in the response process, such as leading questions or social desirability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Biased samples can be eliminated by applying random sampling procedures.</p>

                        <h4>Points to be considered when constructing a survey tool</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use open-ended questions with probes.</li>
                            <li>Keep questions simple and brief.</li>
                            <li>Avoid closed questions and leading questions.</li>
                            <li>Start with easy questions and make personal questions last.</li>
                            <li>Each question should address one issue.</li>
                            <li>Keep the language very simple and avoid ambiguity.</li>
                            <li>Ask questions in a logical order.</li>
                            <li>Provide clear and sufficient instructions.</li>
                        </ul>
