                            <li><strong>Ecosystem</strong> - Environment is where man, pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi and protozoa) live. The interaction between man with environment enable transfer of germs to human system</li>
                            <li><strong>Difficulties in changing behavior</strong>- To prevent disease we increasingly ask people to begin do things that they have not done previously, to stop doing things that they have been doing for years and to do more of some things and less of others</li>
                            <li><strong>Pattern of disease rate</strong> - Some groups often have a characteristic over time even though individuals come and go from these groups. If groups have different rates over time, there may be something promotes or discourages disease among individuals in those groups</li>
                            <li><strong>Socio-economic status</strong>- A consistent finding dated from the twelfth century, is that people in the lowest socioeconomic groups have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality, whether the socioeconomic status was studied in relation to education, income, or occupation: the lower the level the higher the death and morbidity rate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gender</strong> - One of the most well-established facts among students of health and disease is that men have higher mortality rates than women. This excess of male deaths occurs at every age and for every major cause for which comparison is possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Culture and myths</strong> -There are some cultures that are opposing health prevention measures such as child immunization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Political challenges</strong> - Un favorable political situation will hinder disease prevention processes</li>
                            <li><strong>Taxation and cost issues</strong> - High tax in procuring vaccines may increase cost of immunization services</li>
                            <li><strong>Demographic issues</strong> - A growing elderly population puts more strain on health and social services. A significant number of people now spend a quarter of their lives as pensioners retired from working life</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal barriers</strong> - Cost and quality, lack of information, exercise and social class</li>
                            <li><strong>Administrative barriers</strong> - Differences in administrative conditions may make disease prevention become a challenge</li>
