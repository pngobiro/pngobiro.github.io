                            <li>Characteristics of a good goal:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Specific</strong> - When setting goals, they should answer the highly specific questions of who, what, where, when, and why.</li>
                                <li><strong>Measurable</strong> - In order for us to track our progress, goals should be quantifiable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Attainable</strong> - It is important to evaluate your situation honestly and recognize which goals are realistic, and which are a little far-fetched.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relevant</strong> - Is this goal relevant to your life? Does this match my needs?</li>
                                <li><strong>Time-related</strong> - Setting a "due date" to meet goals not only keeps you on track, but it prevents pesky daily roadblocks from getting in the way.</li>

                            <li>Facts about goal setting include:</li>

                                <li>Specific, realistic goals work best</li>
                                <li>It takes time for a change to become an established habit</li>
                                <li>Repeating a goal makes it stick</li>
                                <li>Pleasing other people doesn't work</li>
                                <li>Roadblocks don't mean failure</li>

                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Goals</strong> are broad, abstract statements of intent that help create a vision of what you are striving to accomplish.</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Example: Our goal is to reduce the number of premature deaths due to heart disease in our community.</li>

                                <li><strong>Objectives</strong> are measurable, specific statements that lead toward program goals and define what change the community will try to achieve.</li>
                                <li>Each objective should answer these questions:</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Who will receive the intervention?</li>
                                    <li>What health benefit should these persons receive?</li>
                                    <li>How much of that benefit should they receive?</li>
                                    <li>By when should it be achieved?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>For example:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>By 2020, the prevalence of smoking among county residents aged 18 years and older will be reduced by 15% from 25% to 21%.</li>
                                <li>By 2019, the rate of fatal injuries among county residents caused by drinking and driving will be reduced by 15% from 7/1,000 to 5/1,000.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Objectives are active, working tools and not merely academic exercises. An objective:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>Specifies a single key result.</li>
                                <li>Specifies a target date.</li>
                                <li>Is specific and quantitative.</li>
                                <li>Specifies what and when, not why and how.</li>
                                <li>Is readily understandable to those involved.</li>
                                <li>Is realistic, attainable, yet a challenge.</li>
                                <li>Provides limits to expenditures of time and effort.</li>

                            <li>Community health planning uses two types of objectives to clarify community goals:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Behavioral objectives</strong> - refer to those behavioral risk factors that contribute to the cause of death specified in your community goals</li>
                                <li><strong>Intervention objectives</strong> - refer to the intervention activities you plan to undertake</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The community goal is more general, the behavioral objectives are more specific, and the intervention objectives the most specific.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Examples:</p>

                            <li>The following are steps in organizing a community health services:</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Step I: Mobilizing the community</strong> - Mobilizing the community is an ongoing process that starts in step I as a community organizes to begin planning and continues throughout the process. During this step:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>The community to be addressed is defined,</li>
                                <li>Participants are recruited from the community</li>
                                <li>Partnerships are formed</li>
                                <li>Demographic profile of the community is completed</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li><strong>Step II: Collecting and organizing data</strong> - Step II begins when the community members form working groups to obtain and analyze data on mortality, morbidity, community opinion, and behaviors. These data are obtained from various sources, include quantitative data (e.g., vital statistics and survey) and qualitative data (e.g., opinions of community leaders).</li>

                            <li><strong>Step III: Choosing health priorities</strong> - During this step, objectives related to the health priorities are set. The health priorities to be addressed initially are selected.</li>

                            <li><strong>Step IV: Developing a comprehensive intervention plan</strong> - Using information generated during steps II and III, the community group chooses, designs, and conducts interventions during this step.</li>

                            <li><strong>Step V. Build on existing services</strong> - In order to prevent duplication and to integrate the existing services, the community group identifies and assesses resources, policies, environmental measures, and programs already focused on the risk behavior and to the target group.</li>

                            <li><strong>Step VI: Evaluating plans</strong> - Evaluation is an important part of the planning and implementation processes. It is ongoing and serves two purposes: to monitor and assess progress during the five phases of planning and to evaluate interventions. The community sets criteria for determining success and identifies data to be collected.</li>
                            <li>In each of these steps, community members are involved and are put to take lead in order to ensure sustainability, ownership and accountability.</li>

                                <li><strong>Financial viability</strong> - Example: profitability.</li>

                                <li>Customer satisfaction is important because without happy customers the organization will fail.</li>
                                <li>Employee satisfaction is important because over the long term it is impossible to have an organization with unhappy employees that has happy customers</li>
                                <li>Contribution to society (e.g., environment, ethics, safety, social responsibility) is important because every organization needs more than a simple profit motive to attract and retain the best talent and to sustain itself over time. An organization in which greed is a core value will ultimately devour itself.</li>

                            <li>The following are types of program evaluations:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Design</strong> - A design evaluation is conducted early in the planning stages or implementation of a program. It helps to define the scope of a program or project and to identify appropriate goals and objectives. Design evaluations can also be used to pre-test ideas and strategies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Impact</strong> - An impact evaluation is a subset of an outcome evaluation. It assesses the causal links between program activities and outcomes. This is achieved by comparing the observed outcomes with an estimate of what would have happened if the program had not existed (e.g., would the water be swimmable if the program had not been instituted).</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong> - Cost-effectiveness evaluations identify program benefits, outputs or outcomes and compare them with the internal and external costs of the program. Cost-effectiveness evaluations identify program benefits, outputs or outcomes and compare them with the internal and external costs of the program. The impact evaluation determines the causal effects of the program. This involves trying to measure if the program has achieved its intended outcomes, i.e. program outcomes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Evaluation result is measured by indicators:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Input indicators</strong> - are efforts or what you invest in an activity. These can be resources e.g. money, personnel, time etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>Process indicators</strong> - are procedures, methods or steps followed during implementation of an activity. A process evaluation assesses whether a program or process is implemented as designed or operating as intended and identifies opportunities for improvement. Process evaluations often begin with an analysis of how a program currently operates. Process evaluations may also assess whether program activities and outputs conform to statutory and regulatory requirements, policies, and program design or customer expectations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Output indicators</strong> - are immediate outcome or results of an activity</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
