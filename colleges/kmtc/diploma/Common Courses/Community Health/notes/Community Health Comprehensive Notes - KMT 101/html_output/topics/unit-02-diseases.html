                        <p><dfn>Disease</dfn> - A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively affects the function of part or organism, and that is not due to any external injury. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Pathogens (germs)</dfn> are tiny organisms or microbes (living things) that may cause disease. We don't know what hit us until we have symptoms (runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, etc.)</p>

                        <p>Although some microbes can make you sick or may even kill you, most are harmless, and some are extremely helpful. Microbes can be found virtually anywhere - in air, water, plants, animals and humans.</p>

                        <p>Broad examples of germs are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Bacteria</strong> - are one-cell organisms responsible for illnesses e.g. sore throat, urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Viruses</strong> - Are smaller than bacteria. They depend upon a host to survive, grow, and reproduce. Viruses cannot live outside living cells. Viruses cause chicken pox, measles, flu, and many other diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fungi</strong> - are multi-celled plant-like organisms. They thrive in warm, damp environments. Most fungi are not dangerous. Fungi causes diseases like athlete's foot, candidiasis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protozoa</strong> - are one-celled organisms like bacteria. Protozoa also love moisture and often spread diseases through contaminated water. Some protozoa cause intestinal infections.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>There are 4 types of disease:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Infectious diseases</strong> - disorders caused by organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deficiency diseases</strong> - caused by a lack of essential dietary elements and especially a vitamin or minerals e.g. scurvy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hereditary diseases</strong> - Are inherited. A specific gene from one or both parents lead to an abnormality e.g. sickle cell anemia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physiological diseases</strong> - a condition in which the organs in the body malfunctions and causes illness e.g. Asthma, Diabetes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Diseases can be classified in to communicable and non-communicable diseases.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>A communicable disease</strong> - are the diseases which passes from one individual to another individual. They are generally caused by some bacteria, viruses or any other pathogens. For example, malaria, AIDS etc.</p>

                        <p><strong>Non-communicable disease</strong> - is not transmissible directly from one person to another. Most are non-infectious, although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases.</p>

                        <p>The epidemiologic triangle or triad is the traditional model of infectious disease causation. It has 3 components: External agent; Susceptible host; Environment that brings the host and agent together.</p>

                        <p><strong>Agent</strong> - is the pathogen. Are infectious microorganism i.e. virus, bacterium, parasite, or other microbe. Agent factors - These agents must be present for a disease to occur.</p>

                        <p><strong>Host</strong> - is the living being that the bacteria, virus, protozoan, or other disease-causing microorganism normally resides in. A vector is an organism that helps transmit infection from one host to another. Host factors - Are factors that influence individual's exposure, susceptibility, or response to a causative agent. Age, race, sex, socioeconomic status and behaviors (smoking, drug abuse, lifestyle, sexual practices and contraception, eating habits) are some of the many host factors which affect a person's likelihood of exposure</p>

                        <p><strong>Environment</strong> - influences the agent, the host and the route of transmission of the agent from a source to the host. Environmental factors - Are factors which affect the agent and the opportunity for exposure. It includes physical factors such as geology, climate, physical surrounding, biological factors such as insects that transmit agents, socioeconomic factors such as crowding, sanitation etc.</p>

It is made up of six different links: pathogen (infectious agent), reservoir, portal of exit, means of transmission, portal of entry, and the new host. Each link has a unique role in the chain, and each can be interrupted, or broken, through various means.</p>

                            <li><strong>Transmission cycle</strong> - occurs when the agent leaves its reservoir or host through a portal of exit, and is conveyed by some mode of transmission, and enters through an appropriate portal of entry to infect a susceptible host.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reservoir</strong> - is the habitat in which an infectious agent normally lives, grows and multiplies. This includes humans, animals and the environment</li>

                                <li><strong>Persons with symptomatic illness</strong> - Symptomatic persons are usually less likely to transmit infection widely because their symptoms increase their likelihood of being diagnosed and treated</li>
                                <li><strong>Carriers</strong> - Asymptomatic carrier, a person or organism infected with an infectious disease agent, but displays no symptoms.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><strong>Environmental reservoir</strong> - Plants, soil and water are also reservoir for some infectious disease. Many fungal agents such as those causing histoplasmosis live and multiply in the soil</li>
                            <li><strong>Animal reservoir</strong> - Infectious diseases that are transmittable under normal conditions from animal to humans are called zoonoses. Such disease includes brucellosis (cows and pigs), anthrax (sheep), plague (rodents), rabies (bats, dogs)</li>
                            <li><strong>Portal of exit and entry</strong> - Is the path by which an agent leaves the source host or enters. Tubercle bacilli and influenza viruses exit the respiratory tract; Schistosome through urine; cholera vibrios through feces etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modes of transmission</strong> - After an agent exits its natural reservoir, it may be transmitted to a susceptible host in numerous ways. These modes of transmission are classified as:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Direct (Direct contact and direct spread)</strong> - This is immediate transfer of the agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. It occurs through kissing, skin-to-skin contact. Also refer to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Indirect (Airborne, vehicle borne, Vector borne)</strong> - This can be mechanical or biologic. An agent is carried from a reservoir (a susceptible host) by suspended air particles or by animate (vector). Most vectors are arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas and ticks. This is in contrast of instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host. When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of direct transmission is called a biologic transmission. Vehicles that may directly transmit an agent include food, water, blood, handkerchiefs, bedding etc.</li>

                            <li><strong>Establish the existence of an outbreak and confirm it</strong> - Check for possible increase in numbers than usual, interview cases and review laboratory findings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Verify the diagnosis</strong> - Review clinical findings and laboratory results. Visit and talk to some patients to get better understanding of the clinical features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case definition</strong> - Establish a case definition (A case definition is a standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the disease or not). Classify case definitions as: definite case; probable case; possible case.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case finding (Identify and count cases)</strong> - Collect the following information about every case: Identifying information; Demographic information; Clinical information; Risk factor information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perform descriptive epidemiology</strong> - Characterizing an outbreak by variables such as time, place and person. Draw epidemic curve (graph of disease occurrences over time) and line list (table summarizing information about the disease outbreak i.e. name, residence, date of onset, results)</li>
                            <li><strong>Develop hypothesis</strong> - Causes may have been suspected. However, a formal hypothesis can be generated by reflecting on the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test hypothesis</strong>: Use analytical epidemiology to assess exposure between cases and control (Ill and Non-Ill) You can use cohort study or case control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interventions</strong> - Implement control and prevention measures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate control measures</strong> - Monitor incidences of cases once control interventions are put in place. This can be done through surveillance to assess the effectiveness of the interventions.</li>

                            <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Use specific forms to report confirmed cases within 24 hours</li>
                            <li><strong>Isolation</strong> - Separation of patients from other persons within communicable period of a particular disease. This is done to limit spread of disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quarantine</strong> - Prohibition of movement of persons who have been exposed to the communicable disease to stop the spreading</li>
                            <li><strong>Disinfection</strong> - Killing of infectious agent and reduce harm of the disease to an individual</li>
                            <li><strong>Immuno-prophylaxis</strong> - Preventing disease by giving immunizing agents to raise herd immunity. This can be: Passive immunization (administering prepared antibodies) or Active immunization (administering antigens in form of vaccines and toxoid)</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemo-prophylaxis</strong> - Use of drugs to prevent development or progression of infection</li>
                            <li><strong>Health education</strong> - Create awareness to community about causes of disease, clinical features, mode of transmission, prevention, notification, immunization and hygiene</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental sanitation</strong> - Keeping hygiene of the surrounding</li>
                            <li><strong>Surveillance</strong> - Continuous watching over occurrence and spread of disease through investigation, lab confirmation and data collection</li>
