                            <li>The SDG has brought all three aspects of sustainable development - the economic, social and environmental in a much more integrated way than the MDGs ever did.</li>
                            <li>The new SDGs go much further than the MDGs by addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for development that works for all people.</li>
                            <li>There were only eight MDG goals and while the SDGs has 17</li>
                            <li>The SDGs apply to all countries whether rich or poor</li>
                            <li>The SDGs will now finish the job of the MDGs, and ensure that no one is left behind</li>
