                            <li>Drugs can be categorized based upon their effects on users.</li>
                            <li>There are essentially seven different drug types, each with its own set of characteristics, effects and dangers.</li>
                            <li>Drugs are classified as:</li>
                            
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Stimulants</strong> - impact the body's central nervous system (CNS), causing the user to feel as if they are "speeding up." These drugs increase the user's level of alertness, pumping up heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and blood glucose levels.</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Doctors prescribe stimulants for, narcolepsy and asthma (because the drugs can open up breathing passages). The drugs can also help aid weight loss, as they can decrease appetite in users.</li>
                                    <li>Stimulant abuse occurs in high school when teens wish to enhance performance in school or sports.</li>
                                    <li>Examples are:</li>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
                                        <li>Cocaine - commonly known as blow, bump, candy, coke, rock (are smoked or injected)</li>

                                <li><strong>Depressants</strong> - Like stimulants, depressants also impact the body's CNS, but with the opposite effect, making users feel as if things are "slowing down." Thus, they are often called "downers" on the street.</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Doctors prescribe depressants for anxiety, insomnia, and other medical issues that prevent the sufferer from fully relaxing.</li>
                                    <li>These drugs often offer a sedative experience to users, making them a tempting choice for teens who wish to escape everyday stresses.</li>

                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Users report intense, rapidly shifting emotions and perceptions of things that aren't really there. Hallucinogen user might believe that they see a person speaking to them - when that person does not even exist.</li>
                                    <li>Example:</li>

                                    <li>These drugs work by interfering with the brain's receptors for the chemical glutamate, which plays a significant role in cognition, emotionality and pain perception. Dissociative can be taken as liquids, powders, solids or gases. The drugs include:</li>
