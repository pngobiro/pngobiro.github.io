                            <li>Malnutrition is the condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function.</li>
                            <li>Individuals are malnourished if their diet does not provide them with adequate calories and protein for maintenance and growth, or they cannot fully utilize the food they eat due to illness.</li>
                            <li>Growth failure malnutrition is the failure of an individual to grow as expected in height or weight, according to his/her age and gender.</li>
                            <li>Growth failure malnutrition can take three serious types:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Acute malnutrition or wasting</strong> - arises out of sudden, drastic weight loss. It leads to three clinical malnutrition types:</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Marasmus: this occurs when body fat and tissues degenerate at an alarming rate to compensate for the lack of nutrients. As a result, the body's internal processes begin to slow down alarmingly fast as does the activity of the immune system.</li>
                                    <li>Kwashiorkor. this is characterized by bilateral pitting edema (fluid retention) in the legs and feet. As a result, the under-nourished child may actually look plump.</li>
                                    <li>Marasmic-kwashiorkor. This is characterized by both severe wasting and edema.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><strong>Chronic malnutrition or stunting</strong> - happens over a long period of time and has more long-lasting consequences. It begins before birth due to poor maternal health and leads to stunted growth in an otherwise normally proportioned child. Poor breast feeding, infections and lack of availability of proper nutrients are the main causes behind it. Stunting is dangerous because it becomes irreversible after an age. Therefore, it becomes important to nip it in the bud by providing proper medical treatment to pregnant women and young girls.</li>
                                <li><strong>Micronutrient malnutrition</strong> - implies a moderate to severe lack of Vitamins A, B, C and D, Calcium, Folate, Iodine, Iron, Zinc and Selenium. These vitamins and minerals are of utmost importance in various body processes and their deficiency can make an otherwise healthy person malnourished:</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Iron deficiency causes anaemia, poor brain development and cardiac functioning.</li>
                                    <li>Iodine deficiency leads to impaired thyroid functioning and mental retardation.</li>
                                    <li>Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets and other bone development related disorders.</li>
                                    <li>Selenium deficiency leads to poor cardiac function, weak immunity and osteoarthritis.</li>
                                    <li>Vitamin A deficiency is a cause of poor vision, bone development and immunity.</li>
                                    <li>Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to nerve degeneration and poor RBC formation</li>
                                    <li>Folate or vitamin B9 deficiency causes slow growth and anemia</li>
                                    <li>Zinc deficiency can cause poor immunity, sensory perception and anemia.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Signs and symptoms of malnutrition- A symptom is something the patient feels and reports, while a sign is something other people, such as the doctor detect. For example, pain may be a symptom while a rash may be a sign. The general signs and symptoms include:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>Loss of fat (adipose tissue)</li>
                                <li>Breathing difficulties, a higher risk of respiratory failure</li>
                                <li>Depression</li>
                                <li>Higher risk of complications after surgery and lower healing hence longer recovery</li>
                                <li>Higher risk of hypothermia - abnormally feeling cold and low body temperature</li>
                                <li>The total number of some types of white blood cells falls; consequently, the immune system is weakened, increasing the risk of infections.</li>
                                <li>Lower sex drive and problems with fertility</li>
                                <li>Reduced muscle and tissue mass</li>
                                <li>Tiredness, fatigue, apathy and irritability</li>
                                <li>In more severe cases:</li>
                                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Skin may become thin, dry, inelastic, pale, and cold</li>
                                    <li>Eventually, as fat in the face is lost, the cheeks look hollow and the eyes sunken</li>
                                    <li>Hair becomes dry and sparse, falling out easily</li>
                                    <li>Sometimes, severe malnutrition may lead to unresponsiveness (stupor)</li>
                                    <li>If calorie deficiency continues for long enough, there may be heart, liver and respiratory failure</li>
                                    <li>Total starvation is said to be fatal within 8 to 12 weeks</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Causes of malnutrition are:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Poor diet</strong> - if a person does not eat enough food, or if what they eat does not provide them with the nutrients they require for good health, they suffer from malnutrition. Poor diet may be caused by one of several different factors. If the patient develops dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) because of an illness, or when recovering from an illness, they may not be able to consume enough of the right nutrients.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mental health problems</strong> - some patients with mental health conditions, such as depression, may develop eating habits which lead to malnutrition. Patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia may develop malnutrition because they are ingesting too little food.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mobility problems</strong> - people with mobility problems may suffer from malnutrition simply because they either cannot get out enough to buy foods, or find preparing them too arduous.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digestive disorders and stomach conditions</strong> - some people may eat properly, but their bodies cannot absorb the nutrients they need for good health.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alcoholism</strong> - this is a chronic (long-term) disease. Individuals who suffer from alcoholism can develop gastritis, or pancreas damage. These problems also seriously undermine the body's ability to digest food, absorb certain vitamins, and produce hormones which regulate metabolism. Alcohol contains calories, reducing the patient's feeling of hunger, so he/she consequently may not eat enough proper food to supply the body with essential nutrients.</li>
                                <li>Food shortage, price and distribution</li>
                                <li>Lack of breastfeeding</li>
                            </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Malnutrition and starvation have devastating impact on children, adults and especially on pregnant women. They also have severe and far-reaching socioeconomic impacts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effects on children</strong> - Mental retardation, stunted growth, poor immune system, micronutrient deficiency, GI tract infections, anemia and inevitably - death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effects on pregnant women</strong> - Besides the health of the child being poor, a pregnant woman might have difficult labour, postpartum hemorrhage and anemia.</li>
                            <li><strong>General effects</strong> - Weak immunity, inactivity of muscles, apathy, depression, and kidney function impairment.</li>
                            <li>Malnourished children experience developmental delays, weight-loss and illness as a result of inadequate intake of protein, calories and other nutrients. Because orphaned and institutionalized children may experience one or several macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, they are at risk for a variety of short-term and long-term complications:</li>
                            <li><strong>Short-Term Implications</strong> - Because so much development occurs in the first few years of life, nutrient deficiencies can have major short-term implications in young children.</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Immune Implications</strong> - Malnourishment can greatly compromise a child's immune system, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Particularly in institutions where there are poor sanitary practices, children are vulnerable to infections from other children or caregivers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Growth Implications</strong> - A child may contract an infection due to poor nutritional status. In turn, a gastrointestinal infection places the child at even greater risk for nutrient deficiencies because nutrients are unable to be absorbed properly. Consequently, nutrient deficiency combined with infection can cause growth retardation.</li>
                                <li>Additionally, a deficiency in one nutrient may lead to a deficiency in another nutrient. For example, deficiencies in iron, magnesium and zinc can cause anorexia and thereby result in reduced intake of other important nutrients such as protein. Low lipid intake can also affect the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A and Zinc and protein deficiencies can retard bone growth and development, putting a child at risk for long-term complications.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><strong>Long-Term Implications</strong> - The short-term implications of malnutrition eventually give way to long-term complications, such as growth and cognitive delays:</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li><strong>Growth Implications</strong> - Malnutrition not only impacts growth in the short term, but can also limit total bone growth. Additionally, children classified as low height-for-age (stunted) may never be able to regain lost growth potential if they continue to live in a nutritionally deprived situation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cognitive Implications</strong> - Malnutrition negatively effects brain development causing delays in motor and cognitive development, such as:</li>
