                        <h3>Hospital administration statistics</h3>
                        <p>Health administrative data is generated from health institutions where health services are provided to the patients or clients. The information obtained indicates a detailed account of the activities that are carried out in a health institution. It forms a data base which is used by health managers/administrators in the Mx and planning of health services.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Examples of Uses</h4>
                        <h5>1. Management of health services</h5>
                        <p>Managers of health services require data concerning patients in order to manage them more effectively and efficiently. This include the mx of scarce resources such as patients food, linen, transport, staff, finances available, physical facilities such as beds and theatre etc. Data concerning family planning and maternal child health services (MCH/FP) are also required for evaluation and better mx for such services. The requirements of doctors and other health workers needs statistical information concerning diagnosis, operations, Rx and investigations. Adequate information would improve the efficiency of the process involved in arriving at the diagnosis and subsequent Rx, thereby making it possible to eliminate wasteful process.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. Planners</h5>
                        <p>Health information aids planners in making accurate plans for day to day and future requirements of health activities with accurate and timely data, planners are able to estimate for service requirements such as drugs, finances and physical facility requirements. The health information data bank enables health workers and information officers to create an analytical frame work commonly referred to as Health Activity Analysis.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Health Activity Analysis</h5>
                        <p>This is a systematic way of collection, analysis and presentation of health data. It concerns data obtained from patients/clients attendances, staff, bed use, physical facilities, service delivery data, finances etc.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4. Patient/client attendance</h5>
                        <p>Patients/clients make use of health facilities either as in-patient or out-patient clients.</p>

                        <p>In-patient indicates the activities of in-patient services in a health institution. The data is collected by a form commonly known as Daily Bed Return. (DBR). The form is designed to be useful in specific circumstances.</p>
                        
                        <h3>DBR-MOH 328</h3>
                        <h4>Explanation of sections.</h4>
                        <h5>Section A-E</h5>
                        <p>It's normally computed by in charges of each ward. This is done after doing a physical counting of patients in the ward, who remain after discharges or deaths have been removed from the ward. The physical count is normally carried out preferably at midnight of each day. This is the time when patient's movement is minimal.</p>
                        <p>This section is divided into 2 main sections:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Admissions</li>
                            <li>Discharges</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h6>Admissions</h6>
                        <p>All patients admitted from home, transferred from another ward, coming from parole or returned from having absconded are indicated on admission section. All patients indicated on this section are added to patients who remained in the ward the previous day and the total is obtained which is the total number of patients in that ward.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Discharges</h6>
                        <p>These are discharges from the wards which are discharged home, those who are dead, transferred to another ward, absconders (run away from hospitals) and those who are granted hospital leaves (parole). The total discharges are subtracted from the totals obtained in admission section. The results obtained must be equal to the physical count of patients who are in the ward at the time of physical count. This is the figure entered in section E of the DBR in the column of patients who are either sleeping on the bed or cots (accommodated).</p>
                        
                        <h5>Section F</h5>
                        <p>Section F of the DBR is normally for records use only. The officer in charge of health information completes this section. This section is used to balance the DBR to check the accuracy of entries in all other sections. The last total that's obtained after adding all the admissions to the previous day, number of patients who remained in the ward and subtracting all discharges must be equal to patients indicated in section E, that is today's daily return numbers of patients.</p>
                        
                        <p>When DBR is returned to the records department is properly checked, summarized on daily summary in patients statistics form. The daily summary form, summarizes the day statistics. It indicates the total admissions and discharges in the ward. There is a column for OBD (occupied Bed Days), this is the total number of patients remaining in the ward each day.</p>
