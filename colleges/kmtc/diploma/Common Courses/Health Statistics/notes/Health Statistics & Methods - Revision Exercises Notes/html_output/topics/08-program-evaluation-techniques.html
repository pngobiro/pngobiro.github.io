                        <h3>Program Evaluation Techniques</h3>
                        <p>It's a way of measuring whether programs are doing what they are supposed to do. Evaluation means collecting information about program activity effectiveness and then comparing it to the actual results.</p>
                        <p>Evaluation helps communities to see if their programs are achieving the expected results.</p>

                        <h4>Reasons for evaluation of a health program</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Evaluation helps communities understand how the health programs are working.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation provides a platform to show the success or challenges of a given program.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation shows what works in another community that can be adopted by a different community.</li>
                            <li>Evaluation will show us how staffs in a given program are working.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Community needs assessment</h3>
                        <p>Needs assessment are part of the planning stage of programs and help in identifying community health priorities. Needs assessment helps the community to understand the following:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>What kind of health problems communities are experiencing.</li>
                            <li>What causes this health problems.</li>
                            <li>What resources are available to address this health problems.</li>
                            <li>What goals and objectives community need to write or formulate to help out this problems.</li>
                            <li>Which community members have the most urgent needs and how best to meet the needs of the community members.</li>

                        <h4>a. Goal</h4>
                        <p>These are broad statements that describe what programs or activities should be achieved.</p>

                        <h4>b. Objective</h4>
                        <p>These are identifiable and measurable actions to be completed in a specific time.</p>

                        <h4>c. Activity</h4>
                        <p>It's something that communities do to meet program objectives. They are building blocks that make up a program.</p>

                        <h4>d. Indicator</h4>
                        <p>Evaluation indicators are signs, events or statistics that measure the success of programs or activities in meeting the objective.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Hard or soft indicators:</b> Hard indicators based on numbers and it's quantitative. Soft indicators not based on numbers and it's qualitative.</li>
                            <li><b>Short term or long term indicators:</b> Short term- they appear within a few weeks or months after activity starts and show progress towards meeting the objective. Long term- occur many months or years to show progress towards meeting the objectives.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Main evaluation tasks</h4>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Examining findings enables evaluators to answer evaluation questions explaining the conclusion. This analysis explains why the activity was successful or not.</p>

                        <h4>1. Traditional evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Traditional evaluation in health were focused on assessing the impact of specific program activities of defined programs.</p>

                        <h4>2. Economic evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cost minimization</li>

                        <p>They combine program effectiveness information with economic resources that is costs and benefits in quantitative terms. They allow decision makers to prioritize health activities in the face of finite or scarce resources.</p>
                        
                        <h4>3. Process evaluation</h4>
                        <p>It refers to evaluation that are focused on outputs. A relationship is assumed between outputs and outcomes and evidence of a change in output is taken as indirect evidence of an impact on the desired outcome.</p>

                        <h4>4. Formative evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Refer to efforts to identify the best use of the available resources prior to the traditional program evaluation.</p>

                        <h4>5. Empowerment evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Involves an approach whereby programs takes stock of their existing strength and weaknesses, focus on key goals and program improvement, develop self-initiated strategies to achieve this goals and determine the type of evidence that can document credible progress.</p>

                        <h4>6. Performance measures</h4>
                        <p>Use of statistical methods and other evaluation tools on an going basis to assure accountability for public health programs and to improve performance.</p>

                            <li><b>A formative evaluation:</b> During the project developmental phase to clarify objectives while taking into account the cultural environment and other local factors that influence project execution. Collection of baseline data and existing historical trends. Found out where we are.</li>
                            <li><b>Process evaluation:</b> Done throughout project implementation phase to provide timely feedback on how the intervention has been put into operation and what could be done to improve its operationality to achieve the desired outcomes.</li>
                            <li><b>Impact evaluation:</b> Assess the net effects/total impact of the intervention and whether the stated intervention goals are reached. Assess both short term outcomes and long term system impacts. Its usually very useful as it informs donor funding organization and policy decision makers whether to invest in or scale up the particular program.</li>
