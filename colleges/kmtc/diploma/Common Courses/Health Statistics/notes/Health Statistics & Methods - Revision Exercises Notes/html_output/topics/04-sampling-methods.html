                        <h3>Population</h3>
                        <p>In statistics, population means total number of items in a specific field of inquiry. It's the entire group of individuals or objects under consideration.</p>
                        <p>The examples of population are number of wild animals in a national park, total number of cars in a country, total number of students in a college, total number of human beings in a country etc. population is also known as universe.</p>
                        <p>In order to collect statistical data, census method and sampling method can be used. In census method, all the units of a population or universe are contracted e.g in the census of population of Kenya, all the individuals residing in Kenya is included. Although this technique provides complete and accurate information but it's very expensive and inconvenient.</p>

                        <h3>A sample.</h3>
                        <p>When the sample are selected from a population, the units selected must be taken random. Sample is a portion, piece or segment that represents the whole (population). According to this method, a few units from the whole population must have equal chance to be selected. The units selected are just by chance or coincidence. If these units selected are not taken at random then bias will take place and undue importance will be given to some units. In this case the sampling will not be fair and representative e.g if from a class students selected to be part of the study will be only intelligent students. This will not be representative regarding the performance.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sampling</h3>
                        <p>The process of selecting a number of individuals for a study in such a way that the selected individuals represent the large group from which they were selected.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of sampling is to secure a representative group which will enable the researcher to gather information about a population.</p>

                        <h4>Advantages of sampling method</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>As only a small part of the whole population is studied, its cheaper to collect the data.</li>
                            <li>The data are collected and analyzed more quickly, thus sampling saves a lot of time.</li>
                            <li>Since only a part of the whole population is to be studied a good quality of labour with better supervision can be provided.</li>
                            <li>An investigation of a small part of the population gives us more detailed information.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Sampling frame</h3>
                        <p>Refers to a list of all items that constitute given population. A list of entire population from which items can be selected to form a sample. E.g voters register may be used as a sampling frame for the voting population.</p>

                        <h3>1. Simple random sampling</h3>
                        <p>The name comes from the fact that no complexities are involved. Random expresses the idea of chance being the only criterion for selection. It's therefore a sampling procedure that provides equal opportunity of selection from each element in a population. All is needed is clearly defined population in a sample frame (boundaries should be defined).</p>
                        <p>Random samples are satisfactory when the population is homogeneous (uniformity of certain characteristics)</p>
                        <p>The main objective of the simple random is to eliminate any form of bias in the selection and to obtain a representative sample.</p>
                        <p>There are various techniques of selecting randomly, the most common is lottery technique, where a symbol of each unit population is placed in a container mixed well and then the likely numbers are drawn, that constitute the sample.</p>
                        <p>A more sophisticated method particularly used for large populations is the use of random number tables. These tables are mathematically prepared so that numbers are written in a random way and therefore each item has an equal probability of being selected.</p>

                            <p>Read and make notes on how to get a sample using random number tables.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Suppose you want to investigate the socio-economic status of patients with diabetes in Kisumu county, here are the steps to follow;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get all the information on the total number of people with this condition (sampling frame). Such information can be obtained from existing health records or previous investigation.</li>
                            <li>Decide on your sample size</li>
                            <li>Give a number to each patient in the location within Kisumu County.</li>
                            <li>Write those numbers on pieces of paper: fold them properly making sure that the numbers cannot be seen.</li>
                            <li>Put all the papers in the basket and shake them properly.</li>
                            <li>Pick any of the papers at random, repeat several times until you reach your sample size.</li>
                            <li>You will then go to the location and interview those patients whose numbers you have picked.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>2. Systematic random sampling</h3>
                        <p>This type of sampling is very similar to simple random sampling. The technique of collection instead of relying on number of tables it's based on the selection of elements at each equal interval starting at a randomly selected element on the population list.</p>
                        <p>To make systematic random, it's necessary to compute the length (k) of the sampling interval which is determined by the ratio of the total population ( N ) to the desired sample size (n).</p>
                        <p class="equation">K = N / n</p>
                        <p>Where;<br>K = interval length<br>N = total population<br>n = sample size</p>
                        <h4>Example;</h4>
                        <p>While drawing the samples in your study in Kisumu County, the following steps will be followed;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine the affected population. The number of people affected 10000 (N)</li>
                            <li>List the population (in our case diabetes cases), from 1-10000. While listing you have to make sure that:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Specific characters don't occur all the time at any given interval.</li>
                                    <li>Each number corresponds to a specific point or case in the population (to eliminate biased representation)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Determine the sample size e.g 1000(n)</li>
                            <li>Divide the population by sample size, this is the interval which you will use while picking your samples from the population.<br>
                            K = N/n<br>
                            K = 10000 / 1000<br>
                            K = 10 interval.</li>
                            <li>Determine the starting point from which you will start picking every 10th item e.g using simple random, if the first randomly selected sample is number 3 and K is 10th item after number 3, then the items or samples we shall come with are 3, 13, 23, 33 etc all selected systematically till you reach your sample size of 1000.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Advantages of simple random sampling</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Its straight forward and probably the simplest method of sampling.</li>
                            <li>It prevents the sampling bias and error.</li>
                            <li>The method is fair.</li>
                            <li>It's simple and makes data interpretation easier.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It's more time consuming than non-representative methods.</li>
                            <li>It's expensive.</li>
                            <li>Each person has to be located and questioned.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Advantages of systematic random sampling</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Easy to organize.</li>
                            <li>More precise than simple random sampling and more evenly spread over population.</li>
                            <li>Simple to apply the analysis of data and has a sound mathematical basis.</li>
                            <li>Biasness is eliminated.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>There is no guarantee that the behaviour of these people represents the behaviour of the other groups.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Stratified sampling.</h3>
                        <p>This is a method of obtaining a sample from a population when distinct groups (strata) of a population can be identified. The principle of this sampling is to divide a population into different groups called strata such that each element of the population belongs to one and only stratum.</p>
                        <p>The population divided into groups should be in such a way that units within each group are as similar as possible. The groups should be homogeneous.</p>
                        <p>The composition of groups can be for instance different tribes, religions, gender, socio-economic groups, occupation, age, income groups etc.</p>
                        <p>The chosen variables should be one that result in internally homogeneous stratum, then within each stratum, random sampling is applied using either simple or systematic random method to choose the sample.</p>
                        <p>Stratified sampling can be proportional or non-proportional. In proportional sampling the participants are chosen in proportion to the number in each group. Non-proportional occurs when the response weight of the sub-group is not a factor.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Examples</h4>
                        <p>The ministry of health wants to determine if geographical location has a significant effect on health care workers support for a merit pay plan.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <p>It allows representation of district groups in a population proportionally, this is because the samples are taken in accordance to this proportion of the constituent parts of the whole population.</p>

                        <h4>Example 2</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Assume that Kisumu town is divided into two district locations. It can therefore stratify its population into two groups according to their locations.</li>
                            <li>Suppose Kisumu town has a population of 100000 and this population is distributed between the two locations namely: Kisumu East and Kisumu West. The proportion representation of this locations in town is 3:7.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Kisumu town = 100,000<br>
                        Kisumu East = 30,000<br>
                        Kisumu West = 70,000</p>
                        <p>Therefore if we wish to study for instance malaria prevalence as a health condition which has affected 10,000 people in Kisumu town, we shall take our sample in accordance to 3:7 representation of the location in the town. If our sample is 1000 cases only.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Steps</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Obtain information about the total population and population of a location in Kisumu town which is 100,000 and locations (Kisumu East 30,000 and Kisumu West 70,000 )</li>
                            <li>Obtain proportion representation of a location, this is worked in the form of a ratio as follows:<br>
                            Kisumu East = 30,000 / 100,000<br>
                            Kisumu West = 70,000 / 100,000 = 7/10</li>
                            <li>Ten is common in both locations and therefore we shall say that the proportional representation is 3:7. This means that for every 3 people in Kisumu East location there are 7 people in Kisumu West location.</li>
                            <li>If the sample size is 1000, apply the same ratio 3:7 in which the population occurs in order to get smaller sub- samples which are 3/10 of 1000 for Kisumu East and 7/10 of 1000 for Kisumu West, this smaller sub -samples are called stratified samples.</li>
                            <li>After establishing the sub-samples, then apply simple random sampling to get the actual cases to be investigated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>4. Multi-Stage Sampling Method</h3>
                        <p>The population is divided into first sampling units which are sampled by simple random sampling. The selected units are therefore subdivided into second stage units and the sample is selected out of these units. The selected second stage units are then further sub divided into 3rd stage units and again a sample is selected out of 3rd stage units.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Suppose we had a division known as Rera Division, there is a justification that a control programme on the spread of malaria must be started in the whole of Rera Division, however there is need to start a pilot programme in two villages in order to provide us with information on how effective the major control programme will be. We are required to select two villages in which the pilot programme will be introduced. Rera division has 24 villages spread equally over the 3 locations and 12 sub locations.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Steps</h5>

                            <li>In each selected locations there are 4 sub-locations, in each sub-location there are two villages.</li>
                            <li>Apply the same random sampling method to select one village in each of the two sub-locations.</li>
                            <li>Having selected the two villages they are your representative sample where the control programme would be started on a pilot basis.</li>

                            <p>The programme will be introduced to affect everybody in the two villages. Each person in the two villages is considered to be a true representative sample of the population in Rera division, this gives everybody in this two villages a right to be interviewed.</p>

                        <h3>5. Cluster sampling method</h3>
                        <p>This is a method of sampling which follows the same basic steps as in multi stage sampling method. The difference in cluster sampling and multi-stage sampling is that, cluster sampling deals with only specific selected places or characters referred as clusters.</p>
                        <p>It involves selecting some known members of a population for the study e.g footballers, prostitutes, adolescents, women etc.</p>
                        <p>Eg In Rera division we would take the following steps as in;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Follow the same steps as explained in multi stage sampling</li>
                            <li>Issue instructions specifying who will be interviewed in the already identified areas e.g people living within 100 m from the ponds, dams, lake etc</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The number of specification to be included in your investigation forms a group of clusters within the population to be interviewed. This is with biased method of sampling, because there is a deliberate focus on some groups to the exclusion of others. When a particular strategy is selected for the study, then, either cluster or focus group of sampling is said to have been used in selecting the sample points.</p>

                        <h3>6. Quota sampling</h3>
                        <p>This is a method of sampling in which interviewers are sent to different survey locations with instructions to interview all people up to a given number, this given numbers are what we call quotas.</p>
                        <p>The enumerators are given a quota of say 400 people and are told to interview all the people they can until their quota has been met.</p>
                        <p>Such quota is nearly always divided up into different types of people with sub-quotas for each type e.g Out of 400, the enumerator may be told to interview 250 working wives, 100 non-working wives and 50 unmarried women.</p>
