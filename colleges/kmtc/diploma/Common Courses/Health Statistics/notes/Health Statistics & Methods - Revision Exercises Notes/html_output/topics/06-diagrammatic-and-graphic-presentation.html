                        <p>The main objective of statistics is to simplify the complexity of the quantitative data and make them easily understandable.</p>
                        <p>Diagrammatic representation is best suited to spatial series (in relation to geographical locations) and data split into different categories whenever a comparison of the same data at different places is to be made, diagrams will be the best way to do that.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages of diagrams</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>They provide an easy and attractive means of representing data.</li>
                            <li>They make the information contained in data readily understandable.</li>
                            <li>They facilitate comparisons.</li>
                            <li>They save time and labour.</li>
                            <li>They give an effective impression.</li>
                            <li>They have great memorizing value as compared to mere figures.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Limitations of diagrams</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Diagrams do not give accurate result but rough ideas.</li>
                            <li>A technical man can construct a diagram so a common man cannot do it correctly.</li>
                            <li>Comparisons of diagrams cannot be made of the unit not common or the phenomena is not the same.</li>
                            <li>They can be misused very easily.</li>
                            <li>This method of data presentation is very expensive.</li>

                            <li>The diagrams should be neat and clean so that they may have an attractive impression on the mind of the reader.</li>
                            <li>A brief heading on the top of the diagram should be given so that the reader may create an idea about the diagram before he studies it. The relative data should be given near diagram so it can give a correct view.</li>
                            <li>The scale to be used should be suitable and mentioned on the right hand top or left hand bottom.</li>
                            <li>All types of symbols used should be explained.</li>

                        <h3>Bar charts</h3>
                        <p>This is a means of presenting information visually by drawing bars that represent specific data frequency. All charts have common principles of constructing.</p>
                        <h4>General principles of bar charts construction:</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>It should have a clear title.</li>
                            <li>Scale used should be indicated clearly.</li>
                            <li>Show the attribute (quality) or variable (quantity) on the horizontal axis (x-axis).</li>
                            <li>Frequencies should be appear in the vertical axis (Y-axis).</li>
                            <li>The height of the bars should be proportional to the frequencies.</li>
                            <li>The source of information should be indicated normally as footnotes.</li>
                            <li>The axis should be clearly labelled either X or Y axis.</li>
                            <li>The Y axis should be 3/4 of the length of X -axis.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Simple bar charts</h4>
                        <p>This type of charts are used to present data which has been presented in a simple table. The height of each bar indicates the size of the figure represented. The width of the bars is not taken into account and it should be uniform for all bars. The number of bars depend on the number of figures.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Multiple component bar chart.</h4>
                        <p>The component figures are shown as separate bar charts adjoining each other. The height of each bar represents the actual value of this component figure. They are useful if we have two or more sets of comparable data and wish to compare and contrast them.</p>

                        <h4>Component/Sectional bar chart</h4>
                        <p>This is also called subdivided bar diagrams. Instead of placing the bars for each component side by side we may place these one on top of the other. Each bar is subdivided into two or more components across the years.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Percentage/Component bar charts</h4>
                        <p>These are component bar charts that show percentage component parts of the total instead of actual parts and actual totals of the bar. The length of the bar represents the percentage of the total. It will therefore be 100% and a series of pull bars will have the same height.</p>

                        <h4>Advantages of bar charts.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>They are easy to construct.</li>
                            <li>They can depict data more accurately.</li>
                            <li>They can be used to indicate the sizes of component figures.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Disadvantages.</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>They are not more informative.</li>
                            <li>They are restricted to three or four component figures only.</li>

                        <p>A pie-chart is a circle divided by radial lines into sections so that the area of each section is proportional to the size of the figure represented. A pie chart is particularly useful where it's desired to show the relative proportions of the figures that are obtained to make up a single overall total.</p>
                        <p>In order to construct a sub-divided circle, first find out the various angles which represent the various sectors by the following formula;</p>
                        <p>Angle of each component is equal to component divided by total components times 360 degrees.</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>In 2004, medical clinic had 80000 patients, surgical had 60000 patients and pediatrics had 50000 patients. Present the information of a pie chart.</p>

                        <p>To understand how to draw the above graphs its important to note the following terms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>a. Class interval:</b> A set of classes that are used to define the raw data or size of the group chosen. It can be determined by finding the dary of the raw data obtained and dividing it by the value of number of classes we desire to have.</li>
                            <li><b>b. Class limit:</b> These are the end number of class interval. The lower value for class interval is called lower class limit while the upper value for class interval is called upper class limit.</li>
                            <li><b>c. Class boundaries:</b> Class boundaries are easily gotten by subtracting 0.5 from the lower class limit or lower value of class interval and adding 0.5 to upper class limit or upper value of class interval e.g 20-29 will be 19.5-29.5.</li>
                            <li><b>d. Class width:</b> This is the size of the class interval and it's obtained by subtracting lower class boundaries from upper class boundaries e.g 19.5-29.5 the class width will be 29.5-19.5=10</li>
                            <li><b>e. Class mark:</b> This is the mid-point or value of the class interval. It can be derived by adding lower and upper class limit and dividing by 2 or adding lower and upper class boundaries and dividing the sum by 2.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Histogram</h4>
                        <p>Its graph in which class boundaries or class interval is marked on the horizontal axis and the corresponding class frequency on the vertical axis. It assumes continuous data.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Frequency polygon</h4>
                        <p>Are very useful if we want to compare two distributions. This is a graph that joins the mid-point of the tops of column of the histogram through straight lines. To draw a frequency polygon, there is need to obtain class mark (mid-point) for each class boundary against the corresponding frequency. The points to draw frequency polygon will be joined with the help of a ruler. Sometimes its used to derive mode.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Frequency polygon curve</h4>
                        <p>It can be drawn on the same lines as frequency polygon but the mid-point at the height of class interval rectangles will be joined smoothly. The difference between frequency polygon and frequency curve is joining the points.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cumulative frequency curve</h4>
                        <p>An ogive is the name given to the curve obtained when the cumulative frequencies of a distribution are graphed. Its also called cumulative frequency curve.</p>
