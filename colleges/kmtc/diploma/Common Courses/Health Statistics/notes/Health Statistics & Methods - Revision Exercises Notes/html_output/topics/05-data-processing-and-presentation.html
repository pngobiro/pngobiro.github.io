                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A systematic way in which to condense extensive data sets in to smaller analyzable units through the creation of categories and concepts derived from data.</p>
                        <p>When data have been collected in research they have to edited and coded in a numerical form ready to be summarized to table, charts, diagram or grouped into frequencies before calculations are made.</p>

                        <h3>Levels of Coding</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Open:</b> Breakdown compare and categorize data.</li>
                            <li><b>AXIAL:</b> Make connections with categories after open coding</li>
                            <li><b>SELECTIVE:</b> Select the core category, relate it to other categories and confirm the explanation to those relationships.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why coding</h3>
                        <p>It lets you make sense of and analyze your data.</p>
                        <p>For qualitative studies it can have you generate a general theory. The type of statistical analysis you can use depends on the type data you collect, how you collect it and how its coded.</p>
                        <p>Coding facilitates the organisation, retrieval and interpretation of data and leads to conclusions on the basis of that interpretation.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It's the examination or scrutiny of the collected data in order to find out mistakes, errors and omissions. The aspects of accuracy, approximation and errors are analyzed.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Accuracy</h3>
                        <p>It involves describing a phenomenon exactly as it is. Absolute or perfect accuracy cannot be obtained therefore in statistics relative accuracy is required and not absolute.</p>
                        <p>The degree of accuracy depends on the nature and purpose of inquiry and also on the materials of measurement. E.g when measuring the height of men and women it should be accurate up to inches or centimeters and while measuring the length between two cities it should be accurate up to kilometer.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Approximation</h3>
                        <p>This is the basis of rounding off the figures with a view to simplify them thus affecting the standard of reasonable accuracy.</p>
                        <p>There are 3 methods of rounding:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Round up</li>
                            <li>Round down</li>
                            <li>Round to the nearest whole number.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the last figure is > 5, then 1 is added to the last significant figure e.g if 25.268 rounded to two decimal places it will be 25.27</p>
                        <p>If the last figure < 5 then last significant figure is taken as it is e.g if 25.263 rounded to two decimal places then it will be 25.26.</p>
                        <p>If the last figure is 5 then 1 can be added to the last significant figure or it can be taken as it is. e.g of 25.265 is to be rounded off two decimal places, then it can be taken as 25.27 or 25.26. its correct in both ways.</p>
                        <p>If a figure is rounded to the nearest whole figure in thousands then the portion being left is ignored if it's less than 500, next higher figure in thousands is taken, if it's more than 500 and so on. E.g</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>15,856,432 -> 15,856,000</li>
                            <li>15,856,854 -> 15,857,000</li>
                            <li>15,856,500 -> 15,857,000 or 15,856,000</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Errors</h3>
                        <p>The word error has a special meaning in statistics. We can distinguish between mistake and error.</p>
                        <p>A mistake, means incorrect presentation or man factors. Can occur in the collection of the data. E.g the respondent may have mistakenly ticked the 'yes' box instead of 'no' box.</p>
                        <p>An error means the difference between the actual figures. The deviation is just by chance and it's not due to carelessness of human beings.</p>
                        <p>Normally the errors arise due to rounding off or approximation.</p>

                        <h4>Main sources of statistical errors</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><b>Errors of origin:</b> They crop up due to faulty definition of the units, bias or erratic trends in the data.</li>
                            <li><b>Errors of inadequacy:</b> Errors due to inadequacy of samples or incomplete information.</li>
                            <li><b>Errors of manipulation:</b> Errors which result while measuring, weighing and counting unconsciously.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Types of errors</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Sampling errors:</b> The difference between the estimates of a value as obtained from the sample and the actual value. Even when the sample is chosen in a correct manner, it cannot exactly be representative of the population from which it's chosen because all samples will not be similar. The amount of the sample error will depend on the size of the sample. The greater the size of the sample the smaller the size of sampling errors and vice versa.</li>
                            <li><b>Non- sampling errors:</b> Those errors which take place when samples are not selected at random. When a sample is chosen at random, it cannot be exactly representative of the population from which it's chosen. The difference between the characteristics of a sample is known as sample error. When the errors arise due to other reasons, those are known as non-sampling errors. Non-sampling errors may arise due to the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. Biased behaviour</li>
                                    <li>b. Haphazard selection.</li>
                                    <li>c. Failure to cover all items.</li>
                                    <li>d. The use of approximate or estimated values</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Biased errors:</b> These errors arise due to the bias on the part of investigator, enumerator or instrument etc. They are of cumulative in nature. E.g the instrument is more or less than actual or the investigator ignores some digits with giving any weight/reason etc.</li>
                            <li><b>Unbiased errors:</b> These errors arise by chance in the usual course. These are of compensatory nature because positive and negative errors cancel each other and mostly the estimated value is just equal to true and actual value.</li>
                            <li><b>Positive and negative errors:</b> Errors may be positive or negative if the true value is greater than estimated value, the error is said to be positive, on the other hand, if it's less then it's said to be negative.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Measurement of errors</h4>
                        <p>Errors can be measured either absolutely or relatively</p>
                        <h5>a. Absolute error</h5>
                        <p>This is the difference between the actual value and estimated value.</p>
                        <p>Ae = A - E</p>
                        <p>Where;<br>
                        Ae = Absolute error.<br>
                        A = Actual Value<br>
                        E = Estimated Value</p>
                        <p>e.g Assume the population of a town was estimated as 1,424,880 whereas the actual population was 1,578,620.</p>
                        <p>Ae = 1,578,620 - 1,424,880 = 153,740.</p>
                        
                        <h5>b. Relative error</h5>
                        <p>This the ratio between absolute error and actual value.</p>
                        <p>Re = Ae / A</p>
                        <p>Where: Re = relative error</p>
                        <p>Using the above example calculate relative error</p>
                        <p>Re = 153,740 / 1,578,620 = 0.097</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Note</h4>
                            <p>Relative error gives an indication of how good a measurement is relative to the size of the thing being measured.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Relative error can be converted to a percentage. The % error is the % of absolute error. Eg</p>
                        <p>% error = (153,740 * 100) / 1,578,620 = 9.7%</p>

                        <p>After the data has been collected, they must be organized or sorted in a form which they are easily understood. The organisation of data refers to the classification and tabulation of data.</p>
                        <p>The collected data are mostly large in quantity and its necessary to organize the data in such a way that further analysis and interpretation of data are made easily and correctly.</p>
                        <p>Before the tabulation of data takes place, it's necessary to classify the data into homogeneous groups.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Classification of data</h3>
                        <p>It means the act of arranging the data in groups or classes according to some resemblance of the data in each group or class.</p>
                        <p>In classification of data, the elements which posses the same characteristics are grouped in one class. In this way, the whole data is divided into a number of classes.</p>
                        <p>L.R Connor has defined classification as 'the process of arranging things in groups or classes according to their resemblances and affinities (natural liking for or attraction to a person, thing, idea etc). Thus classification is the sorting of the data into homogeneous groups according to their observed characteristics.</p>
                        <p>It's the process of keeping data with common characteristics together i.e data concerning males, females, children age groupings need to be put separately from others.</p>
                        <p>This enables one to analyze data concerning a specific character or items more easily. This means its important to know what items go together when you have classified information.</p>
                        <p>There are two main ways of classifying items from the questionnaire or data collection instrument. They are classified in terms of variable (quantitative) or an attribute (qualitative) data.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Quantitative classification:</b> It refers to the classification of data according to some characteristics that can be measured such as height, weight, age etc. in this, data are classified by assigning arbitrary limits called class-limits.</li>
                            <li><b>Qualitative classification:</b> Classification made according to some attribute or quality such as sex, literacy, religion etc.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Other classification</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><b>Temporary classification:</b> Classification with respect to time is called temporary classification.</li>
                            <li><b>Spatial classification:</b> When classification is made with respect to places e.g production of sugarcane in Kenya region wise or production of tea in different areas.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Classification may be further divided as under;</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><b>Simplified classification:</b> Simplified classification is that type of classification in which data are divided into two classes e.g persons may be divided into males and females or literate and illiterates. Data is divided into or according to one criterion.</li>
                            <li><b>Manifold classification:</b> Manifold classification is that type of classification when data is divided into a number of classes and sub-classes. E.g the population of Kenya may be classified as males and females. Again, males and females may be further sub-divided into male literate and female literates. These may be further sub-divided according to their professions. In this case, data are classified according to various criteria.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>To eliminate unnecessary details.</li>
                            <li>To bring out clearly points of similarities and dissimilarities.</li>
                            <li>To enable one to intake comparisons and draw inferences.</li>
                            <li>To reflect the important aspects of the data.</li>
                            <li>To utilize the data for further statistical analysis.</li>

                        <h3>Organisation of data</h3>
                        <p>The process of organization the raw data into a compact and readily comprehensible form known as data summary.</p>
                        <p>Data summary involves the preparation of two kinds of tables i.e</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Frequency distribution table</li>
                            <li>Contingency tables (age and sex) - relationship between two or more variables.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Before these tables can be prepared, the raw data needs to be sorted using any of the simplest methods of sorting data such as: a) hand tally b) hand sorting c) sorting coded information (use of computer programming).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Tabulation of data</h3>
                        <p>The systematic arrangement of the statistical data in columns and raws.</p>
                        <p>The main advantages of the tabulation is that a mass of data which is confusing is presented in a logical sequence giving the shape of statistical tables which answers all the questions of the problem under investigation.</p>
                        <p>It's the process between the collection of data and its final analysis. It prepares the ground for the analysis and interpretation of data.</p>
                        <p>It's the process in which information is extracted from either the questionnaire, interview schedule or classified data and entering it on separate summary sheet.</p>

                        <h4>Purpose</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It simplifies the details from different classifications so that salient features on the data are obtained/seen.</li>
                            <li>It facilitates the interpretation of the assembled data.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Advantages of tabulation</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tabulated data can be understood easily as compared to data given in narrative form.</li>
                            <li>The comparisons between different classes of data can be made easily.</li>
                            <li>The required data can easily be located.</li>
                            <li>The unnecessary details are avoided.</li>
                            <li>Tabulated data takes less space.</li>

                        <p>The format of a table depends upon the nature of data and purpose of constructing a table. A table should be constructed in such a way that it achieves its purpose in a best manner.</p>
                        <p>The following principles should be followed:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The table should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.</li>
                            <li>Each table should have a comprehensive explanatory title. It should be clear and if too long, it should be made shorter by including sub-titles.</li>
                            <li>The size of the table should be suitable.</li>
                            <li>The source of data must be stated. Usually given as footnotes.</li>
                            <li>The headings to columns and rows should be clear.</li>
                            <li>The sub-totals for each separate class of data and grand total for all combined classes must be given, where appropriate.</li>
                            <li>The columns whose data are going to be compared should be placed in adjacent columns or rows.</li>
                            <li>The units of measurement should be clearly mentioned or stated.</li>
                            <li>The total of the rows should be given in the extreme right column and the total at the foot.</li>
                            <li>If certain figures are to be given some importance, they should be placed in a box or cycle.</li>
                            <li>If some portion of the collected data cannot be classified into any class then they should be taken into a separate row or column under the heading miscellaneous.</li>
                            <li>If the footnotes are necessary in a table then they should be short, clear and precise.</li>
                            <li>Thick lines should be drawn to separate one class of data from the other and thin lines to separate sub-divisions of classes.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>In January 2006, a firm employed 90 staff of whom 79 were men. During the year 17 staff left and 13 were men. The total recruitment during the year was 13 out of whom 3 were women.</p>
                        <p>During 2007, wastage declined by 3 among men compared with 2006 and no women left, 6 more men but fewer women were recruited than in the previous year. The total number employed in 1st year 2008 amounted to 93.</p>

                        <h3>Array presentation</h3>
                        <p>This is the arrangement of a group of data in a pleasing way so that they are in order. When you are conducting an investigation you will reach a stage when you will have several figures referring to different classifications. When these figures are written down the way they were obtained from the original classification, they are referred to as an array.</p>

                        <h3>Frequency distribution</h3>
                        <p>When the statistical data is grouped according to size or magnitude, the series formed is known as frequency distribution which generally consists of class interval and their corresponding frequencies.</p>

                        <h4>Number of classes</h4>
                        <p>The number of classes in a frequency distribution depends upon the number of items of a series. A frequency distribution should not have less than 6-8 classes and should not have more than 20-25 classes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Class interval</h4>
                        <p>To find out the class interval deduct the minimum value from the maximum value (range) and divide by the Number of classes or groups. The class intervals of different classes should be equal. If they are not equal then these will give misleading results.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Example</h5>
                        <p>Suppose the maximum value is 100 and minimum value is 20 and desired number of classes is 8. Calculate the class interval?</p>
                        <p>Range = maximum - minimum = 100 - 20 = 80</p>
                        <p>Class interval = range/no. of classes = 80 / 8 = 10</p>
