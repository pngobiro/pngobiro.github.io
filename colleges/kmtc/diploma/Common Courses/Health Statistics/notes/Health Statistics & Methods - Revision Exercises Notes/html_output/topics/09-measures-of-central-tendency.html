                        <p>It's very difficult to understand the mass of data. In order to get a concise and complete picture of large data its essential to obtain a figure which should represent the whole data. By the help of such a figure, the data are compared and understood easily. A figure which represents the whole data is known as an average or a measure of central tendency. An average removes all the unnecessary details of the data and gives a concise picture of the huge data under investigation.</p>

                        <h3>Qualities of a good average</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It should be rigidly defined.</li>

                            <li>It should be easily understood and calculated.</li>
                            <li>It should be least affected by the fluctuations of sampling.</li>
                            <li>It should be capable of further algebraic or statistical Rx.</li>
                            <li>It should be least affected by extreme values.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Arithmetic mean or simple average</li>

                        <h4>Ungrouped data - Direct method</h4>
                        <p><b>Example:</b> Kisii level 5 has got the following cases over a period of 5 months: 75, 55, 48, 72, 60. Find the average of malaria cases.</p>

                        <p>This is the value of middle item of a series when these items are arranged in ascending or descending order. The formula for finding median item is $(n+1)/2$, where n = number of items.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Computation of the median</h3>
                        <h4>Continuous series</h4>
                        <p>In order to calculate the median of the continuous frequency distribution, the value of the median lies in a class interval.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ Median = L + \frac{i}{f}(m-c) $$</div>

                        f = frequency of the median group <br>

                        c = cumulative frequency of the group preceding the median group.</p>

                        <h3>Obtaining median graphically</h3>
                        <p>A cumulative frequency curve is drawn. A horizontal line is drawn from the median item on the y-axis to the curve. From the intersection point, a vertical line is drawn to the x-axis. The point on the x-axis is the median.</p>

                        <p>In a symmetrical distribution the mean, mode and median coincide are the same. A distribution which is not symmetrical is either asymmetrical or moderate asymmetrical. In a highly asymmetrical distribution, its impossible to forecast the relationship between the averages. In a moderately asymmetrical distribution, the median would be somewhere between the mean and mode. Usually in such a distribution, the difference between the mean and the median is one third of the difference between the mean and mode.</p>
                        <p>Therefore:</p>
                        <p>Median = Mean - 1/3(Mean - Mode)</p>
