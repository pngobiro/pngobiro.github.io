                        <p>This is any quality that can have a number of values which may be either discrete or continuous. It's a property that can take on different values. It's any attribute, property or gender that changes.</p>
                        <p>It therefore refers to all those characteristics of people, events, objects or situations that change e.g students in a class may differ in sex, age, intelligence, height etc. These properties are variables.</p>
                        <p>Therefore variables could vary in quality and quantity.</p>

                        <h3>Type of variables</h3>

                        <h4>a. Organismic variables</h4>
                        <p>They are human oriented independent variables e.g gender (sex) or age.</p>

                        <h4>b. Qualitative variables</h4>
                        <p>This type of variable differs in terms of quality (kind). They are classified according to that attribute (quality or characteristics) e.g gender, nationality, social economic status, academic qualification, marital status etc. Taste can be classified as salt, sour. Smell can be classified as odour, pungent.</p>

                        <h4>c. Quantitative variables</h4>
                        <p>This variables assumes values that vary in terms of magnitude. They differ by how much or how many thus means they can be given numerical basis. They are very easy to measure/count and compare with others e.g weight, height, age, distance, marks obtained in a test etc.</p>
                        <p>Quantitative values can be sub-divided into:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i. Continuous variables</li>
                            <li>ii. Discrete variables.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>i. Continuous variables</h5>
                        <p>These are variables that can take any value (within a certain range) and are not therefore restricted.</p>
                        <p>They are characterized by being related to some numerical scale of measurement, any interval of which may of desired, be an infinite number (any number that contains an endless line of digits after a decimal point). E.g length, height, weight, temperature, volume, time etc. because they take fractions or decimals e.g $51/2 \mathrm{ft}, 2.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ etc.</p>

                        <h5>ii. Discrete variables</h5>
                        <p>They are variables that can take finite or defined (whole numbers). They can be counted or for which there is a fixed set of values e.g $1,2,3,4$ and not $1.2, 2.5, 3.5$ etc.</p>
                        
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Independent variables</h3>
                        <p>These are variables that can be manipulated or treated. The effect is reflected on the dependent variable. The value of the dependent variable thus depends on that of the independent variable. It's a variable that which is subject to the researcher e.g a pupil's performance (y) depends on age (x).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Y-dependent variable</li>
                            <li>X-independent variable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bumper harvest depends on the rainfall.</p>
                        <p>Note that in graphing, the dependent variable is placed on the vertical (y-axis) while the independent variable is placed on the horizontal (x-axis).</p>

                        <h3>Dependent variable</h3>
                        <p>These are variables where the effects of independent variable are felt/seen (the one being influenced) e.g rational use of medicine depends on educational level, occupational or socioeconomic status.</p>

                        <h3>Distribution</h3>
                        <p>This is the arrangement of a set of numbers classified according to some properties or attributes such as age, height, weight etc.</p>

                        <h3>Population</h3>
                        <p>This is any defined whole set of people, situations or objects. The definition of a population is done in terms of certain characteristics, e.g if there are 100 students in health records class, we say the population size is 100. This measurement is of interest representing the aggregate of units to be covered which could be finite of infinite. When the population can be easily counted then its said to be finite e.g the number of contestants for a political post but if the population under consideration is large e.g the grain of sand, then we say it's infinite.</p>

                        <h3>Sample</h3>
                        <p>This is a sub-set of a population. It's a sub-group or sub-aggregate draw from the population. i.e the proportion appropriately selected out of the population by the same statistical method of observation. It's a small set of a population. It's a group of items or part of a population selected to represent such a population in a statistical investigation.</p>
                        <p>A sample must be representative of the target population. It must have all or most of the characteristics of the population.</p>

                        <h3>Sampling frame</h3>
                        <p>Refers to a list of all items that constitute a given population e.g voters register may be used as a sampling frame for the voting population.</p>

                        <h3>Large sample</h3>
                        <p>This is the sample with more than thirty items.</p>

                        <h3>Small sample</h3>
                        <p>This is the sample with less than thirty items.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Note</h4>
                            <p>The size of your sample depends on the size of your population. The larger the population, the larger the sample size should be. It should be proportional to the population to reduce sampling error.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Parameter</h3>
                        <p>Any numerical value describing a characteristic of a population. It's a situation when mean (average), standard deviation or variance of a population are computed for statistical analysis. Its any number or value calculated from the data of a population.</p>

                        <h3>Statistic</h3>
                        <p>This refers to a descriptive measure of a sample i.e a numerical value or function computed to describe a sample of a population.</p>

                        <h3>Constant</h3>
                        <p>It's the opposite of variable, therefore it does not vary (change).</p>
