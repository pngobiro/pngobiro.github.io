                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    
                    <h3 id="direct-measurement">i. Direct measurement</h3>
                    <p>Where the information can be measured or counted. We can arrange for ourselves or someone else to take the necessary measurements directly and using the 3<sup>rd</sup> party influence. This method has the distinct advantage that accurate measurements can be obtained.<br>
                    It can however turn out to be very time consuming and costly if misused.</p>

                    <h3 id="experimentation">ii. Experimentation</h3>
                    <p>It's a method where a particular Rx is given to the population or the people to determine the effect it has on the population. E.g applying fertilizer on different crops to determine their yields etc.</p>

                    <h3 id="observation">iii. Observation.</h3>
                    <p>It involves watching or counting events as they happen.<br>
                    It involves getting data when investigation concerns attitude and behaviour.<br>
                    Its applicable when all other methods cannot be effectively used due to the situation.<br>
                    Data can be obtained by either directly or indirectly. Its sometimes referred to as participatory or non-participatory.</p>

                    <h4 id="direct-participatory-observation">a) Direct/participatory observation.</h4>
                    <p>The investigator goes to the study situation and behaves like the respondent.<br>
                    For instance, if you are carrying out an investigation on alcoholic behaviour, you will go and mix with alcoholics in their drinking places and behave like them recording your observations.<br>
                    Respondents may or may not know that you are there as an investigator.<br>
                    Another example can be taken from (CID) who does a passive but participatory role in data collection.<br>
                    The observer may ask a series of questions informally or administer a test.</p>

                    <h4 id="indirect-non-participatory-observation">b) Indirect/ non participatory observation</h4>
                    <p>In this method, the respondent is observed through a device e.g through one way mirror, tape recorders, cameras, closed circuits or even a key hole.<br>
                    In most cases the respondent is not aware that he is being observed.</p>

                    <h3 id="interviewing">iv. Interviewing</h3>
                    <p>This is a method of data collection in which you or your assistant conducts an interview conversation with respondents while completing a pre-designed interview schedule.<br>
                    There are advantages and disadvantages of conducting the interview by yourself or employing an interviewer.</p>

                    <h4>Advantages of interviewing by investigator:</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Information collected will be more accurate as the investigator knows the limitation of the population or sample to be interviewed.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Reduces chances of wrong recording of information by the investigator is more knowledgeable about the investigation than the interviewer.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Disadvantages of interviewing by investigator.</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">It takes more time for one person to conduct all interviews with respondents and therefore time may not allow you to do it by yourself.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">It cannot be used in some cases because of the cost. This is particularly when conducting large surveys e.g census.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Advantages of interviewing by assistant</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Information will be collected faster than when the investigator is doing it alone.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">It's possible to cover a large area within a short time.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">It may be less expensive when the data generated is compared with the volume of data generated by investigator.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Disadvantages.</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Information collected may not be as accurate as the one the investigator collects, this is because the interviewer may misinterpret the questions wrongly when conducting the interview.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">The assistant may record the information wrongly taking the editing session very difficult and expensive.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="questionnaire">v. Questionnaire</h3>
                    <p>This is where an investigator/interviewer has a set of questions (the questionnaires), designed questions which he/she administers to the respondent (the person chosen to be in the sample).<br>
                    It has the advantages that the results can be obtained quickly and reliably. Due to high response rate obtained when using this method, its usually considered the most effective way of obtaining data.<br>
                    This method is subdivided into 3 parts;</p>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>By post</li>
                        <li>Face to face interview</li>
                        <li>By phone.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>1. Post.</h4>
                    <p>The questions are sent to the respondent through the post office, the respondent fills the questions and posts back.<br>
                    It requires that:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">Write an introduction letter</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Give an explanation on how questions should be answered.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii.</span><span class="item-text">A statement that ensures the respondent that the information given by them will be treated highly confidential.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iv.</span><span class="item-text">Enclose a stamp and addressed envelope for return postage.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Advantages of postal questionnaires</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Can be sent to a very large no. of people in the population at a low cost.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">There is no risk of bias or mistake that can originate from the interviewer.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Disadvantages of postal questionnaires</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Low proportion of returns. Postal enquiries are commonly used by government because they have the power to make it compulsory for the questions to be returned.</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Can only be used in collection of limited factual data such as figures or dates.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>The method of data collection that you need to use depends on:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Available resources that include money, man power and time. However the method that gives you the best results utilizing the available resources to its maximum. The method therefore should enable you to conclude your investigation effectively.</li>
                            <li>A through consideration of advantages and disadvantages should be considered so that you can apply the method that has less disadvantages.</li>

                    <p>This is any quality that can have a number of values which may be either discrete or continuous. It's a property that can take on different values. It's any attribute, property or gender that changes.</p>
                    <p>It therefore refers to all those characteristics of people, events, objects or situations that change e.g students in a class may differ in sex, age, intelligence, height etc. These properties are variables.</p>
                    <p>Therefore variables could vary in quality and quantity.</p>

                    <h3>Type of variables</h3>
                    
                    <h4>a. Organismic variables</h4>
                    <p>They are human oriented independent variables e.g gender (sex) or age.</p>

                    <h4>b. Qualitative variables</h4>
                    <p>This type of variable differs in terms of quality (kind).<br>
                    They are classified according to that attribute (quality or characteristics) e.g gender, nationality, social economic status, academic qualification, marital status etc.<br>
                    Taste can be classified as salt, sour.<br>
                    Smell can be classified as odour, pungent.</p>

                    <h4>c. Quantitative variables</h4>
                    <p>This variables assumes values that vary in terms of magnitude. They differ by how much or how many thus means they can be given numerical basis.<br>
                    They are very easy to measure/count and compare with others e.g weight, height, age, distance, marks obtained in a test etc.<br>
                    Quantitative values can be sub-divided into:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">Continuous variables</span></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Discrete variables.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>i. Continuous variables</h5>
                    <p>These are variables that can take any value (within a certain range) and are not therefore restricted.</p>
                    <p>They are characterized by being related to some numerical scale of measurement, any interval of which may of desired, be an infinite number (any number that contains an endless line of digits after a decimal point). E.g length, height, weight, temperature, volume, time etc. because they take fractions or decimals e.g 51/2 ft, 2.6kg etc.</p>

                    <h5>ii. Discrete variables</h5>
                    <p>They are variables that can take finite or defined (whole numbers)<br>
                    They can be counted or for which there is a fixed set of values e.g 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1.2, 21/2, 31/2 etc</p>

                    <h4>Independent variables</h4>
                    <p>These are variables that can be manipulated or treated.<br>
                    The effect is reflected on the dependent variable. The value of the dependent variable thus depends on that of the independent variable. It's a variable that which is subject to the researcher e.g a pupil's performance (y) depends on age (x).</p>
                    <p>Y-dependent variable<br>
                    X-independent variable<br>
                    Bumper harvest depends on the rainfall.<br>
                    Note that in graphing, the dependent variable is placed on the vertical ( y -axis) while the independent variable is placed on the horizontal ( x -axis).</p>

                    <h4>Dependent variable</h4>
                    <p>These are variables where the effects of independent variable are felt/seen (the one being influenced) e.g rational use of medicine depends on educational level, occupational or socioeconomic status.</p>

                    <h3>Definitions</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><dfn>Distribution</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>This is the arrangement of a set of numbers classified according to some properties or attributes such as age, height, weight etc.</dd>

                        <dt><dfn>Population</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>This is any defined whole set of people, situations or objects. The definition of a populatin is done in terms of certain characteristics e,g if there are 100 students in health records class, we say the population size is 100. This measurement is of interest representing the aggregate of units to be covered which could be finite of infinite. When the population can be easily counted then its said to be finite e.g the number of contestants for a political post but if the population under consideration is large e.g the grain of sand, then we say it's infinite.</dd>

                        <dt><dfn>Sample</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>This is a sub-set of a population. It's a sub-group or sub-aggregate draw from the population. i.e the proportion appropriately selected out of the population by the same statistical method of observation. It's a small set of a population. It's a group of items or part of a population selected to represent such a population in a statistical investigation.<br>
                        A sample must be representative of the target population. It must have all or most of the characteristics of the population.</dd>

                        <dt><dfn>Sampling frame</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>Refers to a list of all items that constitute a given population e.g voters register may be used as a sampling frame for the voting population.</dd>

                        <dt><dfn>Large sample</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>This is the sample with more than thirty items.</dd>

                        <dt><dfn>Small sample</dfn></dt>
                        <dd>This is the sample with less than thirty items.<br>
                        N/B: the size of your sample depends on the size of your population. The larger the population, the larger the sample size should be. It should be proportional to the population to reduce sampling error.</dd>

                    <h3 id="questionnaire-details">i. Questionnaire</h3>
                    <p>This is a research instrument that gathers data over a large sample. Each item in the questionnaire is developed to address each specific objective.<br>
                    A questionnaire that is well thought of saves time. There is no opportunity for interview bias and can cover a wide area.<br>
                    Open-ended questionnaires can generate large amount of data that can take long time to process and analyze.</p>

                    <h4>Advantages</h4>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Large amount of information can be collected from a large no of people in a short period of time and in a relatively cost effective way.</li>
                        <li>Can be carried out by the researcher or by any no. of people with a limited effect to its validity and reliability.</li>
                        <li>The results of the questionnaire can usually be quickly and easily quantified by either a researcher or through the use of software package.</li>
                        <li>Can be analyzed more scientifically and objectively than other forms of research.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>They may confuse the respondent as to the nature of the information required. The respondent will not answer right as he does not know the purpose of the study.</li>
                        <li>May discourage respondents to the extent of discarding the questionnaires.</li>
                        <li>May leave important information required in the study; some of the questions may be omitted. The respondent may not understand the question well or was bored.</li>
                        <li>Response rates can be very low, the respondents will not post back the questionnaires.</li>
                        <li>The participants may forget important issues because they occur after the event.</li>
                        <li>Questionnaire is standardized so its not possible to explain any points in the question that participants might mis-interpret. This could be partially solved by piloting.</li>
                        <li>There is no direct contact so the researcher cannot deal with any other misunderstanding.</li>
                        <li>There is no opportunity for the researcher to ask for further information or probe deeper to the answers given to the respondents.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>There are two broad categories of questions that are used in the questionnaires</p>
                    <p>a. Structured or close ended.<br>
                    b. Unstructured or open-ended</p>

                    <h4>Structured</h4>
                    <p>These are questions which are accompanied by a list of all possible answers from which the respondents select the answer that describes their situation.<br>
                    Leave allowance for others e.g others (specify)</p>

                    <h5>Advantages.</h5>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Saves time for the researcher. Economical to use in terms time and money.</li>
                        <li>The researcher gets the information he requires.</li>
                        <li>It's easier to analyze since they are in an immediate usable form.</li>
                        <li>It's simple for the respondent to understand.</li>
                        <li>They are easier to administer because each item is followed by an alternative answers.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Disadvantages.</h5>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>It's difficult to construct because the answers must be well thought of.</li>
                        <li>Responses are limited and the respondents are compelled to answer questions according to the researcher's choices.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Unstructured</h4>
                    <p>This refers to questions that give the respondent complete freedom of expressions. These free expressions permit an individual/respondent to use his or her own words.</p>

                    <h5>Advantages.</h5>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Are simple to formulate because the researcher does not have to labour to come up with appropriate response categories.</li>
                        <li>The respondent's responses may give an insight into his feelings, background, hidden motivation, interests and decisions.</li>
                        <li>It gives the researcher the real feelings or picture of the respondents.</li>
                        <li>It gives respondent's freedom to excess him/herself in his/her own words.</li>
                        <li>It saves time for the researcher.</li>
                        <li>Can stimulate the respondent to think and express what he/she considers most important.</li>
                        <li>It permits a greater depth of the respondent when the respondent is allowed to give a personal response usually reasons for the response given may be directly or indirectly included.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h5>Disadvantages.</h5>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>It's time consuming for the respondent.</li>
                        <li>It's tedious and cumbersome for the researcher to compile the responses.</li>
                        <li>There is tendency to provide information that does not answer the stipulated research questions or objectives.</li>
                        <li>Responding to open ended questions is time consuming. This may put off some respondents.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Contingency questions</h4>
                    <p>These are follow up questions needed to get further information from the relevant sample. These questions probe for more information. They also simplify the respondent's task in that they will not be required to answer questions that are not relevant to them.</p>

                    <h4>Matrix questions</h4>
                    <p>These are questions that share the same set of response categories e.g<br>
                    Were the learning objectives achieved?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Agree</li>
                        <li>Do not agree</li>
                        <li>No</li>
                        <li>Uncertain</li>
                        <li>Strongly disagree</li>
                        <li>Strongly agree</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Time for lecture is well distributed?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Strongly agree</li>
                        <li>Agree</li>
                        <li>Uncertain</li>
                        <li>Disagree</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Circle a number to represent your response.</p>

                    <h5>Advantages</h5>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Simple to answer.</span></li>

                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">Some respondents especially the ones that may not be too keen to give the right responses might form a pattern of agree or disagree with the statement.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Rules/principals for constructing a questionnaire/design.</h4>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>List the objectives that you want the questionnaire to accomplish. This will help in writing the questions, since questions are related to objectives.</li>
                        <li>Clarity is essential/important. Terms like several, must, because have no precise meaning and they should therefore be avoided.</li>
                        <li>The questions are focused and are limited to single idea. i.e short questions should be used as they are easier to understand. They should be short and clear e.g have you gone for VCT and how often?</li>
                        <li>Double barreled questions should be avoided. Questions that have more than two meanings yet allows for one answer e.g Do you think that students should have more classes about history and culture? What motivates your work? Pleasant work and nice coworkers.</li>
                        <li>Leading or biased questions should be avoided e.g asking for the gender of a child-like is he a boy when you see by yourself. Were you at the KCs bar on the night of 15<sup>th</sup>?</li>
                        <li>Very personal and sensitive questions should be avoided as the respondent may be dishonest in answering them.</li>
                        <li>Simple words that are easily understandable should be used. Difficult words that are not familiar will discourage the respondent. Avoid jagon words e.g short hand etc.</li>
                        <li>Questions that assume facts with no evidence should be avoided. Such questions offend and discourage the respondent. e.g asking a mother if she affords formula milk for breastfeeding by looking at her social class. This may discourage her to respond. You got HIV because you were unfaithful.</li>
                        <li>Avoid psychologically threatening questions e.g asking a mother, are you afraid that your child who is HIV positive is about to die?</li>
                    </ol>

                        <p>This is a data collection tool which is very much like questionnaire. The little difference is that the tool is filled by the enumerator/investigator/researcher/interviewer who are specially appointed for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>N/B: In certain situations the tool may be handed over to the respondent and the enumerator helps in recording the answers.</p>
                        <p>Enumerator explains the aims and also removes the difficulties which the respondent may fail in understanding the definition or concept of difficult times.</p>

                        <h4>Principles of interview schedule design</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Open-ended interviews</h5>
                        <p>Designed to be flexible and to allow the respondent to use his/her own words.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The first question must confirm that the potential respondent is aware of the purposes and the scope of the interview, the amount of time it will take, and the way the responses will be used e.g addressing confidentiality issues.</li>
                            <li>Address whether or not the responses will be recorded. Recording responses has the advantage that all materials are captured but the disadvantage that many respondents may speak less freely if they are being recorded obtain a consent before recording.</li>
                            <li>It must contain questions that will answer the research questions.</li>
                            <li>It must not contain questions that are not related to the research questions.</li>
                            <li>Each question must address a single use.</li>
                            <li>Topics that might be covered include:
                                <ul>

                                    <li>Knowledge- questions about what a person knows about a specific topic.</li>
                                    <li>Behaviour- questions about what a person does in general or has done on a specific occasion and/or what a person plans to do in future.</li>

                        <h5>Wording of questions</h5>
                        <p>Wording should be open ended. Questions that require a one word answer, such as yes or no, should only be used as an introduction to more searching questions or for specific facts.</p>
                        <p>Questions must be neutral. Avoid using many questions that might lead the respondents to provide a specific answer or that might generate a strong emotional reaction.</p>
                        <p>Questions should be worded clearly, using simple words, and not using any jargon, abbreviations or technical terms.</p>

                        <h5>Order of questions</h5>
                        <p>To get the respondent involved in the interview, start with some non-controversial questions such as facts.</p>
                        <p>Ask questions about the present before asking about the past or the future.<br>
                        Use the last question of the interview to allow the respondent to talk about any issue that he/she thinks is important and has not been addressed or has not been addressed in sufficient depth.</p>

                        <p>This involves a schedule containing a set of questions which are filled by the researcher or enumerators as he/she directly observes things around him/her which are of interest by asking the respondent.</p>
                        <p>The checklist is systematically planned and includes all the items or points that must be considered during observation in a field or when extracting data from existing records. E.g ventilated pit latrine, you want to observe the functionality.</p>
                        <p>Set of questions will be:<br>
                        a. Evidence of use<br>
