                        <p>A systematic way in which to condense extensive data sets in to smaller analyzable units through the creation of categories and concepts derived from data.<br>
                        When data have been collected in research they have to edited and coded in a numerical form ready to be summarized to table, charts, diagram or grouped into frequencies before calculations are made.</p>

                        <h3 id="editing-collected-data">Editing the collected data</h3>
                        <p>It's the examination or scrutiny of the collected data in order to find out mistakes, errors and omissions. The aspects of accuracy, approximation and errors are analyzed.</p>

                        <h4>Accuracy</h4>
                        <p>It involves describing a phenomenon exactly as it is.<br>
                        Absolute or perfect accuracy cannot be obtained therefore in statistics relative accuracy is required and not absolute.</p>
                        <p>The degree of accuracy depends on the nature and purpose of inquiry and also on the materials of measurement. E.g when measuring the height of men and women it should be accurate up to inches or centimeters and while measuring the length between two cities it should be accurate up to kilometer.</p>

                        <h4>Approximation</h4>
                        <p>This is the basis of rounding off the figures with a view to simplify them thus affecting the standard of reasonable accuracy.</p>
                        <p>There are 3 methods of rounding:<br>
                        a. Round up<br>
                        b. Round down<br>
                        c. Round to the nearest whole number.</p>
                        <p>If the last figure is 75, then 1 is added to the last significant figure e.g if 25.268 rounded to two decimal places it will be 25.27</p>
                        <p>If the last figure 5 then last significant figure is taken as it is e,g if 25.263 rounded to two decimal places then it will be 25.26 .</p>
                        <p>If the last figure is 5 then 1 can be added to the last significant figure or it can be taken as it is.eg of 25.265 is to be rounded off two decimal places, then it can be taken as 25.27 or 25.26 . its correct in both ways.</p>
                        <p>If a figure is rounded to the nearest whole figure in thousands then the portion being left is ignored if it's less than 500, next higher figure in thousands is taken, if it's more than 500 and so on. E.g<br>
                        1. 15,856,432 - 15,856,000<br>
                        2. 15,856,854 - 15,857,000<br>
                        3. 15,856,500 - 15,857,000 or 15,856,000</p>

                        <h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>
                        <p>The word error has a special meaning in statistics. We can distinguish between mistake and error.</p>
                        <p>A mistake, means incorrect presentation or man factors. Can occur in the collection of the data. E.g the respondent may have mistakenly ticked the 'yes' box instead of 'no' box.</p>
                        <p>An error means the difference between the actual figures. The deviation is just by chance and it's not due to carelessness of human beings.</p>
                        <p>Normally the errors arise due to rounding off or approximation.</p>

                        <h4>Main sources of statistical errors</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Errors of origin:</strong> They crop up due to faulty definition of the units, bias or errastic trends in the data.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Errors of inadequacy:</strong> Errors due to inadequacy of samples or incomplete information.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Errors of manipulation:</strong> Errors which result while measuring, weighing and counting unconsciously.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Types of errors</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Sampling errors:</strong> The difference between the estimates of a value as obtained from the sample and the actual value.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non- sampling errors:</strong> Those errors which take place when samples are not selected at random. When a sample is chosen at random, it cannot be exactly representative of the population from which it's chosen. The difference between the characteristics of a sample is known as sample error.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biased errors:</strong> These errors arise due to the bias on the part of investigator, enumerator or instrument etc. They are of cumulative in nature. E.g the instrument is more or less than actual or the investigator ignores some digits with giving any weight/reason etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unbiased errors:</strong> These errors arise by chance in the usual course. These are of compensatory nature because positive and negative errors cancel each other and mostly the estimated value is just equal to true and actual value.</li>
                            <li><strong>Positive and negative errors:</strong> Errors may be positive or negative if the true value is greater than estimated value, the error is said to be positive, on the other hand, if it's less then it's said to be negative.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Measurement of errors</h4>
                        <p>Errors can be measured either absolutely or relatively</p>
                        
                        <h5>a. Absolute error</h5>
                        <p>This is the difference between the actual value and estimated value.<br>
                        Ae = A - E<br>
                        Where;<br>
                        Ae = Absolute error.<br>
                        A = Actual Value<br>
                        E = Estimated Value</p>
                        <p>e.g Assume the population of a town was estimated as 1,424,880 where as the actual population was 1,578,620.<br>
                        Ae = 1,578,620 - 1,424,880<br>
                        = 153,740.</p>

                        <h5>b. Relative error</h5>
                        <p>This the ratio between absolute error and actual value.<br>
                        $$ \mathrm{Re} = \frac{\mathrm{Ae}}{\mathrm{A}} $$<br>
                        Where: Re = relative error</p>
                        <p>Using the above example calculate relative error<br>
                        $$ \mathrm{Re} = \frac{153,740}{1,578,620} $$<br>
                        = 0.097</p>
                        <p>N/B; Relative error gives an indication of how good a measurement is relative to the size of the thing being measured.</p>
                        <p>Relative error can be converted to a percentage. The % error is the % of absolute error. Eg<br>
                        % error = <u>153,740 * 100</u><br>
                        1,578,620<br>
                        = 9.7%</p>

                        <p>After the data has been collected, they must be organized or sorted in a form which they are easily understood. The organisation of data refers to the classification and tabulation of data.<br>
                        Before the tabulation of data takes place, it's necessary to classify the data into homogeneous groups.</p>

                        <h3 id="classification-of-data">Classification of data</h3>
                        <p>It means the act of arranging the data in groups or classes according to some resemblance of the data in each group or class.<br>
                        In classification of data, the elements which posses the same characteristics are grouped in one class. In this way, the whole data is divided into a number of classes.<br>
                        L.R Connor has defined classification as 'the process of arranging things in groups or classes according to their resemblances and affinities (natural liking for or attraction to a person, thing, idea etc). Thus classification is the sorting of the data into homogeneous groups according to their observed characteristics.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are two main ways of classifying items from the questionnaire or data collection instrument. They are classified in terms of variable (quantitative) or an attribute (qualitative) data.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Quantitative classification:</strong> It refers to the classification of data according to some characteristics that can be measured such as height, weight, age etc. in this, data are classified by assigning arbitrary limits called class-limits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Qualitative classification:</strong> Classification made according to some attribute or quality such as sex, literacy, religion etc.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Other classification</h4>
                        <p>a. Temporary classification: Classification with respect to time is called temporary classification.<br>
                        b. Spatial classification: When classification is made with respect to places e.g production of sugarcane in Kenya region wise or production of tea in different areas.</p>

                        <p>Classification may be further divided as under;<br>
                        a. Simplified classification: Data divided into two classes (e.g., male/female). Data is divided into or according to one criterion.<br>
                        b. Manifold classification: Data divided into a number of classes and sub-classes.</p>

                        <h4>Main objectives of data classification</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">To eliminate unnecessary details.</span></li>

                        <h3 id="organisation-of-data">Organisation of data</h3>
                        <p>The process of organization the raw data into a compact and readily comprehensible form known as data summary.<br>
                        Data summary involves the preparation of two kinds of tables i.e<br>
                        a. Frequency distribution table<br>
                        b. Contingency tables (age and sex) - relationship between two or more variables.</p>
                        <p>Before these tables can be prepared, the raw data needs to be sorted using any of the simplest methods of sorting data such as: a) hand tally b) hand sorting c) sorting coded information (use of computer programming).</p>

                        <h3 id="tabulation-of-data">Tabulation of data</h3>
                        <p>The systematic arrangement of the statistical data in columns and raws.<br>
                        It's the process in which information is extracted from either the questionnaire, interview schedule or classified data and entering it on separate summary sheet.</p>

                        <h4>Principles of table construction</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The table should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.</li>
                            <li>Each table should have a comprehensive explanatory title. It should be clear and if too long, it should be made shorter by including sub-titles.</li>
                            <li>The size of the table should be suitable.</li>
                            <li>The source of data must be stated. Usually given as footnotes.</li>
                            <li>The headings to columns and rows should be clear.</li>
                            <li>The sub-totals for each separate class of data and grand total for all combined classes must be given, where appropriate.</li>
                            <li>The columns whose data are going to be compared should be placed in adjacent columns or rows.</li>
                            <li>The units of measurement should be clearly mentioned or stated.</li>
                            <li>The total of the rows should be given in the extreme right column and the total at the foot.</li>
                            <li>If certain figures are to be given some importance, they should be placed in a box or cycle.</li>
                            <li>If some portion of the collected data cannot be classified into any class then they should be taken into a separate row or column under the heading miscellaneous.</li>
                            <li>If the footnotes are necessary in a table then they should be short, clear and precise.</li>
                            <li>Thick lines should be drawn to separate one class of data from the other and thin lines to separate sub-divisions of classes.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="array-presentation">Array presentation</h3>
                        <p>This is the arrangement of a group of data in a pleasing way so that they are in order.<br>
                        When you are conducting an investigation you will reach a stage when you will have several figures referring to different classifications.<br>
                        When these figures are written down the way they were obtained from the original classification, they are referred to as an array.</p>

                        <h3 id="frequency-distribution">Frequency distribution</h3>
                        <p>When the statistical data is grouped according to size or magnitude, the series formed is known as frequency distribution which generally consists of class interval and their corresponding frequencies.</p>

                        <h4>Number of classes</h4>
                        <p>The number of classes in a frequency distribution depends upon the number of items of a series.<br>
                        A frequency distribution should not have less than 6-8 classes and should not have more than 20-25 classes</p>

                        <h4>Class interval</h4>
                        <p>To find out the class interval deduct the minimum value from the maximum value (range) and divide by the Number of classes or groups.<br>
                        The class intervals of different classes should be equal. If they are not equal then these will give misleading results.</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>Suppose the maximum value is 100 and minimum value is 20 and desired number of classes is 8. Calculate the class interval?</p>
                        <p>Range = maximum - minimum<br>
                        = 100 - 20<br>
                        = 80</p>
                        <p>Class interval = range/no. of classes<br>
                        Class interval = 80/8<br>
                        Class interval = 10</p>

                        <p>There are two types of frequency distribution:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Discrete series:</strong> In discrete series the various units are capable of exact measurement and each unit of the data is separate and complete and definite breaks are visible between different units.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continuous series:</strong> In this series the statistical units are arranged in groups or classes because they are not exactly measurable and are only approximations.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Example: Inclusive vs Exclusive form</h4>
                        <p>INCLUSIVE FORM: Both the units are included in the class while taking the items in a group.</p>

                        <p>The main objective of statistics is to simplify the complexity of the quantitative data and make them easily understandable.<br>
                        Diagrammatic representation is best suited to spatial series (in relation to geographical locations) and data split into different categories whenever a comparison of the same data at different places is to be made, diagrams will be the best way to do that.</p>

                        <h4>Principles of diagram construction</h4>
                        <p>The diagrams should be neat and clean so that they may have an attractive impression on the mind of the reader.<br>
                        A brief heading on the top of the diagram should be given so that the reader may create an idea about the diagram before he studies it. The relative data should be given near diagram so it can give a correct view.<br>
                        The scale to be used should be suitable and mentioned on the right hand top or left hand bottom. All types of symbols used should be explained.</p>

                        <h4>Simple bar charts</h4>
                        <p>This type of charts are used to present data which has been presented in a simple table. The height of each bar indicates the size of the figure represented.<br>
                        The width of the bars is not taken into account and it should be uniform for all bars.<br>
                        The number of bars depend on the number of figures.</p>

                        <p>A pie-chart is a circle divided by radial lines into sections so that the area of each section is proportional to the size of the figure represented.<br>
                        A pie chart is particularly useful where it's desired to show the relative proportions of the figures that are obtained to make up a single overall total.<br>
                        In order to construct a sub-divided circle, first find out the various angles which represent the various sectors by the following formula;<br>
                        Angle of each component is equal to component divided by total components times 360 degrees.</p>

                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <p>In 2004, medical clinic had 80000 patients, surgical had 60000 patients and pediatrics had 50000 patients.<br>

                        <p>In this graph false baseline is required.<br>
                        When the fluctuations in a variable are relatively small to it's size then definite break in the scale is shown between 0 and the next number.<br>
                        In this case instead of showing the entire scale from zero to the highest value involved, only as much as shown as is necessary for the purpose.<br>
                        The portion which lies between 0 and the lowest value of the variable is left out. This method is termed as false line approach allowing time series graphs.</p>

                        <p>A Z-chart is simply a time series chart incorporating three curves for:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Individual monthly figures.</li>
                            <li>Monthly cumulative figures for the year.</li>
                            <li>A moving annual total.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Z- chart takes its name from the fact that the three curves together tend to look like the letter Z.<br>
                        A Z-chart is of great importance for presenting business data over a period of one year.<br>
                        It includes the following information:</p>

                        <h4>a. Monthly totals</h4>
                        <p>These simply show the monthly results at a glance together with any rising or falling trends and seasonal variations.</p>

                        <h4>b. Cumulative totals</h4>
                        <p>These show the performance to date and can be easily compared with planned or budgeted performance.</p>

                        <h4>c. Annual moving totals</h4>
                        <p>These show a comparison of the current levels of performance with those of the previous year. If the line is rising then this year's monthly results are better than the results of the corresponding month last year and vice versa.</p>

                        <h4>Constructing of a Z-chart</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A double scale is used on the vertical axis. N/B: for the monthly figures. For the MAT and cumulative figures.</li>
                            <li>The points where each curve starts must be clearly marked. These are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Monthly figures for December of the previous year.</li>
                                    <li>Cumulative figures at zero.</li>
                                    <li>MAT at the MAT figures for the December of the previous year.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Since a MAT is the total of the 12 immediately preceding months the MAT for the final month must be the same as the cumulative total. The two curves will therefore meet at the last month of the graph.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="lorenz-curve">Lorenz curve</h3>
                        <p>This is a graph to measure dispersion. It measures inequalities of wealth distribution.<br>
                        Important use of the Lorenz curve is in the measurement of the extent to which income is unevenly distributed between the various income groups.</p>

                        <h4>Examples of the uses of such curve.</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">•</span><span class="item-text">To show the degree of concentration of a particular industry in the hands of a few firms.</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Write down the values of the two variables being plotted.</li>
                            <li>Express the variables as % of the total.</li>
                            <li>Compute the cumulative % of each variable.</li>
                            <li>Draw a horizontal and vertical axis and plot 0% to 100% on each axis.</li>
                            <li>Mark the cumulative % on the graph and join the points together by a free hand curve. This is Lorenz curve.</li>
                            <li>Draw the line of equal distribution by joining 0% to 100% point by a straight line or by dividing the graph on 45 degrees.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the Lorenz curve is a way from the line of equal distribution, there is greater disparity or inequality and vice versa.</p>

                        <p>The graphs of frequency distribution of continuous type are as follows:<br>
                        a. Dgive curve<br>
                        b. Histogram<br>
                        c. Frequency polygram<br>
                        d. Frequency curve.</p>

                        <p>To understand how to draw the above graphs its important to note the following terms:</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><dfn>Class interval</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A set of classes that are used to define the raw data or size of the group chosen. It can be determined by finding the range of the raw data obtained and dividing it by the value of number of classes we desire to have.</dd>

                            <dt><dfn>Class limit</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>These are the end number of class interval. The lower value for class interval is called lower class limit while the upper value for class interval is called upper class limit.</dd>

                            <dt><dfn>Class boundaries</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>Class boundaries are easily gotten by subtracting 0.5 from the lower class limit or lower value of class interval and adding 0.5 to upper class limit or upper value of class interval e.g 20-29 will be 19.5-29.5.</dd>

                            <dt><dfn>Class width</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>This is the size of the class interval and it's obtained by subtracting lower class boundaries from upper class boundaries e.g 19.5-29.5 the class width will be 29.5-19.5=10</dd>

                            <dt><dfn>Class mark</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>This is the mid-point or value of the class interval. It can be derived by adding lower and upper class limit and dividing by 2 or adding lower and upper class boundaries and dividing the sum by 2.</dd>
