                        <h4>Examples</h4>
                        <h5>1. Mx of health services</h5>
                        <p>Managers of health services require data concerning patients in order to manage them more
                            effectively and efficiently. This include the mx of scarce resources such as patients food,
                            linen, transport, staff, finances available, physical facilities such as beds and theatre
                            etc</p>
                        <p>Data concerning family planning and maternal child health services (MCH/FP) are also required
                            for evaluation and better mx for such services. The requirements of doctors and other health
                            workers needs statistical information concerning diagnosis, operations, Rx and
                            investigations.</p>
                        <p>Adequate information would improve the efficiency of the process involved in arriving at the
                            diagnosis and subsequent Rx, thereby making it possible to eliminate wasteful process.</p>

                        <h5>2. Planners</h5>
                        <p>Health information aids planners in making accurate plans for day to day and future
                            requirements of health activities with accurate and timely data, planners are able to
                            estimate for service requirements such as drugs, finances and physical facility
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>The health information data bank enables health workers and information officers to create an
                            analytical frame work commonly referred to as Health Activity Analysis.</p>

                        <h5>3. Health Activity Analysis</h5>
                        <p>This is a systematic way of collection, analysis and presentation of health data. It concerns
                            data obtained from patients/clients attendances, staff, bed use, physical facilities,
                            service delivery data, finances etc.</p>

                        <h5>4. Patient/client attendance</h5>
                        <p>Patients/clients make use of health facilities either as in-patient or out-patient clients.

                        <h4>Section A-E</h4>
                        <p>It's normally computed by in charges of each ward. This is done after doing a physical
                            counting of patients in the ward, who remain after discharges or deaths have been removed
                            from the ward.<br>
                            The physical count is normally carried out preferably at midnight of each day. This is the
                            time when patient's movement is minimal.<br>
                            This section is divided into 2 main sections<br>
                            a. Admissions<br>
                            b. Discharges</p>

                        <h5>Admissions</h5>
                        <p>All patients admitted from home, transferred from another ward, coming from parole or
                            returned from having absconded are indicated on admission section.<br>
                            All patients indicated on this section are added to patients who remained in the ward the
                            previous day and the total is obtained which is the total number of patients in that ward.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Discharges</h5>
                        <p>These are discharges from the wards which are discharged home, those who are dead,
                            transferred to another ward, absconders (run away from hospitals) and those who are granted
                            hospital leaves (parole). The total discharges are subtracted from the totals obtained in
                            admission section.<br>
                            The results obtained must be equal to the physical count of patients who are in the ward at
                            the time of physical count.<br>
                            This is the figure entered in section E of the DBR in the column of patients who are either
                            sleeping on the bed or cots (accommodated).</p>
                        <p>Section F of the DBR is normally for records use only. The officer in charge of health
                            information completes this section.<br>
                            This section is used to balance the DBR to check the accuracy of entries in all other
                            sections. The last total that's obtained after adding all the admissions to the previous
                            day, number of patients who remained in the ward and subtracting all discharges must be
                            equal to patients indicated in section E that is today's daily return numbers of
                            patients.<br>
                            When DBR is returned to the records department is properly checked, summarized on daily
                            summary in patients statistics form.<br>
                            The daily summary form, summarizes the day statistics. It indicates the total admissions and
                            discharges in the ward.<br>
                            There is a column for OBD (occupied Bed Days), this is the total number of patients
                            remaining in the ward each day.</p>
