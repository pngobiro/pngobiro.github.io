Uses of health statistics
- Management of health services
- Health information aids planners in their day to day play
- Health activity analysis e.g. finance, how beds are used, staff and many other physical facilities.

Patients / clients
Patients / clients attendance make use of facilities in patient or outpatient

In patient statistics
Indicates the facilities of in-patient services in a health institution
The data iscollected through the form common known as daily bed return / bed state

Daily summary form
Summarizes all the activities

\section*{TERMINOLOGY (TERMS)}
I. Allocated beds / Available beds / Staffed beds / bed compliment
-This is the number of beds constantly (permanently) allocated to a ward or hospital for treatment of patients.
II. In - patient
-Person who has gone all through admission procedures and is expected to occupy a bed in hospital ward at the in - patient departments at a specified occurrence or session.
III. Period - This is usually the available time in which a patient can be treated while admitted and is usually counted in days. The common period of reference is usually $365 / 366$ which is one year. However, months or part of the year can be computed as half ayear or quarter year.
IV. Bed state - Refers to the number of patients occupying hospitalbeds during a given period of time.
V. In - patient days (IPD ) - It refers to occupied bed days ( OBD )

This is the total number of patients remaining or occupying a bed in the ward or hospital at each day.
VI. Percentage occupancy -This is the percentage of the actual in - patient days in comparison to the maximum available patient days as determined by the allocated beds capacity during a given period.
VII. Available bed days - Is the total number of bed days available of which the patient can occupy. Those particular beds in ward or hospital. This usually gives the available bed space for patient to use.
VIII. Turnover per bed / through put for bed / bed turnover - refers to the number of patients expected to have used each bed available in a particular ward or hospital during the specified period of time.
IX. Turnover interval - Is the average period of time in which beds stay vacant between twosuccessive patients' use of the same bed. This may also be said to be the period between a discharge and admission on the same bed in ward or hospital. It ii also the number of days beds lie vacant between two successive admissions
X. Length of stay - number a patient occupies a bed thus from admission time of a particular patient to the discharge time of the same patient.
XI. Occupied bed days - is the total number of patients remaining in the hospital / ward each day added together over the reference period
XII. Average occupancy/ average number of patients - This is the average number of patients in a hospital during a specified period
XIII. Amenity beds - is a bed provided in a single room or small ward for the time being required by any patient on medical grounds for which a patient is charged part of the cost.
XIV. Day case - are patients attending as a non - residence patient for investigations, therapeutic test, operative procedures or other treatment and who require some form of preparation period of recovery or both involving provision of accommodation and services

\section*{HEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE STATISTICS}

Daily bed return

2) Why should health records and information students learn statistics ( 8 mks )
3) State 8 uses of statistics ( 16 mks )
4) State the four types of statistics ( 8 mks )

\section*{MEDIAN}

Denoting or relating to a value or quantity lying at the midpoint of a frequency distribution of observed values or quantities, such that there is an equal probability of falling above or below it

To find the Median, place the numbers you are given in value order and find the middle number. Example: find the Median of $\{13,23,11,16,15,10,26\}$. Put them in order: $\{10,11,13,15,16,23,26\}$ The middle number is 15 , so the median is 15 . (If there are two middle numbers, you average them.)

\section*{ODD DISTRIBUTIONS}

The following data was collected on age of patients attending a paediatric clinic
Step 1: 55,65,49,77,80,90,55,66,65,70,69
Step 2: 49,55,55,65,65,66,69,70,77,80,90
Median position $=\mathrm{N}+\mathrm{I} / 2=11+1 / 2=12 / 2=6^{\mathrm{TH}}$
Median position value is 66

$\checkmark$ Among the students weighed in the diploma HR\&I 2002 half OR 50\% weighed below 71kgs.

\section*{MEDIAN IN GROUPED DATA}

To obtain median in grouped frequency distribution some of principles identified in the ungrouped data computations are observed ie arranging of the data in order of magnitude from the smallest to the highest and identifying the median position
However, there are two common methods followed in determining median among grouped frequency distribution , and this includes;
a) Calculation method
b) Diagrammatic method

\section*{CALCULATION METHOD}

It is necessary to remember common characteristics in grouped frequency distribution to facilitate computation. This include
- Classes
- Frequency
- Class interval
- Class limit

Procedures
a. Obtain data and ensure that its grouped and in order of classes and with their sizes.
b. Workout the cumulative frequencies in a separate column usually abbreviated as CF (cf). Once you have worked out CT
c. Identify the median position by dividing the total frequency by two. Usually abb. As $\mathrm{N} / 2$ (some abb it as $\sum \mathrm{f} / 2$ )
d. Identify the location of median position in the distribution using the cumulative totals .
The class in which the median position falls is referred to as the median class
e. Take note of the following identified median class
i. The lower class limit abbreviated as $\mathrm{L}_{1}$
ii. Cumulative total level of the class before the median class abbreviated as CT2
iii. The frequency of the median abbreviated as fx
iv. Class interval especially as in the median class abbreviated as (i) Obtain median by substitution of the values in number 5 in the following formula

Median $=$ lower class limit + median position - cumulative total before median class x class interval /frequency of the median class

Median $=\mathrm{L}_{1}$

\section*{Example 1}

This sample data was collected from Namilama division during a research process on the role of the community on HIV/ AIDS awareness.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline AGE & TOTALS( F ) & Cf \\
\hline 15-19 & 40 & 40 \\
\hline 20-24 & 130 & 170 \\
\hline 25-29 & 89 & 259 \\
\hline 30-34 & 64 & 323 \\
\hline 35-39 & 30 & 353 \\
\hline 40-44 & 22 & 375 \\
\hline 45-49 & 14 & 389 \\
\hline $50 \quad$ yrs and above & 16 & 405 \\
\hline Totals & 405 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
i. Find the median position
ii. Calculate the median

\section*{Interpretation}

The total number of the half of the male and female between age of 15 and 50 years and above inNamilama division that wasinterviewed duringa research process on the role of the community on HIV/AIDS awareness was 26 years.

\section*{MEDIAN DIAGRAMATICALLY}

The principles acquired in cumulative frequency curve have to be ;
1) Draw / prepare a cumulative frequency curve.
2) Obtain the median position by dividing the total number of items ( sum of frequency )by two abbreviated as N/2
3) Determine the median position value on the cumulative frequency curve
4) Trace the median value on the curve x -axis by drawing a perpendicular line on the cumulative frequency
5) The point of intersection of the perpendicular line with the $x$-axis is the median of the distribution . so determine its value

a) Using a class interval of 10 prepare a grouped frequency distribution table for the ages of the patient admitted in the ward (13marks).
b) Calculate the arithmetic mean from the table ( 5 mks )
c) Find the median by calculation and diagrammatically from the table ( 10 mks )
d) Give two portions of information arising from each of your answers in a-c above.

\section*{MODE}

Is the measure of central tendency that represents a value or item ora observation that occurs most frequently. It is also a representative in a distribution or a series of figures which has the highest frequency .Mode is usually abbreviated as (z)

To identify mode in your distribution it is required that one identifies the particular type of data that is being handled ie ungrouped or grouped frequency distribution

\section*{MODE IN UNGROUPED DATA}

Mode us obtained by inspection of the distribution to determine the item or observation that has occurred more than the others with the highest number of occurrence

Procedure
i. Must obtain data
ii. Inspect the data by looking at each item and determining numbers of times it occurs
iii. Select the item that has occurred most and that would be the mode for that particular distribution

\section*{Example 1}

Using data on diploma 2002 students weights on those born in the month of $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ quarter of the year were 50,92,71,60,70,75,71,74,60,74,69,63,62,50,71,80,80 $\_\_\_\_$

\section*{.STEPS}

Arrange the values from the smallest to the highest ie $50,51,52$ $\_\_\_\_$ 92.Then you tally the values

\section*{Mode is 71 kgs for the above data}

\section*{Interpretation}

Most of the students in the diploma class born in the month of the $1^{\text {st }}$ quarter of the year were weighing 71kgs

\section*{MODE IN GROUPED DATA}

Determination of mode in grouped data requires much more attention and it may follow two possible ways namely;
- Computation
- Diagrammatic presentation

However, both of them are worked from frequency distribution

\section*{COMPUTATION OF MODE}
i. You obtain the frequency distribution table
ii. Inspect the table on the frequency column to determine the class with highest frequency
iii. The class with the highest frequency is usually referred to as modal class in a distribution
iv. The modal class is said to be carrying the modal value for the distribution
v. On the modal class, take note of the following
- The lower class limit abbreviated as $\mathrm{L}_{1}$
- The frequency of the modal class abbreviated as $\mathrm{f}_{1}$
- The frequency of the item below or before the modal class abbreviated as $f_{o}$
- Frequency of the item above / after the modal class abbreviated as $\mathrm{f}_{2}$
Class interval of the distribution abbreviated as i
vi. Substitute the identified values of the modal to obtain mode. By using the following formula
Mode z =

\section*{Example 1}

Using data from Namilama on the role of community on HIV / AIDS

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Age & No of respondents \\
\hline $15-19$ & 40 \\
\hline $20-24$ & 130 \\

\hline $45-40$ & 14 \\
\hline $50+$ & 16 \\
\hline Totals & 405 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Modal class $=20-24$
$\mathrm{L}_{1}=20$
$\mathrm{F}_{1}=130$
$\mathrm{F}_{0}=40$
$\mathrm{F}_{2}=89$
$\mathrm{I}=5$

Mode z =
=
$$\begin{aligned}
& = \\

\section*{QUARTILES}

Are measures that divides a distribution into four equal parts

Types of data
1. Grouped data
2. Ungrouped data

Quarters
$1^{\text {st }}$ quarter $2^{\text {nd }}$ quarter $\quad 3^{\text {rd }}$ quarter $\quad 4^{\text {th }}$ quarter
Abbreviation $\mathrm{Q}_{1} \mathrm{Q}_{2} \mathrm{Q}_{3} \mathrm{Q}_{4}$

\section*{QUARTERS}
$1^{\text {st }}$ quarter $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{1}\right), 2^{\text {nd }}$ quarter $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{2}\right), 3^{\text {rd }}$ quarter $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{3}\right), 4^{\text {th }}$ quarter $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{4}\right.$

\section*{Quartile in grouped data}

\section*{Procedure}
- Get the data
- Determine the quartile 1 position $\underline{\mathrm{N}+1}$
- 4
- $\mathrm{Q} 1=\mathrm{N}+1 \mathrm{~N}-$ No. of items

4
- Arrange the items in order of size or magnitude e.g from smallest to highest.
- Identify the quartile position using the computed position values.
- Establish the values in the quartile position. Remember the odd and even distribution i.e odd distribution gives an actual value in the distribution while even distribution requires an approximation between the two values.
- The item(value) that is located in the quartile position in the quartile value.

\section*{Example}

The following weights collected from patients attending ophthalmology clinic( $92,71,60,70,75,50,71,74,60,74,69,63,62,50,71,80,80)$ kegs''.

\section*{MEASURES OF DISPERSION / VARIABILITY}

These are measures that help us to understand how individual items in any given distribution are distributed or positioned. This is done by comparing individual items, measures of central tendency and the total number of items in then distribution. All these are worked out leading to certain indicators that show variability / dispersion .Some of these measures include;
1. Range -is the difference between the highest and the lowest value in any given distribution.

These usually gives a value that can dictate (point to us) how close the items in a distribution were ie A range of higher values with fewer items indicate that the items are likely to be far from each other. A range of lower values with many items indicates that items are likely to be close to each other.

Example one
Mbagathi ANC weighed 40 clients below 50 kgs and 90 kgs while Maralal district hospital weighed 39 clients between 49 kgs and 69 kgs

Mbagathi $-90-50=40$
Maralal $69-49=20$

\section*{Interpretation}

Its likely that the weights of clients inMaralal are closely similar as compared to Mbagathi
2. Mean deviation - this is a measure of variation which seeks to show a common value of the individual item $s$ variations from a central value usually the arithmetic mean. Therefore it gains its name from the measure of the central tendency .
It may also be referred to as average deviation.
Therefore to calculate the mean deviation one would require to obtain all the deviations of the difference of the individual items in the distribution from the arithmetic mean
Mean deviation is abbreviated as (MD) while deviation abbreviated as ( d )

Computation of mean deviation honors the category of data in the distribution; however, the principle is still the same.
a) Mean deviation of ungrouped data

Procedures
i. Obtain the data
ii. Calculate the arithmetic mean
iii. Obtain the deviation by subtracting the arithmetic mean from the individual item
iv. Obtain the sum of the deviation while ignoring the accompanying mathematical signs
v. Divide the sum of the deviations by the total number of items abbreviated as
The resultant value after the division is the mean deviation for that particular distribution. This is formulated as follows

Mean deviation =
MD =

\section*{Example}

The following weights were collected from patients attending ophthalmology clinic
$92,71,60,70,75,50,71,74,60,74,69,63,62,50,71,80,80 \mathrm{kgs}$
Calculate the mean deviation
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{MD} & = \\
& = \\
& =8.1
\end{aligned}$$
b) Mean deviation in grouped data

Procedures
i. Obtain the data
ii. Compute the arithmetic mean
iii. Workout the deviations ( usually abbreviated as d ) by subtracting arithmetic mean from the midpoint of each class
iv. Multiply the deviation by their respective frequency, this is abbreviated as fd
v. Sum up the product of the frequency and deviations disregarding the mathematical sign , this is abbreviated as
vi. Divide the sum of the frequency and deviations by the sum of the frequency in the distribution , this is abbreviated as
vii. The resultant answer upon division is the mean deviation for the distribution
Therefore, formula for mean deviation in grouped frequency is;
Mean deviation =
MD=
3. Quartile deviation - this is the measure of dispersion that indicate the relationship between quartile one and quartile three $\left(\mathrm{Q}_{1} \& \mathrm{Q}_{3}\right)$ in any given distribution
It is abbreviated as QD and it seeks to show the item value that gives the relationship between the lower quartile ( $\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ ) and the upper quartile ( $\mathrm{Q}_{3}$ )
Its also referred to as interquartile range
To compute quartile deviation , the following steps are observed;
Step 1
Determine the lower quartile ( $\mathrm{Q}_{1}$ ) and the upper quartile ( $\mathrm{Q}_{3}$ )

Step 2
Subtract the lower quartile value from the upper quartile value (Q3 - Q1 )
Step 3
Divide the results answer by $2=$

The resultant answer is the QD for the distribution
This can be summed up as
Quartile deviation =
$$\mathrm{QD}=$$

\hline Totals & 494 & 732 & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Compute;
Quartile 1 position
Quartile 3 for urban
Interpretation
Variation in age among the urban residence was less compared to rural residence -

Note :
Its worthy noting that the quartile deviation indicates uniformity in items hence when the quartile deviation is very low, It indicates that there is high uniformity among the values (items). Thus the items did not differ or vary very much and when the quartile deviations is very high it did not indicate that there is low uniformity among the items or values . Thus the items varied greatly or highly .

\section*{VARIANCE}

Variance is the name given to the square of the standard deviation . ie variance $= \mathrm{S}^{2}$. It is important because variance can be added . For instance, if two independent distributions had variances of $\mathrm{S}_{1}{ }^{2}$ and $\mathrm{S}_{2}{ }^{2}$ respectively the variance of the two distributions combined would be $\mathrm{S}_{1}{ }^{2}+\mathrm{S}_{2}{ }^{2}$.

Is a kind of dispersion which seeks to overcome the ignored mathematical principles

Ungrouped $-\mathrm{V}={ }^{2}$
Grouped - ${ }^{2}$
SD =
Standard deviation symbolize
Is found by adding the squares of the deviations of the individual value from the mean of the distribution, dividing this sum by the number of items in the
distribution, and then finding the square root of the quotient . Algebraically, this can be shown as
$$\mathrm{SD}=\quad \mathrm{SD}={ }^{2} \quad \text {-ungrouped }$$

The more the values of individual items differ from the mean , the greater will be the square of these differences and therefore the greater sum of the squares. And the greater this sum , of course the larger will S be , Hence , the greater the dispersion, the larger the standard deviation will be .

NOTE: if there is no dispersion at all, ie all values are the same, the S will work at zero

\section*{Interpretation}

c. standard deviation for the three subjects ie home science, computer science and maths

VARIANCE -is a measure of variation which seeks to overcome the act of ignoring the mathematical sign undertaken in the mean deviation computation . This makes it better measure of variation hence its name variance

\section*{Procedure}
1. obtain the data in a given distribution
2. understand the data, the category in which it exists and determine the method to be followed in computation
3. work out the arithmetic mean for the distribution)
4. obtain the deviations by subtracting the mean from every item (ungrouped) or midpoint in grouped abbreviated as (d)
5. square each deviation as obtained abbreviated as $\left(\mathrm{d}^{2}\right)$
6. multiply the squared deviations by the number of items or frequency in each class abbreviated as ( $\mathrm{fd}^{2}$ )
7. obtain the sum of the number multiplied by the squared deviations abbreviated as $\sum \mathrm{d}^{2}$ or $\sum \mathrm{fd}^{2}$
8. divide the resultant sum by the total number of items or sum of frequency abbreviated as ${ }^{2} \mathrm{OR}{ }^{2}$
The resultant answer is the variance of the distribution abbreviated as $\mathrm{S}^{2}$ This is formulated as follows = ungrouped variance
$$\mathrm{S}^{2}=2$$
grouped variance
$$S^{2}={ }^{2}$$

\section*{STARNDARD DEVIATIONS}

This is a measure of variation or dispersion that is said to be the best in determining the spread of items in any given distribution

This is because it involves each item in the distribution individuals and its deviation

It is also referred to as root squared mean deviation . This is because its obtained as the square root of the mean of the square deviation of the arithmetic mean

Usually, the squared deviations are sum up before the standard deviation is obtained

The standard deviation is abbreviated as SD or symbolized as
Its also referred to as the square root of the variance hence abbreviated as ${ }^{2}$

\section*{PROCEDURE}

1 Observe all the steps in obtaining variance
2 work out the square root of the variance abbreviated as ${ }^{2}$
3 The resultant answer is the standard deviation for the distribution .This can be formulated as follows
${ }^{2}$ or $=^{2}$ or $\mathrm{SD}^{2}$

\section*{STANDARD DEVIATION INTERPRETATION}

The higher the value of standard deviation the greater the level of variation or dispersion in the distribution . This is also referred to as variability level of that particular distribution. Thus it would mean that the magnitude of deviation of values in the distribution from the arithmetic mean is greater. A smaller standard deviation value means that there was low variability level of values (that is the distribution) from the arithmetic mean

Thus a higher degree of uniformity of value or items in that particular distribution . Therefore the standard deviation can be used in deciding or making a choice between two or more distributions especially when they may have the same values or their measure of central tendency (arithmetic mean)

In certain cases distributions with smaller standard deviation would mean that particular distribution is the one with the most dependable or representative arithmetic mean .

This makes standard deviation measurement a very useful indicator in checking the representativeness of arithmetic mean in a given distribution .

\section*{COEFFICIENCY OF VARIATION}

This is a measure of variation that seeks to bring a clear difference (level) of variation in two or more distributions

It involves the arithmetic mean and standard deviation and is considered as the best relative measure of variation

It's also referred as the coefficient of standard deviation (SD).It is also abbreviated as(cv).

\section*{PROCEDURE TO OBTAIN}
1) Obtain the data
2) Calculate the arithmetic mean and standard deviation for the distr4ibution abbreviated as and SD
3) Divide the standard value by the in the distribution
4) Multiply the resultant answer by 100 to give a percentage expression .

All this are expressed as follows.
Coefficient variation $=$
$$\mathrm{CV}=$$

The resultant is a percentage expression

\section*{SKEWNESS}

This is a comparable characteristic which helps us to understand distributions further or more this is especially where one has similar mean and standard deviation in distribution but the end diagrammatic view appearance is different among the distribution.

Therefore a measure of skewness indicates the difference between the manner in which items are distributed or spread in particular groups of items in a distribution in relation to the normal distribution.

The presentation showing the difference in appearance are referred as asymmetrical and the one which is normal (no skewedness) is referred to as symmetrical.

The difference in spread from the normal may be in the lower values or in the higher values. Where the spread extents into the higher values, the distribution curve on presentation tends to be higher on the right hand side of the x -axis. Such a distribution is referred to as positively skewed .where the spread extents more in the lower values of the distribution, the distribution curve when presentment on the x -axis tents to be higher than left part of the x-axis. Such distribution is referred to us negatively skewed

The three common measures of central tendency arithmetic mean, median and mode also help us to describe skewness easily and to distinguish their differences in appearance

These are simplified in appearance as follows;

\section*{METHODS OF CALCULATING SKEWNESS}

As mentioned above there are three common measures of central tendency also helps us to describe skewness and determination of its direction or category of skewness

There are many methods and procedures of determining skewness in any given distribution named or based on the names of people who first suggested and proposed them and they are in determining skewness. Some of the commonly used methods include ;

\section*{1. PEARSONIAN MEASURE OF SKEWNESS}

As the name suggests this was proposed by professor KaarlPearsons . He who a great british by biometrician and statistician from 1857-1936.

Its based on the fact that mode and mean have a difference in any skewed distribution. This difference is then divided by the standard deviation of the same distribution .

Inn determining skewness , this method is formulated as follows ;

Skewness =
Sk=
Most values of skewness obtained are between minus one and positive one. Although in certain circumstances:

This value may be up to minus or positive three but rarely higher or beyond this values e.g

\section*{Example 1}

Patient's weight in a special clinic were established as follows ;

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Kgs & No. of pts(f) & m.p(x) & fx & ct & d & $\mathrm{D}^{2}$ & $\mathrm{Fd}^{2}$ \\
\hline 54 & 40 & 52 & 2080 & 40 & -13.8 & 189.1 & 756.4 \\
\hline 55-59 & 70 & 57 & 3990 & 110 & -8.8 & 76.6 & 536.2 \\
\hline 60-64 & 130 & 62 & 8060 & 240 & -3.8 & 14.1 & 183.3 \\
\hline 65-69 & 80 & 67 & 5360 & 320 & 1.3 & 1.6 & 128 \\
\hline 70-74 & 80 & 72 & 5760 & 400 & 6.3 & 39.1 & 3128 \\

\hline Totals & 480 & & 31560 & & 61.6 & 711.2 & 32268 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Calculate the following
a) arithmetic mean
b) mode
c) state the modal class
d) standard deviation
e) variance
f) skewness
example 2
the following data was collected on adults referred to the laboratory for malaria parasites test on monthly basis in the kabsebeth hospital

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age & F & Ct & m.p (x) & Fx & d & $\mathrm{D}^{2}$ & Fd2 \\
\hline 15-19 & 24 & 24 & 17 & 408 & -14 & 196 & 4704 \\
\hline 20-24 & 57 & 81 & 22 & 1254 & -9 & 81 & 4617 \\
\hline 25-29 & 75 & 156 & 27 & 2025 & -4 & 16 & 1200 \\
\hline 30-34 & 74 & 230 & 32 & 2368 & 1 & 1 & 74 \\
\hline 35-39 & 67 & 297 & 37 & 2479 & 6 & 36 & 2412 \\
\hline 40-44 & 32 & 329 & 42 & 1344 & 11 & 121 & 3872 \\

\hline Total & 351 & & & 10912 & & & 22511 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Compute the following using the table above
(a) arithmetic mean
(b) mode
(c) standard deviation
(d) skewness
its worthy nothing that in normal distribution (symmetric distribution) mean, mode, and median are equal hence upon application of the pearsonian formula the resultant answer will be zero which would mean that the distribution has no skewness .And upon computation where the resultant answer has appositive sign it denotes that the distribution is positively skewed. Which will mean that the spread is more in the higher values of that particular distribution, while where the resultant answer has a negative sign it denotes that the distribution is negatively skewed . Thus the spread extends more or exists more among the lower values or items .
the resultant numerical values also give the extend or level of the skewness ie where two distributions exists and one has a skewness values of +0.65 and the one of +0.85 the later $(+0.85)$ is more skewed than the earlier distribution .

Consequently, this formula gives both the direction and extends of skewness in any given distribution

\section*{2. MODIFIED PEARSONIAN MEASURE OF SKEWNESS}

In certain distributions mode may not be exact especially in grouped frequency distribution . This formula is used on the averages of moderately skewed distribution whose relationship indicates that mode $=3$ median -2 mean when this relationship is applied on the first formula of skewness measurement described and the formula is modified as follows ;
$$\text { Skewness }(\mathrm{sk})=3$$

Most values again are $\pm 1$ although they vary between $\pm 3$ and the resultant answer sign gives the direction and level of skewness as explained in the first formula . in most computation it is recommended that the first formula to be used in computing skewness for ungrouped distribution while the second for grouped frequency distribution

Example 1
Use the data below
The following data was collected as patients bp in the hypertension clinic

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{3. BOWLEY'S MEASURE OF SKEWNESS}

Formula
Sk =
This method was first proposed by professor Bowley's based on quartile with remembrance that symmetrical distribution have their first and third quartile situated equal distance from the median value which is also the second quartile value. This gives and impression that can be expressed as follows;

Q3-median=median=Q1
Or
Q3 + Q1-2 median $=0$
His principles therefore are that in asymmetrical distribution there will be a difference in these equations if the quartile is worked out. The different results
after computing the quartiles in the impression would indicate that either the $25 \%$ of items at the top or below the median are further from it. This impression can be expressed into a formula that can be used to measure skewness as follows;
$$\mathrm{SK}=$$

The interpretation of the skewness resultant value will be as in the other measurements previously explained. The positive or negative skewness of up to $\pm 3$ signify variation in the first $25 \%$ item (negative) or the top $25 \%$ item (positive). It is also interpreted that if it is positive skewed the top $25 \%$ of the items in the distribution tended to be further from the median than the first $25 \%$ of the items. Thus the Q3 value will be further from median than the Q1 value. This would be vice versa for the negatively skewed distribution.

It is advisable that the skewness value obtained out of the two formulas should not be directly compared with each other since the numerical values have no direct relationship. However a direct common feature would be attained in a given distribution on direction and existence of skewness. It is rare to obtain different direction for the two formulas from the same distribution.

\section*{NOTE}

It is worthy to remember that skewness gives us the direction in a distribution which has more values from a central measure and with more varied spread among the items. Thus the extend of spread among the items is more therefore effective interpretation should consider the measure of central tendency and the method of computation used.

\section*{Example}

This sample data was collected from Namilama division during a research process on the role of the community on HIV/AIDS awareness . compute the skewness for the total and explain the outcome answer-meaning of the skewness

\hline $25-29$ & 46 & 43 & 89 & 259 \\

\section*{NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS}

This is the most important of all statistical distribution analysis.This was just discovered by a French mathematician -Abraham Demoivre in 1733 and was rediscovered and applied to normal and natural social sciences by the French mathematician Pierre simondelaplace and the Germany mathematician and astronomer Karl Friedrick Gauss in the early $\mathrm{C} 19{ }^{\text {th }}$ hence its also referred to as Gaussian distribution

Many phenomena closely follow or approximately follow normal distribution , this include ;
$\checkmark$ Weight of persons
$\checkmark$ Serum
$\checkmark$ Cholesterol
$\checkmark$ Life span of light bulbs
$\checkmark$ Body temperature of health persons
$\checkmark$ Size of oranges ,bananas etc
We have got also other phenomena that do not follow the normal distribution such as individual annual earnings, clinical laboratory readings of various specimen ie urea , magnesium etc

Normal distribution are also popular because they posess certain mathematical properties that make them attractive and easy to manipulate .

Its also based on the theory of methodology developed on assumption that certain data are distributed approximately on normal basis

\section*{NORMAL DISTRIBUTION CURVE}

\section*{PROPERTIES OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION}
1. Bell-shaped curve upon diagrammatic presentation of the distribution on a curve
2. Have particular internal distribution for the area under the curve which is referred to as confidence limits. The confidence limit property relates the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation of distribution in such a way that;
$68.26 \%$ of items are included in arithmetic mean plus or minus one standard deviation value ( $68.26 \%= \pm \mathrm{SD}$ )

Also $95.45 \%$ of the items are included in arithmetic mean plus or minus two standard deviation $(95.45 \%= \pm 2 \mathrm{SD})$
In the same line $99.74 \%= \pm 3 \mathrm{SD}$ )
3. The amount of area under the normal curve is directly proportional to the x-axis score

\section*{CORRELATION AND REGRESSION}

These are measures which help us determine the existence of a relationship between two or more variables in a distribution

Also in prediction of possible value one of the related values are given

\section*{CORRELATION}

Is a statistical term which indicates two quantities / distributions varying in such a way that movement or change in one is followed / accompanied by movement or change on the other .

Such quantities are said to be correlated
Example
- Fundal heights and gestation age
- Age of husband and age of wife
- Distance covered and speed used

\section*{CORRELATION ANALYSIS}

Correlation analysis determines whether there is a statistically probable relationship between two variables .It does not presume as it does causal analysis ;that one variable actually is the agent that causes change to occur in another variable .It merely assesses the strength and direction $n$ of an association between variables. Many empirical attempts to understand political phenomena

Causation is very difficult to assess using statistics of correlation .Usually, we try to define one variable as the independent or causal factor in a relationship and the other variable . For example :smoking tobacco(independent variable )is correlated and usually precedes getting cancer (dependent variable ) or another example is us politics ;women are more likely than men to vote for the democratic party , gender would be independent variable and their vote for president (democrat or republican) would be the dependent variable .

The actual correlation factor in the 1996 elections was 24.This means that if we know the gender of a person, we have a $24 \%$ vote better chance of predicting their vote than if we don't know their gender causes people to vote in different ways, it simply indicates that there is a relationship that may be causal in nature

Causation about correlational analysis correlation is not the same as cause. The fact that people who find jobs with health coverage are more likely to work steadily does not mean that providing coverage to low wage workers will necessarily improve retention

\section*{CORRELATION ANALYSIS}

This is the attempt / consideration to measure / determine the degree of relationship between two or more variables that are correlated

A statistical device that helps in analyzing relationships between distribution / series

\section*{USES OF CORRELATION}
- Determination if a relationship existence between two distribution / variable
- Measure relationship between two variables
- Test if the relationship is relevant or significant
- Establishment of causes and effects if there is any between the variables with relationship
- Estimation of values when one is known

\section*{TYPES OF CORRELATION}

May be classified in different ways that include
1. Positive or negative
2. Simple, partial and multiple
3. Linear and non linear

\section*{POSITIVE CORRELATION}

Depends on direction of change on the variables. This may occur in two ways
-where one variable increase the other also increase
-where one decrease the other one also decrease
It is also referred to as direct correlation
Example
-variable x 10,12,15,18,or,80,70,60,40,40
-variable y $15,20,22,23,37$, or, $50,44,30,20,10$

\section*{NEGATIVE CORRELATION}

Variables vary in the positive direction such that where one variable increase the other one decreases and vice versa

Its also referred to as inverse
Example
-variable x $20,30,40,60,80$, or $100,90,60,40,30$
-variable y 40,30,22,15,10,or 10,20,30,40,30

\section*{SIMPLE, PARTIAL AND MULTIPLE CORRELATION}

Simple -only two variables are studies as above
Partial and multiple - three or more variables are studied
Partial- more than two variables are reorganized but only two are considered to influence each other .The possible influence from the others are kept constant

Multiple - three or more variables are studies simultaneously ie a drug test on the station , samples , amount used and effectiveness

\section*{LINEAR AND NON LINEAR}

These are correlation on the relation of change
The distinction between the two is based on the consistence of ratio change in the variables

Linear -is where change in one variable bear constant change in the other variable
Example
-variable x 10,20,30,40,50
-variable y 70,140,210,280,350
If the ratio is presented on the graph it gives a straight line

\section*{NON LINEAR}

Non linear - is where amount of change does not bear constant ratio of change to the other variable

It is also referred to as curvilinear
Double ratio of change in one does not necessarily mean double ratio in the other variable

\section*{METHODS OF STUDYING CORRELATION}

Diagrammatical
-scatter diagrams
-graphs
Mathematical computation
-karlpearson's coefficient of correlation
-Concurrent deviation
Interpretation same
- Perfect, high degree, low degree positive relation
- Perfect, high degree, low degree negative relation

\section*{REGRESSION}

The act of returning back,first used by sir Francis Calton in 1977 while studying the relationships between heights of fathers and sons published in the paper regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature .It showed that tall fathers tend to have short sons while short fathers have short sons .

Measure of average relation between two variables in terms of the original unit of data or variables

\section*{REGRESSION ANALYSIS}

Once a relationship has been established there would be a possibility of estimation or prediction of values of one set where the other set is known and this is referred to as regression analysis

It also refer to the methodology in which estimates are made of values of variables from knowledge of one or two of the other variables

Also measurements of errors are involved in this estimation process .

\section*{REGRESSION STUDY}

This is done by drawing lines which are referred to as regression lines

\section*{USES}
i. Estimation of independent and dependent variables
ii. Obtaining measure of error involved in using lines of regression as estimation basis
iii. Can be used to calculate correlation coefficient

\section*{STATISTICAL ANALYSIS}

Is concerned with collection, organization and interpretation of data according to well defined procedure.

It is the heart of every scientific discipline
Is a methodology of systematically analyzing and drawing conclusion on things studied

\section*{STUDY AREAS}
- Behavioral and biological characteristics of human being
- Aspects of plants and animal life
- Dynamics of physical environment
- Interactions of any of these dynamics

\section*{GOALS}

In broad sense it is the process of drawing conclusions and understanding more about the sources of our data.

This manipulation and organization has basic objectives as follows ;
-reduction of data
-procedures of starting degree of confidence in the accuracy of the measures
-identification of associations
