                        <p>The Health Services objective for the Kenya Health Policy is to attain universal coverage with critical services that positively contribute to the realization of the overall policy goal. Six policy objectives, therefore, are defined, which address the current situation - each with specific strategies for focus to enable attaining of the policy objective.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Eliminate communicable conditions:</strong> This it aims to achieve by forcing down the burden of communicable diseases, till they are not of major public health concern.</li>
                            <li><strong>Halt, and reverse the rising burden of non communicable conditions.</strong> This it aims to achieve by ensuring clear strategies for implementation to address all the identified non communicable conditions in the country.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduce the burden of violence and injuries.</strong> This it aims to achieve by directly putting in place strategies that address each of the causes of injuries and violence at the time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provide essential health care.</strong> These shall be medical services that are affordable, equitable, accessible and responsive to client needs.</li>

                            <li>i. Economy and employment: Ensure work and stable employment and entrepreneur opportunities for all people across different socio economic groups</li>

                        <h4>Regulatory functions</h4>
                        <p>Kenya health professionals' regulatory boards and councils regulate the training and practice of health professionals, which can include professionals and training institutions as well as health facilities. Although functions vary somewhat among the various agencies, the following are the general functions of most regulatory agencies.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>I. Accreditation of training institutions:</strong> All training institutions, whether public, private or faith-based, are required to be approved by their respective health professional regulatory agencies. The process of accreditation of training institutions begins with the established institution applying for accreditation to the regulatory agency, followed by inspection of the institution, and review of the curriculum, after which the regulatory agency makes a decision on whether or not to approve the institution. After approval, institutions are allowed to admit students. Thereafter, inspection of institutions is a random continuous activity to promote quality training of health professionals.</li>
                            <li><strong>II. New student enrolment:</strong> Upon accreditation, institutions are required to submit data on the enrolment of new students, to enable the regulatory agencies to keep track of their performance in a process commonly referred to as "indexing." When students begin their training, key demographic data are collected, including county of origin, secondary school, date of birth and gender. Regulatory agencies use data provided on each student to ensure that the students meet the minimum qualifications set by the agency for entry into the various training programs. Regulatory agencies assign each student an index number, which serves as a unique identifier for that individual through graduation and into their career.</li>
                            <li><strong>III. Internship and licensing examinations:</strong> After students show proof of completing the approved training, regulatory agencies recommend certain health professional students for internship posting by the Ministry of Health, whereas other cadres proceed directly to licensure examinations.</li>
                            <li><strong>IV. Licensing and registration:</strong> Students who have passed their national qualifying exams (when required) and the stipulated internship period (when required) are allowed to apply for licensing and registration.</li>
                            <li><strong>V. Regulation of registered professionals:</strong> Regulation of the health workforce is a continuous quality control measure. Regulatory agencies maintain and update registers of active health professionals.</li>
                            <li><strong>VI. Disciplinary actions:</strong> The regulatory agencies are responsible for investigating disciplinary cases and administering disciplinary actions against health professionals who are found culpable.</li>
                            <li><strong>VII. Immigration and out-migration:</strong> Regulatory agencies oversee the immigration and out-migration of health professionals in Kenya. They are responsible for determining suitability of foreign-trained health professionals who apply for licensure to practice in Kenya. In that regard, regulatory agencies administer various competence tests, additional training, and internship to foreign-trained professionals to match Kenya’s quality requirement.</li>
                            <li><strong>VIII. Health facility inspections:</strong> The regulatory agencies inspect private and public health facilities to guarantee quality healthcare. They conduct periodic joint inspections of private healthcare facilities in conjunction with the Ministry of Health to ensure quality healthcare standards are achieved</li>
                        </ul>
