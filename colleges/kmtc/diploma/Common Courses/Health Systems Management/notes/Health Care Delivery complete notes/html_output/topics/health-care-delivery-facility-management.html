                        <span class="heading-text">Community Participation</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Community participation can be loosely defined as the involvement of people in a community in projects to solve their own problems. People cannot be forced to 'participate' in projects which affect their lives but should be given the opportunity where possible. This is held to be a basic human right and a fundamental principle of democracy. Community participation is especially important in emergency sanitation programmes where people maybe unaccustomed to their surroundings and new sanitation facilities.</p>

                        <h4>Community participation can take place during any of the following activities:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Needs assessment</strong> --expressing opinions about desirable improvements, prioritising goals and negotiating with agencies</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning</strong>- formulating objectives, setting goals, criticising plans.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobilising</strong>- raising awareness in a community about needs, establishing or supporting organisational structures within the community.</li>
                            <li><strong>Training</strong> - participation in formal or informal training activities to enhance communication, construction, maintenance and financial management skills</li>
                            <li><strong>Implementing</strong>- engaging in management activities; contributing directly to construction, operation and maintenance with labour and materials; contributing cash towards costs, paying of services or membership fees of community organisations</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation</strong> - participating in the appraisal of work done, recognising improvements that can be made and redefining needs</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Incentives of community participation</h4>
                        <p>The following are some of the main reasons why people are usually willing to participate in humanitarian programmes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Community participation motivates people to work together - people feel a sense of community and recognise the benefits of their involvement.</li>
                            <li>Social, religious or traditional obligations for mutual help Genuine community participation - people see a genuine opportunity to better their own lives and for the community as a whole</li>
                            <li>Remuneration in cash or kind ..</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There are often strong genuine reasons why people wish to participate in programmes. All too often aid workers assume that people will only do anything for remuneration and have no genuine concern for their own predicament or that of the community as a whole. This is often the result of the actions of the agency itself, in throwing money or food at community Members without meaningful dialogue or consultation. Remuneration is an acceptable incentive but is usually not the only, or even the primary, motivation</p>

                        <p>The intention of the decentralization policy is to enable the community to participate effectively in decision making processes related to matters of health at the community level, as well as at the interface between level 1 and levels 2 and 3. The lower levels of care (levels 2 and 3) are more or less consistent with the administrative and development nodes within the community.</p>
                        <p>Health facility management committees, made up of community representatives and the facility in-charges, should meet at least monthly.</p>
                        <p>The committees will review progress from the indicators and baselines generated through the CBIS and FBIS and make decisions for continued actions for health, at facility, community, household, political and administrative levels</p>

                        <h4>Participation of communities in health management at tier 1</h4>
                        <h5>Community Health extension workers (CHEWs)</h5>
                        <p>Community health extension workers (CHEWs) tend to be recruited by the health system and assigned to the local structures. Main roles include training and continued support for the CHWS according to the felt needs of the community. They include P.H.Technitian, P.H.Nurse, and P.H.Officer</p>
                        <p>The CHEWs are based at a health facility but assigned to work within a specific sub-location to ensure acceptable standards of care at level 1. They provide continuing training to CHWS through demonstration and instruction based on immediate learning needs. They thus train the CHWS on the job as they provide services at level</p>
                        <p>This is why the CHEWs are referred to as "coaches" of the CHWS. This is the essence of the community system</p>
                        <p>Their tasks will therefore include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Training CORPs using problem-based learning methods in service contexts.</li>
                            <li>Implementing NHSSP III and the KEPH at level 1.</li>
                            <li>Organizing and facilitating community animation and mobilization.</li>
                            <li>Carrying out evidence-based management of service delivery at level 1, grounded in a continuous improvement strategy.</li>
                            <li>Supporting CORPs in recognition and classification of health problems and action to resolve them.</li>
                            <li>Promoting inter-sector action for health, working with various extension workers.</li>
                            <li>Facilitating health promotion through advocacy, social mobilization and interactive communication to improve key household practices for health.</li>
                            <li>Functioning as link person between communities and the health system.</li>
                            <li>Carrying out immunization, family planning, antenatal care, home delivery, disease surveillance, treatment of common conditions, prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, STI, TB, and promotion of school health.</li>
                            <li>Managing resources, and storing and distributing commodities and supplies for CORPs.</li>

                        <h4>HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION</h4>
                        <p>A hospital is a multifaceted organization comprising many committees, departments, types of personnel, and services.</p>

                        <p>The medical staff is a formally organized self-governing unit within the hospital, primarily comprised of physicians, but may also include other doctoral level health care professionals such as dentists or psychologists</p>
