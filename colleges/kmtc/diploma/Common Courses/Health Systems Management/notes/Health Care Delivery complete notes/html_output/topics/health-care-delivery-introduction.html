                        <p>A health system consists of all organizations, institutions, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health" (WHO, 2007)</p>
                        <p>Broadly a health system includes the resources, actors and institutions related to the financing, regulation and provision of health actions.</p>
                        <p>A HEALTH SYSTEM may be described as A set of cultural beliefs about health and illness that forms the basis for health-seeking and Health-promoting behavior; The Institutional arrangements within which that behavior occurs; and the socioeconomic/political/physical context for those beliefs and institutions.</p>
                        <p>In short, it consists of what people believe and know about health and illness and what they do to remain healthy and cure diseases. Beliefs and action are usually closely connected. For example, if in a society people perceive evil ancestor-spirits as a cause of disease, there will be specialists and rituals to appease those spirits. If they see germs as the cause, they will look for modern (biomedical) health care. If biomedical health care is a recent introduction, people may accept services, but the beliefs and knowledge to support this behavior may not have been fully developed.</p>
                        <p>Health workers therefore should be aware of the indigenous explanations for illness, so that "biomedical" explanations can be adapted to these more deeply rooted indigenous concepts. Institutional arrangements within which health behavior occurs encompass more than the delivery of medical care through governmental health services. They include all individuals, groups, and institutions that directly or indirectly contribute to health. It may differ from society to society but usually covers the following;</p>
