                <div class="content-card">
                    <p><strong>A Hazard:</strong> A hazard is a dangerous phenomenon, substance, human activity or condition that may cause the loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>A Natural Hazard:</strong> Natural processes or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>A Geological Hazard:</strong> Geological process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technological Hazard:</strong> A hazard originating from technological or industrial conditions, including accidents, dangerous procedures, infrastructure failures or specific human activities, that may cause loss of life, injury, illness or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>A Disaster:</strong> A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community/ society to cope using its own resources.</p>
                    <p><strong>A Disaster Risk:</strong> The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disaster Risk Management:</strong> The systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disaster Risk Reduction:</strong> The concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analyzing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend.</p>
                    <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variabilities of its properties and that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate Change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adaptation to Climate Change:</strong> The adjustment in natural or human activities in responses to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that makes it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard.</p>
                    <p>Disaster occurs when a hazard results in devastation that leaves communities or even whole nations unable to cope unaided but disasters are neither inevitable nor 'natural'. There is no such thing as a 'natural' disaster. Many hazards are natural and usually inevitable, like cyclones, floods, droughts and earthquakes. They are 'hazards' in that they can potentially harm people, economies and the environment if they are not adequately prepared.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, the world has witnessed an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of disasters. Disaster cases are rising throughout the world due to a number of factors that include:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>more frequent extreme weather events</li>
                        <li>agricultural production systems that increase risk</li>
                        <li>population growth combined with demographic change and movements leading, for instance, unplanned urbanization, growing demand for food, industrial goods and services; and</li>
                        <li>Over-exploitation of natural resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While better emergency response systems will save lives and properties, many of these losses can be avoided - or reduced - if appropriate policies and programmes are instituted to address the root causes and set in place mitigation, preparedness and response mechanisms that are effectively integrated into overall development planning. These issues were debated during the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (January 2005). It was therefore insisted on the need to move from theory to concrete action in disaster risk reduction.</p>

                        <li>closely related terms</li>
                        <li>However, a hazard is a natural event while the disaster is its consequence</li>
                        <li>"Hazard" refers to the event which may cause disaster</li>
                        <li>They could be either man-made or naturally occurring hazards in our environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Disaster</strong> is combination of two words: 'des' meaning evil and 'astre' meaning star. Disaster therefore means evil star. A complete definition of disaster provided by Turner (1976) as 'an event, concentrated in time and space,which threatens a society or a subdivision of a society with major unwanted consequences as a result of the collapse of precautions which had hitherto been culturally accepted as adequate'</p>
                    <p>Common definition: major misfortune which disrupts the normal functioning of the society</p>
                    <p><strong>Emergency:</strong> The term 'emergency' is used to describe the crisis which a community has great difficulty to cope with. External assistance is needed to cope with the emergencies. e.g. political emergency, drought, famine etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Calamity:</strong> Calamity is defined as deep distress, disaster to a lesser degree of damage, which disrupts the normal functioning of the people of a society</p>
                    <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> "Vulnerability" basically means susceptibility of a population or system (e.g., a hospital, water supply and sewage system, or aspects of infrastructure) to the effects of the hazard. "The extent to which a community, structure, service or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted by the impact of particular disaster hazard...". Its magnitude is expressed on a scale from 0.0 (No damage or loss) to 1.0 (total loss).</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The probability that a particular system or population will be affected by hazards is known as the "risk." Risk is a function of the vulnerability and the hazard, and is expressed as follows:</p>
                    <p class="equation">Risk = Vulnerability × Hazard.</p>
                    <p>It means, the risk increases if the vulnerability of the population or the systems is more; and also of the magnitude of the hazard is more.</p>

                    <h3>Preparatory phase</h3>
                    <p>The preparatory phase of disaster response includes all of the activities that help a society and the disaster agencies to prepare for a disaster event. These activities are broadly classified as:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li><strong>disaster prevention:</strong> The objective of prevention is to prevent the disaster from occurring.</li>
                        <li><strong>disaster mitigation:</strong> Disaster mitigation accepts that some natural event may occur, but it tries to lessen the impact by improving the common ability.</li>
                        <li><strong>disaster preparedness:</strong> Disaster preparedness assumes that a disaster will occur, it focuses on structuring the emergency response and on laying a framework for recovery.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Disaster mitigation</h3>
                    <p>Disaster Mitigation is essentially measures taken in advance of a disaster aimed at minimizing or eliminating the impact of disaster on community and environment. 2 components: reducing hazard and reducing vulnerability</p>

                    <h4>Reducing hazard vs reducing vulnerability</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reducing hazard:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>protection against threat by removing the cause of threat</li>
                        <li>Eg. Construction of levees along banks of river to reduce chance of flooding</li>
                        <li>Tree plantation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Reducing vulnerability:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>reducing the effect of threat</li>
                        <li>Eg. Constructing buildings as per bylaws in NBC</li>
                        <li>Most of the natural hazards are unpreventable, therefore, we mostly work towards reducing vulnerability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Disaster Mitigation Measures:</h4>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Passive mitigation measure</li>

                    <h5>Passive mitigation measures:</h5>
                    <p>Authorities prevent undesired actions through controls and penalties by:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Requirement to conform with design codes</li>
                        <li>Checking compliance of controls on-site</li>
                        <li>Imposing court proceedings, fines, closure orders on offenders</li>
                        <li>Control of land use</li>
                        <li>Denial of utilities and infrastructure to areas where development is undesired</li>
                        <li>Compulsory insurance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Requirements of passive control systems</h5>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>An existing and enforceable system of control</li>
                        <li>Acceptance by the affected community of the objectives and the authority imposing the controls</li>
                        <li>The economic capability of the affected community to comply with the regulations.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h5>Active mitigation measures</h5>
                    <p>Authorities promote desired actions through incentives like:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Planning control dispensations</li>

                        <li>Economic assistance (grants and preferential loans)</li>
                        <li>Subsidies on safety equipment, safer building materials, etc.</li>
                        <li>Provision of facilities: safer buildings, refuge points, storage</li>
                        <li>Public information dissemination and awareness raising</li>
                        <li>Promotion of voluntary insurance</li>
                        <li>Creation of community organizations</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Active Programs</h5>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Aim to create a self-perpetuating safety culture in areas of weak authority or poor ability to comply with existing controls.</li>
                        <li>Require large budgets, skilled manpower and extensive administration.</li>
                        <li>Are useful in areas of low income, rural areas or elsewhere where there is no external jurisdiction over land use or building activity.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Capabilities:</h3>
                    <p>When conducting vulnerability analysis, special note should be taken of positive attributes able to be identified that may contribute to an enhanced ability to prevent or mitigate the effects of a disaster, or which may strengthen a community's ability to respond effectively to the hazard</p>

                    <p>Risk management has three components namely:</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Risk identification</li>
                        <li>Risk reduction</li>
                        <li>Risk transfer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Risk identification has to be done through mapping and using other available technological options. It is usual to allocate risk management to special body at national level. Usually, it is a national disaster management organization at national level. Others support should be obtained within a National Action Plan for disaster management. At local, it may be the responsibility of a disaster mitigation committee, which administers risk management.</p>
                    <h3>Risk reduction:</h3>
                    <p>Effective risk reduction involves mitigation measures in hazard prone areas. It may also involve overcoming the socio-economic, institutional and political barriers to the adoption of effective risk reduction strategies and measures in developing countries.</p>
                    <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                    <p>This is the process by which assessed risks are mitigated, minimized or controlled through engineering, management of land use practices or other operational means. This involves the optimal allocation of available resources in support of group goals</p>
                    <h3>Risk Transfer:</h3>
                    <p>Effective risk transfer involves different tools such as insurances; tax polices special measures focused on land management. Organizational structures, policies, legislation etc is required for effective implementation of risk transfer strategies for a country or local government areas.</p>
