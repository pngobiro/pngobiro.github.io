                    <p>Kenya's health system has undergone significant change and reform in recent years and with the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution will continue to evolve. Even so, the system will reflect the inter-linked levels of national, provincial, district, sub-district and community. (These levels of local administration are subject to change in line with the implementation of the new Constitution of Kenya 2010, which provides for devolution of both authority and financial resources). The national level is made up of the MOMS and MOPHS headquarters, with the provincial level serving as de-concentrated units of the national level. (Figures 3.1 and 3.2 outline the organization of the Ministry of Medical Services and the Ministry Public Health and Sanitation, respectively.)</p>
                    <p>The government health service is supplemented by privately owned and operated hospitals and clinics and faith-based organisations’ hospitals and clinics, which together provide between 30 and 40 percent of the hospital beds in Kenya.</p>
                    <p>The functions of the national level are:</p>
                    <ol class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Strategic planning and policy formulation,</li>

                        <li>Ensuring commodity security,</li>
                        <li>Performance monitoring,</li>
                        <li>Capacity strengthening,</li>

                        <li>Operational and other research</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The oversight and policy formulation functions are managed through the Ministers and Assistant Ministers. The Permanent Secretary (PS) is the link between the technical, administrative and oversight functions, while the Director of Medical Services (DMS) and the Director of Public Health and Sanitation (DPHS) are the coordinators of the technical functions of the respective ministries. The DMS and the DPHS execute their functions through the departments in the respective ministries. These departments are further divided into divisions as illustrated in the figures below.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of an organizational structure is to define the guidelines, parameters and the procedural process necessary for a group to accomplish a main objective. For example, the anatomy of an organizational structure is further reduced to the distribution of authority, span-of-control, and line vs. staff structures, organizational height and departmentalization.</p>
                    <p>An organizational structure organizes priorities hierarchically by means of identifying tasks critical to a group realizing an end goal. An organizational structure may adopt a live structure or a staff structure or both to achieve their main objectives. A line structure, sometimes called a product structure, identifies the activities directly responsible for the organization's main goal, such as the labor involved in making an actually product. A staff structure is the support staff or network assisting the line structures in their goals.</p>

                    <span class="heading-text">The Health Care System</span>
                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>The health sector comprises the public system, with major players including the MOH and parastatal organisations, and the private sector, which includes private for-profit, NGO, and FBO facilities. Health services are provided through a network of over 4,700 health facilities countrywide, with the public sector system accounting for about 51 percent of these facilities.</p>
                    <p>The public health system consists of the following levels of health facilities: national referral hospitals, provincial general hospitals, district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries.</p>
                    <p>National referral hospitals are at the apex of the health care system, providing sophisticated diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. The two national referral hospitals are Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital in Eldoret. The equivalent private referral hospitals are Nairobi Hospital and Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.</p>
                    <p>Provincial hospitals act as referral hospitals to their district hospitals. They also provide very specialized care. The provincial level acts as an intermediary between the national central level and the districts. They oversee the implementation of health policy at the district level, maintain quality standards, and coordinate and control all district health activities. Similar private hospitals at the provincial level include Aga Khan Hospitals in Kisumu and Mombasa.</p>
                    <p>District hospitals concentrate on the delivery of health care services and generate their own expenditure plans and budget requirements based on guidelines from headquarters through the provinces.</p>
                    <p>The network of health centres provides many of the ambulatory health services. Health centres generally offer preventive and curative services, mostly adapted to local needs. Dispensaries are meant to be the system's first line of contact with patients, but in some areas, health centres or even hospitals are effectively the first points of contact. Dispensaries provide wider coverage for preventive health measures, which is a primary goal of the health policy.</p>
                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                        <li>Kenya's health care provision and implementation infrastructure include the national teaching hospital, provincial hospitals, district and sub district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries, community health services</li>
                        <li>There is also a host of other operators within the private, non-governmental, and traditional/informal sectors.</li>
                        <li>The system is a hierarchical-pyramidal organization comprising five levels, the lowest being the village dispensary and the Kenyatta National Hospital at the apex.</li>
                        <li>The mandate for supervision, formulation of policies, establishment and enforcement of standards, and mobilization of resources for health care rests with the Ministry of Health</li>
                        <li>The country has eight provinces divided into lower levels of administrations called districts, which are responsible for delivering health services and implementing health programs.</li>
                        <li>Under the decentralization strategy, districts form the central pillars of the public health system.</li>
                        <li>Management of healthcare at the district level is headed by a District Medical Officer of Health (DMOH) appointed by the Ministry of Health.</li>
                        <li>The DMOH is supported by a District Health Management Board (DHMB) comprising officials appointed by the MOH and from local areas, and a professional unit, the District Health Management Team (DHMT).</li>
                        <li>The DHMT prepares technical advisories and the District Health Plan in consultation with local health actors and the DHMB.</li>
                        <li>According to the most recent health management information system (HMIS) data, there are over 9470 health facilities across the country operated by three owner systems.</li>
                        <li>The government running 43% of the facilities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 3.4%, and private businesses 37% all other ownership is 16.6%</li>
                        <li>The government owns most of the hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries, while clinics and nursing homes are entirely in the hands of the private sector.</li>
