\section*{LONG ANSWER QUESTION (20 MARKS)}
1. Dr. Mohammed is a County Director of Health Services in Kwale County of Coast region. The county serves a population of 120,000 . He spends all his time at the hospital where he handles essentially curative cases. Last month (January) alone, he treated many children suffering from diarrhea. All of them were from Kinango sub-county situated 35 kilometers from the country referral hospital. Dr. Mohammed has no information on Kinango which he last visited two years before. He likes curative care so much that he hardly moves out to supervise the health facilities in his area of jurisdiction or to attend health committee meetings. Therefore, he has no information on the population that his hospital is supposed to cover.

b) In reality, does this happen? Gives reasons for your answer
c) What information should Dr. Mohammed have on the health of his community?
