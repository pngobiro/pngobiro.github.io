5. An epidemic usually affecting a large proportion of the population, occuring over a wide geographic area such as a section of a nation is referred to as pandemic
6. Zoonosis an infection that is transmissible under natural conditions from vertebrate animals to man
7. The action taken prior to the onset of disease, which removes the possibility that the disease will ever occur is the tertiary level of disease prevention
