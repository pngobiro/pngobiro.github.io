                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Level of disease</h3>
                        <p>The amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community is the baseline level of the disease. This level is not necessarily the preferred level, which should in fact be zero; rather it is the observed level. Theoretically, if no intervention occurred and if the level is low enough not to deplete the pool of susceptible persons, the disease occurrence should continue at the baseline level indefinitely. Thus, the baseline level is often considered the expected level of the disease.</p>
                        <p>Different diseases, in different communities, show different patterns of expected occurrence:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a persistent level of occurrence with a low to moderate disease level is referred to as an <dfn>endemic</dfn> level;</li>
                            <li>a persistently high level of occurrence is called a <dfn>hyperendemic</dfn> level;</li>
                            <li>an irregular pattern of occurrence, with occasional cases occurring at irregular intervals is called <dfn>sporadic</dfn>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Occasionally, the level of disease rises above the expected level. When the occurrence of a disease within an area is clearly in excess of the expected level for a given time period, it is called an <dfn>epidemic</dfn>. Public health officials often use the term <dfn>outbreak</dfn>, which means the same thing, because it is less provocative to the public. When an epidemic spreads over several countries or continents, affecting a large number of people, it is called a <dfn>pandemic</dfn>. Epidemics occur when an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers, and the agent can effectively be conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts. More specifically, an epidemic may result from the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a recent increase in amount or virulence of the agent</li>
                            <li>the recent introduction of the agent into a setting where it has not been before</li>
                            <li>an enhanced mode of transmission so that more susceptibles are exposed</li>
                            <li>some change in the susceptibility of the host response to the agent</li>
                            <li>factors that increase host exposure or involve introduction through new portals of entry</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Epidemic patterns</h3>
                        <p>We sometimes classify epidemics by how they spread through a population, as shown below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Common source</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Point</li>
                                    <li>Intermittent</li>
                                    <li>Continuous</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Propagated</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Mixed</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Other</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A <dfn>common source outbreak</dfn> is one in which a group of persons is exposed to a common noxious influence, such as an infectious agent or a toxin. If the group is exposed over a relatively brief period, so that everyone who becomes ill develops disease at the end of one incubation period, then the common source outbreak is further classified as a <dfn>point source outbreak</dfn>. When the number of cases in a point source epidemic is plotted over time, the resulting epidemic curve classically has a steep upslope and a more gradual downslope (a so-called "log-normal distribution").</p>
                        <p>In some common source outbreaks, cases may be exposed over a period of days, weeks, or longer, with the exposure being either intermittent or continuous. When we plot the cases of a continuous common source outbreak over time, the range of exposures and range of incubation periods tend to dampen and widen the peaks of the epidemic curve. Similarly, when we plot an intermittent common source outbreak we often find an irregular pattern that reflects the intermittent nature of the exposure.</p>
                        <p>An outbreak that does not have a common source, but instead spreads gradually from person to person-usually growing as it spreads-is called a <dfn>propagated outbreak</dfn>. Usually transmission is by direct person-to-person contact, as with syphilis.</p>
                        <p>Transmission may also be vehicle-borne, as the transmission of hepatitis B or HIV by sharing needles, or vector-borne, as the transmission of yellow fever by mosquitoes. In a propagated epidemic, cases occur over more than one incubation period. In theory, the epidemic curve of a propagated epidemic would have a successive series of peaks reflecting increasing numbers of cases in each generation. The epidemic usually wanes after a few generations, either because the number of susceptibles falls below some critical level, or because intervention measures become effective.</p>
                        <p>Some epidemics may have features of both common source epidemics and propagated epidemics. The pattern of a common source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person spread is not uncommon. These are called <dfn>mixed epidemics</dfn>.</p>
                        <p>Finally, some epidemics are neither common source in its usual sense nor propagated from person-to-person. Outbreaks of zoonotic or vector-borne disease may result from sufficient prevalence of infection in host species, sufficient presence of vectors, and sufficient human vector interaction.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">The Epidemiologic Approach</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An epidemiologist determines What, When, Where, Who, and Why. However, the epidemiologist is more likely to describe these concepts in slightly different terms: case definition, time, place, person, and causes.</p>
                        <p>As with all scientific endeavors, the practice of epidemiology relies on a systematic approach. In very simple terms, the epidemiologist:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Counts cases or health events, and describes them in terms of time, place, and person;</li>
                            <li>Divides the number of cases by an appropriate denominator to calculate rates; and</li>
                            <li>Compares these rates over time or for different groups of people.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Before counting cases, however, the epidemiologist must decide what a case is. This is done by developing a case definition. Then, using this case definition, the epidemiologist finds and collects information about the case-patients. The epidemiologist then performs descriptive epidemiology by characterizing the cases collectively according to time, place, and person.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Case Definition</h4>
                        <p>A <dfn>case definition</dfn> is a set of standard criteria for deciding whether a person has a particular disease or other health-related condition. By using a standard case definition we ensure that every case is diagnosed in the same way, regardless of when or where it occurred, or who identified it. We can then compare the number of cases of the disease that occurred in one time or place with the number that occurred at another time or another place.</p>
                        <p>With a standard case definition, when we find a difference in disease occurrence, we know it is likely to be a real difference rather than the result of differences in how cases were diagnosed.</p>
                        <p>A case definition consists of clinical criteria and, sometimes, limitations on time, place, and person. The clinical criteria usually include confirmatory laboratory tests, if available, or combinations of symptoms (subjective complaints), signs (objective physical findings), and other findings.</p>
                        <p>A case definition may have several sets of criteria, depending on how certain the diagnosis is. For example, during an outbreak of measles, we might classify a person with a fever and rash as having a suspect, probable, or confirmed case of measles, depending on what additional evidence of measles was present. In other situations, we temporarily classify a case as suspect or probable until laboratory results are available. When we receive the laboratory report, we then reclassify the case as either confirmed or "not a case," depending on the lab results. In the midst of a large outbreak of a disease caused by a known agent, we may permanently classify some cases as suspect or probable, because it is unnecessary and wasteful to run laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., chickenpox).</p>
                        <p>Case definitions should not rely on laboratory culture results alone, since organisms are sometimes present without causing disease.</p>
                        <p>Case definitions may also vary according to the purpose for classifying the occurrences of a disease. For example, health officials need to know as soon as possible if anyone has symptoms of plague or foodborne botulism so that they can begin planning what actions to take. For such rare but potentially severe communicable diseases, where it is important to identify every possible case, health officials use a sensitive, or "loose" case definition.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, investigators of the causes of a disease outbreak want to be certain that any person included in the investigation really had the disease. The investigator will prefer a specific or "strict" case definition. For instance, in an outbreak of Salmonella agona, the investigators would be more likely to identify the source of the infection if they included only persons who were confirmed to have been infected with that organism, rather than including anyone with acute diarrhoea, because some persons may have had diarrhoea from a different cause. In this setting, the only disadvantage of a strict case definition is an underestimate of the total number of cases.</p>

                        <h4>Time</h4>
                        <p>Disease rates change over time. Some of these changes occur regularly and can be predicted. For example, the seasonal increase of influenza cases with the onset of cold weather is a pattern that is familiar to everyone. By knowing when flu outbreaks will occur, health departments can time their flu shot campaigns effectively. Other disease rates make unpredictable changes. By examining events that precede a disease rate increase or decrease, we may identify causes and appropriate actions to control or prevent further occurrence of the disease. Depending on what event we are describing, we may be interested in a period of years or decades, or we may limit the period to days, weeks, or months when the number of cases reported is greater than normal (an epidemic period).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Secular (long-term) trends.</strong> Graphing the annual cases or rate of a disease over a period of years shows long-term or secular trends in the occurrence of the disease. We commonly use these trends to suggest or predict the future incidence of a disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seasonality.</strong> By graphing the occurrence of a disease by week or month over the course of a year or more we can show its seasonal pattern, if any. Some diseases are known to have characteristic seasonal distributions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Day of week and time of day.</strong> Displaying data by days of the week or time of day may also be informative. Analysis at these shorter time periods is especially important for conditions that are potentially related to occupational or environmental exposures, which may occur at regularly scheduled intervals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Epidemic period.</strong> To show the time course of a disease outbreak or epidemic, we use a specialized graph called an epidemic curve.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Place</h4>
                        <p>We describe a health event by place to gain insight into the geographical extent of the problem. For place, we may use place of residence, birthplace, place of employment, school district, hospital unit, etc., depending on which may be related to the occurrence of the health event. Similarly, we may use large or small geographic units: country, state, county, census tract, street address, map coordinates, or some other standard geographical designation. Sometimes, we may find it useful to analyse data according to place categories such as urban or rural, domestic or foreign, and institutional or non-institutional.</p>

                        <h4>Person</h4>
                        <p>In descriptive epidemiology, when we organize or analyse data by "person" there are several person categories available to us. We may use inherent characteristics of people (for example, age, race, sex), their acquired characteristics (immune or marital status), their activities (occupation, leisure activities, use of medications/tobacco/drugs), or the conditions under which they live (socioeconomic status, access to medical care). These categories determine to a large degree who is at greatest risk of experiencing some undesirable health condition, such as becoming infected with a particular disease organism. We may show person data in either tables or graphs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Age.</strong> Age is probably the single most important "person" attribute, because almost every health-related event or state varies with age. A number of factors that also vary with age are behind this association: susceptibility, opportunity for exposure, latency or incubation period of the disease, and physiologic response (which affects, among other things, disease development).</li>
                            <li><strong>Sex.</strong> In general, males have higher rates of illness and death than females do for a wide range of diseases. For some diseases, this sex-related difference is because of genetic, hormonal, anatomic, or other inherent differences between the sexes. These inherent differences affect their susceptibility or physiologic responses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethnic and racial groups.</strong> In examining epidemiologic data, we are interested in any group of people who have lived together long enough to acquire common characteristics, either biologically or socially. Several terms are commonly used to identify such groups: race, nationality, religion, or local reproductive or social groups, such as tribes and other geographically or socially isolated groups.</li>
                            <li><strong>Socioeconomic status.</strong> Socioeconomic status is difficult to quantify. It is made up of many variables such as occupation, family income, educational achievement, living conditions, and social standing. The variables that are easiest to measure may not reflect the overall concept. Nevertheless, we commonly use occupation, family income, and educational achievement, while recognizing that these do not measure socioeconomic status precisely.</li>

                        <p>Epidemiology and the information generated by epidemiologic methods have many uses. These uses are categorized and described below.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Population or community health assessment.</strong> To set policy and plan programs, public health officials must assess the health of the population or community they serve and must determine whether health services are available, accessible, effective, and efficient. To do this, they must find answers to many questions: What are the actual and potential health problems in the community? Where are they? Who is at risk? Which problems are declining over time? Which ones are increasing or have the potential to increase? How do these patterns relate to the level and distribution of services available?</li>
                            <li><strong>Individual decisions.</strong> People may not realize that they use epidemiologic information in their daily decisions. When they decide to stop smoking, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or choose one method of contraception instead of another, they may be influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by epidemiologists' assessment of risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Completing the clinical picture.</strong> When studying a disease outbreak, epidemiologists depend on clinical physicians and laboratory scientists for the proper diagnosis of individual patients. But epidemiologists also contribute to physicians' understanding of the clinical picture and natural history of disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Search for causes.</strong> Much of epidemiologic research is devoted to a search for causes, factors which influence one's risk of disease. Sometimes this is an academic pursuit, but more often the goal is to identify a cause so that appropriate public health action might be taken. It has been said that epidemiology can never prove a causal relationship between an exposure and a disease. Nevertheless, epidemiology often provides enough information to support effective action.</li>
                            <li>Identify the risk factors/cause of a disease</li>
                            <li>Determine the extent to which the disease is found in the community</li>

                        <h4>Odds</h4>
                        <p>Similar to cumulative incidence but rather than use the number of disease free people at the beginning of the period (population at risk), we use number of disease free people at end of the specified time for the denominator.</p>
                        <p>Odds of disease = number of new cases during a period / number of people still disease free by end of period</p>

                            <h4>Note</h4>
                            <p>Both cumulative incidence/risk and odds assume that the population at risk is followed up over a specified time period. Also assumed is that the those who were included at the start of the period are counted at the end. This is called a closed population or a cohort.</p>

                        <h4>Incidence Rate/Density</h4>
                        <p>Defined as the number of newly reported cases of a given disease in a calendar year divided by the population on July 1 of that year, with the quotient multiplied by a convenient factor, usually, 1000, 100,000, or 1,000,000.</p>
                        <p>IR = Number of NEW cases of disease during a period / Total person-time at risk in this period of observation</p>
                        <p>Also called force of morbidity or incidence density. The denominator is a measure of time - the sum of each individual's time at risk and free from disease.</p>
                        <p>Incidence rate must take into account; the number of individuals who become ill in a population, and the time periods experienced by members of the population during which the events occur. Incidence rate looks at incidence in dynamic/open population where people enter and exit population at risk at different points, follow up for long periods, and people are at risk for different lengths. Instead of counting the disease free individuals at the start, the time that each individual spends in the study before becoming a case is calculated. This is called the person time at risk.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Comparing Incidence and Prevalence</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Incidence:</strong> New cases or events over period of time. Useful studying factors causing disease, disease "risk".</li>
                            <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> All cases at point/period of time. Useful for measuring size of problem and planning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Relationship of Incidence to Prevalence:</strong> Prevalence depends on both on incidence rate and duration of disease. Because prevalence affected by factors such as migration and duration, incidence is preferred for studying etiology.</p>

                        <h4>Special types of Incidence</h4>
                        <p><strong>Morbidity rate</strong> = # cases / Population at risk</p>
                        <p><strong>Mortality rate</strong> = # deaths / Population at risk</p>
                        <p><strong>Case Fatality rate</strong> = # deaths from a disease / Total cases of that disease</p>
                        <p><strong>Attack rate</strong> = # cases during "epidemic" / Population at risk</p>
                        
                        <h4>Attack Rate</h4>
                        <p>An attack rate is an incidence rate calculated for a specific disease for a limited period of time during an epidemic. Usually expressed for the entire epidemic period, from the first to the last case.</p>
                        <p><strong>Attack Rate</strong> = Number of new cases of a specified disease reported during an epidemic period of time / Population at risk during the same time interval</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondary Attack Rate</strong> = Number of new cases of a specified disease among contacts of known cases / Size of contact population at risk</p>

                            <p>Seven cases of hepatitis A occurred among 70 children attending a childcare center. Each infected child came from a different family.

                        <p>When the event under study is death rather than the occurrence of disease, we usually use the term mortality (rate) rather than cumulative incidence. Each rate is a measure of the relative frequency of deaths that occurred in a given population over a specific period. Mortality Rate - must know the population and time at risk to compute the mortality rate.</p>
