                        <h3>Definition of epidemiology and its origin</h3>
                        <p>The word epidemiology comes from the Greek words epi, meaning "on or upon," demos, meaning "people," and logos, meaning "the study of." Many definitions have been proposed, but the following definition captures the underlying principles and the public health spirit of epidemiology:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Epidemiology- Greek</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Epi:</strong> 'on, upon, at, by, near, over, on top of, against, among';</li>
                            <li><strong>demos:</strong> 'people/populations'</li>
                            <li><strong>logos/ology:</strong> 'study of'</li>
                            <li><strong>Epidemiology</strong> is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the prevention and control of health problems. (Last, 1995)</li>
                            <li>The study of the patterns, causes, and control of disease in groups of people</li>
                            <li>Study of how disease is distributed in populations and the factors that influence this distribution</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Why a study?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Epidemiology relies on scientific methods to apply a systematic approach to the collection, analysis and interpretation of data.</li>
                            <li>The main basis of epidemiology is using an observation and comparison group to determine if whether what is observed (distribution and determinants) differs from what is expected.</li>
                            <li>Epidemiology also depends on methods from other fields such as economics, social and behavioural sciences, biology, biostatistiscs, informatics etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Why distribution?</h4>
                        <p>In distribution we consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> This includes not only the number of health-related states or events but also their relation to the whole population.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> This includes disease occurrence in time, place or person:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> daily, weekly, monthly etc</li>
                                    <li><strong>Place:</strong> geography (rural, urban), work, school</li>
                                    <li><strong>Person:</strong> personal characteristics: age, sex, socio-economic status, etc</li>

                            <li>The underlying assumption of Epidemiology is that human disease does not occur in a vacuum.</li>
                            <li>Human disease occurs when a host (you and I), the agent (e.g. bacteria etc) and the environment (e.g. polluted air) interact to cause disease.</li>

                            <li>Epidemiology focuses on the health of communities or populations. This is unlike healthcare professionals who focus on the health of an individual. Epidemiology is about groups of people not individuals. It answers population questions such as:</li>
                            <li>aetiology of disease</li>
                            <li>prevention of disease</li>

                            <li><strong>Circa 400 B.C.</strong> - Hippocrates attempts to explain there is a rational cause for disease rather than supernatural forces. He suggests that the environment and host factors may influence disease occurrence.</li>
                            <li><strong>1662</strong> - John Graunt, a Londoner haberdasher and councilman published his analysis of mortality data in 1662. His data noted difference in mortality patterns in males, females and infants.</li>
                            <li><strong>1854</strong> - An anesthesiologist named John Snow was conducting a series of investigations in London that later earned him the title "the father of field epidemiology." Twenty years before the development of the microscope, Snow conducted studies of cholera outbreaks both to discover the cause of disease and to prevent its recurrence. Because his work classically illustrates the sequence from descriptive epidemiology to hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing (analytic epidemiology) to application, we will consider two of his efforts in detail. Snow conducted his classic study in 1854 when an epidemic of cholera developed in the Golden Square of London. He began his investigation by determining where in this area persons with cholera lived and worked. He then used this information to map the distribution of cases on what epidemiologists call a spot map as shown.</li>

                        <p><dfn>Epidemiology</dfn> is the study of factors affecting the health and illness of populations, and serves as the foundation and logic of interventions made in the interest of public health and preventive medicine. It is considered a cornerstone methodology of public health research, and is highly regarded in evidence-based medicine for identifying risk factors for disease and determining optimal treatment approaches to clinical practice.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Health</dfn> is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Illness</dfn> (sometimes referred to as ill-health or ail) can be defined as a state of poor health.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Logic</dfn> is the study of the principles of valid inference and demonstration. The word derives from Greek $\lambda o \gamma \imath \kappa \eta$ (logike), fem. of $\lambda o \gamma \imath \kappa o ́ \varsigma$ (logikos), "possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", from $\lambda ó \gamma o \varsigma$ logos, "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle".</p>
                        <p><dfn>Public health</dfn> is the study and practice of managing threats to the health of a community. The field pays special attention to the social context of disease and health, and focuses on improving health through society-wide measures like vaccinations, the fluoridation of drinking water, or through policies like seatbelt and non-smoking laws. The public-health approach can be applied to a population of just a handful of people or to the whole human population. Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and health are also important subfields.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, <dfn>preventive medicine</dfn> is the part of medicine engaged with preventing disease rather than curing it. It can be contrasted not only with curative medicine, but also with public health methods (which work at the level of population health rather than individual health).</p>
                        <p><dfn>Evidence-based medicine (EBM)</dfn> aims to apply evidence gained from the scientific method to certain parts of medical practice. It seeks to assess the quality of evidence relevant to the risks and benefits of treatments (including lack of treatment).</p>
