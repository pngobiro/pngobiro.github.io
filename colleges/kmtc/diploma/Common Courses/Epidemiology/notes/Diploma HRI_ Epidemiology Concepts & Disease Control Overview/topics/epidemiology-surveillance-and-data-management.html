                            <li>Epidemic is detected if the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values show indications of an epidemic</li>

                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Prepare for field work</strong> - by addressing scientific and investigative issues (review literatures about the issue), and management and operational issues (team formation and planning for logistics)</li>
                            <li><strong>Establish the existence of an outbreak</strong> - by checking reports if there are more cases than expected</li>
                            <li><strong>Verify the diagnosis</strong> - by reviewing the clinical findings and laboratory results</li>
                            <li><strong>Construct a working case definition</strong> - by designing standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the health condition of interest</li>
                            <li><strong>Find cases systematically and record information</strong> - by conducting passive surveillance and active surveillance to collect Identifying information, Demographic information, Clinical information, Risk factor information, Reporter information</li>
                            <li><strong>Perform descriptive epidemiology</strong> - by characterizing the occurrence by time, place, and person</li>
                            <li><strong>Develop hypotheses</strong> - by addressing the source of the agent, the mode (and vehicle or vector) of transmission, and the exposures that caused the disease. The hypotheses should be testable, since evaluating hypotheses is the next step in the investigation</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate hypotheses epidemiologically</strong> - by 1) comparing the hypotheses with the established facts or by using analytic epidemiology to quantify relationships and assess the role of chance; 2) using a combination of environmental evidence, laboratory science, and epidemiology</li>
                            <li><strong>Implement control and prevention measures</strong> - by 1) blocking the mode of transmission and 2) interrupting direct transmission through isolation, counselling and treatment</li>
                            <li><strong>Initiate or maintain surveillance</strong> - Monitor effectiveness of the intervention through routine collection, analysis and interpretation of data</li>
                            <li><strong>Communicate findings</strong> - by giving oral briefing for local authorities and written reports.</li>

                            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> to look at questions posed by research and accommodate changes or reporting definitions</li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A threshold is a marker that alerts public health officials to take action.</li>
                            <li>It uses past data to decide if an event is abnormal in order to identify possible outbreaks using surveillance data.</li>
                            <li>Although there are internationally accepted signals that constitute an alert for some conditions, there are no globally fixed criteria for all diseases to guide outbreak detection.</li>
                            <li>Diseases under elimination, e.g. a single cases of poliomyelitis, Guinea worm or ebola constitutes an alert.</li>
                            <li>Characteristics and settings of a population, such as overcrowded camp settings of displaced populations at risk following man-made or natural disasters. In such settings a single case of meningitis constitutes an alert.</li>
                            <li>For high frequency, less severe infectious diseases, several cases are normally expected in endemic settings and a single case is not abnormal. However, we would want to know and investigate further when a disease occurs at levels exceeding expectation (or "baseline") by a significant amount.</li>
                            <li>A threshold helps us decide if what we are seeing is abnormal and needs to be investigated further. Typhoid, for example, is a high-frequency disease in developing countries. Every reported case does not necessarily require a public health response.</li>
                            <li>Only when cases are clustering within a defined area or there is a substantial increase in the occurrence of cases is follow-up required.</li>

                            <li>Primary data is the original data collected for a specific purpose by or for an investigator.

                            <li>A Survey is defined as a research method used for collecting data from a pre-defined group of respondents to gain information and insights on various topics of interest.</li>
                            <li>Surveys can be carried out in many ways depending on the methodology chosen and the objectives to be achieved.</li>
                            <li>The Survey method is the technique of gathering data by asking questions to people who are thought to have desired information.</li>
                            <li>A formal list of questionnaire is prepared.</li>
                            <li>Surveys can be divided into two broad categories:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Questionnaires</strong> - are usually paper-and-pencil instruments that the respondent completes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Interviews</strong> - are completed by the interviewer based on the respondent says</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>There are three main types of longitudinal survey:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Trend surveys</strong> - In a trend study we compare sample surveys describing the same population at two or more points in time</li>
                                    <li><strong>Panel surveys</strong> - is a type of longitudinal survey. It can be a qualitative or quantitative survey used to measure people's behavior.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cohort surveys</strong> - is a longitudinal study that samples a cohort, performing a crosssection at intervals through time. It is a type of panel study where the individuals in the panel share a common characteristic</li>
                                </ul>
