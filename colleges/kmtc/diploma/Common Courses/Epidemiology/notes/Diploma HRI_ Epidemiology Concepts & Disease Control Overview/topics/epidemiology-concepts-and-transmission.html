                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Epidemiologic thinking has been traced from Hippocrates</li>
                            <li>In 400 B.C, Hippocrates explained that environmental and host factors such as behaviors might influence the development of disease.</li>
                            <li>In 1662, John Graunt published analysis of mortality data that quantified patterns of birth, death, and disease occurrence by sex, region and seasonal variations</li>
                            <li>In 1800, William Farr collected and analyzed Britain's mortality statistics and developed basic practices that are being used today in vital statistics and disease classification.</li>
                            <li>In 1854, John Snow conducted a study when an epidemic of cholera erupted in the Golden Square of London.</li>
                            <li>In the $18^{th}$ and $19^{th}$ Century, epidemiological methods began to be applied in the investigation of acute infectious diseases.</li>
                            <li>In the 1930s and 1940s, epidemiologists extended their methods to noninfectious diseases</li>
                            <li>During the 1960s and early 1970s health workers applied epidemiologic methods to eradicate naturally occurring smallpox worldwide</li>
                            <li>In the 1980s, epidemiology was extended to the studies of injuries and violence.</li>
                            <li>In the 1990s, the related fields of molecular and genetic epidemiology took root.</li>

                        <h3>2.1. Causation of disease</h3>
                        <p>A number of models of disease causation have been proposed. Among the simplest of these is the epidemiologic triad or triangle</p>
                        <p>The triad consists of an external agent, a susceptible host, and an environment that brings the host and agent together.</p>
                        <p>In this model, disease results from the interaction between the agent and the susceptible host in an environment that supports transmission of the agent from a source to that host</p>
                        
                        <h4>Agent</h4>

                            <li>Is referred to an infectious microorganism or pathogen: a virus, bacterium, parasite, or other microbe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Agent factors</strong> - These factors must be present for a disease to occur</li>
                            <li>The agent must be present for disease to occur; however, presence of that agent alone is not always sufficient to cause disease.</li>
                            <li>A variety of factors influence whether exposure to an organism will result in disease, including the organism's pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) and dose.</li>
                            <li>Over time, the concept of agent has been broadened to include chemical and physical causes of disease or injury.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Host</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Refers to the human who can get the disease</li>

                        <h3>2.4. Chain of infection</h3>
                        <p>Is also called a transmission cycle. It is made up of six different links: pathogen (infectious agent), reservoir, portal of exit, means of transmission, portal of entry, and the new host. Each link has a unique role in the chain, and each can be interrupted, or broken, through various means.</p>
                        <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px;">
                            <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li><strong>Transmission cycle</strong> - occurs when the agent leaves its reservoir or host through a portal of exit, and is conveyed by some mode of transmission, and enters through an appropriate portal of entry to infect a susceptible host.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reservoir</strong> - is the habitat in which an infectious agent normally lives, grows and multiplies. This includes humans, animals and the environment.</li>
                                    <li>Two types of human reservoir are:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Persons with symptomatic illness</strong> - Symptomatic persons are usually less likely to transmit infection widely because their symptoms increase their likelihood of being diagnosed and treated.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Carriers</strong> - Asymptomatic carrier, a person or organism infected with an infectious disease agent, but displays no symptoms.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Environmental reservoir</strong> - Plants, soil and water are also reservoir for some infectious disease. Many fungal agents such as those causing histoplasmosis live and multiply in the soil</li>
                                    <li><strong>Animal reservoir</strong> - Infectious diseases that are transmittable under normal conditions from animal to humans are called zoonoses. Such disease includes brucellosis (cows and pigs), anthrax (sheep), plague (rodents), rabies (bats, dogs)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Portal of exit and entry</strong> - Is the path by which an agent leaves the source host or enters. Tubercle bacilli and influenza viruses exit the respiratory tract; Schistosome through urine; cholera vibrio through feces etc.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Modes of transmission</strong> - After an agent exits its natural reservoir, it may be transmitted to a susceptible host in numerous ways. These modes of transmission are classified as:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Direct (Direct contact and direct spread)</strong> - This is immediate transfer of the agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. It occurs through kissing, skin-to-skin contact. Also refer to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Indirect (Airborne, vehicle borne, Vector borne)</strong> - This can be mechanical or biologic. An agent is carried from a reservoir (a susceptible host) by suspended air particles or by animate (vector).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Most vectors are arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas and ticks. This is in contrast of instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host.</li>
                                    <li>When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of direct transmission is called a biologic transmission</li>
                                    <li>Vehicles that may directly transmit an agent include food, water, blood, handkerchiefs, bedding etc.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>Any of a group of variables or factors, that directly or indirectly influence the frequency or distribution of a disease</p>
                        <p>These can be:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Environmental factors</strong> - the greatest burdens relate to unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation & hygiene, and pollution of the indoor and outdoor air</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological factors</strong> - This includes agents, such as Bacteria, Fungi, Parasite and Virus</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetics factors</strong> - inheritance plays a part in determining lifespan, healthiness and the likelihood of developing certain illnesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical factors</strong> - safe water and clean air, healthy workplaces, safe houses, communities and roads all contribute to good health. Employment and working conditions - people in employment are healthier</li>
                            <li><strong>Individual factors</strong> - Diet, Physical activity, life style such taking alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use, and Hand washing</li>
                            <li><strong>Social economic factors</strong> - higher income and social status are linked to better health. The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2.6. Occurrences of diseases</h3>
                        <p>A disease and other health events do not occur randomly in a population, but are more likely to occur in some members of the population than others. This is because of risk factors that may not be distributed randomly in the population</p>
                        <p>The amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community is referred to as the baseline or endemic level of the disease. This level is not necessarily the desired level, but rather the observed level</p>

                            <li><strong>Screening</strong> - detection of an infection in an individual who does not show any signs or symptoms of the disease. It is carried out using specific tests called screening tests. It helps in:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Detecting an infection early</li>

                            <li><strong>Isolation</strong> - separate patients from others to prevent transmission to healthy people. The isolation period lasts until the risk of transmission from the infected person has reduced or stopped.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quarantine</strong> - Restriction on movement of people who may have been exposed to a disease to prevent spread of disease or pest</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporting</strong> - Cases of communicable diseases should be reported to a nearby health center or health head office periodically, using the national surveillance guidelines</li>
                            <li><strong>Terminating modes of transmission</strong> - The measures that can be applied to interrupt transmission of infectious agents in water, food, other vehicles and by vectors i.e. sterilization, disinfection, boiling water etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Removing susceptible host</strong> - help to protect the susceptible host either from becoming infected, or from developing the stage of infectious disease if they are exposed to the infectious agents i.e.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Vaccination</strong> - administration of vaccines to increase the resistance of the susceptible host against specific vaccine-preventable infections. For example, measles vaccination helps to protect the child from measles infection, and BCG vaccination gives some protection from tuberculosis</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chemoprophylaxis</strong> - drugs given to exposed and susceptible hosts to prevent them from developing an infection. For example, individuals from non-malarial areas who are going to a malaria endemic area can take a prophylactic drug to prevent them from developing the disease if they become infected with malaria parasites from a mosquito bite.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle</strong> - Proper nutrition and exercise improves a person's health status, supports the effective functioning of their immune system, and increases resistance to infection</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Limiting exposure to reservoirs of infection</strong> - Measures taken to decrease contact with reservoirs of infection include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Condom use to prevent transmission of HIV and other STI</li>
                                    <li>Use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) over the bed at night, insect repellants and wearing protective clothing to prevent diseases transmitted by insect vectors.</li>
                                    <li>Wearing surgical or very clean gloves and clean protective clothing while examining patients, particularly if they have wounds, or the examination involves the genital area.</li>
                                    <li>Keeping personal hygiene i.e. hand washing</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2.8. Level of disease prevention</h3>
                        <p>There are 3 levels of disease prevention: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Primary level</strong> - It aims to prevent disease or injury before it ever occurs
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is done by preventing exposures to hazards that cause disease or injury, altering unhealthy or unsafe behaviors that can lead to disease or injury, and increasing resistance to disease or injury when exposure occur</li>
                                    <li>Examples include:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>legislation and enforcement to ban use of asbestos</li>
                                            <li>Education about healthy and safe habits (e.g. eating well, exercising regularly, not smoking)</li>
                                            <li>Immunization against infectious diseases</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary level</strong> - This level aims to reduce the impact of a disease or injury that has already occurred.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is done by:

                                    <li>Examples include:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Regular exams and screening tests to detect disease in its earliest stages (e.g. mammograms to detect breast cancer)</li>
                                            <li>Daily, low-dose aspirins and/or diet and exercise programs to prevent further heart attacks or strokes</li>

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Tertiary level</strong> - This level aims to soften impact of an ongoing illness/injury that has lasting effects.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This is done by helping people manage long-term health problems and injuries (e.g. chronic diseases, permanent impairments) in order to improve as much as possible their ability to function, their quality of life and their life expectancy.</li>
                                    <li>Examples include:

                                            <li>Support groups that allow members to share strategies for living well</li>
                                            <li>Vocational rehabilitation programs to retrain workers for new jobs when they have recovered as much as possible.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
