                            <li><strong>Primordial level:</strong> New concept, more related to NCDs. It includes the
                                prevention of development of risk factors among countries or population groups where
                                they are not yet appeared e..g Hypertension and obeisty in children</li>
                            <li><strong>Primary level:</strong> action taken prior to onset of disease which removes the
                                probability of a disease occurring. Methods of primary prevention include (a) health
                                promotion and (b) specific protection. The strategy include mass/population or high risk
                                strategy</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary level:</strong> action that could halt the progression of an ongoing
                                disease and prevents complications. Strategies include (a) early diagnosis through
                                screening and case finding for treatments. This strategy is rather imperfect, more
                                expensive. Its more related to clinical medicine and most efforts of governments. Its
                                less effective than primary prevention</li>
