                        <p>Academic journals, conference proceedings, government reports and books are part of the
                            sources of literature survey depending on the nature of the problem.</p>

                        <p>In the process of literature survey, it should be remembered that one source will lead to
                            another. The earlier studies (researches) if available, which are similar to the study or
                            research being carried out should be carefully studied. A good library will be a great help

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>After extensive literature survey, researcher should state in clear terms the working
                            hypothesis or hypotheses of the research topic they are undertaking.</p>

                        <p>Working hypothesis is a tentative assumption made in order to draw out and test its logical
                            or empirical consequences. As such the manner in which research hypotheses are developed is
                            particularly important since they provide the focal point for research. Hypothesis should be
                            very specific and limited to the research at hand because it has to be tested. The role of
                            the hypothesis is to guide the researcher by delimiting the area of research and to keep
                            them on the right track. It also indicates the type of data required and the type of methods
                            of data analysis to be used.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, working hypotheses arise as a result of a-prior thinking about the subject,
                            examination of the available data and material including related studies and the counsel of
                            experts and interested parties .Working hypotheses are more useful when stated in precise
                            and clearly defined terms.</p>

                        <p>The research problem having been formulated in clear cut terms, the researcher will be
                            required to prepare a research design, i.e., will have to state the conceptual structure
                            within which research would be conducted.</p>

                        <p>The preparation of such a design facilitates research to be as efficient as possible yielding
                            maximum information.</p>

                        <p>In other words, the function of research design is to enable the collection of relevant
                            information/data with minimal expenditure of effort, time and money. All these can be
                            achieved depending mainly on the research purpose which is categorized into; Exploration,
                            description, diagnosis, and experimentation purposes.</p>

                        <p>There are several research designs, such as, experimental and nonexperimental hypothesis
                            testing. Experimental designs can be either informal designs or formal designs (such as
                            completely randomized design, randomized block design, Latin square design, simple and
                            complex factorial designs), out of which the researcher must select one for his own project.

                        <p>It means that research is structured with specified steps to be taken in a specified sequence
                            in accordance with the well-defined set of rules. Systematic characteristic of the research
                            does not rule out creative thinking but it certainly does reject the use of guessing and
                            intuition in arriving at conclusions.</p>

                        <h3>ii) Good research is logical</h3>
                        <p>This implies that research is guided by the rules of logical reasoning and the logical
                            process of induction and deduction are of great value in carrying out research.</p>

                        <p>Induction is the process of reasoning from a part to the whole whereas deduction is the
                            process of reasoning from some premise to a conclusion which follows from that very premise.
                            Logical reasoning makes research more meaningful in the context of decision making.</p>

                            and deals with concrete data that provides a basis for external validity to research
                            results.</p>
