                        <p>Research may be very broadly defined as systematic gathering of data and information and its
                            analysis for advancement of knowledge in any subject.</p>

                        <p>Research is an academic activity and as such the term should be used in a technical Sense.
                        </p>

                        <p>According to Clifford Woody research comprises defining and redefining problems, formulating
                            hypothesis or suggested solutions; collecting, organizing and evaluating data; making
                            deductions and reaching conclusions; and at last carefully testing the conclusions to
                            determine whether they fit the formulating hypothesis.</p>

                        <p>D. Steiner and M. Stephenson in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences define research as "the
                            manipulation of things, concepts or symbols for the purpose of generalizing to extend,
                            correct or verify knowledge, whether that knowledge aids in construction of theory or in the
                            practice of an art."</p>

                        <p>In summary the term 'research' refers to the systematic method consisting of identifying the
                            problem, formulating a hypothesis, collecting the data, analyzing the data and reaching
                            certain conclusions either in the form of solutions towards the concerned problem or in
                            certain generalizations for some theoretical formulation.</p>

                        <p>Research is broadly categorized into social research and scientific research.</p>

                        <p>Social research is used to investigate the behavior of humans in the social life and is
                            either qualitative or quantitative or both. Qualitative approach can be seen in participant
                            observation, communication with research participants. Furthermore, social research looks
                            deep into human nature and analyzes social phenomena. The social scientist or researcher
                            take a sample of population and investigate data and later on form a general theory based on
                            the analyzed data.</p>

                        <p>Scientific research is connected with natural sciences like physics, biology and chemistry.
                            In scientific research scientists try to generate new knowledge by investigating the
                            phenomenon using empirical and measurable techniques. Scientific researches follow
                            measurable analytical method and the specialty is that anybody can repeat the same research
                            anytime.</p>

                        <p>Social and scientific researches are further classified into the following types;</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Descriptive and Analytical Research</li>
                            <li>Applied and Fundamental Research</li>
                            <li>Qualitative and Quantitative Research</li>
                            <li>Conceptual and Empirical Research</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Descriptive research concentrates on finding facts to ascertain the nature of something as it
                            exists. In contrast analytical research is concerned with determining validity of hypothesis
                            based on analysis of facts collected.</p>

                        <p>Applied research is carried out to find answers to practical problems to be solved and as an
                            aid in decision making in different areas including product design, process design and
                            policy making. Fundamental research is carried out as more to satisfy intellectual
                            curiosity, than with the intention of using the research findings for any immediate
                            practical application.</p>

                        <p>Qualitative research studies such aspects of the research subjects which are not
                            quantifiable, and hence not subject to measurement and quantitative analysis. In contrast
                            quantitative research makes substantial use of measurements and quantitative analysis
                            techniques.</p>

                        <p>Conceptual research involves investigation of thoughts and ideas and developing new ideas or
                            interpreting the old ones based on logical reasoning. In contrast empirical research is
                            based on firm verifiable data collected by either observation of facts under natural
                            condition or obtained through experimentation.</p>

                        <p>V) All other types of research are variations of one or more of the above stated approaches,
                            based on either the purpose of research, or the time required to accomplish research, on the
                            environment in which research is done, or on the basis of some other similar factor.</p>

                        <p>Research can be field-setting research or laboratory research or simulation research,
                            depending upon the environment in which it is to be carried out. Research can as well be
                            understood as clinical or diagnostic research. Such research follow case-study methods or in
                            depth approaches to reach the basic causal relations and the studies usually go deep into
                            the causes of things or events that interest us, using very small samples and very deep
                            probing data gathering devices.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Research Approaches</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The two basic approaches to research are quantitative approach and the qualitative approach.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Quantitative Approach</h3>
                        <p>Quantitative approach can be further sub-classified into inferential, experimental and
                            simulation approaches to research. The purpose of inferential approach to research is to
                            form a data base from which to infer characteristics or relationships of population. This
                            usually means survey research where a sample of population is studied (questioned or
                            observed) to determine its characteristics, and it is then inferred that the population has
                            the same characteristics.</p>

                        <p>Experimental approach is characterized by much greater control over the research environment
                            and in this case some variables are manipulated to observe their effect on other variables.
                        </p>

                        <p>Simulation approach involves the construction of an artificial environment within which
                            relevant information and data can be generated. This permits an observation of the dynamic
                            behavior of a system (or its sub-system) under controlled conditions.</p>

                        <p>The term 'simulation' in the context of business and social sciences applications refers to
                            "the operation of a numerical model that represents the structure of dynamic process.
                            Simulation approach can also be useful in building models for understanding future
                            conditions.</p>

                        <h3>Qualitative Approach</h3>
                        <p>Qualitative approach to research is concerned with subjective assessment of attitudes,
                            opinions and behavior. Research in such a situation is a function of researcher's insights
                            and impressions. Such an approach to research generates results either in non-quantitative
                            form or in the form which are not subjected to rigorous quantitative analysis.</p>
