                            <p>History of Dialysis starts with Thomas Graham [1805-1869], professor of Chemistry at Anderson University, Glasgow, Scotland. This was at the same time as physician Richard Bright was describing the clinical features and diagnosis of renal failure in Edinburgh. After several experimentation which combined the physical process of osmosis and diffusion, he devised a phenomenon which he termed as dialysis and proposed, together with Richard Bright, that this would form the basis of a treatment for renal failure. He demonstrated that vegetable parchment acted as a semi-permeable membrane for the purpose of dialysis.</p>

Abel, Rowntree and Turner of the Department of pharmacology of John Hopkins Medical School described a method by which the blood of a living animal was submitted to dialysis outside the body and again returned to natural circulation.</p>

Thereafter up to 1926 he performed a total of 6 dialysis with the use of 6 to 8 glass containers each with two celloidon Dialysis tubes using leech as an anticoagulant. [Surface area 2 m²]</p>
                                    <p>In 1928 he treated a 55 Kgs Uremic man with dialysis using a newly available highly purified preparation of heparin and dialyzer of 1.5 m². His article published in 1928 is a real classic in the field of dialysis; where he cautiously warned "one swallow does not make a summer."</p>

                            <p>Dialysis as a treatment for kidney failure was not always the sleek, high-tech process it is today. The first hemodialysis treatment in a patient, using cellulosic membrane, was done in 1943 using a rotating drum artificial kidney.</p>
                            
                            <p>The first practical artificial kidney was built during World War II by the Dutch doctor Willem Kolff. The Kolff kidney used a 20-meter long tube of cellophane sausage casing as a membrane. The tube of casing was wrapped around a slatted wooden drum. Run by an electric motor, the drum spun in a tank filled with dialysate.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="rotating-drum-device">Rotating drum device:</h3>
                            <p>To start a treatment, blood was drained from the patient into a sterile jug. Blood thinning drugs were added. The filled jug was hung on a post (pole) above the artificial kidney and linked to the casing that was wound around the wooden drum.</p>
                            <p>When the motor turned the drum, blood was pulled through by gravity to "prime" the casing (fill it with blood). Wastes from the blood diffused through the tubing into the dialysate in the tank. The cleansed blood went into a second sterile jug at the other end of the machine. An HD treatment took about 6 hours. When all of the blood had passed through the machine, the second jug was raised up to drain the cleaned blood back into the patient.</p>

In this method low blood volume is used with high surface area and low resistance circuit. He used flattened tubes of gold beater's skin impregnated with gelatine bichromate. This for the first time introduced the concept of the flat-plate dialyzer using external screen for rigidity and to produce well-mixed flow of blood in experimental animals.</p>

                            <p>This was one of the stationary dialyzer first developed by Mac Neal and Colleagues from Buffalo, New York, constructed in 1947, built from short lengths of flattened cellophane tubes, 28 of which were stacked together separated by specially prepared screens made from nylon mesh. Originally described by Frederik Kill in 1960 from Oslo-Norway the modified kill dialyzer used sheets of cellophane, a very thin membrane more permeable than the original viscous cellophane.</p>
                            
                            <p>This type of artificial kidney is called the parallel plate dialyzer for an obvious reason. Instead of the classic drum rotating system, this dialyzer uses several parallel plates with ridges and grooves in them. The dialysate flows along the grooves or ridges. A semipermeable membrane rests between the grooves and the blood flow. With these dialyzers, resistance to blood flow is low.</p>

                            <p>The pressure Cooker kidney: Dr. William Inouye took the concept and miniaturized it. He wrapped the membrane around a beaker and held the layers apart with fiberglass screening. He placed this "coil" into a Presto Pressure Cooker to enclose it and control the temperature. And, he made holes in the pot for the dialysate. By applying a vacuum to the dialysate leaving the pot, he was able to draw excess water out of the patient's blood. A blood pump was needed to overcome resistance in the device.</p>
                            <p>This device was used on patients. When it was used in a closed circuit, the exact amount of fluid removed could be determined.</p>

Stanley Shaldon successfully began training patients to use the internal A-V fistula for overnight dialysis in the home and also taught the patients self-needling [1967]. By 1975 83% of all hospital and 88% of home dialysis patients in Europe were using A-V fistula for circulatory access.</p>
