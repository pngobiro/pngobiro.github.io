                                <dd>A substance that is normally present in the blood which is measured in the biochemistry blood test. A low blood level of bicarbonate shows there is too much acid in the blood.</dd>

                                <dd>Due to ruptured membranes blood might leak from blood compartment to the dialysate. A devise in HD machine detects as minimum as 0.036ml/litre of blood in the dialysate.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Blood pressure</strong></dt>
                                <dd>The pressure that the blood exerts against the walls of the arteries as it flows through them. Blood pressure measurements consist of two numbers. The first shows the systolic blood pressure, the second, the diastolic blood pressure. One of the functions of the kidneys is to help control the blood pressure. In kidney failure, the blood pressure tends to be high.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Blood pump</strong></dt>
                                <dd>A pump that moves blood from the patient’s access through the blood tubing and artificial kidney and back to the patient without damage to the blood cells.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Bolus</strong></dt>
                                <dd>Giving a specific amount of IV fluid during dialysis. This is usually used to treat low blood pressure.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Bruit/Thrill</strong></dt>
                                <dd>The sound produced by the blood flowing through a blood vessel, as well as through a fistula, graft or shunt.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>BUN</strong></dt>
                                <dd>It helps to see how well your kidneys are working. Urea nitrogen is a normal waste product that your body creates after you eat. Your liver breaks down the proteins in your food and while it does that, it creates blood urea nitrogen, also known as BUN.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Calcium</strong></dt>
                                <dd>A mineral that strengthens the bones. It is contained in some foods, including dairy products. It is stored in the bones and is present in the blood. The kidneys normally help to keep calcium in the bones. In kidney failure, calcium drains out of the bones, and the level of calcium in the blood also falls.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Clearance</strong></dt>
                                <dd>The rate that waste products in the blood are removed through dialysis, expressed in milliliters per minute or the ratio of the toxic waste products of food from the body. Clearance is one of the two main functions of the kidneys. In kidney failure, clearance is inadequate and toxins from food build up in the blood.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Conventional Hemodialysis</strong></dt>
                                <dd>Method of renal replacement therapy that is usually done at an out-patient dialysis facility 3x/week for 3-4 hours.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Counter current</strong></dt>
                                <dd>Opposite flow of two liquids/solutions.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Creatinine</strong></dt>
                                <dd>A waste substance produced by the muscles when they are used. The name creatinine is also given to a blood test that measures the blood level of creatinine. The higher the blood creatinine level, the worse the kidneys (or dialysis or a kidney transplant) are working.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Dialysate</strong></dt>
                                <dd>Aqueous fluid containing electrolytes and, usually, dextrose, which is intended to exchange solutes with blood during hemodialysis. The word "dialysate" is used throughout this document to mean the fluid made from water and concentrates that is delivered to the dialyzer by the dialysate supply system.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Diffusion</strong></dt>
                                <dd>A process by which substances pass from a stronger to a weaker solution. Diffusion is one of the key processes in dialysis (the other is ultrafiltration). During dialysis, body wastes such as creatinine pass from the blood into the dialysis fluid. At the same time, useful substances such as calcium pass from the dialysis fluid into the blood.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Dry weight</strong></dt>
                                <dd>The weight of a dialysis patient when excess fluid has been removed. Also known as "ideal weight."</dd>

                                <dd>Major component of the outer cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides, which consist of a polysaccharide chain covalently bound to lipid A. Endotoxins can acutely activate both humoral and cellular host defenses, leading to a syndrome characterized by fever, shaking chills, hypotension, multiple organ failure, and even death if allowed to enter the circulation in a sufficient dose.</dd>

                                <dd>An enlarged vein, usually at the wrist or elbow, that gives access to the bloodstream for haemodialysis. The fistula is created by a surgeon in a small operation. It is done by joining a vein to an artery. This increases the flow of blood through the vein and causes it to enlarge, making it suitable for haemodialysis needles.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>Fluid overload</strong></dt>
                                <dd>A condition in which the body contains too much water. It is caused by drinking too much fluid, or not losing enough. Fluid overload occurs in kidney failure because one of the main functions of the kidneys is to remove excess water.</dd>

                                <dt><strong>GFR</strong></dt>
                                <dd>Abbreviation of glomerular filtration rate. Measurement of how much blood is filtered by the kidneys, if the GFR is low there is kidney disease.</dd>

                                <dd>A type of sugar. There is normally a small amount of glucose in the blood. This amount is not usually increased in people with kidney failure unless they also have diabetes mellitus. Glucose is the main substance in PD fluid, drawing excess water into the dialysis fluid from the blood by osmosis.</dd>

                                <dd>A substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body. Blood levels of haemoglobin are measured to look for anaemia. A low Hb level indicates anaemia.</dd>
