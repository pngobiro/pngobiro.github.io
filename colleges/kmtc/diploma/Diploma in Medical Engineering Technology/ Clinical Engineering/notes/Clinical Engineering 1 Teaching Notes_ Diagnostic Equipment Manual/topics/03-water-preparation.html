                            <p>Distillation is a water purification process that uses a heat source to vaporize water and separate it from contaminants and other undesirable elements commonly found in ground and surface water. Distillation heats raw (untreated) water until the water reaches its boiling point and begins to vaporize.</p>
                            
                            <p>The heat is then kept at a constant temperature to maintain water vaporization while prohibiting other undesirable elements from vaporizing. Water has a lower boiling point than salt and other mineral sediments. This process also separates the water molecules from microscopic, disease-causing organisms.</p>
                            
                            <p>Once all of the water has vaporized, the vapor is led into a condenser, where, upon cooling, the water reverts to the liquid form and runs into a receiving container. The remaining elements, whose boiling point was too high to permit vaporization, remain in the original container and constitute the sediment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Because the distillation process can never ensure a complete separation between water and other materials, it is often repeated one or more times with the treated water. Many alcoholic beverages, like brandy, gin, and whiskey, are distilled, using an apparatus similar in constitution to the water distillation apparatus.</p>

                            <p>Reverse osmosis (RO) technology is used in the water purification process to filter out dissolved solids and other large molecules. Typical applications of RO technology are seawater desalination, boiler feed water filtering, product rinsing, microelectronics production, laboratory testing, biotechnology, and other process that require highly purified water. There are RO systems on the market treating as little as 25 gallons per hour to more than 450,000 gallons per day.</p>
                            
                            <p>Reverse osmosis is what the name implies: osmosis in reverse. In osmosis, water with a lower concentration of solids naturally flows through a membrane to an area of higher concentration through naturally occurring osmotic pressure, equalizing the concentration of the solute on either side of the membrane. The RO technology applies pressure to a stream of water to overcome the natural osmotic pressure. The feed water is forced through a semi-permeable membrane, emerging as purified water and leaving behind a concentrated solution of dissolved solids (see Figure 1).</p>

                            <h3>Osmosis</h3>
                            <p>To understand the purpose and process of Reverse Osmosis you must first understand the naturally occurring process of Osmosis.</p>
                            
                            <p>Osmosis is a naturally occurring phenomenon and one of the most important processes in nature. It is a process where a weaker saline solution will tend to migrate to a strong saline solution. Examples of osmosis are when plant roots absorb water from the soil and our kidneys absorb water from our blood.</p>
                            
                            <p>Above is a diagram which shows how osmosis works. A solution that is less concentrated will have a natural tendency to migrate to a solution with a higher concentration. For example, if you had a container full of water with a low salt concentration and another container full of water with a high salt concentration and they were separated by a semi-permeable membrane, then the water with the lower salt concentration would begin to migrate towards the water container with the higher salt concentration.</p>
                            
                            <p>Reverse Osmosis is the process of Osmosis in reverse. Whereas Osmosis occurs naturally without energy required, to reverse the process of osmosis you need to apply energy to the more saline solution. A reverse osmosis membrane is a semi-permeable membrane that allows the passage of water molecules but not the majority of dissolved salts, organics, bacteria and pyrogens. However, you need to 'push' the water through the reverse osmosis membrane by applying pressure that is greater than the naturally occurring osmotic pressure in order to desalinate (demineralize or deionize) water in the process, allowing pure water through while holding back a majority of contaminants (see the diagram above)</p>
                            
                            <p>Reverse osmosis works by using a high pressure pump to increase the pressure on the salt side of the RO and force the water across the semi-permeable RO membrane, leaving almost all (around 95% to 99%) of dissolved salts behind in the reject stream.</p>

                            <h3>RO System Components</h3>
                            <p>RO systems consist of the following basic components, which are common to every RO system. The specifications for each component vary by application, source water quality, and the required permeate quality.</p>

                                    <p>The recovery rate of RO systems is the ratio of permeate flow to total feed water flow. The recovery rates of RO systems vary significantly and are influenced by the quality and constituents of the feed water, type of membrane, system configuration, and system operation. Large systems typically have recovery rates between 40% and 60%. In other words, for every 10 gallons of feed water entering the system, 4 to 6 gallons of purified permeate water are produced. When systems are fully optimized, which is the focus of this technology evaluation, recovery rates can exceed 90%. The main factors that affect system recovery rate are fouling and scaling. Other factors are degradation of the system membranes and system pressure.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Fouling</strong>: Fouling occurs when suspended particles or biological compounds deposit on the membrane surfaces. Fouling of the RO membrane is heavily influenced by the quality of the incoming feed water. Membrane fouling affects the ability of the membrane to filter the feed water properly and decreases permeate production.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Scaling</strong>: Scaling is the precipitation of dissolved mineral compounds from solutions that have become saturated, producing solids trapped within the membrane. These solids can be hard to remove and decrease the overall effectiveness of the membrane, lowering the system's recovery rate.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Membrane degradation</strong>: Membranes can degrade from exposure to conditions in the system that destroys the membrane material, such as scaling, fouling, and harsh chemicals, which affects water flux and recovery rate.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Feed water pressure</strong>: Feed water pressure is another factor that affects system recovery rate. Water flux across the membrane increases in direct relationship to increases in feed water pressure given all the other factors such as osmotic pressure and water temperature are held constant. Increased feed water pressure also increases rejection of dissolved solids. The greater the water pressure within the maximum designed pressure range of the system, the better the quantity and quality of the water produced. However, a feed water pressure exceeding the designed range can cause the membranes to degrade prematurely; therefore, remaining within the design range is crucial.</p>

                                    <h4>Strategies to Increase Recovery Rate</h4>
                                    <p>There are three basic optimization techniques discussed in this evaluation that can help to increase recovery rate and thereby reduce water use:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Feed water pretreatment</li>
                                        <li>Advanced membrane technologies</li>
                                        <li>Flow configuration optimization</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>These techniques can be applied individually or together when designing or retrofitting an RO system.</p>

                                    <h4>1. Feed Water Pretreatment</h4>
                                    <p>Pretreatment of the feed water entering an existing RO system can minimize fouling of the membrane and thereby increase the overall recovery rate of the system. The feed water, depending on its source, may contain various concentrations of suspended solids and dissolved matter, including both organic and inorganic substances. Suspended particles can settle on the membrane surface, blocking feed channels and increasing friction losses across the system. Dissolved solids can precipitate out of the solution and cause scaling. Pretreated water entering the RO system can reduce the amount of work of the RO pump, thus reducing energy consumption.</p>
                                    <p>A typical pretreatment process includes the following steps:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Removal of large particles (typically larger than 5 microns) with a mesh strainer or traveling screen</li>
                                        <li>Disinfection to kill biological growth</li>
                                        <li>Coagulant or flocculants to conglomerate particles that can be filtered out</li>
                                        <li>Chemical treatment to inhibit scaling</li>
                                        <li>Activated carbon filter to remove chlorine and organic compounds</li>
                                        <li>Final removal of suspended solids using cartridge filter</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h4>2. Advanced Membrane Technology</h4>
                                    <p>There are several new advanced membrane technologies for RO systems to assist in optimal membrane selection for specific applications. Advances in membrane technology allow more options for higher water production rate. These advances include larger active surface areas, higher permeable membranes, larger diameter spiral wound elements, and low fouling membranes. These new features, if designed and implemented properly, can reduce energy consumption and increase water recovery rates of the systems.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Larger active surface area</strong>: Spiral wound membranes with a large active surface area are commercially available. These types of membranes enlarge the elements' filtration area without increasing the elements' physical size. For example, a circa 1980 filter with an area of 320 ft² can now have a filtration area of 440 ft² with new spiral wound membranes. This increase in area translates into a 38% increase in water production from the same pressure vessel.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Higher permeability</strong>: Membranes with high permeability incorporate nano-particles within TFC membranes. Nano-particles are encapsulated in the conventional RO membranes, which change the structure of the thin-film surface, allowing more water to pass through while meeting a high rejection rate. This type of membrane requires lower operating pressure, which reduces energy requirements and also increases water flux and recovery rate. The membranes can cost slightly more than conventional units; however, higher permeability can decrease operating costs because of energy and water savings.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Larger diameter spiral wound elements</strong>: For large scale RO systems, large diameter spiral wound modules enable significant reductions in RO plant capital cost and life-cycle cost. The standard size for spiral wound elements in industrial RO systems is 8 inches. However, within large scale RO plants, 8-inch diameter membranes are not the most efficient choice because of the number of elements, pressure vessels, piping, and connections that must increase in direct proportion to the increase in flow capacity. The optimum size for large scale systems is 16-inch diameter spiral wound elements, which allows the membrane's active area and productivity to increase to 4 times that of standard RO modules. For typical brackish water RO systems, use of 16-inch elements would save approximately 15% in material costs on the membrane racks. However, cost savings and productivity increases tend to be project specific and need to be evaluated case by case.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Low-biofouling feed spacers</strong>: Feed spacers are the material responsible for maintaining channels of water flow between the two faces of the membrane in a spiral wound element. Feed spacers can foul easily if feed water has a large amount suspended solids that plug the channels and reduce the flow through the membrane. In contrast, low-biofouling feed spacers have a larger open cross-sectional area than traditional spacers, reducing pressure drop and allowing more effective cleaning, and thereby reducing fouling. Low-biofouling feed spacers minimize pressure drop across the element, which increases water productivity.</p>

                                    <h4>Flow Configuration Optimization</h4>
                                    <p>There are different types of flow configurations in RO systems including single-stage, two-stage, single-pass and two-pass systems. RO systems can contain one to several groups of pressure vessels. Each group of pressure vessels is called a stage. RO systems can also have distinct RO units, referred to as a pass. For applications where high purity water is required, two-pass systems are common because they essentially treat the water twice in two distinct systems. These flow configurations can be optimized, influencing overall system performance.</p>
                                    <p>In the following sections, flow configuration options that allow higher water recovery rates are described.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Concentrate recirculation</strong>: The simplest membrane element assembly is called a single-stage system that typically sends the concentrate directly to drain. Such a configuration operates at a limited recovery rate. To increase the overall system recovery rate, a portion of the concentrate stream is returned to the supply and blended with the feed water. The concentrate recycling configuration is shown in Figure 6. The potential disadvantage of concentrate recirculation design is related to the possible need for a larger feed pump to handle higher feed flow. In this case, energy use would increase for the system. Because the feed water blends with the concentrate stream, the average feed salinity can change. Therefore, if a system is converted to a concentrate recirculation system, the feed water must be reevaluated for pretreatment methods.</p>

                            <h3>RO Pretreatment</h3>
                            <p>Proper pretreatment using both mechanical and chemical treatments is critical for an RO system to prevent fouling, scaling and costly premature RO membrane failure and frequent cleaning requirements. Below is a summary of common problems an RO system experiences due to lack of proper pretreatment.</p>

                            <h4>Fouling</h4>
                            <p>Fouling occurs when contaminants accumulate on the membrane surface effectively plugging the membrane. There are many contaminants in municipal feed water that are naked to the human eye and harmless for human consumption, but large enough to quickly foul (or plug) an RO system. Fouling typically occurs in the front end of an RO system and results in a higher pressure drop across the RO system and a lower permeate flow. This translates into higher operating costs and eventually the need to clean or replace the RO membranes. Fouling will take place eventually to some extent given the extremely fine pore size of an RO membrane no matter how effective your pretreatment and cleaning schedule is. However, by having proper pretreatment in place, you will minimize the need to address fouling related problems on a regular basis.</p>
                            <p>Fouling can be caused by the following:</p>
                            <ol start="4">
                                <li>Particulate or colloidal mater (dirt, silt, clay, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Organics (humic/fulvic acids, etc)</li>
                                <li>Microorganisms (bacteria, etc). Bacteria present one of the most common fouling problems since RO membranes in use today cannot tolerate a disinfectant such as chlorine and thefore microorganisms are often able to thrive and multiply on the membrane surface. They may product biofilms that cover the membrane surface and result in heavy fouling.</li>
                                <li>Breakthrough of filter media upstream of the RO unit. GAC carbon beds and softener beds may develop an under drain leak and if there is not adequate post filtration in place the media can foul the RO system.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>By performing analytical tests, you can determine if the feed water to your RO has a high potential for fouling. To prevent fouling of an RO system, mechanical filtration methods are used. The most popular methods to prevent fouling are the use of multi-media filters (MMF) or microfiltration (MF). In some cases cartridge filtration will suffice.</p>

                            <h4>Scaling</h4>
                            <p>As certain dissolved (inorganic) compounds become more concentrated (remember discussion on concentration factor) then scaling can occur if these compounds exceed their solubility limits and precipitate on the membrane surface as scale. The results of scaling are a higher pressure drop across the system, higher salt passage (less salt rejection), low permeate flow and lower permeate water quality. An example of a common scale that tends to form on an RO membrane is calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).</p>

                            <h4>Chemical Attack</h4>
                            <p>Modern thin film composite membranes are not tolerant to chlorine or chloramines. Oxidizers such as chlorine will 'burn' holes in the membrane pores and can cause irreparable damage. The result of chemical attack on an RO membrane is a higher permeate flow and a higher salt passage (poorer quality permeate water). This is why microorganism growth on RO membranes tends to foul RO membranes so easily since there is no biocide to prevent its growth.</p>

                            <h4>Mechanical Damage</h4>
                            <p>Part of the pretreatment scheme should be pre and post RO system plumbing and controls. If ‘hard starts’ occur mechanical damage to the membranes can occur. Likewise, if there is too much backpressure on the RO system then mechanical damage to the RO membranes can also occur. These can be addressed by using variable frequency drive motors to start high pressure pumps for RO systems and by installing check valve(s) and/or pressure relief valves to prevent excessive back pressure on the RO unit that can cause permanent membrane damage.</p>

                            <p>Demineralization is a type of water purification. While it can refer to any treatment process that removes minerals from water, the term demineralization is typically reserved specifically for ion exchange processes used for near total removal of ionic mineral contaminants. Often, the terms demineralization and deionization are used interchangeably.</p>
                            
                            <p>Demineralization utilizes both cation and anion exchange resins, sometimes even in the same column or bed. Following demineralization, the treated water will be of a high level of purity comparable to distilled water, but typically at a much lower cost.</p>

                            <p>What’s included in a basic demineralization system?</p>
                            <p>The specific design and components of a demineralization system can vary from one application to the next based on process conditions and composition of the stream to be treated. Still, most demineralization systems will include the following components:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>One or more Ion exchange columns</li>
                                <li>Regenerant dosing system</li>
                                <li>Chemical feed storage tanks</li>
                                <li>PLC, control valves and piping</li>
                                <li>Ion exchange resins</li>

                            <p>There is some flexibility in the configuration of a demineralization system in order to optimally meet various process conditions and purity goals. In designing a demineralization system, consideration should be given to variability of the feed water, level of purity needed, system footprint, tolerance for ion leakage (in particular sodium and silica), and chemical feed requirements, among other factors.</p>

                            <h3>How does demineralization work?</h3>
                            <p>As we’ve said, demineralization typically refers to the removal of dissolved mineral solids through an Ion exchange process. But before we get deeper into how demineralization works, we’ll go over the basic principles of an Ion exchange reaction.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the presence of water, minerals and salts dissociate into their constituent ions. These dissolved solids consist of negatively-charged ions known as anions, and positively-charged ions known as cations, each of which are attracted to counterions (or ions of an opposing charge). Present within an Ion exchange column is a resin which consists of plastic beads to which an ionic functional group has been bound. These functional groups loosely hold ions of an opposing charge through mutual electrostatic attraction. During an active Ion exchange cycle, a water with dissolved ions is introduced to the resin. The ions in solution will exchange places with the ions on the resin beads, clinging to the resin’s functional groups even as the resulting solution is drained away. Ion exchange happens when one ion has greater affinity for the functional group than the ion that is already present. The specific ionic contaminants present will dictate whether anionic and/or cationic resin types are needed.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a typical Ion exchange reaction, the exchange of ions simply results in the replacement of contaminant ions with other, less objectionable, ions. In an Ion exchange sodium softening system, for example, the objective is to remove hardness ions (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>) from solution by replacing them with sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>). As a result, the treated solution will have little to no hardness, but it will contain a greater concentration of sodium ions.</p>
                            
                            <p>While this is acceptable for many applications, some processes demand near total removal of dissolved solids. That’s where demineralization comes in. In demineralization, cations in the feed water are exchanged for hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) ions and cations are exchanged for hydroxyl (OH<sup>-</sup>) ions. The result is water: H<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup> &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O. In general, demineralization Ion exchange systems are available in either two-bed or mixed-bed configurations, as detailed below.</p>

                            <h4>Two-bed Ion exchange</h4>
                            <p>Two-bed or dual bed exchangers use two or more Ion exchange resin beds or columns are used to treat a stream, each containing a specific type of Ion exchange resin. In two-bed demineralization, a stream is first treated with a strong acid cation (SAC) resin that captures the dissolved cations, and releases hydrogen (H⁺) ions in exchange. The resulting mineral acid solution is then routed to the strong base anion (SBA) resin bed. This second step sequesters the anionic contaminants while releasing hydroxide (OH⁻) ions, which combine with the existing hydrogen ions (H⁺) to form water. The resulting stream is low in TDS and has a nearly neutral pH. While two-bed exchangers are effective for demineralization, sodium leakage can affect the quality of their output, especially for streams with high TDS and/or low pH.</p>

                            <h4>Mixed-bed Ion exchange</h4>
                            <p>Mixed-bed exchangers offer a higher water quality compared to twin-bed systems. Mixed-bed ion exchangers hold a mixture of different Ion exchange resins housed within a single Ion exchange column. When a stream is introduced to the unit, the cation and anion exchange reactions take place simultaneously within the unit, which has the effect of addressing the sodium leakage issues that can compromise the quality of water produced by a twin-bed Ion exchange system. While mixed-bed exchangers produce higher quality water, they also require a more involved resin regeneration process. Additionally, mixed-bed units are more susceptible to resin fouling and/or inferior system function due to fluctuations in stream contents, and are therefore typically used downstream of other treatment measures.</p>

                            <p>Maintenance of water softeners largely is confined to restocking the salt supply for the brine solution. With semiautomatic models, the owner also will have to start the recharging cycle. Salt can be purchased in the form of pellets, granules or blocks.</p>
                            
                            <p>The brine tank may require periodic cleaning. The frequency of cleaning depends on the amount and purity of the salt used in the softening process. The brine valve and float assembly also should be checked and cleaned as often as needed.</p>
                            
                            <p>The presence of excess iron or hydrogen sulfide can inhibit the effectiveness of a water-softening unit. Installation of the iron-removal equipment may be required (see the NDSU publication “Iron and Manganese” (AE1030). Water test results will help make that determination.</p>
                            
                            <p>More frequent backflushing (reversing the normal flow of water through the treatment unit) may be required to remove iron buildup.</p>

                            <h3>Recharging or Regenerating Resins</h3>
                            <p>Resin materials have a finite exchange capacity. Each of the individual exchange sites will become full with prolonged use. When unable to exchange ions any longer, the resin must be recharged or regenerated to restore it to its initial condition. The substances used for this can include sodium chloride, as well as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or sodium hydroxide.</p>
                            
                            <p>The spent regenerant is the primary substance remaining from the process. It contains not only all of the ions removed, but also any extra regenerant ions and will also have a high level of total dissolved solids.</p>
                            
                            <p>The efficacy of ion exchange for water treatment can be limited by mineral scaling, surface clogging, and other issues that contribute to resin fouling. Pretreatment processes such as filtration or addition of chemicals can help reduce or prevent these issues.</p>
