                                Diagnostic Set Overview
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>A diagnostic set is a set of medical instruments which are used to look into the eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Commonly, the set consists of a single instrument with configurable parts which can be used for all four functions, making it easy for a physician to use and carry a diagnostic set. Others may have two instruments, with the ophthalmoscope for the eyes being separate. Some doctors maintain their own, while others take advantage of diagnostic sets which are used to stock exam rooms and clinic suites.</p>
                            
                            <p>Devices used for looking into the eyes are known as ophthalmoscopes, while otoscopes can be used to peer into the ears. The design includes a base attached to a strong light source and a magnifying glass which can be used to clearly visualize the area of interest, with speculums for peering into the ears and up the nose. The speculum is removed to look into the throat or eyes.</p>
                            
                            <p>A doctor can use a diagnostic set in a routine exam to assess the health of these areas, and to look for specific clues to a patient's medical condition. For example, if a patient complains of ear pain, the doctor would use the otoscope to look into the ears for signs of inflammation and other issues which could cause the ears to feel painful.</p>

                            <p>The speculums used are changed between uses to eliminate the risk of transmitting disease, and the diagnostic set can be wiped down between patients as well. In addition to being used with basic attachments, the diagnostic set can include tools which as wide speculums which allow doctors to insert tools through the speculum into the area, along with an array of magnifying glasses which will allow the doctor to see different areas of magnification, and polarizing filters for eye exams.</p>

                            <p>Medical supply companies carry several styles and designs of diagnostic set, including versions scaled for pediatric use. It is also possible to order these tools directly from the manufacturer. Optics companies tend to produce sets of the highest quality, because they are used to designing devices which are used for precision tasks, and some doctors develop a preference for products from a particular company.</p>

                            <p>A laryngoscope is a medical instrument used to examine the inside of the larynx, or voice box. It typically consists of a handle and a blade that is inserted into the patient's mouth to visualize the vocal cords.</p>
                            
                            <p>Laryngoscope set is an illuminating medical examining instrument contains handle and interchangeable blades, used in medical procedure by healthcare providers called laryngoscopy to allow visualization so that obtain more clear view of the vocal folds and the glottis by inserting a tube through a part of throat larynx (of the pharynx and larynx of a patient).</p>
                            
                            <p>Laryngoscope is handy instrument, handle is just about 6 inch in length and generally blades are shorter than the handle but size differ according to specification</p>

                            <h3>Components of Laryngoscope</h3>

                            <h3>How Laryngoscope works</h3>
                            <p>Laryngoscope Blades and Laryngoscope Handle are two separate pieces of laryngoscope set that has to assemble. The traditional or “conventional” Laryngoscope are available in interchangeable blades model.</p>
                            
                            <p>Laryngoscope Handle has hallow cylindrical structure, contains the batteries needed for illumination and the blade has a bulb at the end, tip of blade.</p>
                            
                            <p>During intubation procedure, Blade has to attach with handle before use it just takes only few seconds (PUSH to FIT), attachment complete circuit and light/bulb at the end of blade tip shine bright during illuminating procedure this light help examinee to view things clearly.</p>
                            
                            <p>The two major types of laryngoscope blades: curved and straight. Both are inserted deep within a patient’s airway</p>
                            
                            <p>Straight blade is used to depress the tongue whereas the curved blade pushes the epiglottis to one side to visualize the glottis. In infants, the straight blade is preferred as small children have long floppy epiglottis whereas in older children (more than 8 years), the curved blade is preferred.</p>

                            <h3>Other types of blades include:</h3>

                            <p>An otoscope consists of a head and a handle and is used to examine the external auditory canal (EAC), the tympanic membrane, and the middle ear. A magnifying lens enhances the clinician's view. The following two types of head are available for the otoscope:</p>

                            <p>A pneumatic attachment on the diagnostic head allows assessment of tympanic membrane motion by generating positive pressure in the EAC, causing the tympanic membrane to deflect medially. When pressure is released, the tympanic membrane expands laterally. This technique is an important tool in the diagnosis of middle ear effusions, vascular lesions, and inner ear fistulas.</p>
                            
                            <p>For optimal viewing of the tympanic membrane in an adult, retract the auricle posteriorly and superiorly to straighten the EAC; for optimal viewing in a child, pull the auricle posteriorly. Remove any debris or cerumen to allow an adequate examination. Proceed with the examination as follows:</p>
