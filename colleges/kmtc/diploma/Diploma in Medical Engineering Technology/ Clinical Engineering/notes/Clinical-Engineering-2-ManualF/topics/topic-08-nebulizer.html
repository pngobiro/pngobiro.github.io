                            <p>A nebulizer is a medication delivery system for aerosolized inhaled medication. It changes medication from a liquid to a mist form and warms it up before the medication can be inhaled into the patient’s lungs.</p>

                                    <p>The nebulizer works by pumping pressurized air through the liquid. Once it has formed a fine mist, the patient breathes it in through a mouthpiece or face mask. Nebulization from a drug solution is a common method of medical aerosol generation.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>To deliver a drug by nebulization, the drug must first be dispersed in a liquid (usually aqueous) medium. After application of a dispersing force (either a jet of gas or ultrasonic waves), the drug particles are contained within the aerosol droplets, which are then inhaled.</p>
                            <p>In a nebulizer, the aerosol output is increased by directing auxiliary air entrained at the time of inspiration by enhanced delivery designs. Adaptive aerosol delivery monitors a patient’s breathing pattern in the first three breaths, and then targets the aerosol delivery into the first 50% of inhalation of each time. This commits that the aerosol is delivered to the patient during inspiration only, thereby eliminating loss during expiration that occurs with a continuous output nebulizer.</p>

                            <h4>Operation/Working Principle of Jet Nebulizer</h4>
                            <p>The working of jet nebulizers is based on the <strong>Venturi's rule</strong>, according to which there is a decrease in the fluid pressure as it flows through a limited (narrow) sectional region.</p>
                            <p>A jet nebulizer unit has a T-shaped mouthpiece and a compressor employed in forcing the gas through a plastic bottle (i.e., nebulizer reservoir).</p>
                            <p>In these nebulizers, a jet of high-pressure airstream travels at high velocity through a narrow hole called the venturi nozzle into the drug solution which is placed in the plastic bottle. This results in the development of low pressure on the top of the drug solution. This drives the drug solution to be aerosolized up the narrow capillary tube.</p>

                            <p>The small aerosol particles are inhaled by the patient through the mouthpiece and the larger droplets will hit the baffles located in various numbers and positions as per the design of the nebulizer. These impactions further atomize the bigger droplets into smaller estimated size droplets that will leave the nebulizer. In addition, baffles also regulate and reduce the velocity of aerosol releasing through the nebulizer.</p>

                            <h4>Jet nebulizers with collection bag</h4>
                            <p>This nebulizer type releases an aerosol only during inhalation. Collection bag serves up to collect and store an aerosol generated during the expiratory phase breath hold. The stored drug is further delivered to a patient in the next cycle with one-way valves that are fitted with nebulizer and located between the mouthpiece and the collection bag. In addition, Jet nebulizers with a collection bag offer an advantage in that they improve pulmonary delivery of drugs and also decrease the amount of drug loss to the environment.</p>

                            <h3>ii) Ultrasonic Nebulizers</h3>
                            <p>Ultrasonic nebulizers are the devices that utilize a ceramic piezoelectric crystal to produce ultrasound waves, which vibrates on electrical excitation. Thus within the device chamber, high-energy waves of a specific frequency are produced in the solution. The surface waves produce small droplets that are carried away by an airstream for inhalations.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the piezoelectric crystal, the ultrasonic nebulizer consists of a nebulizer chamber, fan, and baffle system.</p>

                            <h4>Operation/Working Principle</h4>
                            <p>During the operations of Ultrasonic Nebulizer, piezoelectric crystal owing to electric current produce vibrations of high frequency (1–3 MHz) and thus forming fountain-like structures of the drug solution. The smaller droplets are formed at the bottom of the fountain, whereas large droplets are formed at the peak of the fountain. The larger droplets are deflected by the baffles and then fragmented into smaller droplets that are then nebulized as inhalable aerosols.</p>

                            <h3>iii) Mesh Nebulizer</h3>
                            <p>Mesh nebulizers are the newest innovation of nebulizer product to the market. They use a mesh cap with tiny holes to help dispense medication into consistent particle sizes that can be easily and comfortably inhaled.</p>
                            <p>Almost entirely silent, modern mesh nebulizers are also small and compact and enable complete treatment in little time possible. They are also often battery operated, giving patients the freedom to complete their respiratory treatment when they're on-the-go.</p>
