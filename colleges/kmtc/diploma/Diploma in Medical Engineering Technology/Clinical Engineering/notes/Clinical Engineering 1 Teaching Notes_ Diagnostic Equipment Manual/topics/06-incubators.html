                            <h3>Procedure for running an incubator</h3>
                            <p>Once the cultures of organisms are created, the culture plates are to be placed inside an incubator at the desired temperature and required period of time. In most clinical laboratories, the usual temperature to be maintained is 35–37°C for bacteria.</p>
                            <p>The following are the steps to be followed while running an incubator:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">Before using the incubator, it should be made sure that no remaining items are present in the incubator from the previous cycles. However, in some cases, if the same incubator is being used for multiple organisms, and they require the same set of parameters, they can be placed together in the same incubator.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-content">The door of the incubator is then kept closed, and the incubator is switched on. The incubator has to be heated up to the desired temperature of the growth of the particular organism. The thermometer can be used to see if the temperature has reached.</span>
                                </li>

                            <h3>Maintenance of bacterial incubators</h3>
                            
                            <h4>1. Clean It Regularly</h4>
                            <p>If your incubator is contaminated, it's likely your results will be negatively impacted. As such, it's important to stick to a strict cleaning schedule for your unit. Some key steps to follow are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Always wear gloves when handling containers to be placed inside the unit.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">If using a humidity pan, change the water in the pan at least once per week.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Clean the humidity pan, chamber, shelves, and any other removable parts regularly. Depending on the application, disinfection may be sufficient, or complete sterilization might be required. Make sure any disinfectants used won't harm your cell cultures or corrode the incubator chamber. <strong>Quaternary ammonium disinfectant</strong> is one of the best options for many applications.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Remember to clean the outside of the unit, especially the door handle.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Clean the fan and fan wheels every few months.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Some lab incubators include HEPA filters, which trap fine particulate matter present in the incoming air to reduce the potential for chamber contamination. Filters should be replaced every six months to one year.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2. Monitor Humidity and CO2</h4>
                            <p>Optimal growth conditions for cell cultures also include a specific humidity level and, in some cases, CO2 level. Tissues and cells are sensitive to changes in these parameters, so they need to be monitored closely.</p>
                            <p>If the humidity is too low, there's a chance your cell culture media can evaporate or your growth media may become too concentrated. Ideal humidity is usually around 95%, and to keep it at this level, you need to make sure the water tray (under the incubator) is never at risk of running dry.</p>
                            <p>For CO2 incubators, you'll need to monitor the CO2 level. This is typically kept at 5% to maintain a constant pH for optimal growth. CO2 sensors help here by signaling when and how much CO2 needs to be added to the chamber. You can check CO2 levels using an external gas analyzer every few months.</p>

                            <h4>3. Monitor Temperature</h4>
                            <p>Incubators are often maintained at 37°C for optimal growth of cell cultures. Deviations in temperature could inhibit growth or even destroy cultures. Temperature sensors are included units, but how do you know that you can always rely on your sensor? One way to ensure the correct temperature is use a second thermometer.</p>
                            <p>If your incubator has a glass door, you can attach a calibrated thermometer to the inside of the glass and read it without having to open the door. You can check this against the sensor temperature and if they're different, you know the sensor needs to be recalibrated.</p>
                            <p>Avoiding opening and closing the door unnecessarily can help keep the temperature stable (and prevent contaminants from entering the chamber). If you're concerned about the incubator door being inadvertently opened, you can opt for a unit with a door lock.</p>

                            <h4>4. Place Your Unit Properly</h4>
                            <p>Proper positioning of your unit can ensure it runs efficiently and has minimum exposure to potential contaminants. Here are the factors you need to consider when deciding on the perfect spot for your lab incubator:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Doorways and vents can blow in contaminants and increase the chance of fungal growth. What's more, they can create drafts which can affect the temperature stability of your unit.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Direct sunlight can cause temperature fluctuations and issues with anti-condensation features.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">You need enough space (at least three inches) around the unit so that heat can vent and cords and sockets are easily accessible.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Place floor incubators on a stand to limit the risk of contaminants sweeping in when the door is open.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Avoid humid, damp areas that may be harboring fungal growth.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Place units away from sources of vibration such as shakers, stirrers, or refrigerators, as vibrations can affect cell growth.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">Ensure the area around the unit is as clean as possible.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Ideal conditions for a lab incubator would be in a temperature-controlled environment and cleanroom conditions. As that is often not practical nor feasible, taking into account the factors above will suffice for most applications.</p>
