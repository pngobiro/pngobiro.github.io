                            <p>The measurement of blood pressure is important in the diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of clinical conditions especially cardiovascular diseases. Traditionally, blood pressure is measured non-invasively using the auscultatory technique (Korotkoff sounds) with the pressure in the cuff measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer</p>
                            
                            <p>This consequently became, and still is recognized as, the 'gold standard'. However, environmental concerns regarding mercury mean that there is no long-term future for these devices. These concerns have led to the imposition of bans in some European countries and supply in the UK is now restricted to healthcare use. It is therefore recommended that consideration be given to the selection of mercury-free products when the opportunity arises.</p>
                            
                            <p>The cuff pressure can also be measured by an aneroid gauge or by electronic pressure transducers. However, concerns about their reliability and ability to withstand the stresses of clinical use have in the past limited their widespread acceptance. Meanwhile, automated blood pressure measurement devices, many of which use the oscillometric measurement technique, have become increasingly popular because of their ease of use. However, these automated devices have limitations of which users need to be aware.</p>

                                    <p>In 2015, the global prevalence of hypertension was estimated to be more than 1.1 billion.

                            <h3>Detection Methods</h3>
                            
                            <h4>a) Palpation</h4>
                            <p>This is the process of using one’s hands to check/feel the body, especially while perceiving/diagnosing a disease or illness. While being easy to perform, this technique has been shown to underestimate a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg by 25%. Diastolic and mean pressures cannot be determined.</p>

                            <h4>b) Doppler</h4>
                            <p>Systolic pressure can also be determined using the Doppler principle. Blood flow towards or away from the Doppler probe, reflects sound waves causing a change in frequency that is detected using the same Doppler probe. As Doppler is so sensitive, this technique is usually reserved for the measurement of low pressures, e.g. vascular insufficiency.</p>

                            <h4>c) Auscultation</h4>
                            <p>This is the action of listening to sounds from the heart, lungs or other organs, typically with a stethoscope, as part of medical diagnosis. Auscultation over brachial artery while using a Riva Rocci cuff was first described in 1905 by Nicolai Korotkoff, a Russian army sergeant. He described four sounds, or phases, attributable to the systolic, but also to the diastolic blood pressure. A fifth sound was later described (Fig. 1).</p>

                            <p>Oscillotonometer uses two cuffs and two bellows connected to a measurement gauge.</p>
                            <p>With the lever in the sensing position, the occlusive cuff is inflated above systolic pressure. The cuff is then deflated using a bleed valve until the needle suddenly starts to move vigorously. The lever is then switched to measure the occluding cuff pressure. This is the systolic blood pressure. With the lever back in the 'sensing cuff' position, the occluding cuff is deflated further. The needle will jump further with maximal oscillations occurring at mean arterial pressure (MAP), as measured by moving the lever once more. Diastolic pressure is the point at which these oscillations reduce.</p>

                            <h4>e) Mercury manometers</h4>
                            <p>The air in the cuff acts on a liquid forcing it up a manometer. Mercury is used as it has 13.6 times the density of water. (A systolic pressure of 120 mm of mercury equates to 1.62 m of water as 7.5 mmHg 1/4 10 cmH2O). A sphygmomanometer uses an open manometer and measures gauge pressure, e.g. pressure over atmospheric pressure. Unlike water, the meniscus created by a level of mercury is convex upwards. Measurement is taken from the top of the meniscus.</p>

                            <h4>f) Aneroid gauge</h4>
                            <p>An aneroid gauge commonly replaces the mercury column as it is more robust and avoids the problems associated with mercury toxicity. An increase in pressure expands a bellows, which then moves a pointer along a scale to indicate pressure. They are susceptible to loss of accuracy over time and hence require regular calibration.</p>

                            <h4>g) Electronic systems</h4>
                            <p>A change in air pressure causes movement of a diaphragm. That movement is then detected and displayed electronically.</p>

                            <p>A sphygmomanometer, blood pressure meter, blood pressure monitor or blood pressure gauge is a device used to measure blood pressure, composed of an inflatable cuff to collapse and then release the artery under the cuff in a controlled manner, and a mercury or mechanical manometer to measure the pressure. It is always used in conjunction with a means to determine at what pressure blood flow is just starting, and at what pressure it is unimpeded. Manual sphygmomanometers are used in conjunction with a stethoscope.</p>

                            <p>They require a stethoscope for auscultation. They are used by trained practitioners. It is possible to obtain a basic reading through palpation alone, but this only yields the systolic pressure.</p>

                            <p>They use oscillometric measurements and electronic calculations rather than auscultation. They may use manual or automatic inflation. These are electronic, are easy to operate without training, and can be used in noisy environments; they are not as accurate as mercury instruments.</p>
                            <p>They measure systolic and diastolic pressures by oscillometric detection, using a piezoelectric pressure sensor and electronic components, including a microprocessor. They do not measure systolic and diastolic pressures directly, but calculate them from the mean pressure and empirical statistical oscillometric parameters. Calibration is also a concern for these instruments. Most instruments also display pulse rate.</p>

                            <h3>Operation of a Sphygmomanometer</h3>
                            <p>In humans, the cuff is normally placed smoothly and snugly around an upper arm as shown in the figure below, at roughly the same vertical height as the heart while the subject is seated with the arm supported. It is essential that the correct size of cuff is selected for the patient. Too small a cuff results in too high a pressure, while too large a cuff results in too low a pressure. The cuff is inflated until the artery is completely occluded.</p>
                            
                            <p>With a manual instrument, listening with a stethoscope to the brachial artery at the elbow, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff. As the pressure in the cuffs falls, a "whooshing" or pounding sound is heard (Korotkoff sounds) when blood flow first starts again in the artery. The pressure at which this sound began is noted and recorded as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released until the sound can no longer be heard. This is recorded as the diastolic blood pressure.</p>

                            <h3>Korotkoff Sounds</h3>
                            <p>Introduced by the Russian Army physician N. Korotkoff in 1905. Korotkoff discovered that, if a limb is partially occluded, a cardiac-synchronous sound is still present in the limb distal to the occlusion. The method therefore relies on occluding the flow of arterial blood for a short period of time.</p>
                            
                            <p>The cuff is initially inflated to a sufficient pressure to occlude the limb completely. Then the pressure is slowly decreased (2-3 mmHg s⁻¹). This gives rise to four or five different “phases” of Korotkoff sounds.</p>

                            <p>It is important that cuffs are not inflated to too high a pressure, or even held at moderately high pressure for too long. There are two reasons for this:</p>
                            
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content">First, given that the purpose of the pressure is to occlude blood flow down the limb it is necessary to ensure that the occlusion does not occur for enough time to cause <strong>significant oxygen depletion for too long in the occluded sections of the limb</strong>.</span>
                                </li>

                            <p>Invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure (IBP) monitoring is a commonly used technique in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is also often used in the operating theatre. The technique involves the insertion of a catheter into a suitable artery and then displaying the measured pressure wave on a monitor. The most common reason for using intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring is to gain a 'beat-to-beat' record of a patient's blood pressure.</p>

                            <p>A stethoscope is a medical instrument used to listen to body sounds such as those made by the heart, lungs, and intestines. Using a stethoscope to hear sounds is called auscultation. Medical professionals are trained to use stethoscopes, but you can learn how to use one too.</p>
