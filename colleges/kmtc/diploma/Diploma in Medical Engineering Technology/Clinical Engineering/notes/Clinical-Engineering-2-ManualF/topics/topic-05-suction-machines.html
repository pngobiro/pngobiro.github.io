                            <p>Suction machine (also known as aspirator) is a type of medical device that is primarily used for removing obstructions like mucus, saliva, blood, or secretions from a person's airway. When an individual is unable to clear secretions due to a lack of consciousness or an ongoing medical procedure, suction machines help them breathe by maintaining a clear airway.</p>
                            
                            <p>They are found in operating theatres, delivery suites/rooms in maternity department, ENT and emergency departments. Smaller specialized suctions are used in dental departments.</p>

                            <h3>Principles of Operation</h3>
                            <p>Suction is generated by a pump, which is normally an electrically powered motor, but manually powered versions are also often found. The pump generates a suction that draws air from a bottle. The reduced pressure in this bottle then draws the fluid from the patient via a tube. The fluid remains in the bottle until disposal is possible. A valve prevents fluid from passing into the motor itself.</p>

                            <p>The suction pump can be either portable or standard. Usually, the standard medical suction pump is connected to the mains electrical supply for energy.

                            <p>The pump is operated electrically through an electric motor. The motors may take various forms depending on individual Engineering design and the anticipated capacity of the pump. Popular pump types used include: Centrifugal, reciprocating (piston) and Diaphragm.</p>
                            <p>A clear glass or Perspex bottle with a rubber-sealed lid is included in the pneumatic circuit to reserve the vacuum created. A second bottle may be included to boost the pump's capacity to hold sucked fluid which ensures longer suction before emptying is done.</p>
                            <p>A flexible rubber or plastic pipe interacts directly with the liquid to be sucked and terminates in the bottle. Another similar pipe leaves the lid to the pump. In the two bottle design, the outlet pipe from one bottle goes into the second bottle as input pipe.</p>
                            <p>The output of the second bottle then goes to the pump. With each backward stroke in the Reciprocating and diaphragm pumps, negative pressure is created in the pneumatic circuit. In the Centrifugal type, vacuum is created on the suction pipe which is part of the pneumatic circuit. In all cases if the free pipe is immersed in a fluid (e.g. the placental blood and amniotic fluid), the fluid is sucked into the bottle and the bottles emptied once full. A special float valve (called anti-overflow device) is included in the bottles in some designs. It interacts with the motor control to stop pumping once a pre-determined liquid level is reached.</p>

                            <h3>iii) Central piped vacuum system</h3>
                            <p>This is piped vacuum from a central source. Two motor operated pumps are interconnected to create vacuum in a reservoir. The pumps are operated by pressure switches which activate the pumps once pressure falls below a pre-determined level in the reservoir.</p>
                            <p>The pump piping is rigid but is connected to the reservoir via a flexible pipe which absorbs the shock of the pumping system before the reservoir during pumping. Outlets to the patient are connected to a central pipe leading to the reservoir. Each patient outlet is connected to the central pipe via a glass bottle trap (for collecting the liquid during suction) and Bacterial filter (for ensuring that pathogenic agents from the suction site and fluid don't pass on to the atmosphere). The air sucked in the system is released to the atmosphere through the exhaust pipe via silencers (which muffle the noise of the gas as it is released under pressure to the atmosphere). A flexible plastic or rubber pipe is connected to the patient outlet on one end and is immersed in the liquid on the other end. The vacuum in the reservoir effects suction of the liquid.</p>

                            <h3>iv) Pneumatic driven Suction Pumps or Vacuum Ejector</h3>
                            <p>A vacuum ejector or simply ejector is a type of vacuum pump, which produces vacuum by means of the Venturi effect.</p>
                            <p>In an ejector, a working fluid (liquid or gaseous) flows through a jet nozzle into a tube that first narrows and then expands in cross-sectional area. The fluid leaving the jet is flowing at a high velocity which due to Bernoulli's principle results in it having low pressure, thus generating a vacuum. The outer tube then narrows into a mixing section where the high velocity working fluid mixes with the fluid that is drawn in by the vacuum, imparting enough velocity for it to be ejected, the tube then typically expands in order to decrease the velocity of the ejected stream, allowing the pressure to smoothly increase to the external pressure.</p>

                            <p>Commonly for suction pumps, capacitor run motors are used because centrifugal switches (to switch off starting winding and capacitor) cannot be manufactured—sparkless. In suction pumps for operating theatres, sparkless switches have to be used.</p>
