A steam boiler is usually provided with [two] safety valves. These are directly placed on the boiler. In brief, the function of a safety valve is to blow off the steam when the pressure of steam inside the boiler exceeds the working pressure.

                                        <p>We know that water in a boiler is continuously converted into steam which is used by the engine. Thus we need a feed pump to deliver water to the boiler.</p>
                                        <p>The pressure of steam inside the boiler is high. So the pressure of feed water has to be increased proportionately before it is made to enter the boiler. Generally, the pressure of feed water is 20% more than that in the boiler.</p>
                                        <p>A feed pump may be of centrifugal type or reciprocating type. But a double acting reciprocating pump is commonly used as a feed pump these days. The reciprocating pumps are run by the steam from the same boiler in which water is to be fed.</p>
