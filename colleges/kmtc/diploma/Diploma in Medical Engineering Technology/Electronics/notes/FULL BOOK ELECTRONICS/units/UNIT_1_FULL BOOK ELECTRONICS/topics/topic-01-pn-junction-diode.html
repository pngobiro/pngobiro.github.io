                            <p>Electronics is the branch of Physics deals with the study of generation, motion, manipulation, control and detection of electrons in vacuum and semiconductors under applied electric or magnetic field. The branch is originated after invention of vacuum tube diode which is a two element electronic rectifying device by J. A. Fleming (U.K.) in the year 1904. In 1906, Lee De Forest added a third element, called the control grid, to the vacuum diode, resulting in the first amplifier, the triode. In the early 1930s the four-element tetrode and five-element pentode gained prominence in the electron-tube industry. The era of semiconductor electronics is started after invention of semiconductor diode in 1926, by L.O. Grondahl and P.H. Geiger (USA). They found rectifying properties in a (semiconducting) copper oxide-copper junction and by 1938 W. Schottky (Germany) developed a theoretical explanation for it. The p-n-diode finally was described by W. Schockley (USA) in 1949, even after J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain and W. Schockley had invented the transistor in 1947.</p>

                            <p>P-type semiconductor can be fabricated by doping small amount of trivalent atoms to tetravalent materials like Silicon (Si) or Germanium (Ge). Similarly, N-type semiconductor can be fabricated by doping small amount of pentavalent atoms to Silicon or Germanium. Due to the process of doping, P-type semiconductor has more number of holes in valance band than number of electrons in conduction band and hence has holes as majority charge carriers. Similarly, N-type semiconductor has more number of electrons in conduction band than number of holes in valance band and hence has electrons as majority charge carriers. Thus a P-type semiconductor consists of positive charged holes as majority charge carriers, negative charged immobile impurity ions (acceptor ions) and neutral immobile Si atoms in its crystal structure. Similarly, an N-type semiconductor consists of negatively charged electrons as majority charge carriers, positively charged immobile impurity ions (donor ions) and neutral immobile Si atoms in its crystal structure. Additionally, due to the room temperature, P-type semiconductor has small amount of free electrons and N-type semiconductor has small amount of holes as minority charge carriers.</p>

                            <p>It should be noted that a PN junction can not be formed by simply joining or welding the two pieces together, because it would produce a discontinuous crystal structure. Special fabrication techniques are used to prepare P-N junctions.</p>

                            <p>While fabricating a P-N junction, the following processes takes place:</p>

This difference in concentration creates a concentration gradient across the junction. It results in the diffusion of mobile charge carriers across the junction. Moreover, the electrons and holes move at random in all directions due to thermal energy. In doing so, some carriers manage to cross over the junction.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content">The diffusion of holes and free electrons across the junction takes place for a short time. After a few recombination of holes and free electrons in the vicinity of the junction, a retraining force is automatically set up. This force is produced due to depletion region, which exists on either side of the junction. As a result of this, further diffusion of holes and free electrons from one region to the other is stopped by this depletion layer. The formation of this depletion region is due to availability of uncovered negative acceptor ions in P-region and positive donor ions in N-region in the junction, as shown in Fig. 1.2. The additional holes trying to diffuse to the N-region are repelled by the uncovered positive charge of the donor ions. Similarly, the electrons trying to diffuse into P-region, are repelled by the uncovered negative charge of the acceptor ions. Hence, the further diffusion of free electrons and holes across the junction is stopped.</span>

                            <p>Thus the region containing the uncovered acceptor and uncovered donor ions in the vicinity of the P-N junction is called depletion region. Since the depletion region contains immobile ions, which are electrically charged, the depletion region is also called space-charge region. Due to the presence of only immobile ions, the depletion region behaves as insulator. This space-charge region establishes a potential difference across the junction (designated as $\mathrm{V_p}$), even when the junction is not connected across any external voltage source as shown in Fig. 1.3. This electric potential $(\mathrm{V_p})$ is called junction potential or barrier potential. At room temperature, the junction potential or barrier voltage is $0.7\mathrm{V}$ for Si diode and $0.3\mathrm{V}$ for Ge diode.</p>

                                        <p>When the diode is forward-biased and the applied voltage is increased from zero, hardly any current flows through the diode in the beginning. It is so because the external voltage is being opposed by the internal barrier voltage $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ whose value is $0.7\mathrm{V}$ for Si and $0.3\mathrm{V}$ for Ge. As soon as $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ is neutralized, current through the diode increases rapidly with increasing applied battery voltage. It is found that a small voltage of $1.0\mathrm{V}$ produces a forward current of about $50\mathrm{mA}$. The diode will burn and fail to function if forward voltage is increased beyond a certain safe limit. The forward voltage at which the current $I_{\mathrm{B}}$ starts to flow is called knee voltage or Cut-in voltage (or Cut-off voltage or off-set voltage).</p>

                                        <p>When the diode is reverse-biased, majority carriers are blocked and only a small current (due to minority charge carriers) flows through the diode. As the reverse voltage increases from zero, the reverse current very quickly reaches its maximum or saturation value $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{C}}$, which is also known as leakage current or reverse saturation current. It is of the order of nanoamperes (nA) for Si and microamperes (μA) for Ge. As seen from Fig. 1.6, when reverse voltage exceeds a certain value called breakdown voltage $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BR}}$, the leakage current suddenly and sharply increases. The curve indicates zero resistance at this point.</p>

                            <p>In second approximation, the off-set voltage of the diode is taken into account. Usually this model is used when the source voltage is small. In this approximation, a practical diode (made of Si) is equated to an ideal diode in series with a battery of $0.7\mathrm{V}$, as shown in Fig. 1.8. If the source voltage is greater than $0.7\mathrm{V}$, the switch closes and the diode voltage is $0.7\mathrm{V}$. If the source voltage is less than $0.7\mathrm{V}$ or if the source voltage is negative, the switch is open.</p>

                            <p>The equivalent circuit for the third approximation is a switch in series with a battery of $0.7\mathrm{V}$ and a resistance of $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{B}}$ as shown in Fig. 1.9 (a). After the external circuit has overcome the barrier potential, the diode current produces an IR drop across the bulk resistance. Therefore, the total voltage across the silicon diode becomes, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{F}} = 0.7 + \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{F}}\cdot \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{B}}$</p>

For a given PN junction, the first two factors are constant, thus making the value of barrier voltage $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ dependent only on temperature. It has been observed that for both germanium and silicon, the value of $V_{\mathrm{B}}$ decreases by $2\mathrm{mV} / {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Mathematically, the decrease in barrier voltage, $\Delta V_{\mathrm{B}} = -0.002\times \Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is the increase in temperature in $^\circ \mathrm{C}$.</p>

                            <p>As shown in Fig. 1.12, in the reverse bias region, the breakdown voltage $(\mathrm{V_{BR}})$ is increasing with the increase in temperature and the reverse saturation current $(\mathrm{I_C})$ is increasing to almost double in magnitude for every $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature.</p>

                            <p>When we apply ac signal to a P-N junction, it becomes periodically forward and reverse biased. When a forward biased junction is suddenly reverse biased, a reverse current flows which is large initially but gradually decreases to the level of saturation current $(\mathrm{I_C})$. This effect can be equated as it is a discharging capacitor and represented by a capacitance called diffusion capacitance $(\mathrm{C_D})$. Similarly, a reverse biased P-N junction behaves like a junction capacitor (parallel plate capacitor) with depletion region acts like dielectric medium between P-type and N-type plates. This junction capacitance is called transition capacitance $(\mathrm{C_T})$.</p>

                            <p>For ac signal, a forward biased junction offers ac resistance $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{ac}}$ along with barrier voltage $(\mathrm{V_B})$ and a parallel diffusion capacitance $(\mathrm{C_D})$. Similarly, a reverse biased junction offers a reverse resistance $\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{R}}$ connected in parallel with the transition capacitance $(\mathrm{C_T})$. Thus an ac equivalent circuit of P-N junction diode during forward bias is shown in Fig. 1.13 (a) and during reverse bias is shown in Fig. 1.13 (b).</p>
