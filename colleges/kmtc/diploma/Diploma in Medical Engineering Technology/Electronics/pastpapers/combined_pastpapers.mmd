d Explain how Forward Voltage Triggering is done to trigger an SCR
7 marks

\section*{Forward Voltage Triggering}

This kind of triggering method is mainly used to increase the voltage among the anode and cathode. So that the width of the depletion layer gan be increased and makes to increase the accelerating voltage of minority charge carriers at J 2 junction. Further, this can be lead to an avalanche breakdown of J 2 -junction at a forward break ovef- yoltage.
In this stage, silicon controlled rectifier can change into conduction mode \& therefore a huge flow of current with a less drop of voltage will be there. Throughout the triggering state in the SCR, the range of forwarding voltage drop is 1 to $1 / 5$ volts across the SCR. This may be amplified using the load current.
In practical, this method cannot be used as it requires an extremely large anode voltage to the cathode. Once the voltage is high than the break over-voltage, then it offers extremely huge currents. This may cause harm to the thyristor.

Electrical Transmitter containselectrical stage which drives an optical source to give modulation of light wave carrier.

Optical Source provides electyical to optical conversion can be LED's on laser. Requirements are

Optical fibres usciles transmission mattum to compensate for losses during transmission repeatrs or optical amplifier can be used at regalar intervals. Required characteristics are low dispersion, lower fibre non tinserity, low attenwation, high optical signal to noiseration large repeater span.

Optical detector detects and convert optical signal to propurtional electrical signal Eg: Photo diodes. Photo transigtors etc

Repeaters and Optical Amplifier:
To cumpensete for signal degradation in long distance convert optical signal to electrical signal, restores the signal used then converting back to optical signal for further ransmission, This mailhed increases cosh complevity and ned cees operational bundwidit.

Optical amplifiers simply amplify the optical signal. They provide improved SNR due to all optical domain operation.

Fibre Couplers and Fibre Connectors are used to distribute light from main fibre into one or more branches of fibres and to convert one fibre with anothen.
Receiver: At the destination of an optical fiber transmission line there is a coupling device (connector) which couples the light signal to the detector.
- Inside the receiver is a photodiode that detects the weakened and distorted optical signal emerging from the end of an optical fiber and converts it to an electrical signal.

Two SCRs are connected in inverse parallel with gate terminal as common. Gate terminals is connected to both the N and P regions due to which gate signal may be applied which is irrespective of the polarity of the signal. Here, we do not have anode and cathode since it works for both the polarities which means that device is bilateral. It consists of three terminals namely, main terminal $1\left(\mathrm{MT}_{1}\right)$, main terminal $2\left(\mathrm{MT}_{2}\right)$, and gate terminal G .

Medical applications
\end{tabular}

The highly collimated beam of a laser may be further focused to a microscopic dot of extremely high energy density. This concept makes it useful for cutting and cauterizing instrument.

\section*{Welding and Cutting}

The highly collimated beam of a laser may be further focused to a microscopic dot of extremely high energy density for welding and cutting.
For instance, the automobile industry makes extensive use of carbon dioxide lasers with powers up to several kilowatts for computer controlled welding on auto assembly lines.

\section*{Surveying}

Helium-neon and semiconductor lasers have become standard parts of the field surveyor's equipment. A fast laser pulse is sent to a corner reflector at the point to be measured and the

\section*{time of reflection is measured to get the distance.}

\section*{Garment industry}

Computer controlled laser garment cutters can be programmed to cut out 400 size 6 and then 700 size 9 garments. The usefulness of the laser for such cutting operations comes from the fact that the beam is highly collimated and can be further focused to a microscopic dot of extremely high energy density for cutting.

\section*{Laser nuclear fusion}

Telephone fiber drivers may be solid state lasers the size of a grain of sand and consume a power of only half a milliwatt. They can sent 50 million pulses per second into an attached telephone fiber and encode over 600 simultaneous telephone conversations.

\section*{Communication}
$$C$$

Digital data transmission plays a pivotal role in modern society. Optical communication is any form of telecommunication that uses light as the transmission medium. An optical communication system consists of a transmitter, which encodes a message into an optical signal, a channel, which carries the signal to its destination, and a receiver, which reproduces the message from the received optical signal. [4]

\section*{Laser printing}

The laser printer has in a few years become the dominant mode of printing in offices. It Any Tour' employs a semiconductor laser and the xerography principle it produces a charge pattern scanned across a photoactive seleniumed.
CDs and optical discs

\section*{CDs aros}

CDs and
Analog sound data is digitized by sampling at 44.1 kHz and coding as binary numbers in the pits on the compact disc. As the focused laser beam sweeps over the pits, it reproduces the binary numbers in the detection circuitry.

C EXPLAIN in detail how mobile phone works when you make a call
When you speak into a cellphone, a tiny microphone in the handset coo 6 marks down sounds voice into a corresponding up-and-down pattonts the up-and microchip inside the phone turns these signals into strin packed up into a radio wave and beamed
through the air at the speed of light until it reach the nearest cellphone mast/boosters.
The mast receives the signals and passes them on to its base station through fiber optic cable connected from one station/mast to another, which effectively coordinates what happens inside each local part of the cellphone network, which is called a cell. From the base station the calls are routed onward to their destination. Calls made from a cellphone to another cellphone on the same network travel to their destination by being routed to the base station nearest to the destination phone, and finally to that phone itself. Calls made to a cellphone
on a different network or a land line follows a more lengthy path. They may have to be routed into the main telephone network before they can reach their ultimate destination.
