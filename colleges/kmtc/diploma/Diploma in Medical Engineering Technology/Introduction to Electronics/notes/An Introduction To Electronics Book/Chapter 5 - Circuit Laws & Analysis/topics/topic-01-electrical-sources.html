However, many systems (e.g., varicaps that are used in radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.</p>

                            <h3>Ideal voltage sources</h3>
                            <p>An ideal voltage source is a two-terminal device that maintains a fixed voltage drop across its terminals. It is often used as a mathematical abstraction that simplifies the analysis of real electric circuits. If the voltage across an ideal voltage source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent voltage source. Conversely, if the voltage across an ideal voltage source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled voltage source. A mathematical model of an amplifier will include dependent voltage sources whose magnitude is governed by some fixed relation to an input signal, for example.<sup>[2]</sup> In the analysis of faults on electrical power systems, the whole network of interconnected sources and transmission lines can be usefully replaced by an ideal (AC) voltage source and a single equivalent impedance.</p>

                            <h3>Background</h3>
                            <p>In circuit theory, an ideal current source is a circuit element where the current through it is independent of the voltage across it. It is a mathematical model, which real devices can only approach in performance. If the current through an ideal current source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent current source. Conversely, if the current through an ideal current source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled current source.</p>

                            <p>The voltage across an ideal current source is completely determined by the circuit it is connected to. When connected to a short circuit, there is zero voltage and thus zero power delivered. When connected to a load resistance, the voltage across the source approaches infinity as the load resistance approaches infinity (an open circuit). Thus, an ideal current source, if such a thing existed in reality, could supply unlimited power and so would represent an unlimited source of energy.</p>
                            <p>No physical current source is ideal. For example, no physical current source can operate when applied to an open circuit. There are two characteristics that define a current source in real life. One is its internal resistance and the other is its compliance voltage. The compliance voltage is the maximum voltage that the current source can supply to a load. Over a given load range, it is possible for some types of real current sources to exhibit nearly infinite internal resistance. However, when the current source reaches its compliance voltage, it abruptly stops being a current source.</p>
                            <p>In circuit analysis, a current source having finite internal resistance is modeled by placing the value of that resistance across an ideal current source (the Norton equivalent circuit). However, this model is only useful when a current source is operating within its compliance voltage.</p>

                            <h3>Passive current source</h3>
                            <p>The simplest non-ideal current source consists of a voltage source in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by the ratio of the voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor (Ohm's law; $I = V / R$). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual ground circuit, etc.).</p>
                            <p>The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance. For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a 'good' current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5 V voltage source in series with a 4.7 kilohm resistor will provide an approximately constant current of $1 \mathrm{mA}$ ($\pm 5\%$) to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450 ohm.</p>
                            <p>A Van de Graaff generator is an example of such a high voltage current source. It behaves as an almost constant current source because of its very high output voltage coupled with its very high output resistance and so it supplies the same few microamperes at any output voltage up to hundreds of thousands of volts (or even tens of megavolts) for large laboratory versions.</p>

                            <h4>Current-stable nonlinear implementation</h4>
                            <p>They are implemented by active electronic components (transistors) having current-stable nonlinear output characteristic when driven by steady input quantity (current or voltage). These circuits behave as dynamic resistors changing its present resistance to compensate current variations. For example, if the load increases its resistance, the transistor decreases its present output resistance (and vice versa) to keep up a constant total resistance in the circuit.</p>
                            <p>Active current sources have many important applications in electronic circuits. They are often used in place of ohmic resistors in analog integrated circuits (e.g., a differential amplifier) to generate a current that depends slightly on the voltage across the load.</p>
                            <p>The common emitter configuration driven by a constant input current or voltage and common source (common cathode) driven by a constant voltage naturally behave as current sources (or sinks) because the output impedance of these devices is naturally high. The output part of the simple current mirror is an example of such a current source widely used in integrated circuits. The common base, common gate and common grid configurations can serve as constant current sources as well.</p>

                            <p>A JFET can be made to act as a current source by tying its gate to its source. The current then flowing is the $I_{DSS}$ of the FET. These can be purchased with this connection already made and in this case the devices are called current regulator diodes or constant current diodes or current limiting diodes (CLD).

                            <p>The simple resistor current source will become "ideal" if the voltage across the load is somehow held zero. This idea seems paradoxical since real loads always "create" voltage drops across themselves but it is yet implemented by applying a parallel negative feedback. In these circuits, an op-amp compensates the voltage drop across the load by adding the same voltage to the exciting input voltage. As a result, the op-amp inverting input is held at virtual ground and the combination of the input voltage source, the resistor and the supplied op-amp constitutes an "ideal" current source with value $I_{OUT} = V_{IN} / R$.</p>

                            <p>A typical example are Howland current source<sup>[2]</sup> and its derivative Deboo integrator.<sup>[3]</sup> In the last example (see Fig. 1 there), the Howland current source consists of an input voltage source $V_{IN}$, a positive resistor R, a load (the capacitor C acting as impedance Z) and a negative impedance converter INIC $(R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R$ and the op-amp). The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current $I_R$ through the load. The INIC acts as a second current source passing "helping" current $I_{-R}$ through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the circuit impedance seen by the input source is increased. However the Howland current source isn't widely used because it requires the four resistors to be perfectly matched, and its impedance drops at high frequencies.<sup>[4]</sup></p>

                            <p>They are implemented as a voltage follower with series negative feedback driven by a constant input voltage source (i.e., a negative feedback voltage stabilizer). The voltage follower is loaded by a constant (current sensing) resistor acting as a simple current-to-voltage converter connected in the feedback loop. The external load of this current source is connected somewhere in the path of the current supplying the current sensing resistor but out of the feedback loop.</p>
                            <p>The voltage follower adjusts its output current $I_{OUT}$ flowing through the load so that to make the voltage drop $V_R = I_{OUT} \cdot R$ across the current sensing resistor R equal to the constant input voltage $V_{IN}$. Thus the voltage stabilizer keeps up a constant voltage drop across a constant resistor; so, a constant current $I_{OUT} = V_R / R = V_{IN} / R$ flows through the resistor and respectively through the load.</p>
                            <p>If the input voltage varies, this arrangement will act as a voltage-to-current converter (voltage-controlled current source VCCS); it can be thought as a reversed (by means of negative feedback) current-to-voltage converter.

                            <p>Current sources implemented as circuits with series negative feedback have the disadvantage that the voltage drop across the current sensing resistor decreases the maximal voltage across the load (the compliance voltage).</p>

                            <p>In this bipolar junction transistor (BJT) implementation (Figure 4), a Zener voltage stabilizer (R1 and DZ1) drives an emitter follower (Q1) loaded by a constant emitter resistor (R2) sensing the load current. The external (floating) load of this current source is connected to the collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they can be thought of as connected in series).</p>
                            <p>Voltage across R2 ($V_{R2}$) is given by $V_Z - V_{BE}$, where $V_{BE}$ is the base-emitter drop of Q1. The emitter current of Q1 which is also the current through R2 is given by:</p>

                            <p>Since $V_Z$ is constant and $V_{BE}$ is also (approximately) constant for a given temperature, it follows that $V_{R2}$ is constant and hence $I_E$ is also constant. Due to transistor action, emitter current $I_E$ is very nearly equal to the collector current $I_C$ of the transistor.</p>

                            <p>The general negative feedback arrangement can be implemented by an IC voltage regulator (LM317 voltage regulator on Figure 8). As with the bare emitter follower and the precise op-amp follower above, it keeps up a constant voltage drop ($1.25V$) across a constant resistor ($1.25\Omega$); so, a constant current (1 A) flows through the resistor and the load. The LED is on when the voltage across the load exceeds $1.8V$ (the indicator circuit introduces some error). The grounded load is an important advantage of this solution.</p>

An ideal voltage source provides no energy when it is loaded by an open circuit (i.e. an infinite impedance), but approaches infinite power and current when the load resistance approaches zero (a short circuit). Such a theoretical device would have a zero ohm output impedance in series with the source. A real-world voltage source has a very low, but non-zero output impedance: often much less than 1 ohm.</p>
                            
                            <p>Conversely, a current source provides a constant current, as long as the load connected to the source terminals has sufficiently low impedance. An ideal current source would provide no energy to a short circuit and approach infinite energy and voltage as the load resistance approaches infinity (an open circuit). An ideal current source has an infinite output impedance in parallel with the source. A real-world current source has a very high, but finite output impedance. In the case of transistor current sources, impedances of a few megohms (at DC) are typical.</p>

                                    <p>An ideal current source cannot be connected to an ideal open circuit because this would create the paradox of running a constant, non-zero current (from the current source) through an element with a defined zero current (the open circuit).</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, an ideal voltage source cannot be connected to an ideal short circuit ($\mathbb{R} = 0$), since this would result a similar paradox of finite nonzero voltage across an element with defined zero voltage (the short circuit).</p>

                            <p>Because no ideal sources of either variety exist (all real-world examples have finite and non-zero source impedance), any current source can be considered as a voltage source with the same source impedance and vice versa. These concepts are dealt with by Norton's and Thévenin's theorems.</p>
