                            <p>An RLC circuit (the letters R, L and C can be in other orders) is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for resistance, inductance and capacitance respectively. The circuit forms a harmonic oscillator for current and will resonate in a similar way as an LC circuit will. The main difference that the presence of the resistor makes is that any oscillation induced in the circuit will die away over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called damping. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency somewhat. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component. An ideal, pure LC circuit is an abstraction for the purpose of theory.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are many applications for this circuit. They are used in many different types of oscillator circuits. Another important application is for tuning, such as in radio receivers or television sets, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves. In this role the circuit is often referred to as a tuned circuit. An RLC circuit can be used as a band-pass filter, band-stop filter, low-pass filter or high-pass filter. The tuning application, for instance, is an example of band-pass filtering. The RLC filter is described as a second-order circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order differential equation in circuit analysis.</p>

                            <h3>Resonance</h3>
                            <p>An important property of this circuit is its ability to resonate at a specific frequency, the resonance frequency, $f_0$. Frequencies are measured in units of hertz. In this article, however, angular frequency, $\omega_0$, is used which is more mathematically convenient. This is measured in radians per second. They are related to each other by a simple proportion,</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$$
                            </div>
                            <p>Resonance occurs because energy is stored in two different ways: in an electric field as the capacitor is charged and in a magnetic field as current flows through the inductor. Energy can be transferred from one to the other within the circuit and this can be oscillatory. A mechanical analogy is a weight suspended on a spring which will oscillate up and down when released.</p>

                            <h4>Natural frequency</h4>
                            <p>The driven resonance frequency in a series or parallel resonant circuit has the value:</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>This is exactly the same as the resonance frequency of an LC circuit, that is, one with no resistor present. The resonant frequency for an RLC circuit is the same as a circuit in which there is no damping, hence undamped resonance frequency. The peak resonance frequency, on the other hand, depends on the value of the resistor and is described as the damped resonant frequency.</p>

                            <h4>Damping</h4>
                            <p>Damping is caused by the resistance in the circuit. It determines whether or not the circuit will resonate naturally (that is, without a driving source). Circuits which will resonate in this way are described as underdamped and those that will not are overdamped. Damping attenuation (symbol $\alpha$) is measured in nepers per second. However, the unitless damping factor (symbol $\zeta$, zeta) is often a more useful measure, which is related to $\alpha$ by</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\zeta = \frac{\alpha}{\omega_0}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>The special case of $\zeta = 1$ is called critical damping and represents the case of a circuit that is just on the border of oscillation. It is the minimum damping that can be applied without causing oscillation.</p>

                            <h4>Bandwidth</h4>
                            <p>The resonance effect can be used for filtering. A key parameter in filter design is bandwidth. The bandwidth is measured between the 3dB-points, that is, the frequencies at which the power passed through the circuit has fallen to half the value passed at resonance.</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\Delta \omega = \omega_2 - \omega_1$$
                            </div>
                            <p>where $\Delta \omega$ is the bandwidth, $\omega_1$ is the lower half-power frequency and $\omega_2$ is the upper half-power frequency. The bandwidth is related to attenuation by:</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\Delta \omega = 2\alpha$$
                            </div>

                            <h4>Q factor</h4>
                            <p>The Q factor is a widespread measure used to characterise resonators. It is defined as the peak energy stored in the circuit divided by the average energy dissipated in it per radian at resonance. Low $Q$ circuits are therefore damped and lossy and high $Q$ circuits are underdamped. $Q$ is related to bandwidth; low $Q$ circuits are wide band and high $Q$ circuits are narrow band. In fact, it happens that $Q$ is the inverse of fractional bandwidth.</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$Q = \frac{1}{F_b} = \frac{\omega_0}{\Delta \omega}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>For a series resonant circuit, the Q factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$Q = \frac{1}{\omega_0 RC} = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R}$$
