                            <p>In electronics, a Schmitt trigger is a comparator circuit with hysteresis, implemented by applying positive feedback to the noninverting input of a comparator or differential amplifier. It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal. The circuit is named a "trigger" because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change. In the non-inverting configuration, when the input is higher than a certain chosen threshold, the output is high. When the input is below a different (lower) chosen threshold, the output is low, and when the input is between the two levels, the output retains its value. This dual threshold action is called hysteresis and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and can act as a bistable circuit (latch or flip-flop). There is a close relation between the two kinds of circuits: a Schmitt trigger can be converted into a latch and a latch can be converted into a Schmitt trigger.</p>
                            
                            <p>Schmitt trigger devices are typically used in signal conditioning applications to remove noise from signals used in digital circuits, particularly mechanical switch bounce. They are also used in closed loop negative feedback configurations to implement relaxation oscillators, used in function generators and switching power supplies.</p>

                            <h3>Fundamental idea</h3>
                            <p>Circuits with hysteresis are based on the fundamental positive feedback idea: any active circuit can be made to behave as a Schmitt trigger by applying a positive feedback so that the loop gain is more than one. The positive feedback is introduced by adding a part of the output voltage to the input voltage; so, these circuits contain an attenuator (the B box in the figure on the right) and a summer (the circle with "+" inside) in addition to an amplifier acting as a comparator. There are three specific techniques for implementing this general idea. The first two of them are dual versions (series and parallel) of the general positive feedback system. In these configurations, the output voltage increases the effective difference input voltage of the comparator by decreasing the threshold or by increasing the circuit input voltage; the threshold and memory properties are incorporated in one element. In the third technique, the threshold and memory properties are separated.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>The original Schmitt trigger is based on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a voltage divider with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors $\mathrm{RC}_1$ and $\mathrm{RC}_2$) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the voltage divider is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second common collector stage Q2 (an emitter follower) through the voltage divider $\mathrm{R}_1 - \mathrm{R}_2$. The emitter-coupled transistors Q1 and Q2 actually compose an electronic double throw switch that switches over the upper legs of the voltage divider and changes the threshold in a different (to the input voltage) direction.</p>
                            
                            <p>This configuration can be considered as a differential amplifier with series positive feedback between its non-inverting input (Q2 base) and output (Q1 collector) that forces the transition process. There is also a smaller negative feedback introduced by the emitter resistor RE. To make the positive feedback dominate over the negative one and to obtain a hysteresis, the proportion between the two collector resistors is chosen $\mathrm{RC}_1 > \mathrm{RC}_2$. Thus less current flows through and less voltage drop is across RE when Q1 is switched on than in the case when Q2 is switched on. As a result, the circuit has two different thresholds in regard to ground (V- in the picture).</p>

                            <h4>Operation</h4>
                            <p><strong>Initial state.</strong> For NPN transistors as shown, imagine the input voltage is below the shared emitter voltage (high threshold for concreteness) so that Q1 base-emitter junction is backward-biased and Q1 does not conduct. Q2 base voltage is determined by the mentioned divider so that Q2 is conducting and the trigger output is in the low state. The two resistors $\mathrm{RC}_2$ and RE form another voltage divider that determines the high threshold. Neglecting VBE, the high threshold value is approximately</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$V _ {\mathrm {H T}} = \frac {R _ {\mathrm {E}}}{R _ {\mathrm {E}} + R _ {\mathrm {C 2}}} V _ {+}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>The output voltage is low but well above the ground. It is approximately equal to the high threshold and may not be low enough to be a logical zero for next digital circuits. This may require additional shifting circuit following the trigger circuit.</p>

                            <p><strong>Crossing up the high threshold.</strong> When the input voltage (Q1 base voltage) rises slightly above the voltage across the emitter resistor RE (the high threshold), Q1 begins conducting. Its collector voltage goes down and Q2 begins going cut-off, because the voltage divider now provides lower Q2 base voltage. The common emitter voltage follows this change and goes down thus making Q1 conduct more. The current begins steering from the right leg of the circuit to the left one. Although Q1 is more conducting, it passes less current through RE (since $\mathrm{RC}_1 > \mathrm{RC}_2$); the emitter voltage continues dropping and the effective Q1 base-emitter voltage continuously increases. This avalanche-like process continues until Q1 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and Q2 turned off. The trigger is transitioned to the high state and the output (Q2 collector) voltage is close to $\mathrm{V}+$. Now, the two resistors $\mathrm{RC}_1$ and RE form a voltage divider that determines the low threshold. Its value is approximately</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$V _ {\mathrm {L T}} = \frac {R _ {\mathrm {E}}}{R _ {\mathrm {E}} + R _ {\mathrm {C 1}}} V _ {+}$$
                            </div>

                            <p><strong>Crossing down the low threshold.</strong> With the trigger now in the high state, if the input voltage lowers enough (below the low threshold), Q1 begins cutting-off. Its collector current reduces; as a result, the shared emitter voltage lowers slightly and Q1 collector voltage rises significantly. $\mathrm{R}_1 - \mathrm{R}_2$ voltage divider conveys this change to Q2 base voltage and it begins conducting. The voltage across RE rises, further reducing the Q1 base-emitter potential in the same avalanche-like manner, and Q1 ceases to conduct. Q2 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and the output voltage becomes low again.</p>

                            <h4>Variations</h4>
                            <p><strong>Non-inverting circuit.</strong> The classic non-inverting Schmitt trigger can be turned into an inverting trigger by taking $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{out}}$ from the emitters instead of from a Q2 collector. In this configuration, the output voltage is equal to the dynamic threshold (the shared emitter voltage) and both the output levels stay away from the supply rails. Another disadvantage is that the load changes the thresholds; so, it has to be high enough. The base resistor RB is obligatory to prevent the impact of the input voltage through Q1 base-emitter junction on the emitter voltage.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Direct-coupled circuit.</strong> To simplify the circuit, the $\mathrm{R}_1 - \mathrm{R}_2$ voltage divider can be omitted connecting Q1 collector directly to Q2 base. The base resistor RB can be omitted as well so that the input voltage source drives directly Q1 base. In this case, the common emitter voltage and Q1 collector voltage are not suitable for outputs. Only Q2 collector should be used as an output.</p>

                            <p>Schmitt triggers are commonly implemented using an operational amplifier or the more dedicated comparator. An open-loop op-amp and comparator may be considered as an analog-digital device having analog inputs and a digital output that extracts the sign of the voltage difference between its two inputs. The positive feedback is applied by adding a part of the output voltage to the input voltage in series or parallel manner.</p>

                            <p>In this circuit, the two resistors $\mathbf{R}_1$ and $\mathbf{R}_2$ form a parallel voltage summer. It adds a part of the output voltage to the input voltage thus "helping" it during and after switching that occurs when the resulting voltage is near the ground. This parallel positive feedback creates the needed hysteresis that is controlled by the proportion between the resistances of $\mathbf{R}_1$ and $\mathbf{R}_2$.</p>

                            <p>The output voltage $\mathrm{V}_{*}$ of the resistive summer can be found by applying the superposition theorem:</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$V _ {+} = \frac {R _ {2}}{R _ {1} + R _ {2}} \cdot V _ {\mathrm {i n}} + \frac {R _ {1}}{R _ {1} + R _ {2}} \cdot V _ {\mathrm {s}}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>The comparator will switch when $\mathrm{V}_{*} = 0$. Then $R_{2} \cdot V_{\mathrm{in}} = -R_{1} \cdot V_{\mathrm{s}}$. So $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ must drop below $-\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} V_{s}$ to get the output to switch. Once the comparator output has switched to $-VS$, the threshold becomes $+ \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} V_{s}$ to switch back to high. So this circuit creates a switching band centered on zero, with trigger levels $\pm \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} V_{s}$.</p>

                            <p>In the inverting version, the attenuation and summation are separated. The two resistors $\mathbf{R}_1$ and $\mathbf{R}_2$ act only as a "pure" attenuator (voltage divider). The input loop acts as a simple series voltage summer that adds a part of the output voltage in series to the circuit input voltage. This series positive feedback creates the needed hysteresis.</p>

                            <p>The output voltage $\mathrm{V}_{+}$ of the voltage divider is:</p>

                            <p>The comparator will switch when $\mathrm{V_{in}} = \mathrm{V}_{+}$. So $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ must exceed above this voltage to get the output to switch.

                            <h3>Noise immunity</h3>
                            <p>One application of a Schmitt trigger is to increase the noise immunity in a circuit with only a single input threshold. With only one input threshold, a noisy input signal near that threshold could cause the output to switch rapidly back and forth from noise alone. A noisy Schmitt Trigger input signal near one threshold can cause only one switch in output value, after which it would have to move beyond the other threshold in order to cause another switch.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example, in Fairchild Semiconductor's QSE15x family of infrared photosensors, an amplified infrared photodiode generates an electric signal that switches frequently between its absolute lowest value and its absolute highest value. This signal is then low-pass filtered to form a smooth signal that rises and falls corresponding to the relative amount of time the switching signal is on and off. That filtered output passes to the input of a Schmitt trigger.</p>

                            <h3>Use as an oscillator</h3>
                            <p>A Schmitt trigger is a bistable multivibrator, and it can be used to implement another type of multivibrator, the relaxation oscillator. This is achieved by connecting a single RC integrating circuit between the output and the input of an inverting Schmitt trigger. The output will be a continuous square wave whose frequency depends on the values of R and C, and the threshold points of the Schmitt trigger.</p>
