                            <p>In electronics, a flip-flop or latch is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. A flip-flop is a bistable multivibrator. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Flip-flops and latches are a fundamental building block of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.</p>
                            
                            <p>Flip-flops and latches are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of state, and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.</p>

                                    <p>Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous or edge-triggered). Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term flip-flop exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called latches.</p>
                                    <p>Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.</p>

                            <p>The first electronic flip-flop was invented in 1918 by William Eccles and F. W. Jordan. It was initially called the Eccles-Jordan trigger circuit and consisted of two active elements (vacuum tubes). Such circuits and their transistorized versions were common in computers even after the introduction of integrated circuits, though flip-flops made from logic gates are also common now. Early flip-flops were known variously as trigger circuits or multivibrators.</p>

                            <p>According to P. L. Lindley, a JPL engineer, the flip-flop types discussed below (RS, D, T, JK) were first discussed in a 1954 UCLA course on computer design by Montgomery Phister, and then appeared in his book <em>Logical Design of Digital Computers</em>. Lindley explains that he heard the story of the JK flip-flop from Eldred Nelson, who is responsible for coining the term while working at Hughes Aircraft. In designing a logical system, Nelson assigned letters to flip-flop inputs as follows: #1: A & B, #2: C & D, #3: E & F, #4: G & H, #5: J & K.</p>

                            <p>Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or asynchronous) or clocked (synchronous); the transparent ones are commonly called latches. The word latch is mainly used for storage elements, while clocked devices are described as flip-flops.</p>
                            
                            <p>Simple flip-flops can be built around a pair of cross-coupled inverting elements: vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, field effect transistors, inverters, and inverting logic gates have all been used in practical circuits. Clocked devices are specially designed for synchronous systems; such devices ignore their inputs except at the transition of a dedicated clock signal (known as clocking, pulsing, or strobing).</p>
                            
                            <p>Since the elementary amplifying stages are inverting, two stages can be connected in succession (as a cascade) to form the needed non-inverting amplifier. In this configuration, each amplifier may be considered as an active inverting feedback network for the other inverting amplifier.</p>

                            <p>A synchronous SR latch (sometimes clocked SR flip-flop) can be made by adding a second level of NAND gates to the inverted SR latch. With E high (enable true), the signals can pass through the input gates to the encapsulated latch; all signal combinations except for $(0,0) = hold$ then immediately reproduce on the $(\mathrm{Q},\mathrm{Q})$ output, i.e. the latch is transparent. With E low (enable false) the latch is closed (opaque).</p>

                            <p>The D flip-flop is widely used. It is also known as a "data" or "delay" flip-flop. The D flip-flop captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock cycle (such as the rising edge of the clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change.</p>

                            <p>A master-slave D flip-flop is created by connecting two gated D latches in series, and inverting the enable input to one of them. It is called master-slave because the second latch in the series only changes in response to a change in the first (master) latch.</p>

                            <p>The JK flip-flop augments the behavior of the SR flip-flop by interpreting the $S = R = 1$ condition as a "flip" or toggle command. Specifically, the combination $\mathrm{J} = 1$, $\mathrm{K} = 0$ is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination $\mathrm{J} = 0$, $\mathrm{K} = 1$ is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination $\mathrm{J} = \mathrm{K} = 1$ is a command to toggle the flip-flop.</p>

                            <p>Flip-flops are subject to a problem called metastability, which can happen when two inputs, such as data and clock or clock and reset, are changing at about the same time. When the order is not clear, within appropriate timing constraints, the result is that the output may behave unpredictably, taking many times longer than normal to settle to one state or the other, or even oscillating several times before settling. In a computer system, this metastability can cause corruption of data or a program crash if the state is not stable before another circuit uses its value.</p>
