                            <p>The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and as a flip-flop element. Derivatives provide up to four timing circuits in one package.</p>
                            
                            <p>Introduced in 1971 by Signetics, the 555 is still in widespread use due to its ease of use, low price, and stability. It is now made by many companies in the original bipolar and also in low-power CMOS types. As of 2003, it was estimated that 1 billion units are manufactured every year.</p>

                            <p>The IC was designed in 1971 by Hans Camenzind under contract to Signetics, which was later acquired by Philips (now NXP).</p>
                            
                            <p>Depending on the manufacturer, the standard 555 package includes 25 transistors, 2 diodes and 15 resistors on a silicon chip installed in an 8-pin mini dual-in-line package (DIP-8). Variants available include the 556 (a 14-pin DIP combining two 555s on one chip), and the two 558 & 559s (both a 16-pin DIP combining four slightly modified 555s with DIS & THR connected internally, and TR is falling edge sensitive instead of level sensitive).</p>
                            
                            <p>The NE555 parts were commercial temperature range, $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $+70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, and the SE555 part number designated the military temperature range, $-55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $+125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. These were available in both high-reliability metal can (T package) and inexpensive epoxy plastic (V package) packages. It has been hypothesized that the 555 got its name from the three 5 kΩ resistors used within, but Hans Camenzind has stated that the number was arbitrary.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>Low-power versions of the 555 are also available, such as the 7555 and CMOS TLC555. The 7555 is designed to cause less supply noise than the classic 555 and the manufacturer claims that it usually does not require a "control" capacitor and in many cases does not require a decoupling capacitor on the power supply. Those parts should generally be included, however, because noise produced by the timer or variation in power supply voltage might interfere with other parts of a circuit or influence its threshold voltages.</p>

                            <h3>Monostable Mode</h3>
                            <p>In the monostable mode, the 555 timer acts as a "one-shot" pulse generator. The pulse begins when the 555 timer receives a signal at the trigger input that falls below a third of the voltage supply. The width of the output pulse is determined by the time constant of an RC network, which consists of a capacitor (C) and a resistor (R). The output pulse ends when the voltage on the capacitor equals $2/3$ of the supply voltage. The output pulse width can be lengthened or shortened to the need of the specific application by adjusting the values of R and C.</p>

                            <p>In bistable mode, the 555 timer acts as a basic flip-flop. The trigger and reset inputs (pins 2 and 4 respectively on a 555) are held high via pull-up resistors while the threshold input (pin 6) is simply floating. Thus configured, pulling the trigger momentarily to ground acts as a 'set' and transitions the output pin (pin 3) to Vcc (high state). Pulling the reset input to ground acts as a 'reset' and transitions the output pin to ground (low state). No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration. Pin 5 (control voltage) is connected to ground via a small-value capacitor (usually 0.01 to $0.1\mathrm{uF}$); pin 7 (discharge) is left floating.</p>

                            <p>In astable mode, the 555 timer puts out a continuous stream of rectangular pulses having a specified frequency.

Hence the capacitor is charged through $\mathbf{R}_1$ and $\mathbf{R}_2$, and discharged only through $\mathbf{R}_2$, since pin 7 has low impedance to ground during output low intervals of the cycle.</p>

                            <p>The Apple II microcomputer used a quad timer 558 in monostable (or "one-shot") mode to interface up to four "game paddles" or two joysticks to the host computer. It also used a single 555 for flashing the display cursor.</p>
                            
                            <p>A similar circuit was used in the IBM PC. In the joystick interface circuit of the IBM PC, the capacitor (C) of the RC network was generally a 10 nF capacitor. The resistor (R) of the RC network consisted of the potentiometer inside the joystick along with an external resistor of 2.2 kilohms. The joystick potentiometer acted as a variable resistor. By moving the joystick, the resistance of the joystick increased from a small value up to about 100 kilohms. The joystick operated at 5 V.</p>
                            
                            <p>Software running in the host computer started the process of determining the joystick position by writing to a special address (ISA bus I/O address 201h). This would result in a trigger signal to the quad timer, which would cause the capacitor (C) of the RC network to begin charging and cause the quad timer to output a pulse. The width of the pulse was determined by how long it took the C to charge up to 2/3 of 5 V, which was in turn determined by the joystick position. The software then measured the pulse width to determine the joystick position. A wide pulse represented the full-right joystick position, for example, while a narrow pulse represented the full-left joystick position.</p>
