- INTRODUCTION
- EMBRYOLOGY
- IMAGING MODALITIES
- SPECIFIC CONDITION

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- The fetal hert develops from a series of complex and rapid changes which occur between the second and $8^{\text {th }}$ week of intrauterine life
- During the $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $5^{\text {th }}$ weeks cardiac structures fevelop most actively $\square$ most damage

\section*{EMBRYOLOGY}
- Splanchnic mesoderm
- Endocardial tube is the initial basic structure
- Development characterized by rapid and complex changes
- 5 dilatations
- Common truncus arteriosus
- Bulbous cordis
- Common primitive ventricle
- Pcommon primitive atrium
- Sinus venosus

\section*{CONT.}
- Truncus arteriosus $\square$ aorta and pulmonary trunk
- Bulbus cordis $\square$ smooth part of RV (conus arteriosus) and smooth part of LV (aortic vestibule)
- Primitve ventricle $\square$ trabeculated part of LV and RV
- Pimitive atrium $\square$ trabeculated part of atria
- Sinus venosus $\square>$ smooth parts of RA; coronary sinus; oblique vein of LA

\section*{NORMAL FETAL CIRCULATION}
- Oxygenated blood is carried by the umbilical vein through the ductus venosus and IVC $\square$ RA $\square$ LA through the foramen ovale $\square$ LV $\square$ systemic circulation through the aorta (bypassing lungs)
- SVC \& IVC $\square$ RA, RV an PA
- Most of RV output passess through the PDA into the descending aorta to supply the lower parts of the fetus and umbilical arteries which supply the fetal placental plexus

\section*{CHD IMAGING MODALITIES}
- Plain radiography
- Echocardiography $\square 1^{\text {st }}$ line to assess anatomy and function esp. in congenital cardiac anomalies
- Cardiac catheterization $\square$ definition of vascular anatomy
- Preserved for complex anomalies that cannot be resolved by echocardiography
- This is an invasive procedure, contrast is used.
- CT $\square$ description of cardiac and vascular anatomy in relation to other structures of the chest
- MRI $\square$ quantification of cardiac function and vascular flow in vivo

\section*{CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATIONS}
- Suspected congenital heart disease
- Cyanosis
- Cardiac failure
- Failure to thrive
- Difficult in feeding in the neonatal period
- Fainting spells

\section*{CONT.}
- Standard views: erect PA or AP (children) chest; Left lateral
- Role
- Provides clues of underlying congenital heart disease
- Instrumental in planin further investigations
- Limited use in neonated and young children
- May show related skeletal anomalies e.g. in trisomy 21
- Assessment
- Cardiac and visceral situs $\square$ situs solitus, inversus, ambiguous (2/3 of the heart should
be on the left side and $1 / 3$ of the hear should be on the right, if vice versa dextrocardia)
- Cardiac size and shape
- Mediastinum: aortic arch PA, trachea indentation
- Pulmonary vasculature: normal, plethora, oligemia, congestion
- Skeletal features: rib notching: coarctation of the aorta
- Post-surgical stigmata e.g. sternal sutures, implants

\section*{CARDIAC SIZE MEASUREMENT}
- Measure the transverse diameter of the heart and compare that of the chest - $50-55 \%$ in adults

\section*{ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY}
- Gives a wealth of information (anatomical and physiologica) without ionizing radiation, patients discomfort or significant risk
- ID M mode) 2D (most commonly used), 3D
- Doppler echocardiography
- CFI, non-invasive angiogram
- Pulsed Doppler echo (valves)
- Continuous wave Doppler
- Contrast echocardiography
- Microbubbles in the venous circulation

\section*{CONTRAST ECHOCADIOGRAPHY}
- Use of intravascular contrast effects produced when microbubbles of gas present in solution are inected

\section*{INDICATIONS}
- Myocardial perfusion can be investigated directly/ indirectly after intracoronary/venous contrast injection with/ without DSA Better define anatomy not shown well on 2D
- Enhancement of endocardial boundaries increasing sensitivity of wall motion abnormalities e.g. valvular regurgitation, shunts

\section*{DOPPLER ECHO}
- Venus flow from IVC < SVC, pulmonary vessels and across the valves
- Measure direction and speed of blood flowing through the heart and blood vessels
- Check for abnormal communication between left and right side of the heart and regurgitation
- Calculate cardiac output ejection fraction
- Flow towards the transducer $\square$ red away from it $\square$ lye and turbulence flow mixture of red and blue-yellow

\section*{CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF ECHO}
- Congenital heart disease
- Anatomical defects, shunts
- Stress echo
- Pericardial disease
- Coronary artery disease
- Cardiomyopathies
- Valvular heart disease
- Cardiac masses
- Diseases of the aorta

\section*{ANGIOCARDIOGRAPHY}
- Important technique for cardiac and great vessel anatomy
- Coronary angiography commonest
- Transfemoral approach using Judkins or Amplatz catheters
- Pulmonary angiography, for possible PTE
- Adv; offers high resolution images of the heart and great vessels
- Disadv; requires experienced hands and cardiac monitoring, invasive

\section*{CONT.}
- Indications
- Complex congenital heart disease
- Valvular/ myocardial disease
- Ventricular function
- Technique
- Right sided structures studed by introductng the catheter into peripheral vein
- Left sided $\square$ arterial approach
- Use contrast

\section*{CONT.}
- Equipment
- Fluoroscopy on a C-arm with DSA facilities, pressure recording deviece, ECG monitor, blood oxygen analyser, catheters
- Angled views which place the pathological lesion at right angles $\square$ increase accuracu
- Coplications
- Sudden death
- MI
- arrhythmias

\section*{CARDIAC MRI}
- Excellent anatomic detal
- Disadvantage
- Expensive
- Availability
- Metallic implants

\section*{CLINICAL APPLICATIONS}
- Ventriculaar function analysis
- Myocardial function at rest and during stress
- Myocardial erfusion
- Measurement of coronary flow
- VHD pericardial pathology
- Cardiac tumors and throbi
- Carrdiomyopathies
