\section*{Medical Imaging}
- Non-invasive visualization of internal organs, tissue, etc.
- Is endoscopy an imaging modality?
- Image - a 2D signal $f(x, y)$ or 3D $f(x, y, z)$
- Is a 1D non-imaging sensing techniques an imaging modality?

\section*{Major Modalities}
- Projection X-ray (Radiography)
- X-ray Computed Tomography (CT)
- Nuclear Medicine (SPECT, PET)
- Ultrasound
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging

\section*{Projection X-ray Imaging}

-Image records transmission of x-rays through object
-The integral is a line-integral or a "projection" through obj
- $\mu(x, y, z)$ - x-ray attenuation coefficient, a tissue property, a function of electron density, atomic \#, ...

\section*{Projection X-ray Imaging}

-X-ray imaging requires interactions of x-ray photons with object - work in a specific energy band
-Above this band - body is too transparent
-Below this band - body is too opaque
-Well below this band - wavelengths are too long
-One problem with x-ray imaging: no depth (z) info

\section*{X-ray Imaging Projection vs Tomographic}

Projection Image

\section*{X-ray Computed Tomography}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_5f7d6c17f8d45f23b3c7g-07.jpg?height=751&width=1634&top_left_y=430&top_left_x=656)
-Uses x-rays, but exposure is limited to a slice (or "a couple of" slices) by a collimator
-Source and detector rotate around object - projections from many angles
-The desired image, $l(x, y)=\mu\left(x, y, z_{0}\right)$, is computed from the projections

\section*{X-ray Computed Tomography}

\section*{Anatomical vs Functional Imaging}

\section*{Nuclear Medicine (Scintigraphy)}

-Detector records emission of gamma photons from radioisotopes introduced into the body
-The integral is a line-integral or a "projection" through obj
-Source $s(x, y, z)$ usually represents a selective uptake of a radio-labeled pharmaceutical

\section*{Nuclear Medicine (Scintigraphy)}
- Issue: Pinhole Size
- Large pinhole - more photons, better SNR
- Large pinhole - more blur, reduced resolution
- Issue: Half-life
- Long half lives are easier to handle, but continue to irradiate patient after imaging is done
- Issue: Functional Specificity
- Pharmaceuticals must be specific to function of interest
- E.g. Thallium, Technicium
- Issue: No depth info
- Nuclear Medicine Computed Tomography (SPECT, PET)

-Image reflectivity of acoustic wave, $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z})$.
-Depth - A function of time (ping-echo)
-Lateral - Focusing of wavefronts
-Direct imaging (e.g. vs. computed) modality - echo data is placed directly into image matrix

\section*{Ultrasound Imaging}
- Issue: Transmit Frequency
- Increase in frequency reduces wavelength:
- Reduced (improved) resolution size (2-3 $\lambda$ )
- Also improved lateral resolution (diffraction):
- Increases attenuation (and thus, range of depth)
- Issue: Flow
- Can use Doppler effect to image flow
- Issue: Speckle
- Most noise in US is speckle (signal dependent)

Color Doppler

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}
-Atomic nuclei and hydrogen nuclei, ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$, in particular, have a magnetic moment
-Moments tend to become aligned to applied field
-Creates magnetization, $m(x, y, z)$ (a tissue property)
-MRI makes images of m(x,y,z)

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

RF Excitation (Energy into tissue)

Magnetic fields are emitted
- The magnetization is excited into an observable state
- Magnetization emits energy at a resonant frequency:
$$\omega=\lambda B$$

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}
-Frequency is proportional to magnetic field
-We can create a frequency vs. space variation:
$$\omega(x, y, z)=\lambda \mathrm{B}(x, y, z)$$
-Use Fourier analysis to determine spatial location
- Interestingly, $\lambda$ is much larger than resolution - not imaging EM direction, but using its frequency
