The radiograph will remain the technique by which most math pathologies will be detested due to low cost \& quallabilit\%.

\section*{$X$ ray versus other imaging modalities}
- Plain x ray in the mainstay in trauma imaging
- One needs two orthogonal views at right angles to each other.
- The status of soft tissues is poorly depicted.
- Scintigraphy is very sensitive in the detection of stress fractures.
- CT is more sensitive and specific in the description of regions of complex anatomy such as the face, spine and pelvis.
- MRI excellent for soft tissue depiction.
- Use of US is increasing.

\section*{Rule of Two}
- Two views - AP and Lateral
- Two joints - joint above and below
- Two occasions - repeat x- rays
- Two limbs - Compare

\section*{Trauma.}
- Skeletal trauma is one of the most important aspects of orthopedic radiology being by far the commonest problem presented to the musculoskeletal radiologist.

\section*{Imaging is complementary.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-18.jpg?height=696&width=1082&top_left_y=765&top_left_x=1)
- Presence and severity of a fracture usually apparent clinically.
- Confirmation and determination of extent of injury are best documented at imaging.
- Imaging has a role in unsuspected or doubtful injuries.

\section*{neronyms.}
- "Accuracy and conciseness are essential elements in medical communication.
- Accuracy is achieved through careful and painstaking use of medical nomenclature, which at times can be cumbersome.
- This difficulty has been overcome to some extent by the use of labels, tags, acromyms, and eponymns, which, when precisely defined and accurately used, convey a great deal of information very comeisely"

\section*{Bone tumours}
- Radiology is essential for full evaluation of a bone tumour.
- Definitive diagnosis is established by histopathologist.
- This is not always possible.
- Also pathology findings should not be considered in isolation.
- Team work vital between clinician, radiologist and pathologist.

\section*{BONE TUMOURS: thols of the trade}
- Radiography.
- Sonography.
- CT Scanning,
- Scintigraphy.
- MRI.

\section*{Radiographic features verrur clastification.}
- The classification of a lesion is not as important as an understanding of the radiographic features that make the abmormality look immocuous or aggressive.
- Type 1a lesions are at one end of the spectrum as the most innocuous and nonaggressive appearing, and type 3 lesions are at the other end of the spectrum as the most aggressive appearing.

Osteomyelitis and localized Langerhans cell histiocytosis are benign processes that can have an aggressive permeated appearance, and a giant cell tumor may look well defined but be locally aggressive and, on rare occasions, may even metastasize.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-41.jpg?height=721&width=1349&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=1147)

Osteomyelitis and localized Langerhans cell histiocytosis also look "blue" on hematoxylin and eosin stained specimens.

\section*{APPROACH.}
- The two most important aspects of evaluating a bone tumor are the location of the tummor and the age of the patient.
- Knowledge of this information alone is enough to narrow the differential diagnosis without even looking at any images.
- The specific radiographic appearance should then help narrow the list even further and will often lead to the single correct diagnosis.

\section*{Pillar to radiologic diagnorir of bone lumorr.}
1. Age.
2. Location.
3. Margins.
4. Periosteal reaction.
5. Tumor opacity.
6. Matrix mineralization.
7. Size and number.
8. Cortical involvement.
9. Soft tissue involvement.
10. Advanced imaging.

\section*{I.PRTIEAT RGE.}
- Most bone tumors have a predilection for a specific age group.
- For example, simple bone cysts and chondroblastomas occur in skeletally immature people, while giant cell tumors occur in skeletally mature people.
- According to Edeihem, about 80\% of mallgmant tumors can be correctly diagmosed on the basis of age alome even without looking at the radiograph.

\end{tabular}

\section*{2.LOGATION.}
- Most bone tumors, regardless of whether they are benign or malignant, often occur in a characteristic location in the skeleton.
- Thus, some tumors eg, esteesarcoma have a predilection for sites of rapid bone growth, usually the metaphyseal region, while other tumors eg, Ewing sarcoma tend to follow the distribution of red marrow.

\section*{s.marcins (lodwick).}
- Bone lesions may range from a discrete well-defined abnormality to an ill-defined infiltrative process.
- The margin of the lesion and the zone of transition between lesion and adjacent bone are hey factors in determining if a lesion is aggressive.
- A lesion with sharp margins and a narrow transition zone is radiographically considered nonaggressive, particularly when the margins have a sclerotic border.

- Type la geographic lesion.
- Intraosseous lipoma of the calcaneus, with a sclerotic rim.
- Solid or unilamellated periosteal reaction is a monaggressive appearance, simce it indicates that the underlying lesion is slow growing and is giving the bone a chance to wall the lesion off.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-51.jpg?height=881&width=814&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=1)

Onion okin.
- A multilamellated or "omionskin" appearance suggests an intermediate aggressive process, such as one that wases and wanes or one that the bone is continually trying to wall off but cannot.
- Interruption (i.e., regional disruption) of either the uni- or multilamellated periosteal reaction suggests an aggressive process that has broken through the periosteum.

- A spiculated, or "hair-on-end" (perpendicular to the cortex) or sunburst pattern, is the most aggressive appearance and is highly suggestive of malignancy.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-53.jpg?height=1457&width=2407&top_left_y=17&top_left_x=31)

Lateral radiograph in patient with osteosarcoma shows the elevated periosteum forming Codman triangle (long arrow).
Notice the tumor-induced new bone formation (short arrows.)

\section*{6.Tumor matris.}
- The radiographic opacity of a lesion can also be affected by the mineralization of its matrix.
- The term matrix refers to the type of tissue of the tumor-such as osteoid, chondral, fibrous, or adipose, all of which are radiolucent-and mineralization refers to calcification of the matrix.
- This concept of matrix mineralization is important to understand, because the pattern of mineralization can be a clue to the type of underlying matrix and, thus, the diagnosis.

Lateral radiograph of proximal portion of tibia shows enchondroma with punctate and arclike mineralization (arrows).

\section*{7. Size and number.}
- The size of a lesion can also be a clue to its diagnosis, since some entities have size criteria.
- For example, osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma are histologically similar lesions, but they differ in size:
- The nidus of an osteoid osteoma is less than 1.5 cm in diameter, while the osteoblastoma is larger than 1.5 cm (19).

\hline & Osteoblastic metastatic carcinoma (prostate, breast, lung, colon, mucin-producing adenocarcinoma) \\
\hline Lytic & Osteolytic metastatic carcinoma (prostate, breast, lung, colon, etc) \\
\hline & Myeloma \\
\hline & Non-Hodgkin lymphoma \\
\hline & Benign vascular lesions: hemangioma, cystic angiomatosis (rare tumor) \\
\hline & Malignant vascular lesions (rare tumors): hemangioendothelioma, angiosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma \\
\hline & Brown tumors of hyperparathyroidism (should have other radiographic features of hyperparathyroidism) \\
\hline & Multiple enchondromatosis (Ollier and Maffuci disease; may have internal mineralization or appear as lucent linear seams of cartilage within bone) \\
\hline & Fibrous dysplasia (usually ground-glass lytic but may be mixed lytic and sclerotic; bone may be deformed) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{8. Gorlieal involvement.}
- In addition to lesions that specifically arise within the cortex, the cortex may be affected by processes that originate in the medullary canal or the periosteum or surrounding soft tissue.
- For example, as a medullary process expands, it may cause erosion of the inner surface of the cortex, called endosteal scalloping (Fig 4).
- If the medullary lesion is so aggressive that it erodes the inner aspect of the cortex without giving the periosteum a chance to lay down new bone, the cortex will eventually be completely destroyed and breached by the lesion.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-59.jpg?height=1456&width=1322&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=605)
- Anteroposterior radiograph of humerus in a patient with periosteal chondrosarcoma shows periosteal buttress (short white arrow).
- Note well-defined saucerization of humeral shaft (black arrows) and faint mineralization of the matrix (long white arrow).

\section*{9.Soft tireue involvement.}
- The presence of a soft-tissue component with a bone lesion suggests a malignant process.
- The tumor may have frankly destroyed the cortex as it expanded, or it may have permeated through the haversian canals of the cortex to reach the surrounding tissue.
- The soft-tissue component may displace adjacent fat planes.
- Tumors that often have a soft-tissue component are osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and lymphoma.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-61.jpg?height=1431&width=1105&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=637)
- Lateral radiograph of distal portion of femur shows osteosarcoma with amorphous tumor-induced new bone formation (black arrows).
- Note the large soft-tissue mass (white arrows) that displaces adjacent fat.

\section*{I O. Rdvanced tooll.}
- While radiographs are often sufficient to enable a diagnosis, advanced imaging is sometimes needed.
- MR images and CT scans may provide additional information by virtue of their tomographic nature, multiplanar capability, and better soft-tissue contrast than radiographs.
- CT is useful for evaluating subtle mineralization in a lytic lesion, for demonstrating radiographically occult bone destruction, or for demonstrating the lucent nidus of an osteoid osteoma amid a large area of reactive sclerosis.
- MR imaging has become the standard for evaluating the local extent of a malignant process for the purposes of staging and assessing tumor response to chemotherapy.
- However, it must be stressed that CT and MR images should only be interpreted with concurrent radiographic correlation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_9ef9e69b9f2d05bc7a99g-63.jpg?height=1367&width=2495&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=4)
- MR imaging has become the standard for evaluating the local extent of a malignant process for the purposes of staging and assessing tumor response to chemotherapy.
- However, it must be stressed that CT and MR images should only be interpreted with concurrent radiographic correlation.

\section*{Take home.}
- Tumors have a bypical patient age range- $420,20-40$, and >40 years old=and a favored location in the streleton.
- The margin of a lesion and type of periosteal reaction are indicators of lesion aggressiveness, but not necessarily of whether it is benign or malignant:
- A well-defined lesion with a sclerotic rim and thicts unillamellar periosteal reaction is the most innocuous appearance, while a permeated pattern with spiculated periosted reaction is the most aggressive.
- The pattern of mineralization of the tumor matrix is often the clue to the type of tumor:

IMAGING IN OSTEOMY'ELITIS
- Early diagnosis greatly improves outlook.
- Must use available tools optimally.
- often xrays are all you have.

\section*{WHY IS IMAGING VITAL?}
- The symptoms and signs of skeletal infections are varied and often non specific.
- They mimic many other conditions most significantly degenerative disease.
- Thus imaging has a crucial role in the detection, discrimination and follow-up of infections of bone, joint and soft tissues.
