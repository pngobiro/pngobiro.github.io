\title{
INTRODUCTION TO RADIATION SAFETY
}

DATE: 11/8/2016

\section*{IONIZING VS. NON-IONIZING RADIATION}
t lonizing radiation include:
t X-rays and gamma rays
t Charged particles (electrons, protons, alpha particles)
t Neutrons
t Non-ionizing radiation
t Ultra-sound
t Optical radiation
t Radiofrequency radiation

\section*{SOURCES OF IONIZING RADIATION}
t Natural sources include:
t Cosmic radiation from outer space
t Terrestrial radiation in soil, rocks, water ( these sources constitute natural background)
t Artificial sources
t All man-made radiation

\section*{EXPOSURE OF POPULATIONS}
t The most important source is natural background.
t From artificial sources, medical exposure is most important
t Within medical exposure, X-ray diagnosis is the leading contributor

\section*{MODALITIES OF EXPOSURE}
t External exposure/Irradiation - the radiation source is outside the body e.g. X-ray
$t$ There can also be external contamination when radionuclides are spread on the skin
t Internal exposure - the radiation source is inside the body e.g. Nuclear medicine (injection of a radiopharmaceutical)
t This can take place because of inhalation or injection of radionuclides

\section*{BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION}
t Evidence exists for biological effects
t Effects at cellular level include:
t Cell killing
t Mutations
t Loss of proliferative capacity
t Cellular effects may affect organ/tissue function
t Effects on organism, include possible death

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF RADIATION EFFECTS}
t Acute vs. delayed
t Somatic, Hereditary or fetal/embryonic
t Somatic effect occurs in the irradiated person
t Hereditary effects occur in the descendants of the irradiated person.
t Fetal effects occur in the unborn child of an irradiated pregnant mother.
t Deterministic vs. Stochastic
t Deterministic effects have a threshold dose below which they do not occur. Severity is dose-dependent
t Stochastic effects have no threshold dose. The probability of occurrence depends on dose. Severity is independent of dose.

\section*{Radiation effects}

\section*{Deterministic}
(Erythema, Tissue necrosis, fataract, Syndromes

Stochastic
(cancer, Leukaemia, Hereditany.

\section*{IMPLICATIONS}
t NO amount of radiation exposure (no matter how little) is completely safe
t Even very low doses of radiation may induce severe health detriment (carcinogenesis and hereditary effects are stochastic)
t All unnecessary exposures to ionizing radiation should be avoided (principle of justification)
t All necessary exposures to radiation should be kept As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA principle)

\section*{AIMS OF RADIATION PROTECTION}
t Prevent the occurrence of the deterministic/threshold effects
t Limit the probability of occurrence of stochastic/non-threshold effects
t Philosophy radiation protection:
t Justification of practices
t Optimization of procedures
t Dose limitation

\section*{CATEGORIES OF RADIATION EXPOSURE}
t Occupational exposure
t Exposure of designated radiation workers in normal courses of their duties
t Dose limits for radiation workers apply
t Monitoring of radiation doses is required
t Medical exposure
t Exposure of patients during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, based on medical decisions
t Include exposures from artificial body implants emitting ionizing radiation
t When radiation workers are exposed as patients, that component or exposure is classified as medical exposure
t No dose limits prescribed for medical exposure
t However ALARA principle applies; guidance dose levels should be noted
t Radiation dose monitoring not done on routine basis.

\section*{CONT.}
t Public exposure
t Refers to non-occupational, non-medical exposure of members of the general public
t Dose limits for members of the general public apply, for planning purposes
t No radiation monitoring

\section*{RADIATION PROTECTION OF WORKERS}
t Radiation workers are:
t Occupational exposed
t Specially trained
t Subject to prescribed dose limits
t Strategies:
t Training of personnel
t Planning of radiological facilities
t Facility design e.g. structural shielding
t Equipment selection

\section*{OPERATION PRINCIPLES}
t Minimize time of exposure (dose received is proportional to time)
t Maximize distance between the source and workers (dose varies inversely as square of distance)
t Use of physical shielding between source and worker (extent of protection varies with barrier material, barrier thickness and radiation quality). The physical barrier has the following features:
t Z value
t Density value
t Thickness

\section*{PERSONAL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING}
t Lead rubber aprons, gloves (minimum lead equivalence is $\mathbf{0 . 2 5 ~ m m}$ )
t Thyroid shields
t Spectacles

\section*{MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES:}
t Departmental regulations
t Personnel monitoring
t Quality assurance

\section*{PROTECTION OF PATIENTS IN X-RAY DIAGNOSIS}
t X-ray diagnosis contributes largest proportion of artificial exposure to populations
t Collective doses to populations depend on frequencies of radiological examinations and on mean doses per examination
t Very wide variation in patient dose are observed

\section*{STRATEGIES OF PATIENT PROTECTION}
t Clinical judgment (necessity of examination)
t Trained personnel
t Radiological equipment in good condition
t Performance specifications
t Maintenance
t Quality assurance programs
t Sensitive image receptors
t Adequate preparation, proper instruction or patient
t Proper performance of examination
t Positioning, views, exposure factors. Limitation of beam size, gonad shielding
t Proper film processing practice
t Through quality control programs, minimize repeat examinations
t Consider alternatives of X-rays to use when appropriate e.g. ultrasound

\section*{SENSITIVE PATIENT GROUPS}
t Children
t Pregnant female

\section*{PUBLIC PROTECTION}
t Involved institutions should put in place regulations that protect the public from radiation exposure.

\section*{SAFETY IN DIAGNOSTIC ULTRASOUND}
t Biological effects observed with animal experimentation using very high intensities of ultrasound
t Biological effects may be due to:
t Tissue temperature elevation
t Formation of bubbles in liquids
t Diagnostic ultrasound employs beam intensities well below the thresholds for observed effects
t Diagnostic ultrasound is considered to be a safe method of medical imaging, with a wide margin of safety

\section*{SAFETY IN MRI}
t Risk of biological effects considered remote
t The environment around powerful magnets presents some risks to patients, relatives and staff
t Attraction of objects into magnet (ferromagnetic missiles)
t Rapid evaporation of cryogens
t Restricted access ( 0.5 mT ) if necessary, monitor entrants
t Warning signs and symbols
t Screening of patients
t Pre-exam instructions
t Design with faraday cage
t Confines high magnetic field to restricted zone
t Keeps out extraneous sources of electromagnetic fields
t Design to facilitate escape route in case of cryogen boil-off
t Staff awareness and good practice
t There should be warnina sians and svmbols to indicate the presence of maanetic fields.
