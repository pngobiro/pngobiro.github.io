\section*{What is Rheumatology?}
- Rheumatology is the subspecialty of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases that affect bones muscles, ligaments, tendons, joints, and other body parts including the immune system.

\section*{Why?}

\section*{Sutton's Law}

This law has been ascribed to Willie Sutton, a famous bank robber. When asked why he robbed banks, he reportedly said, "Because that's where the money is."
In the radiographic evaluation of appendicular arthropathies, the "money" is generally in a relatively small handful of disorders.
Even though over 90 different rheumatic diseases are recognized by the American College of Rheumatology, only three entities are commonly seen in most clinical radiology practices, even including those located in

\section*{More laws....}
- In George Orwell's Animal Farm, it is stated that "All animals are equal.
- But some animals are more equal than others.
- " This principle is manifested in the appendicular arthropathies, where some radiographic findings are quite specific and can quickly lead one to the correct diagnosis.
- Other findings are less specific and are usually unhelpful in ordering one's differential diagnosis.

\section*{And the last...}
- The Law of Parsimony
- In medical school, one is taught to take historical points and physical findings and to put them together into one diagnosis which explains everything (the law of parsimony).
- However, once one reaches the ward rotations and opens a patient's chart to the problem list, one sees that most real patients have several disorders going on simultaneously.
- In real life, patients often have more than one arthropathy.
- This is most commonly seen in patients with

\section*{Rheumatoid}

\section*{arthritis.}
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease of unknown origin that predominantly involves synovial tissue.
- Early diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy help modify the course of the disease and reduce the degree of severe late sequel.
- Radiology plays a key role in diagnosis and management of RA.

\section*{Tools of the trade.}

- Currently, magnetic resonance imaging is the best imaging modality because it depicts soft-tissue changes and damage to cartilage and bone even

- Ultrasound and conventional radiography are more readily available but cannot show the entire spectrum of the disease.

\section*{ABCDE'S}
- Alignment
- Malalignment: subluxation and dislocations occur late in RA.
- Boutonniere and Swan-neck deformities

Psoriatic Arthritis
}
- Different from RA -Bone proliferation -Often asymmetric although usually bilateral
-Normal bone

\section*{Psoriatic Arthritis}
- Five patterns
-Monoarthritis/asymmetric oligoarthritis (most common):
sausage digit
-Sacroilitis/spondylitis
-Symmetric polyarthritis (resembling RA)
- Polyarthritis w/ DIP involvement
- Arthritic mutilans
