\section*{PDA}
- Radiological Features

Plain: (mimics VSD)
- LA enlargement
- enlarged pulmonary artery segment
- increase of pulmonary vasculature (less flow directed to LUL)
- enlarged RV + LV
- enlarged ascending aorta + aortic arch (thymus may obscure this)
- "railroad track" = calcified ductus arteriosus

\section*{CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART}
- patients with this type of $F$ FID $F$ Fesent with central cyanosis at birth/few hours after birth/few months or years later
- result of flow of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation
- anatomical deformities responsible for central cyanosis:
- Conotruncal septum displaced anteriorly, and its lowermost component, the infundibular septum, fails to fuse with the top of the IV septum.
- the combination of an abnormal communication and distal right heart block, leading to a R $\rightarrow$ L shunt e.g. TOF, ER
- common chambers, leading to an admixture of saturated and desaturated blood e.g. PTA, TAPVD
- abnormal connections (discordance) e.g. UTGA, CCTGA (AV discordance)

\section*{TETRALOGY OF FALLOT (TOF)}
- Incidence:
- 12\% of all CHD; most common CHD with cyanosis after 1 year of life
- Pathology:
- underdevelopment of pulmonary infundibulum secondary to unequal partitioning of the conotruncus
- leads to hypoplasia of the pulmonary valve, main pulmonary artery, and the origins of the R and L pulmonary arteries.

\section*{TOF}
- Radiological Features

Plain:
- RVH - lifted rounded apex, obliteration of the retrosternal airspace $\rightarrow$ coeur en sabot (boot-shaped heart ) on frontal radiograph
- pronounced concavity in region of pulmonary bay
- right-sided aortic arch in 25\%
- marked reduction in caliber + number of pulmonary vessels $\rightarrow$ oligemic lung fields

[CCTGA]
- Radiological Features:

Plain:

\section*{ACQUIRED HEART DISEASE}
- Acute rheumatic fever
- Rheumatic /valvular heart disease
- Myocardial diseases
- Pericardial diseases
- Miscellaneous heart diseases

\section*{Acute rheumatic fever}

A connective tissue disorder which follows infection with gp A beta-haemolytic streptococci of the throat or skin.
- Usually affects children or young adults.
- Most common between 5-15yrs.
- Endemic in parts of Africa and Asia.
- Still the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children and adolescence.

\section*{c/features}

Often occur 2-3 wks after streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Usually present with fever anorexia, lethargy and joint pains.
- History of sore throat may not be forthcoming.
- Arthritis seen in 75\% of pts.
- Skin rash, carditis and neurological changes are also seen.

\section*{Jones criteria}
- Major:
- Carditis
- Polyarthritis
- Chorea
© Erythema marginatum
- Subcutaneous nodules.

O Minor
- Fever
- Arthralgia
- Previous rf
- Raised ESR.
- Raised c-reactive protein.
- leucocytosis

\section*{Mitral valve disease}
- 1) Mitral stenosis(ms)

Almost always rheumatic in origin.
- In the elderly, heavy calcification of the valve apparatus can cause ms.
A rare congenital form of ms is also recognized.
- In rms the valve orifice is slowly diminished by progressive fibrosis, calcification of valve leaflets, and fusion of the cusps and subvalvular apparatus.

\section*{Ms cont}
- Flow of blood from left atrium to left ventricle is restricted and left atrial pressure rises leading to pulmonary venous congestion and breathlessness.
- There is dilatation and hypertrophy of the left atrium and left ventricular filling becomes more dependent on left atrial contraction.
mitral orifice is about 5 cm sq and may be reduced to 1 cm sq or less in severe ms.

\section*{Investigations}

ECG: features of rt ventricular hypertrophy left atrial hypertrophy and fibrillations.
- CXR: enlargement of left atrium and its appendage.
-enlargement of main pulm artery.
-features of pulmonary venous congestion.

\section*{Mitral regurgitation}
- Rheumatic disease is the principal cause of mitral regurgitation.
- May follow successful relief of ms.
- Myxomatous degereration of the valve leaflets.
- Elongation or rupture of the chordae tendinae.
- Left atrial Myxomas, cardiac trauma, bacterial endocarditis, Ischaemic heart disease.

\section*{Imaging}

Plain chest radiographs: resemble those of mitral stenosis.

The left atrium is generally larger than in ms and may be aneurismal.
O In acute non-rheumatic mr, CXR may be normal.

O In chronic cases, the heart enlarges with left ventricular predominance.

\section*{Plain cxr}

\section*{Aortic stenosis}

Middle aged and elderly:
-senile degenerative aortic stenosis
-calcification of bicuspid valves.
-rheumatic aortic stenosis.
- Calcific aortic stenosis usually develops on the basis of congenitally bicuspid valves.
- Calcification begins in the $4^{\text {th }}$ decade. Mobility is lost and stenosis develops.
- Valve calcification in this case is invariable since it is the stenosing process. (in mitral stenosis, valve calcification is a result of stenosis)

\section*{Ischaemic heart disease (CHD)}
- Almost always due to atheroma and its complications particularly thrombosis.
- Risk factors:-
-age -male sex -family history
-smoking -hypertension
-diabetes mellitus -obesity
-sedentary life style -diet

\section*{Investigations}
- Plain radiographs:-
- normal
- Myocardial perfusion studies:scintiscans of the heart are taken at rest and after exercise. Thallium 201 is taken up by viable perfused myocardium.
Thallium 201 is injected during exercise test with immediate exercise images and perfusion images 3 hrs later, after resting.

\section*{Chd cont}
- Myocardial perfusion study.
- Thallium scan showing reversible anterior myocardium ischaemia.
