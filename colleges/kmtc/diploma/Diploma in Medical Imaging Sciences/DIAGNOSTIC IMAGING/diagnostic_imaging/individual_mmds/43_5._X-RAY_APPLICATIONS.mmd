\section*{CONVENTIONAL TOMOGRAPHY}
-A thin plane through the patient imaged
-Movement of the x-ray source
-Movement of film
-Structures in planes other than the one being imaged are subjected to blurring due to gross movement in sharpness.

\section*{Fluoroscopy}

Primary image created on a fluorescent screen.

Screen is part of an x-ray image intensifier that enhances the brightness(luminance by a factor of about 5000).

Image from intensifier recorded via lenses by a T.V camera and shown on a monitor.

Image may be reflected by mirrors to a small still camera or cine camera (fluorography)

\section*{COMPUTER TOMOGRAPHY (CT)}
--Invention by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in 1972.
-Greatest step forward in radiology since the discovery of x-rays.
-Initial scanners designed for head studies only but soon whole body scanners became available.
- Used for imaging any part of the body today.
- depends on the fact that different tissues provide different degrees of x-ray attenuation.
-Thin slices of tissue exposed.

\section*{Limitations of conventional radiology}
-Three dimensional subject projected on to a two dimensional image
- Poor contrast resolution.

A radiographic film only differentiates between -bone /calcification
- soft tissue/fluid
- fat
- air/gas
-Impossible to differentiate between different soft tissues.
- Radiation.
- Hollow viscous not visualized
- may be visualized if;
- containing gas/air
-equipment required is bulky
- storage of film.

\section*{Contrast}

\section*{Definition}

Exhibition or emphasizing of differences between things by placing them actually or in imagination over against each other.
Contrast in Radiology
visual differentiability of variations in photographic or film density produced on a radiograph/image by the structural composition of the object or objects radiographed/imaged.

Contrast media
-Agents used to enhance this differentiability
-Structures in the body enhanced by the use of contrast media.

\section*{Images}
- CXR /swallow/Bronchogram
- Angiogram /plain film
- abdomen / follow through.

\section*{X-RAY IMAGING METHODS}
- Plain Radiography with screen and film (casette) > 100yrs old.
- Fluoroscopy (Trans illumination)
- from the beginning of the previous century.
- image intensifier and television camera introduced in 1960s.
-Computerized Tomography- 1970s.

Can also be divided into.
- Conventional 3 dimensional object is projected on to a 2 dimensional image.
-Shadows of different organs are summated on a film.
-The entire tissue volume is exposed.
-Much scatter reduction generated which degrades image quality.
- Computed Tomography
-used to analyse and display axial image in digital limits.

\section*{FLUOROSCOPY}

Direct fluoroscopy
-used until 1960s
-still in use in some parts of the country
-obsolete
-transmitted x ray beam falls on a fluorescent screen resulting on a dynamic light image.
-Observed directly by the radiologist.
-Used to study physiological movement e.g respiration, etc.
-radiation doses too high (patient/radiologist)
-replaced by indirect fluoroscopy.

\section*{DIRECT RADIOGRAPHY}
-Original means of imaging
-X-rays pass through the patient and create an image on a photographic film.
-Cassette film.
Film
-photographic emulsion- silver bromide.
-Sensitive to photons having a wide range of images -Xrays, ultraviolet radiation visible light.
-Silver bromide ionized by photons
-Ag+ ions created depends on number of photons transmitted.

Development $\mathrm{Ag}+$ metallic Ag .
Fixation - fixer removes the Ag Br .
-Visible image on a radiographic film is related to varying degrees of blackening caused by varying densities of microscopic silver granules.

\section*{Intensifying screens}
- Film placed within cassette between fluorescent screen. (Intensifying screens).
- Absorb x-ray photons and produces light photon.
-Light photon responsible for the blackening of the film.
-Calcium tangstate, lanthamides.
-10-100 times more effective on film above.
Image (cassettes).

\section*{Disadvantages of plain film radiography.}

Poor resolution.
-Overlap of structures.
-Non differential of structures.
-soft tissues anonymous
-fat
-air
-bone /calcification
-Non visualization of hollow structures.
-High radiation dose: film is a poor receptor of radiation and hence high dose is required.
-Cannot demonstrate physiological activity.

Direct radiography still the most important radiological modality
-Full size radiography - anatomy shown in full size.
- Provides static images with the highest spatial resolution.
