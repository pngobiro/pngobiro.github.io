\section*{Every imaging modality has its strengths and weaknesses}
t A major limitation inherent in conventional X-ray technology is the inability to show the difference between soft tissues (e.g. blood vessels, muscles, kidneys and intestines etc.)
t Radiographs shows the difference between bone, air and in certain situations fat with soft tissues having similar density

Differences in DENSITY gives contrast.
t When there is a significant difference in density between 2 adjacent organs e.g. between air in the lungs and heart muscle, outlines between these structures are well visualized on a radiograph - the result of inherent contrast
t If 2 organs adjacent to each other have similar densities - it is not possible to distinguish them on radiograph - because no natural/inherent contrast exists
t Contrast agents usually add density to the organ of interest. On the X-ray film the organ appears brighter than the neighboring areas where there is no contrast material present - because the contrast material absorbs more radiation than the surrounding tissue.
t Contrast media are introduced into a hollow viscous organ allowing us to define the outline of the organ

\section*{Example}
t If you have a bottle filled with milk, you can visualize the milk clearly. You may have a problem seeing where the bottle surface is but you do not have a problem with seeing the milk.
t Barium sulfate, a contrast material is introduced into the body to outline the alimentary canal - e.g. the stomach or intestine it defines the intestine so that is can be visualized better. It is difficult to differentiate the intestine from surrounding soft tissues without a contrast medium within it.
t Contrast agents injected into the blood vessels are water soluble and usually contain iodine. The more iodine in the compound used, the greater the radio-density of the contrast agent. Visualization of blood vessels is clearer and interpretation of the radiograph is enhanced.
t Contrast agents - the choice depends on the organ being imaged made of elimination from the body and potential adverse reactions.
t Very important to have knowledge of agents in order to redict their effect on the patient and to be able to evaluate the advisability of using them in a procedure.
t Find radiographs of various body systems
