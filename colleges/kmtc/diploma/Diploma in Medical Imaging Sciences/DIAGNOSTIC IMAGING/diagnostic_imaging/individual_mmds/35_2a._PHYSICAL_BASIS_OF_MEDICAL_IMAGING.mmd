\section*{PHYSICAL BASIS OF MEDICAL IMAGING}

\section*{IMAGING MODALITIES INCLUDE:-}
- X-ray imaging.
- Ultrasound.
- Radionuclide imaging:-
- A radionuclide is an unstable atom that emits energy spontaneously.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

\section*{DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENERGY ARE USED, NAMELY:-}
- X-ray imaging employs short wavelength, highly penetrating electromagnetic radiation (X-rays)
- Ultrasound imaging employs very high frequency sound, a mechanical form of energy
- Radionuclide imaging uses gamma radiation, a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to Xrays but originating from radioactive materials
- MRI employs very strong magmatic fields and long wavelength electromagnetic radiation (radio waves)
- $X$ rays and gamma rays are ionizing radiations, ultrasound and radio waves are non-ionizing.

shorter wavelength higher frequency
higher energy
longer wavelength lower frequency lower energy

\section*{1. X-RAY IMAGING}
- Based on studying the pattern of X-rays transmitted through the body
- Different tissues attenuate X-rays to different extents depending on physical characteristics: density, atomic number, thickness.
- Pattern of attenuation is contained in the invisible latent image transmitted through the body
- Latent image is made visible using an image receptor (photographic emulsions or fluorescent image receptors)

\section*{CONT.}
1. Uniform X-ray beam incident upon subject
2. Differential attenuation of X-ray beam in different structures within subject
- Factors: atomic no.
- Density
- Thickness
3. Latent image represents pattern of attenuation
- It is non-uniform, invisible
4. Image receptor makes latent image visible
- Examples of image receptors include: Photographic film

\section*{2. ULTRASOUND IMAGING}
- Ultrasound of frequencies $3-15 \mathrm{MHz}$ is used
- When beamed into tissues, reflection of the ultrasound occurs at tissue boundaries, based on the physical characteristics of the boundaries
- The magnitudes of the reflected echoes and the locations of the reflecting boundaries are mapped to generate the ultrasound image
- In clinical ultrasound, body fluids are non-reflectors and will therefore appear dark; gas is a reflector ( $99 \%$ reflection) and thus one cannot examine structures lying on the other side of gas.

ULTRASOUND

\section*{3. RADIONUCLIDE IMAGING}
- A radioactive nuclide which emits gamma radiation is used to tag (or label) a pharmaceutical agent selectively concentrates in a particular organ tissue
- The combination of radionuclide and pharmaceutical agent is known as a radiopharmaceutical
- When a radiopharmaceutical is administered internally to the patient, the highly penetrating gamma rays emitted by the radionuclide leave the concentrating organ and can be externally detected.
- Radiopharmaceutical is introduced into the subject [radionuclide + pharmaceutical = radiopharmaceutical]
- Emits gamma rays from uptaking organ
- Gamma rays detected by camera

CONT.

\section*{4. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)}
- Magnetism latent in the nuclei of certain atoms is stimulated by exposure to strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency (RF) pulses
- During de-excitation, the stimulated nuclei emit RF signals
- The concentration of nuclei (strength of emitted RF signal) and rates at which the de-excitation takes place (relaxation times) determines the image formed.
- The most important MRI-friendly nucleus is Hydrogen-1 $\left(\mathrm{H}^{1}\right)$ in body water
- The magnetic resonance image provides high contrast information based on the $\mathrm{H}^{1}$ concentration and magnetic properties of the tissues interrogated in the environments in which they exist

\section*{UNIQUE CHARACTERICTICS OF THEI IMAGING MODALITIES}

The different imaging modalities are associated with unique features in respect of:-
- The nature of information it provides (e.g. physical, chemical, physiologic, paramagnetic)
- Sensitivity (e.g. early detection)
- Ability to depict detail (e.g. resolution, contrast)
- Ability to depict dynamic change (e.g. uptake and excretion rate)
- Safety of forms of energy used (ionizing vs. non-ionizing radiation)
