\section*{Imaging of The GIT}

\section*{Dr. Angeline. A. Aywak}
§ The discovery of X-rays made radiological procedures play a leading role in the visualization of anatomy and diseases of the gastrointestinal system.
§ Later the advent of fibre optic endoscopic examination has changed the role of imaging of GIT pathology.
§ Even so Imaging still has a vital role in management of gastrointestinal conditions.

\section*{Why Irnage?}

\section*{§ Imaging is needed to make or confirm a diagnosis and show disease extend.}
§ Help to plan treatment
§ To follow up disease response after treatment.

\section*{§ Listed below are current gastrointestinal imaging modalities}
A) Plain X-rays
B) Ultrasound
C) Contrast studies
D) Computerized Tomography
E) Radionuclide Scanning
F) Magnetic Resonance Imaging
G) Angiography

\section*{A. Plain X-RAY Films}
§ With plain X-rays the gastrointestinal organs cannot be separately visualized, however the normal or pathological gas accumulations, air fluid levels, calcification and motility of gas containing intestine can be seen.

\section*{Plain Films}

\section*{Indications}
§ Suspected obstructive conditions
i. Congenital e.g. TOF, Pyloric stenosis, duodenal atresia.
ii. Acquired e.g. intussusception, strangulated hernia.
§ Localization of radio-opaque foreign bodies
§ Suspected perforation of intestinal tract.
§ Suspected calculus.

\section*{B. Ultrasound examination.}
§ In the hollow organs an increased wall thickness, increased degree of fluid content, pathological motility and status of surrounding environment (organs, peritoneal space) can be clearly visualized by ultrasound.
§ All solid orgarns and the peritoneal cavity can be assessed by ultrasound.

\section*{Indications for ultrasound}

\section*{§ Suspected masses \\ § Suspected peritoneal fluid collections \\ § Suspected calculus \\ § Suspected inflammatory conditions like appendicitis}
§ Suspected intusussception
§ The jaundiced patient

\section*{Endosonography}
§ With this method the internal lumens of the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum and their surroundings can be examined.
§ Wall structure, pathological processes and their relationship with surrounding organs can be visualized.

\section*{Controlst Studies}
§ Contrast material is introduced into the system. Ba sulphate, Air, Ionic water soluble as well as non-ionic water soluble contrast materials used.
§ Choice of contrast depends on suspected pathology .

\section*{Single Contrast.}
§ The gastrointestinal lumen is filled with positive contrast material usually (Barium sulfate).
§ This then makes easy visualization of pathological conditions such as stenosis, dilatations, intraluminal filling defects, organ contour deformity and external compression.
§ The examination can also verify function of the system i.e. emptying and peristalsis.

\section*{Double contrast studies}
§ This examination applies use of two contrast materials a positive one (Barium sulfate or gastrografin) and a negative one (usually air).
§ The wall of the organ is relaxed by smooth muscle relaxant. Membrane is coated by contrast material and lumen distended with gas.
§ This provides more information than single contrast examination as detailed visualization of gut mucosa is achieved, the method however does not afford a functional information.

\section*{Barium Swallow}

\section*{Indications}
1. Dysphagia
2. Pain on swallowing
3. Assessment of tracheo-oesophageal fistula
4. Pre-operative assessment of CA bronchus
5. Assessment of left atrial enlargement
6. Assessment of perforation (water soluble contrast used)
7. Follow up following oesophageal surgery.

\section*{Contraindications}

$\varnothing$ weight loss
$\varnothing$ upper abdominal masses

\section*{Ban meal follow through}

\section*{Indications}

\section*{§ Pain}

\section*{§ Diarrhoea e.g. suspected disaccharidase deficiency}

\section*{§ Bleeding}

\section*{§ Partial obstruction}

\section*{Contraindications}

\section*{As for Ba meal}

\section*{Small bowel Enernet}
§ Gives better visualization of small bowel than that achieved by barium meal follow through.
§ However it has the disadvantage of being unpleasant to the patient due to intubation and time consuming to the radiologist.

\section*{Indication}

Same as for Barium meal follow through.

\section*{B히 Enerror}
§ Examination of the large bowel. Two methods commonly used.
i. Double contrast: This is examination of choice to demonstrate mucosal pattern.
ii. Single contrast: This is used in children since it is not usually necessary to demonstrate mucosal pattern. It can also be used to reduce an intussusception

\section*{Indications}
§ Change in bowel habits
§ Pain
§ Mass
§ Meleana
§ Obstruction as in intussusception

\section*{Contraindications}
§ Toxic megacolon
§ Pseudomembranous colitis
§ Rectal biopsy within previous 3 days

Arteries of Large Intestine

\section*{D. Computerized T'ornography}
§ This method can recognize pathological wall thickening, pathological wall narrowing (with appropriate technique) and status of surrounding organs.
§ However it is rather expensive.

Indications
§ Same as in Ultrasound

\section*{E. Magnetic Resonance Inaging}

\section*{§ MRI like CT is useful for clarification of status of surrounding organs of an already identified pathology.}
§ It thus plays a role in disease staging especially where cancer is involved
§ Radiation is harmful
- to the individual
- to the community
§ Order these examinations only where clinically indicated.

Examine patient.
§ Make provisional diagnosis
§ Select imaging modality likely to yield the best results
§ Use ultrasound in preference to nuclear and Xray imaging.
§ Do not order other exam before significant radiological changes can have occurred.
