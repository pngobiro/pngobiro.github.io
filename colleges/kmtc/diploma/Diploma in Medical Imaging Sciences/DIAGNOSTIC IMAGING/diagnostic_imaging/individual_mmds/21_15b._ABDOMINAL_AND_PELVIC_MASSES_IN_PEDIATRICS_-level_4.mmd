ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC MASSES IN PEDIATRICS.

\section*{Level IV}

\section*{1. LIVER}

Causes of hepatomegaly include:-
- Diffuse enlargement e.g. hepatic vascular congestion in RHF, fatty liver in malnutrition, malabsorption , leukemia/lymphoma infiltration, liver secondaries, hepatitis
- focal causes e.g. solid tumor- malignant hepatoblastoma, hepatic carcinoma
- Benign- hemangioma, hamartoma, adenoma
- Cystic lesions- hydatid cysts, amoebic/pyogenic abscesses e.t.c.
- primary liver tumors account for 2\% of all malignancies.
- Hepatoblastoma arises from the primitive hepatocyctes. Usually presents in infancy and is rare over 5 years.

\section*{Dxl imaging liver mases}
- Abdominal mass often with marked distension in RUQ
- Plain film- enlarged liver outline, calcification in hepatoblastoma
- US- solid or cystic lesion lesion, biliary obstruction, hemangiomas are echogenic with acoustic enhancement
- CT- size of lesion, evidence of local invasion, extrahepatic metatases
- Tumor markers- $\alpha$ - fetoproteins are elevated
- Tissue diagnosis- US guided core biopsy especially in diffuse disease, or open biopsy in focal lesions
2. SPLEEN

Splenomegaly can be seen in:-
- Infections;
- bacterial- brucellosis, Tuberculosis, Subacute bacterial endocarditis
- viral- infectious mononucleosis
- parasitic- malaria, kalazar, schistosomiasis, hydatid disease
- fungal- histoplasmosis
- glycogen storage disease- Gaucher's
- RES disorders - histiocytosis, leukemia, lymphoma
- Blood disorders- chronic anemias (e.g. hemolytic, pernicious, sickle cell) polycythemia, myelofibrosis
- Portal hypertension- hepatic fibrosis, schistosomiasis

\section*{Diagnosis/ imaging- spleen}
- Plain films- LUQ soft tissue mass
- US for echo pattern- normal spleen is homogenous echoes, can be heterogeneous in infiltrative disorders, hypoechoeic lesions in lymphoma, leukemia
- CT - in staging lymphoma as assessment of liver, par-aortic nodes can also be done

\section*{3. BILIARY SYSTEM}
- Choledochal cyst; commonly occurs as a fusiform dilatation of the CBD
- M:F ratio = 1:4
- Rarely presents before 6 months
- Clinical presentation- obstructive jaundice, upper abdominal swelling (RUQ) which is cystic on US
- Untreated can be fatal fron ascending cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, biliary peritonitis in cyst rupture, malignant change

\section*{4. MESENTERIC CYSTS}
- Are uncommon. More seen in the 2nd decade of life; Are rare between 1-10 years and are exceptional in under 1 year.
- Clinical presentation- painless abdominal swelling that moves freely when at right angles to the mesentery, acute abdomen in torsion, rupture, hemorrhage or infection.
- Include:-
- chylolymphatic/ lymphangiomas
- enterogenous
- urogenital remnants
- dermoids

UPJ obstruction
pelvic dermoid cyst

\section*{Mesenteric cysts;cont.}
- lymphangioma- are the commonest. Arise from the mesentery of the ileum. Has a thin wall of endothelium and is filled with clear fluid.
US- thin walled cyst.
- Enterogenous- Develop as a diverticulum at the mesenteric border of the intestine which separates in embryonic life or as a duplication of the intestine. Has a thicker wall and is lined by mucous membrane which is sometimes ciliated. Contents are mucinous, occasionally brownish from previous hemorrhage.
US- thick walled cyst with echogenic contents of varied appearance

\section*{5. OTHER CYSTS}
include;
- omental cysts- rare
- cysts of the mesocolon
- urogenital cysts from the Wolfian/ Mullerian remnant
6. GIT- INTUSSUSCEPTION
- presents with acute colicky abdominal pain, palpable abdominal mass

\section*{7. KIDNEYS}
- Are the commonest causes of abdominal mass in children.
- Abnormalities include- ectopic kidney 1:1000can be pelvic hence easily palpable
- Horseshoe kidney
- Polycystic kidneys
- Hydronephrosis- UPJ obstruction, posterior urethral valves, ureterocele
- Wilm's tumor- rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. D/dx neuroblastoma
- Multicystic renal dysplasia

\section*{Multicystic renal Dysplasia}
- non hereditary, congenital
- is usually unilateral
- Is the commonest cause of abdominal mass in the newborn.
- There is failure of the ureteric bud to join with the renal blastema. Resultant mass resembles a cluster of grapes.
- US- large multiloculated; predominantly cystic mass D/dx severe hydronephrosis
- The contralateral kidney has increased incidence of congenital anomalies e.g. UPJ obstruction in 30-40 \% of patients

- Hydronephrois

- Polycystic/Multicystic renal disease

\section*{Mesoblastic Nephroma}
- fetal hamartoma seen within the first months of life.
- Is benign.
- D/dx- hydronephrosis, multicystic kidney, Wilm's tumor (rare in neonate)
- Plain film- large soft tissue mass usually without calcifications in the renal area
- US- well defined mass with low echoes
- IVU- distorted, displaced calices due to parenchymal involvement
- Angiography- displaced aorta, renal and lumbar arteries with neovascularisation in the mass (tumor blush0 which may be hyper or hypovascular.
- CT- low attenuation mass with enhancement of capsule and septa with contrast.

\section*{Wilm's Tumor( nephroblastoma)}
- is the most common solid abdominal mass in childhood beyond the neonatal period.

- ARDP- hyperechoeic large kidneys with loss of corticomedullary differentiation, dilatation of distal collecting ducts. Is associated with hepatic fibrosis. Hypertension is a common complication. Presents at 2-5 years
- IVU- streaking of contrast in the renal parenchyma on delayed films
- ADPD- has bilateral asymmetrical renal cysts. Associated with cysts in the liver and pancreas. D/dx- tuberous sclerosis

\section*{Multilocular cysts of the kidney}
- are rare; present with an abdominal mass in late infancy/ early childhood
- US- transonic areas with septations
- Malignant risk hence nephrectomy is recommended.
