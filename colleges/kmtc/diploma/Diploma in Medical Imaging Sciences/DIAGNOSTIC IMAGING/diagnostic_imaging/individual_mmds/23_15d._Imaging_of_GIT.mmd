\section*{Imaging of The GIT}

\section*{Dr. Angeline. A. Aywak}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ea78dddf9295cc64c5a0g-02.jpg?height=967&width=1649&top_left_y=103&top_left_x=553)

The discovery of X-rays made radiological procedures play a leading role in the visualization of anatomy and diseases of the gastrointestinal system.
- Later the advent of fibre optic endoscopic examination has changed the role of imaging of GIT pathology.
Even so Imaging still has a vital role in management of gastrointestinal conditions.

\section*{Why Irsage?}
- Imaging is needed to make or confirm a diagnosis and show disease extend.
- Help to plan treatment
- To follow up disease response after treatment.

Listed below are current gastrointestinal imaging modalities
A) Plain X-rays
B) Ultrasound
C) Contrast studies
D) Computerized Tomography
E) Radionuclide Scanning
F) Magnetic Resonance Imaging
G) Angiography

\section*{A. Pleijn X-PAY FilfNS}

With plain X-rays the gastrointestinal organs cannot be separately visualized, however the normal or pathological gas accumulations, air fluid levels, calcification and motility of gas containing intestine can be seen.

\section*{Plain Films}

\section*{Indications}

\section*{Suspected obstructive conditions}
i. Congenital e.g. TOF, Pyloric stenosis, duodenal atresia.
if. Acquired e.g. intussusception, strangulated hernia.
Localization of radio-opaque foreign bodies
Suspected perforation of intestinal tract.
Suspected calculus.

\section*{B. Utrasound exannination.}

In the hollow organs an increased wall thickness, increased degree of fluid content, pathological motility and status of surrounding environment (organs, peritoneal space) can be clearly visualized by ultrasound.
All solid orgarns and the peritoneal cavity can be assessed by ultrasound.

\section*{Indications for ultiselsound}
- Suspected masses
- Suspected peritoneal fluid collections
- Suspected calculus
- Suspected inflammatory conditions like appendicitis
Suspected intusussception
The jaundiced patient

\section*{Endosonography}
- With this method the internal lumens of the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum and their surroundings can be examined.
- Wall structure, pathological processes and their relationship with surrounding organs can be visualized.

\section*{Contrast Studjes}

Contrast material is introduced into the system. Ba sulphate, Air, lonic water soluble as well as non-ionic water soluble contrast materials used.
- Choice of contrast depends on suspected pathology.

\section*{Single Contrast.}
- The gastrointestinal lumen is filled with positive contrast material usually (Barium sulfate).
- This then makes easy visualization of pathological conditions such as stenosis, dilatations, intraluminal filling defects, organ contour deformity and external compression.
The examination can also verify function of the system i.e. emptying and peristalsis.

\section*{Double contrast studies}

This examination applies use of two contrast materials a positive one (Barium sulfate or gastrografin) and a negative one (usually air).
- The wall of the organ is relaxed by smooth muscle relaxant. Membrane is coated by contrast material and lumen distended with gas.
This provides more information than single contrast examination as detail)ed visualization of gut mucosa is achieved, the method however does not afford a functional information.

\section*{Types of contrast studjes}

Sialography
Ba. Swallow
- Ba. Meal
- Ba. meal follow thru
- Small Bowel Enema

Ba. Enema
Colostrogram, Sinogram, Fistulogram

\section*{Siglography}

\section*{Barium Swellow}

\section*{Indications}
1. Dysphagia
2. Pain on swallowing
3. Assessment of tracheo-oesophageal fistula
4. Pre-operative assessment of CA bronchus
5. Assessment of left atrial enlargement
6. Assessment of perforation (water soluble contrast used)
7. Follow up following oesophageal surgery.

\section*{Contraindications}
- None

Patient Preparation
- None

\section*{Ã‰a! Mea!}

Double contrast is an examination of choice in adults. Single contrast is used in children and very ill adults.

\section*{Indications}
> dyspepsia

\author{
weight loss
}
upper abolominal masses

\section*{Inclicatijons}
suspected gastrointestinal bleeding or unexplained iron deficiency
> partial obstruction
> assessment of site of perforation (use water soluble contrast)
Contraindications
Complete large boned obstruction

\section*{Ba! ssueal follow thisough}

\section*{Indications}

Pain
- Diarrhoea e.g. suspected disaccharidase deficiency
- Bleeding

Partial obstruction
Contraindications
As for Ba meal

\section*{Snsall boyal Enerrie!}

Gives better visualization of small bowel than that achieved by barium meal follow through.
" However it has the disadvantage of being unpleasant to the patient due to intubation and time consuming to the radiologist,

\section*{Indication}

Same as for Barium meal follow through.

\section*{Ee! Enjersie.}

Examination of the large bowel. Two methods commonly used.
i. Double contrast: This is examination of choice to demonstrate mucosal pattern.
ii. Single contrast: This is used in children since it is not usually necessary to demonstrate mucosal pattern. It can also be used to reduce an intussusception

\section*{Indications}

Change in bowel habits
- Pain
" Mass
- Meleana
- Obstruction as in intussusception

\section*{Contraindications}
- Toxic megacolon
- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Rectal biopsy within previous 3 days

\section*{Suggested Prissary Jrsaging Modality}

\section*{S/S}
$$B A \quad \text { OGD }$$

Dyspepsia
-simple
-complicated
- Reflux oesophagus
- Dysphagia
- Haematemesis/ melana
Previous surgery for recurrent disease for anatomy and emptying

\section*{D. Computerized Jomography}

This method can recognize pathological wall thickening, pathological wall narrowing (with appropriate technique) and status of surrounding organs.
- However it is rather expensive.

Indications

Same as in Ultrasound

\section*{E. Magnetic resonance Insagjory}

\section*{MRI like CT is useful for clarification of status of surrounding organs of an already identified pathology.}

\section*{It thus plays a role in disease staging especially where cancer is involved}
- Radiation is harmful
- to the individual
- to the community
- Order these examinations only where clinically indicated.

Examine patient.
" Make provisional diagnosis
- Select imaging modality likely to yield the best results
- Use ultrasound in preference to nuclear and X-ray imaging,
- Do not order other exam before significant radiological changes can have occurred.
