ABDOMINAL MASSES IN CHILDHOOD

\section*{ABDOMINAL MASSES IN CHILDHOOD}
> not a 'small adult'
> different constraints in choice of imaging modalities
> different range of presenting pathologies
> greater emphasis on congenital abnormalities
> incidence of malignant disease increases with increasing age
> exposure to radiation must be kept to a minimum in children
> certain modalities more suitable than others
e.g. paucity of abdominal fat leads to good quality ultrasound images BUT reduced quality on CT
> need for sedation/anesthesia in:
- painful procedures
- procedures requiring immobilization e.g.

CT, MRJ

\section*{IMAGING MODALITIES}
> Plain radiographs
> Ultrasound scanning
> Computerized Tomography (CT)
> Nuclear Medicine
> Intravenous Urography (IVU)
> Angjography
> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRJ)

Plain Radiographs:
- plain abdominal films are of limited use
- ? abdominal mass
- displaced bowel loop gas - location, size
- $\pm$ calcification - neuroblastoma, teratoma, nephroblastoma, hepatoblastoma
- associated skeletal abnormalities e.g. metastatic disease
- complimentary CXR - ? pulmonary metastasis e.g in neproblastoma, hepatoblastoma

Ultrasound Scanning:
- first examination of choice in neonate and child presenting with an abdominal mass
- may be the only one required to make a diagnosis and assist further management
- localization
- organ of origin
- internal structure of mass - cystic/solid, $\pm$ internal septae - (often an indicator of benign or malignant nature)
- ? abnormal vasculature - Doppler and color flow
- guide percutaneous biopsy for histopathological diagnosis

Computerized Tomography:
- adjunct to ultrasonography
- next investigation of choice
- additional anatomical information
- however - ionizing radiation
- requires sedation for those below 5 years
- only used when distinct benefits are identified

\section*{Nuclear Medicine:}
- evaluation of function e.g.
- renal scan in assessment of renal function cases of hydronephrosis

Intravenous Urography:
- largely replaced by ultrasound and CT
- however - specific cases of renal masses, the appearance on IVU is characteristic and diagnostic

Angiography:
- also largely replaced by US, CT and MRI in the investigation and diagnosis of abdominal masses
- however, useful pre-op assessment of a tumor, particularly liver tumors - can demonstrate vascular supply of tumor from liver? arterial ? portal venous

Magnetic Resonance Imaging:
- no ionizing radiation
- multiplanner scanning and therefore useful tool in investigation of children with abdominal masses
- requires relatively long periods of immobility and therefore sedation / general anaesthesia is required for those under 6 years.
- not widely available
- very good demonstration of abdominal and pelvic masses
- best demonstration of extension of masses into spinal canal e.g. neuroblastoma

\section*{ABDOMINAL MASSES}

Masses presenting in childhood in the abdomen can be divided into 4 broad categories:
1. Retroperitoneal:
- renal
- non-renal
2. Hepatobiliary
3. Gastrointestinal
4. Pelvic/Genital
