\section*{Definition of an acute abdomen.}

A group of conditions characterized by severe abdominal pain in which prompt surgical treatment must be considered to treat perforation, peritonitis, vascular or other intra-abdominal catastrophe

\section*{Principles of imaging.}
- The objective of imaging in the whole of the human body is to demonstrate structures not usually visible to the eye.
- Unlike in the chest where natural contrast is maximal abdominal contrast is limited.
- A soft issue opacity of 2 mm in the lung fields would stand out against air.
- In the abdomen a polyp 20 times that would easily be missed.

\section*{General Principles}
- Role of the radiologist - help the surgeon decide if surgery is indicated
- If immediate surgery indicated on clinical findings, negative radiology should be ignored

\section*{The tools of the trade.}
- Plain film.
- Sonography.
- Barium studies.
- Nuclear medicine.
${ }^{\circ}$ CT.
- MRI.
- IVU.

The Plain A6d. Radiograph (AXR)

Often the most useful initial investigation

Interpretation depends on the gas patterns

\section*{Specific diagnosis is possible in many cases}

Objectivity is improved by viewing r/g initially in the absence of any clinical info.

Choice of Radiograph
Influenced by clinical suspicion \& patient's ability to stand

Supine abdomen = most useful single r/g. In some conditions, e.g. Renal colic, it may be adequate alone.

Erect CXR = best film for free intra-abdominal gas

A horizontal ray AXR
- adds information: fluid levels/ free gas.
- It's either Erect PA or LL decubitus (interpretation difficult ??)

Exposures are optimal for picking Pneumoperitoneum

Acute abd. Mimics may be suspected on CXR:
$\checkmark$ LL pneumonia, Pulm. infarction, pleurisy
$\checkmark$ aortic dissection/leaking aneurysm,
$\checkmark$ MI, CCF, pericarditis
$\checkmark$ Pneumothorax

Some abd. Dx have chest complications, eg. Pleural effusion often complicates acute pancreatitis

Baseline CXR - chest complications and subphrenic abscesses are frequent post-op complications

Supine AXR
- Distribution of gas
- Calibre of bowel
- Displacement of bowel by soft tissue masses
- Obliteration of normal fat lines - eg. Psoas
outlines,
properitoneal fat
line
LL Decubitus
Best for pneumoperitoneum in patients who cant stand Best for showing a dilated gas-filled duodenal loop in suspected acute pancreatitis

> Dorsal Decubitus may show calcification in an aortic aneurysm not detected on the supine view

\section*{Normal Appearances}

\section*{Amount of gas in SB is small. Only short lengths of it are seen Valvulae conniventes are rarely seen}

3 - 5 fluid levels $<2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ long are normal

3 or more fluid levels $>2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ are abnormal (ileus/obstruction)

Colon contains gas - haustra are readily identified

Colonic fluid levels of several cm in left colon are normal

Normal Appearances ctd..

S/bowel rule of 3:
-Wall thickness < 3 mm
-Valvulae conn. < 3 mm wide
- Caliber $\quad<3 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Air fluid levels < 3

Bowel calibre limits; rule of 3:
Small bowel 3 cm
TRV colon 6 cm
Caecum $\quad 9 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section*{Mechanical obstruction (GOO)}

\section*{Causes:}

Duodenal or pyloric canal ulceration Extrinsic compression, eg. Ca pancreas

\section*{Huge fluid filled stomach occupies most of the abdomen}

AXR - large soft tissue mass w. little or no bowel gas beyond it

A little stomach gas is usually present allowing identification

Acute Gastric Dilatation (AGD)
Frequently occurs in old people
Associated w/ fluid and electrolyte imbalance High mortality

Causes:
Post-op
Trauma
Inflammatory conditions - peritonitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis
Diabetic or hepatic coma

Abnormal rotation of one part of the stomach around another part

Relatively rare. Causes severe epigastric pain \& wretching

Most common in the elderly; may occur at any age

In most, stomach is at least partially herniated into thorax - Associated with para-oesophageal hiatus hernia or eventration.

\section*{Other causes:}

Luminal: gallstones, parasites, intussusception

Intramural: tumours, TB, strictures
(Radiotherapy)
Extrinsic: abdominal masses, volvulus

SBO: supine
- multiple loops
- valvulae

Large bowel not distended

\section*{S/bowel fluid levels}

\section*{Causes of Small Bowel Fluid Levels}

\section*{Small or large bowel obstruction Paralytic Ileus}

G/Enteritis
Cleansing enemas
Uraemia

Mesenteric thrombosis
Peritoneal metastasis (usually <25mm long)
(SBO should not be diagnosed on the basis of fluid levels alone)

Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)...
String of beads sign - virtually diagnostic of mechanical SBO. (gas bubbles trapped b/w valvulae in very distended almost completely fluidfilled s/bowel)

Initial AXR may be normal or equivocal, especially in high jejunal obstruction with vomiting. Films taken a few hrs later are often diagnostic.

If not, barium study or CT is done. Barium is safe due the large amount of fluid present.

SBO: Erect
- String of beads sign
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-26.jpg?height=1012&width=1720&top_left_y=180&top_left_x=36)

US Rt. flank in SBO:
Dilated hypoperistaltic fluid filled loops

> CT may have a role if - AXR equivocal
> - partial obstruction
> - conservative management is planned (to avoid missing strangulation)

CT shows:
- Dilated loops ( $>2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) (3cm mid ileum, 3.5 prox. Jejunum)
- Site and level of obstruction
- State of mesentery
- Intra- or extraluminal masses
- Presence of ascites
- Presence of strangulation

CT overall accuracy in SBO is $95 \%$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-28.jpg?height=1117&width=1114&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=23)

\section*{SBO on CT}
- Cause was adhesions

\section*{SBO: Strangulating Obstruction}

2 limbs of a loop are incarcerated by a band or in a hernia
Blood supply is compromised

Loop may fill with fluid $\Rightarrow$ mass or pseudotumour on AXR
Loop may fill with gas $\Rightarrow$ coffee bean appearance on AXR

\section*{Gallstone Ileus}

2\% of SBO. Typically, middle aged women
Stone erodes through inflamed GB wall into duodenum, rarely into the colon

Impacts in terminal ileum
(rarely in duodenum, colon)
50\% have radiographic signs of SBO
(usually with large fluid: gas ratio)

\section*{Gallstone ileus: supine}
- Abd. pain \& vomiting 5 days
- Gas in CBD

\section*{Intussusception}

Telescope-like invagination of bowel into lumen of more distal bowel. (Intussusceptum into intussuscipiens)

Presents with pain, vomiting, blood in stool \& a palpable mass. Diagnosis usually made clinically.
$=2^{\text {nd }}$ commonest cause of acute abd. in child after appendicitis

Most common 3 months to 2 yrs

Child over 3 yrs - think lymphoma
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-33.jpg?height=1455&width=1471&top_left_y=181&top_left_x=39)

\section*{Ileocolic Intussusception}

Cause: polypoid mass in terminal ileum

Intussusception ctd...
Adult Intussusception:
Accounts for 5\% of all intussusception cases.

20\% are idiopathic; 80\% have known causes:
- Tumour - 50\%
- Surgery - 30\%
- TB, typhoid

Accounts for < 15\% of adult bowel obstruction.
lleoileal type commoner in adults (40\%). Usually from small bowel benign tumours. Ileocolic 15\%. The rest colocolic.

Bloody stool in the majority. Palpable mass in 50\%.

\section*{Intussusception: supine}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-35.jpg?height=1331&width=1159&top_left_y=221&top_left_x=33)
- soft tissue mass across upper abd
-crescent of gas around head of intussusceptum

Intussusception following ileocolic lymphoma

\section*{US of RIF}
- ileum surrounded by hyperechoic mesenteric fat inside thickened colonic wall

\section*{CT- same case}
- oral contrast in ileal lumen in thickened ascending colon

\section*{Caecal Volvulus}

1/3 of Colonic Volvulus
(2/3 sigmoid; 4\% TRV colon)
< 2\% of adult intestinal obstruction

Caecum \& Asc. Colon have to be on a mesentery
(a congenital variant occurring in 11\%).
$30-60 \mathrm{yr}$ olds
50\%: caecum twists and inverts so caecal pole occupies LUQ

50\%: caecum only twists, remains in RIF or Rt. Abdomen.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-38.jpg?height=1376&width=1379&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=95)

Caecal volvulus

\section*{Caecal Volvulus}

Caecum dilates considerably but 1 or 2 haustra are still seen.

Identification of attached gas-filled appendix confirms the diagnosis

50\% develop mod. to severe small bowel distension

Left colon is collapsed.

\section*{Sigmoid Volvulus}

The elderly (>60), mentally ill or institutionalized most affected

Sigmoid loop twists around its mesenteric axis, usually counterclockwise

Typically chronic with intermittent acute attacks

In $1 / 3$ it's difficult to differentiate from a dilated nonrotated sigmoid or dilated TRV colon looping down.

AXR in Sigmoid Volvulus
Massively distended inverted U-shaped loop

Ahaustral margin which overlaps:
- the lower border of the liver shadow $\rightarrow$ liver overlap sign
- the haustrated dilated desc. Colon $\boldsymbol{\rightarrow}$ left flank overlap sign
- the left side of the pelvis $\boldsymbol{\rightarrow} \boldsymbol{p}$ pelvic overlap sign

Apex above T10 and under left hemidiaphragm

Inferior Convergence on the Left side of the pelvis over upper sacral segments

Air: fluid ratio > 2:1

Sigmoid volvulus: supine.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-42.jpg?height=1428&width=2323&top_left_y=342&top_left_x=55)

\section*{Sigmoid Volvulus}

\section*{Contrast enema is done if AXR diagnosis in doubt:}
$\checkmark$ a curved tapering of barium, the bird of prey sign
$\checkmark$ a corkscrew mucosal pattern at the point of twist
$\checkmark$ in chronic volvulus, shouldering (wall thickening at twist site)

RX:
- Decompress \& stabilise with rectal tube
- Complicated cases: Surgical resection. Mortality 25\%

\section*{Ileosigmoid Znot}

Rare. An abnormally mobile loop of small bowel forms a knot around the base of the pelvic colon

Abrupt onset, fulminant course, intense pain

AXR:
Dilated loop of pelvic colon, lies on Rt. side

Small bowel obstruction

Retained faecal matter in undistended proximal colon

Acute Colitis
Usually acute exacerbations of IBD. Ulceration is responsible for the major complications

AXR is useful to decide between medical and surgical management

Absence of (deep) ulceration and dilatation allows medical management

Areas with active colitis have no faecal residue

Coarse irregularity of the mucosal edge and absence of haustrations suggests marked ulceration

\section*{Acute Colitis: Toxic Megacolon}

An acute fulminant form of colitis with:
- transmural inflammation
- neuromuscular degeneration
- Extensive colonic dilatation

Usually occurs as a complx of - U.Colitis in 2-13\%
- Crohn's dx 2\% or PMC.

Extensive and deep ulceration

Perforation and peritonitis are common. Ba Enema is c/i.

Age: 20-35y. Rx usually by colectomy. Mortality: 30\%.

\section*{Acute Colitis: Perforation}

Likely to occur during an acute attack of Ulcerative Colitis

Result of deep ulceration

Sigmoid = usual site

Free perforation $\boldsymbol{\rightarrow}$ pneumoperitoneum (rare in Crohn's)

Sealed perforations are not detected reliably on AXR

\section*{Pseudo-obstruction ctd...}

\section*{AXR:}

Colon may be very dilated +/- small bowel dilatation

Large amount of bowel gas \& fluid levels are present

Ba enema (or CT) is required to exclude true obstruction and avoid an unnecessary laparatomy

If caecal diameter exceeds the critical 9cm, caecostomy or Rt. colostomy is required to prevent perforation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_ba96cbc2b0950a3eda46g-49.jpg?height=1312&width=2332&top_left_y=135&top_left_x=35)

Pseudo-obstruction: supine. Marked large \& small bowel distension till sigmoid area. Ba flows freely into desc. colon

PneumoPm: Signs on Supine AXR
RUQ gas - about ½ of patients have an oval or linear gas
collection adjacent to the liver in:
- the subhepatic space
- Morrison's pouch
- fissure for ligamentum teres
(This is the commonest sign).

Rigler's sign - both sides of bowel wall visualised.
(Requires 1000 ml of air) - WD

Triangular air - gas collections between loops of bowel

Rigler's sign in perforated DU
Erect CXR

\section*{Pneumoperitoneum: Mimics}

Colonic interposition - Chilaiditi's syndrome.
Commoner in ascites, cirrhosis, chronic lung dx .

Subdiaphragmatic fat - extension from post. pararenal fat
- more laterally situated than air
- constant position in decubitus views

Curvilinear supradiaphragmatic lung collapse - rare

Subphrenic abscess
Irregularity of left hemi-diaphragm

Cysts of pneumatosis intestinalis

\section*{Intraperitoneal Fluid}

Commonly present in acute abdominal conditions

Even moderate amounts can be difficult to diagnose on AXR.
(US far superior)
Pelvis = most dependent part on both supine and erect films

Earliest sign:
Fluid densities (dog-ears) lateral to rectal gas shadow
