What is an imaging request?

-An imaging request is a consultation between the clinician and the radiological team (radiologist/radiographer).
-Consultation - deliberation of two or more persons on some matter, with a view to arrive at a decision.
-As such, adequate communication is paramount for effective consultation
-This consultation is carried out through a request form

If your radiology request is not going to communicate effectively then it is better not to

\section*{Outline of an imaging request design}
-Patient's biodata
-Radiological examination being requested
-Relevant clinical information
-Patient's past medical history and previous imaging findings

\section*{Patient's biodata}

Unique ID - Hosp no, clinic no, etc
Name
Age
Sex
Date
Address - ward, clinic, physical, telephone etc.
LMP (female patients)

\section*{Clinical information}
-There still exists no substitute for proper history and physical examination in clinical patient care
-Signs and symptoms narrow down to a particular system/ organ. In some cases a definitive diagnosis is made while in others differential diagnoses are inferred clinically
-Explicit relevant information of your clinical findings guides the radiologist/ radiographer to resonate with your expectations both in technique and interpretation of findings

\section*{Clinical information}

For female patients of reproductive age, last normal menstrual period is important History of allergies if known need to be included

\section*{generating an imaging request}
-Appropriateness of the examination and modality
-Patient preparation for the examination
-Limitations of the modality

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}

What is the clinical question you want answered by radiology?

What system/ organ is of interest? What imaging modalities are relevant to that system/organ?

How will the radiological investigation influence the decision making in the process of patient management?

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}
"Analyze
1.Patient's stability, immediate and special needs
2.Availability of the preferred modality
3.Cost
4.Radiation safety considerations
5. Details that need to be derived from the imaging modality
6. Expertise of the imaging team

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}

\section*{Patient's stability, immediate and special needs}
"In acute life threatening situations, patients stability overrides any imaging and therefore the latter is done without any danger to the patient's life
"Airway, breathing, circulation (hemodynamic state) need to be sorted out before transfer of patient to the imaging department
"Special needs have to be addressed e.g. hypothermia in neonates and infants. Allergies when performing contrast studies, metallic implants when performing MRI are all risks to be considered. Can you think of any other special needs?

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}

\section*{Availability and cost considerations}

These are not absolute determinants but need to be factored in particularly in regard to the influence the radiological examination will have on the patient's outcome.

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}

\section*{Radiation safety considerations}
"Ionizing vs non-ionizing radiation
"If a clinical question can be adequately answered by a modality that utilizes nonionizing radiation then go for it over one that will use ionizing radiation.
"Children, pregnant mothers carry the greatest risk.
"Some organs are more radiosensitive than others e.g. gonads, thyroid gland, eye lens

\section*{Deciding the appropriate radiological investigation}

\section*{Details expected from the investigation}

Each of the imaging modalities have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to detailing anatomical structures and pathological processes

Moreover, even for the appropriate modality, extent of the examination including field of view, views required and where applicable contrast introduction need to be optimized.

\section*{Patient preparation}
"Some radiological examinations require special preparation
1.i.v. contrast - renal function tests
2.Upper GI Contrast studies - fasting at least 6 hrs
3.Contrast Enema - bowel preparation
4.IVU - Bowel preparation
5.Abdominal US - Fasting at least 6 hrs
6.Pelvic US - Full bladder

\section*{Examples of radiological study limitations}
1.Plain radiography - Poor soft tissue detail, representation of disease in 2D, ionising radiation.
2.Contrast radiography - ionising radiation, lack of extraluminal details, poor soft tissue details
3.Ultrasound - operator dependence, inability to penetrate gas eg. Bowel disease, bone disease
4.CT - radiation dose, cost, availability
5.MRI - availability, cost, limited expertise, metallic implants, claustrophobia.
6 Angiography - invasive, limited expertise, radiation
7.Radionuclide - availability, expertise, poor anatomical detail

Clinical scenario: patient stabbed with a knife through the left temporal region
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_70255f40b12635510c4bg-18.jpg?height=1255&width=2140&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=97)

Plain radiography in this case of penetrating knife injury to the head could only place the tip intracranially. The CT scan image on the right further demonstrates the intracranial effects. Plain radiography has strength in demonstrating bone and other radiodense objects e.g metals, air natterns but is weak in soft tissue analvsis

Clinical scenario: child swallowed a coin
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_70255f40b12635510c4bg-19.jpg?height=938&width=1875&top_left_y=274&top_left_x=374)

A coin that is well demonstrated on plain radiography but poorly shown on ultrasound. Ultrasound has poor penetration of bowel gas

Clinical scenario: patient with suspected colorectal cancer
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_70255f40b12635510c4bg-20.jpg?height=920&width=2023&top_left_y=283&top_left_x=143)

Barium enema demonstrates mucosal irregularity and stricture involving the caecum but does not not show extra-luminal and extramural effects that are well demonstrated by the CT scan on the right. Intracavitary contrast studies are limited to the cavity and its lining

Clinical scenario: patient with trauma to the left middle finger
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_16_70255f40b12635510c4bg-21.jpg?height=1401&width=1552&top_left_y=266&top_left_x=325)

Advantage of at least two orthogonal views when investigating trauma. Note the dislocation of distal interphalangeal joint missed on the AP BUT SEEN ON THE LATERAL.

\section*{generating the imaging request}
-Inadequate information
-Poor/ ineligible handwriting
-Failure to pay attention to details
-Treating imaging examinations casually / poor concentration.
-Use of nonstandard abbreviations.
