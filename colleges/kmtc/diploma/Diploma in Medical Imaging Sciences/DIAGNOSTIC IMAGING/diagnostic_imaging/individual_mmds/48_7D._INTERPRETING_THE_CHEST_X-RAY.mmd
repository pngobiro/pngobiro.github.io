\section*{READING THE CHEST RADIOGRAPH}
t Before you look at a chest film, you should have provisional clinical diagnosis after taking history and physical examination
t The CXR findings should confirm your physical findings rather than be an aid to make your physical findings later

\section*{THE GOLDEN RULES}
1. Technical quality.
2. Chest wall and diaphragm.
3. Heart and mediastinum.
4. Lungs.
5. Review areas.

\section*{CONT.}
t Chest radiographs are done in a postero-anterior (PA) and left lateral positions.
t The PA view is done to minimize cardiac magnification.
t Lateral view is done to allow 3-D interpretation of the chest film findings (see alter).
t In sick patients, an AP chest film is done either supine or upright depending on how mobile the patient is.
t On AP view, it is sometimes hard to assess cardiac enlargement, pleural effusion and lung parenchyma, especially if the patient did not take good inspiratory effort
t When taking a PA X ray, the patient is facing the X-ray film cassette and the X-ray beam enters the patient's back.

\section*{PA VIEW TECHNIQUES}
1. Ensure the film belongs to the patient, the date is correct, the side marker is present
2. Adequate penetration of the mediastinum
$t$ Is the thoracic spine seen?
3. Has the patient taken good inspiratory effort
t About 10 posterior thoracic ribs (7 anterior) should be seen through the lungs.
4. Is there any rotation of the chest
$t$ Assess by checking the upper thoracic spinous process (oval) in relation to the medial ends of the clavicles (lines 'a') this CR is rotated to the left.

\section*{EXPOSURE}
t Overexposure masks opacities in the lung field
t Poor inspiration apparent cardiomegaly

\section*{LEFT LATERAL VIEW}
t The patient's left side is against the film and the X-ray beam travels from the right to the left side.
t This view is used to localize:
$t$ A lung lesion to a specific segment of the lung
$t$ Other pathology if you know your anatomy of the lateral CXR
t Assess cardiac enlargement (Left/right ventricle CXR)
t Hilar enlargement, thoracic spine etc.
t In a normal CXR there is increased trans-radiency as one goes down

\section*{KNOW YOUR ANATOMY}
t For proper interpretation of a CXR, a good knowledge of te anatomy of the lungs and mediastinum is essential.

\section*{LUNGS}
t Compare one hemithorax to the other:
t Size
t Translucency
t Vascular markings
t Superior mediastinum
t Anterior mediastinum
t Middle mediastinum

\section*{IERMINOLOGY USED IN IH EINTERPRETATION OF CXR}
t Acinar pattern
t Round or elliptical ill-defined 4-8 mm opacities in the lung
t Air bronchogram
t Air containing bronchus peripheral to the hilum surrounded by an airless lung
t Reticular pattern
t A collection of innumerable small linear opacities that together produe an appearance resembling a net. The pattern can be fine, medium and coarse
t Reticulo-nodular
t Miliary pattern
t Tiny discrete $\mathbf{2 m m}$ or less, uniform opacities
t Silhouette sign
$t$ The effacement of anatomic soft tissue borders within the thorax or by a process of equal similar density in contiguous lung or pleural e.g. pneumonia in medial segment of the right middle lobe will silhouette the riaht heart border. lingula the left heart
