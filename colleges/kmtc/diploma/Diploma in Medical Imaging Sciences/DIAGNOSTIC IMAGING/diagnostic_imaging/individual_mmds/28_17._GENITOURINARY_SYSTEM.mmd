\title{
GENITOURINARY SYSTEM
}

BY: DR. MANGO
DATE: 27 ${ }^{\text {TH }} / \mathrm{APRIL} / 2017$

\section*{SCOPE}
- Methods of imaging
- Urinary system
- Male and female genital system
- Indications
- Advantages
- Disadvantages
- Imaging pathology

\section*{METHODS}
${ }^{-}$Plain films (Kidney Ureter \& Bladder, KUB)
- Ultrasound
${ }^{-}$Intravenous urogram (pyelogram) $\square$ IVU, IVP; excretion urography
- Micturating cystogram or cystourethrogram (MCUG)
- Cystogram done in a vesicovaginal fistula)
- Urethrogram (ascending urethrogram)
- Retrograde pyelogram $\square$ for imaging the ureters
- Antegrade pyelogram
${ }^{\bullet}$ Radionuclide studies: static and dynamic scans
- Computed tomography
- Magnetic resonance imaging
- Angiography

\section*{ULTRASOUND}
${ }^{-}$Investigation of choice in children (we want to limit radiation)
${ }^{-}$NB: in neonates there is a very distinctive cortico - medullary differentiation
${ }^{-}$In adults, depending on indication ultrasound or IVU/CT pyelogram may be considered
${ }^{\bullet}$ Cortex is hypoechoic compared to the adjacent liver

\section*{INDICATIONS}
- Assess kidneys in suspected renal pathology:
- Location
- Size
- Echotexture: increased echogenicity e.g. in parenchymal diseases
- Masses
- Cysts
- Hydronephrosis
- Calcifications
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Doppler U/S: Vacularity of the kidney, up to the level of arcuate vessels renal masses or suspected vascular lesions

\section*{CONT.}
- Resistive index of renal arteries in suspected renal artery stenosis
${ }^{\bullet}$ U/S guided procedures e.g. percutaneous kidney biopsies, drainage catheter placement
- Assess renal transplants: size, structure, vascularity, fluid collections
- Obstructive uropathy: level obstruction \& sometimes the cause of the obstruction
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Bladder outline, bladder volume, residual volume
${ }^{-}$Assess the surrounding structures in the retro - peritoneum/ extra peritoneum for fluid collections, masses
- U/S lithotripsy

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF U/S}
- Cheap and readily available
- Safe: no danger of contrast reactions, can still assess kidneys in renal failure
- No radiation
- Can be used in point of care or emergency settings

\section*{DISADVANTAGES}
- Ureters cannot be seen unless dilated
- Calyceal detail cannot be seen which is necessary for assessment of chronic pyelonephritis, papillary necrosis and TB (Use IVU)
- Uroendothelial (transitional cell) tumors of the renal pelvis/ calyces are not visualized until large (do IVU or CT pyleogram)

\section*{ACUTE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS}
- Larger kidney
- Hyperechoic
- Interefered corticomedullary differentiations

\section*{HYDRONEPHROSIS}
- Grossly dilated pericalyceal system
- Thinned out renal parenchyma

\section*{RCC}
- Focal hyperechoic lesion within renal parenchyma
