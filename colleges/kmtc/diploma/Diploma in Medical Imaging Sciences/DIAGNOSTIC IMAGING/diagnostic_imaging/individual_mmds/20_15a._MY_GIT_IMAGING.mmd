\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- Describe the modalities available for GIT imaging
- Indications er contraindications and patient preparation for each modality
- Limitations of the described imaging modalities
- Examples of pathological processes demonstrated in each modality
- Bring our a decision making protocol for imaging in acute abdomen setting

\section*{ANATOMICAL DIVISIONS}
- Fore gut: Oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, part of duodenum
- Mid gut: Part of duodenum, small bowel (jejunum, duodenum), part of large bowel
- Hind gut: Mid - transverse, descending, sigmoid colon
- Accessory structures

\section*{GIT PATHOLOGY}
- Congenital anomalies
- Inflammation
- Obstruction
- Neoplasia
- Trauma
- Motility disorders
- Vascular
- metabolic

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- There are pathological conditions that one cannot see on imaging despite their presence due to:
- Wrong imaging modality/technique
- Disease is only microscopic and has not induced any visible anatomical change unless the imaging method is functional

\section*{MODES OF GIT IMAGING}
- Plain radiography
- Contrast radiography
- Ultrasound
- CT scan
- MRI scan
- Radionuclide imaging (Nuclear medicine)

- Angiography

\section*{PLAIN RADIOGRAPHY}
- They are frequently still the $1^{\text {st }}$ investigation in the acute abdomen
- For non - acute situations, the relatively small yield of information from a plain radiograph does not justify the radiation dose that it entails, unless it is on follow up basis
- Plain radiographic findings must corroborate with clinical findings: sometimes even obvious signs can be non - specific generating a plethora of differential diagnoses. A good example is the presence of air - fluid levels which may be benign or a pointer to intestinal obstruction
- NOTE: normal air fluid levels:

\section*{PLAIN RADIOGRAPHY PROJECTIONS}
- Supine AP projection
- Patient lies supine with the source of $X$ rays from above
- Dorsal decubitus positioning
- Patient lies supine with the source of $X$ rays from the side
- Allows visualization of air - fluid levels
- Left-lateral decubitus positioning
- Patient lies on the left side with the source of $X$ rays from the side.
- If patient lies on the right, the stomach will be on the fighter plane bringing about confusion about whether or not there is an air - fluid level

\section*{THE DENSITIES}
- Air: $\square$ very dark $\square$
- Fat:
- Soft tissues (including water): light grev (1)
- Calcified structures: white $\square$

\section*{ABDOMINAL X - RAY: SYSTEMIC APPROACH}
- Check the patient details
- Assess quality (including presence of artefacts)
- Bowel gas
- Soft tissues
- Bones
- Abnormal calcifications

\section*{AXR: AIR DISTRIBUTION (INTRALUMINAL)}
- Normal
- Gastric bubble (erect film)
- Large bowel
- Very minimal or non - detectable in small bowel
- Checkfor abnormalities
- Size
- Distribution:
- Peripheral, taenia coli markings that do not go the entire circumference $\square$ Large bowel
- Central, valvulae conniventes throughout the circumference [ small bowel

\section*{AXR: AIR DISTRIBUTION (EXTRALUMINAL)}
- Always abnormal
- Key areas to look at
- Su6 - diaphragmatic (erect film)
- Bowel wall
- Liver (from the portal system or the bile duct)

\section*{VARIOUS ABDOMINAL CONDITIONS}
- Paralytic ileus
- Sigmoid volvulus
- Meteorism: dilatation of the bowel tending towards a hexagonal shape (aerophagy)

\section*{CONT.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline FEAIVURE & SOMLE BOWEL OBSTRYICITON & CARGE BOWEL OBSTRRICITON \\
\hline BOWEL DIAMEIER & >3AND <5 & >5 \\
\hline POSITION OF LOOPS & CENIRAL & PERIPHERAL \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{PNEUMOPERITONEUM (20 TO PERFORATED GUT)}
- Air under the diaphragm
- Rigler's sign: double wall sign (too beautiful to be true)

\section*{PNEUMATOSIS INTESTINALIS}
- Air within the intestinal wall

AIR SHALL ONLY BE XEPT IN TYE BOWEL FORIT TO BE CONSIDEREED NORMAL AND IN THE RIGHET PROPORTIONS

\section*{GIT CONTRAST RADIOGRAPHY}

\title{
GIT CONTRAST RADIOGRAPHYMODALITIES
}
- Sialography: study of salivary glands using positive contrast
- Ba. Swallow: used to study the esophagus
- Ba. Meal: used to study the esophagus, stomach and duodenum
- Ba. Meal follow through: used to study the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum or ileum
- Small bowel enema (enterochysis): place tube at the duodeno - jejunal junction and introducing the fluid into the small bowel

\section*{CONT.}
- Barium enemas introducing fluid in retrograde function into the large bowel
- Fistulography: introducing contrast into the fistula. Sinography: int
- Fistula vs. sinus: Sinus is blind - ending while a fistula is connecting to epithelial surfaces
- Sinogram
- Colostography: studying the colostomy using contrast

\section*{SIALOGRAPHY}
- Cannulation of major salivary ducts
- Water soluble contrast media is used
- Demonstrates luminal anatomy and pathology

\section*{BARIUM SWALLOW INDICATIONS}
- Dysphagia
- Odynophagia
- Hematemesis
- Assessment of trachea - esophageal fistula (where lain films not diagnostic)
- Follow up of following esophageal surgery
- N(B: in assessment of perforation, water soluble contrast is used

\section*{NORMAL FINDINGS}
- Physiological constrictions may be seen
- Cricopharyngeus muscle: at the start of the esophagus
- Aortic arch
- Left main bronchus
- Left atrium
- Gastro - esophageal junction

\section*{ABNORMAL FINDINGS}
- Achalasia (seen on single contrast)
- Esophageal webs (seen on double contrast)
- Esophageal candidiasis (seen on double contrast)
- Multiple small ulcers will appear mottled
- Hiatal hernia (seen on double contrast)
- Know the types***
- Esophageal carcinoma (double contrast): irregular strictures
- Esphageal varices (double contrast): serpiginous contrast

\section*{BARIUM MEAL}
- Double contrast examination of choice in adults. Single contrast in children and ill
- Indications
- Dyspepsia
- Weight loss
- Follow up after surgery
- Suspected GI bleeding or unexplained iron deficiency

\section*{CONTRAINDICATIONS}
- Complete large bowel obstruction
- Suspected perforation (50\% mortality if barium leaks into the peritoneum)
- Investigation of choice in suspected perforation: plain radiography

\section*{CONT.}
- Stomach ulcer on barium meal: barium meals pools within the crater of the ulcer with the mucosal folds radiating towards the crater
- Barium meal has some sensitivity in demonstrating stomach ulcers (not as high as endoscopy)
- Duodenal ulcer (pooling)

\section*{BARIUM MEAL FOLLOW THROUGH}
- Indications
- Pain
- Suspecting chronic malabsorption
- Reason to think of malignancy
- Bleeding
- Partial obstruction
- Contraindications

\section*{CONT.}
- Ascariasis: filling defects within the small bowel outlined by the barium

\section*{SMALL BOWEL ENEMA (ENTEROCLYSISI)}
- Better visualization of small bowel than that achieved by barium meal follow through
- disadvantage unpleasant to the patient due to intubation and time consuming to the radiologist
- Indication: same as for barium meal follow through

\section*{BARIUM ENEMA}
- Examination of large bowel
- Currently getting replaced by CT colonography
- 2 methods:
- Double contrast: examination of choice to demonstrate mucosal pattern
- Single contrast: used in children since. To reduce an intussusception
- Contrast introduced per rectal
- Change in bowel habits
- Unexplained abdominal pain
- Melena
- Onstruction e.g. intusussception
