                        <div class="section-header">

                            <h2 class="section-title">Packed Red Blood Cells: Indications</h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>So we know that when we give packed red blood cells, what are the basic indications? Well, if a patient has, let's say, <strong>blood loss</strong>. So they exhibit some type of blood loss. So a patient who experiences some type of blood loss to the point where it drops their blood pressure enough, this could be defined as shock, right? Especially if you're not providing oxygen to the tissues.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Hemorrhagic Shock</h3>
                            <p>And so in patients who experience what's called <strong>hemorrhagic shock</strong> due to massive blood loss... what is this? So if there's massive, massive blood loss you're going to be losing red blood cells and you're going to be losing blood volume, whole blood. And so in these scenarios the patient could become severely hypotensive.</p>

                            <p>When a patient experiences hemorrhagic shock, hypotension and anemia, it's really, really crucial for you to give them back what they're losing. So a patient is losing blood plasma, platelets and what else? Packed red blood cells. So in hemorrhagic shock, what you would want to do is you'd actually want to give a patient what's called a <strong>massive transfusion protocol</strong>. So you'd want to do what's called a massive transfusion.</p>

                            <aside class="callout callout--warning" role="note">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">🩸</span>
                                    <span class="callout-title">Massive Transfusion Protocol</span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>And what a massive transfusion is, is that you give them a proper ratio of all whole blood products.</p>
                                    <p>So I'm going to give them <strong>red blood cells</strong>, I'm going to give them packed red blood cells, right? I'm going to give them <strong>platelets</strong> and I'm going to give them <strong>FFP</strong> because if you remember, these were the three primary components that make up whole blood.</p>
                                    <p>So if I give a one unit of packed red blood cells, for one unit of platelets, for every one unit of FFP, I will be giving the patient back whole blood.</p>
                                    <p>That is the particular potential indication. So one of the reasons why we would give packed red blood cells is if a patient is experiencing hemorrhagic shock. So in other words, it's a combination of <strong>anemia and severe hypotension</strong> that's causing multisystem organ dysfunction or organ failure.</p>
                                </div>
                            </aside>
                            
                            <p>Give them one unit of packed red blood cells, and with every one unit of that you give them platelets and for every one unit of that you give them FFP. And you give them this massive transfusion until you can get them hemodynamically stable enough to get them to the OR or obtain source control of the bleeding. So that's the goal. Massive transfusion is usually a bridge to having source control, stopping or plugging the hole where the patient's bleeding from.</p>

                            <h3>Anemia</h3>
                            <p>Another one is let's say that a patient... they're losing blood or they're hemolyzing or they're experiencing <strong>anemia</strong>. So they have a decrease in the number of red blood cells, right? But the decrease is not so much because of blood loss, it's because they have other chronic diseases. The problem with having less red blood cells is this leads to less oxygen delivery to the tissues. So there will be a <strong>decrease in oxygen delivery</strong>. And if you don't deliver enough oxygen to a tissue, what could the tissue start to experience? Ischemia, right? So you could start to experience <strong>tissue ischemia</strong>.</p>

                            <p>And this can look a couple different ways when it comes to anemia. So when a patient has anemia, it's important to realize that if they have less red blood cells, they have less oxygen delivery. When patients have less oxygen delivery and they experience tissue ischemia, you don't want that to happen. So how do you prevent that? You give them packed red blood cells.</p>

                            <p>So my goal here is to give things that are going to increase the oxygen delivery, which is packed red blood cells. So, if a patient has, let's say, a <strong>hemoglobin of less than 7</strong>. That would be an indication to give packed red blood cells.</p>

                            <p>If they have a <strong>hemoglobin less than 8 AND CAD, CHF</strong>... some type of disease that puts them at high risk... where in other words, in CAD, maybe they have coronary artery disease, the supply to their coronary tissue is actually reduced. If you cause them to develop anemia, their oxygen delivery reduces even more. CHF, their cardiac output drops. They can't deliver as much oxygen to the tissues. So for these patients we may need to push their hemoglobin up a little bit higher.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Hemoglobin < 7</strong>: If completely asymptomatic or have no problems.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Hemoglobin < 8</strong>: If they have CAD, CHF, or getting cardiac surgery.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>And then in these scenarios, we would say that we will... if a patient has anemia... you will <strong>transfuse at these hemoglobin thresholds</strong>. So you'll transfuse based on hemoglobin.</p>

                    <!-- Platelets Indications -->
                    <section id="platelet-indications" class="content-section">
                        <div class="section-header">

                            <h2 class="section-title">Platelet Indications</h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>So we give packed red blood cells when our red blood cells are low or when the patient is hemorrhaging and they're losing whole blood. We give platelets when the patient is <strong>hemorrhaging or losing blood</strong>. Because when you lose blood again, what do you lose? You lose red blood cells, you lose platelets, and you'll even lose plasma.</p>

                            <p>So if a patient again experiences <strong>massive blood loss</strong>... what's going to happen? In that massive blood loss, they'll experience <strong>hemorrhagic shock</strong>... and when we have this massive blood loss that leads to hemorrhagic shock... what do we want to do? I want to give platelets because when you lose blood, you lose whole blood. You want to give whole blood back. Let's remind ourself, what do we give in hemorrhagic shock? We prefer to give the <strong>massive transfusion protocol ratio</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>And can you guys remind yourself of what it is? It is <strong>one unit of packed RBCs for every one unit of platelets for every one unit of FFP</strong>. And again, when you give this, you're giving it until you stabilize their hemodynamics. You may allow for a little bit of permissive hypotension, but enough blood pressure that you're keeping them organ perfused and then get them to the OR or get that bleed to be stopped.</p>

                            <h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3>
                            <p>Another one is... what if I have a patient who has a decrease in their platelets? So if I have a decrease in my number of platelets, what is that referred to as? For platelets, we call this <strong>thrombocytopenia</strong>. Now the problem with thrombocytopenia is that with a patient who experiences thrombocytopenia, if they don't have platelets, you know what platelets are supposed to do? They're supposed to come here and stick and actually cause a platelet plug. So they're supposed to cause a platelet plug and initiate a clot. But if I don't have enough platelets, will I be able to initiate this platelet plug? No.</p>

                            <p>So what will the patient start to experience as a result? The patient will experience as a result here <strong>bleeding</strong>... due to the thrombocytopenia. So you want to be a little bit more cautious for these patients and you don't want them to develop bleeding. So we actually transfuse patients with platelets based upon what? Their platelet number.</p>

                                            </tr>
                                            <tr>

                            </div>

                            <p>So for example if a patient comes in with a platelet count of 8,000 but they have no symptoms, no problems whatsoever, I want to get that platelet count above 10,000 so I prevent them from developing bleeding in the future. So in this scenario, it's more of a <strong>prophylactic process</strong>. You're trying to prevent bleeding occurring.</p>

                            <p>We give FFP... it's containing all the clotting factors. Let's say a patient has <strong>cirrhosis</strong>. In cirrhosis, what happens to their liver? Becomes fibrotic, right? And so we'll just represent this with these red Xs here. It becomes damaged. And so with fibrosis, you can compress portal vasculature and lead to a lot of portal hypertension, but you can also lose a lot of the normal functioning hepatocytes. What are hepatocytes supposed to make? Clotting proteins. So if a patient has cirrhosis, what can happen to the number of clotting proteins that they produce? It can decrease. So they can have a <strong>decrease in clotting proteins</strong>. And this could be almost <strong>ALL</strong> of the clotting proteins. So multiple clotting proteins.</p>

                            <h3>Coagulopathies</h3>
                            <p>Patient has <strong>DIC</strong>... Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. What happens here? They get all these microthrombi, right? And when you get microthrombi, what are you doing there? You're getting clots. What do you need in order to make clots? Coagulation proteins. So this one, there's a decrease production that leads to decreased clotting proteins. This one, there's an <strong>increase consumption</strong> of clotting proteins. So this one is due to consumption of clotting proteins and this one is due to a production problem. Either way, you're left with very little of these.</p>

                            <p>So when we give FFP, we're giving it for <strong>coagulopathies</strong>. So we give it for a <strong>coagulopathy</strong>. So when we have a coagulopathy, we give it based upon what? The type of particular factors that are occurring at hand. So usually this may present with... so you basically transfuse based on <strong>INR</strong> or <strong>bleeding</strong>. But INR is definitely one area that we can follow.</p>

                            <p>So for this example, if I have a patient who has let's say again DIC, liver disease or a warfarin related coagulopathy. So if they have <strong>cirrhosis</strong>... if they have <strong>DIC</strong>... or a <strong>warfarin</strong> or Coumadin is another term... warfarin <strong>coagulopathy</strong>... you will administer <strong>FFP</strong>.</p>

                            <p>When you give them FFP, the big thing to follow here is you want to follow a particular parameter. So I'll give FFP, and the amount of FFP I give is to get the INR to at least somewhat of a normal number. And so we will kind of aim for... our goal is to obtain an INR... and this is not always the case for every single patient but I want to get it <strong>less than 1.6</strong>. That's ideal.</p>

                                    <p>Warfarin coagulopathies... this is not the primary drug that we would actually give FFP. We actually like to give <strong>PCC</strong>, four factor PCC actually as more of a preferential situation in patients who have warfarin induced coagulopathy.</p>
                                    <p>If a patient is taking another anticoagulant, which we're going to call these <strong>DOACs</strong>... this could be for an example here, let's say that I mention something like <strong>Apixaban</strong> or <strong>Rivaroxaban</strong>. These are common anticoagulants... these are your Factor 10a inhibitors. So what are they going to decrease the production of my friends? Come on think about it. You'll decrease the production of <strong>Factor 10</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>If a patient is having a warfarin related coagulopathy, I would give <strong>Vitamin K AND Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC)</strong>. That's what I would give. If a patient is due to a <strong>DOAC</strong>, I would give just the <strong>four factor PCC</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>OR there is another drug... there actually is a reversal agent for DOACs. And it's called <strong>Andexanet alfa</strong>. Problem is this thing's expensive as crap. And we found no difference between Andexanet alfa and PCC. So guess which one we're going to give? We're going to give PCC.</p>
                                </div>
                            </aside>

                            <p>So again, remember that FFP is less effective for warfarin coagulopathies or any kind of anticoagulant reversal as compared to PCC. But for cirrhosis, DIC and there is other scenarios... if a patient is having active bleeding or they're having some type of procedure that they're going to be getting done, and their INR is greater than 1.6 and it's not due to these reasons, you could also give FFP.</p>

                            <p>So if you wanted to also remember here, just consider if an <strong>INR greater than 1.6 PLUS bleeding OR pre-procedure</strong>... then I would also give that patient <strong>FFP</strong>.</p>

                    <!-- Cryoprecipitate Indications -->
                    <section id="cryo-indications" class="content-section">
                        <div class="section-header">

                            <h2 class="section-title">Cryoprecipitate Indications</h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The last blood product that I want to talk about is called Cryoprecipitate. So Cryoprecipitate, I... I'm a huge fan of this drug, you know and working in an ICU, we experience patients who have massive bleeding. And often times I'll see patients who exhibit hypofibrinogenemia. And that's one of the best scenarios where I've seen this. And so you got to think about this. Cryoprecipitate is really rich in <strong>fibrinogen</strong>.</p>

                            <p>So let's say that a patient is experiencing an obstetrical complication. And they are just losing tons of blood. What kind of scenarios would cause lots of obstetrical bleeding do you guys know? This could be seen in things like <strong>postpartum hemorrhage</strong>. I'd say you can see it in like a <strong>ruptured ectopic pregnancy</strong>. But this can cause patients to kind of definitely lose a lot of blood.</p>

                            <p>And whenever there's lots of this bleeding, the problem here is with these two kinds of conditions, the patient lose blood but they really like... they consume... because they're trying to stop this bleeding process, they end up with a lot of fibrinogen depletion. And so what happens is their <strong>fibrinogen</strong> levels get pretty, pretty low. We call this <strong>hypofibrinogenemia</strong>. And so you end up with a high risk of a <strong>coagulopathy</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Another one is <strong>DIC</strong>. So in DIC, the patients are consuming so many of their clotting proteins. Right? So there's widespread systemic microthrombi. And in order to make these thrombi guess what you consume? Fibrinogen. As well as other clotting proteins. And so because of that they end up with a <strong>very low fibrinogen level</strong>.</p>

                            <p>And the last one is <strong>massive bleeding</strong>. So if a patient experiences massive bleeding... you think about this. In massive bleeding you're losing whole blood. So you're losing red blood cells, you're losing platelets, and you're losing clotting proteins. And guess what these clotting proteins include? Fibrinogen.</p>
                            
                            <p>So in this potential scenario... either having an increased loss of fibrinogen... or in the scenario of massive bleeding... or having an increased consumption of fibrinogen... either way this is leading to low fibrinogen in the blood. Hypofibrinogenemia. Which precipitates a coagulopathy.</p>

                            <p>In this scenario, you want to know at what point is this coagulopathy going to occur. And it's usually occurring when the <strong>fibrinogen level</strong>... so it's actually, we'll say that this... we transfuse based upon the fibrinogen level. So <strong>transfuse based on fibrinogen level</strong>.</p>

                            <p>And what is this trigger per se to give fibrinogen? Well, if a patient has a <strong>fibrinogen level</strong>... and this varies a lot in different literature, but I'd say a good range per se... I like to always go with <strong>less than 150</strong>, but some are a little bit more, you know, strict and they'll go to less than 100. So anywhere from <strong>less than 100 to 150</strong>... for this type of concentration of the fibrinogen, if it's less than that, you'll give Cryoprecipitate. In that scenario, you will <strong>administer Cryoprecipitate</strong>.</p>

                            <p>So if a patient is experiencing a coagulopathy, so they're bleeding... DIC, postpartum hemorrhage, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, massive bleeding and their <strong>fibrinogen level is less than 100 to 150 PLUS bleeding</strong>... then you're going to <strong>administer Cryoprecipitate</strong>.</p>

                            <p>What's your goal? At what point do you say I don't need to give any more Cryoprecipitate? Because again, you have to remember, Cryoprecipitate is super, super, super rich in fibrinogen. My goal is to get the fibrinogen <strong>greater than 150</strong> and I should be good. And I don't need to give anymore. So I'm aiming... so I want to <strong>obtain a fibrinogen greater than 150</strong>.</p>

But in patients who have emergent indications or there's no available concentrated factor, we can give <strong>Cryoprecipitate</strong> as a second line therapy in patients who have von Willebrand's disease or they have Hemophilia A.</p>
