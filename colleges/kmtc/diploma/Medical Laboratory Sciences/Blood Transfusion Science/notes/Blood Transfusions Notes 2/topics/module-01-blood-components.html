                    <section id="whole-blood" class="content-section">
                        <div class="section-header">

                            <p>All right my friends, so now we're going to talk about types of blood products. So let's say we have a patient, we want to give them particular types of blood products. We should know what those are. And I think it's important to kind of just have a basic understanding of how we kind of take whole blood and divvy that out into the different types of blood products.</p>

                            <p>So for example, let's say here I have a patient who has <strong>whole blood</strong>. And you know, you're drawing blood from a patient. When you draw that blood from the patient, let's say that I go and I separate out this whole blood into different components. So here is my whole blood.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>Now, within this whole blood, what do I have? Well, I have a red cell layer. I can have some plasma. And then I usually have like a buffy coat layer as well, which contains platelets and white blood cells. But the white blood cells we're not going to really talk about. We're going to talk about three particular components here, which is:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Red blood cells</strong></span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Plasma</strong></span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Platelets</strong></span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Now, there's certain indications of why we would give some of these particular things, which we'll talk about. But I think it's better for us to have an understanding of what are these different types of blood products, what are their components.</p>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Packed Red Blood Cells -->
                    <section id="prbc" class="content-section">
                        <div class="section-header">
                            <div class="section-number">03</div>
                            <h2 class="section-title">Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)</h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>So let's say that I take this blood and I separate it out. And I separate into two components. And the two components that I separated into is the red cell layer, and the plasma and platelet layer.</p>

                            <p>So this, we're going to call this our red blood cells. But we actually like to call this <strong>packed red blood cells</strong>. So this is our packed red blood cells. We call this our packed RBCs, or PRBCs.</p>

                            <p>Now, with packed red blood cells, what you're doing is you're taking whole blood and you're separating it out. And generally you should separate into packed red blood cells, and platelet and plasma. But it's not always perfect. And sometimes, sometimes in this packed red cells, it's about a <strong>300 milliliter bag</strong>. It's going to contain primarily red blood cells. Lots of them. But it will contain a tiny, tiny bit of plasma. So there's going to be a lot of red cells, that's the primary component, but there will be a small, little bit of plasma that will contain some proteins, it'll contain some white cells and things like that.</p>

                            <aside class="callout callout--tip" role="note">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">⭐</span>
                                    <span class="callout-title">High Yield Fact</span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Now packed red blood cells, when we give this, we usually give it in a unit formation. And there's a really important high yield fact here.</p>
                                    <p>This high yield fact is that when we give one unit of packed red blood cells... what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to give them red blood cells. So this would be good in patients who have some type of underlying anemia where they're having a decrease in the number of red blood cells, or they're in hemorrhagic shock so they're hypotensive because they're losing blood.</p>
                                    <p><strong>For every one unit of packed red blood cells I give, it will actually increase the patient's serum hemoglobin by 1 gram per dL.</strong></p>
                                    <p>So it should <strong>increase the hemoglobin by 1 gram per deciliter</strong>.</p>
                                </div>
                            </aside>

                            <p>And there's a really important component of this. So if a patient has anemia, and their hemoglobin is 5, and you want to get it to 7, you may have to give them <strong>two units</strong> of packed red blood cells. Okay? Really important point here and we'll talk about it a little bit more when we get into the indications section. But that is something I want you to remember.</p>
