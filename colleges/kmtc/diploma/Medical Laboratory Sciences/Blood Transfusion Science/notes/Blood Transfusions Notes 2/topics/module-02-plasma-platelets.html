                            <p>We separated this out into packed red blood cells. The other component here is you're going to have <strong>platelet rich plasma</strong>. So this is going to be, we can call this platelet rich plasma. But we don't often give this. And so what we're going to want to do here is, is we're going to want to separate out the platelet rich plasma into its two components.</p>

                            <p>So when you do that, you'll separate out the platelets into a concentrate, and the plasma into its own component here. So here I'm going to have platelet rich concentrate, and here I'm going to have plasma. But oftentimes, we'll do a little bit of a freezing. So oftentimes we'll freeze that plasma. And we'll end up with what's called <strong>fresh frozen plasma</strong>. Also abbreviated <strong>FFP</strong>.</p>

                            <p>FFP... it contains plasma. Let's talk a little bit more about what this plasma is per se. So it contains a bunch of different types of proteins that are relevant here. One is it contains a little bit of <strong>fibrinogen</strong>. It contains some <strong>von Willebrand factor</strong>. And here is the key thing. And I'm going to actually write this in red here. It contains <strong>ALL clotting factors</strong>.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>

                            </ul>

                            <p>So all the clotting factors you can possibly think of that are in our plasma is present in the FFP. Factors 2, 7, 9, 10, 1, 3, etc. The list goes on. <strong>All of those clotting factors are in FFP.</strong></p>
                            
                            <p>Now, FFP is usually in a frozen bag. It's about <strong>200 to 300 milliliters</strong>. Now when we give Fresh Frozen Plasma, we're giving it to patients who maybe have a deficiency in fibrinogen or von Willebrand's factor. But more specifically, we're giving it to patients who have some type of coagulopathy.</p>

                            <p>And then over here, we're going to have our platelet rich concentrate. So here we're going to have our <strong>platelets</strong>.</p>

                            <p>For the platelets, when you look at this one, it contains a little bit of plasma. It's almost impossible to not completely separate out all the plasma. But it will contain primarily platelets, and it'll contain a teency teency little bit of plasma.</p>

                            <p>Now, with a platelet transfusion, when you give platelets, every <strong>one unit</strong>... so every single donor unit that you give, could theoretically increase the platelet count by anywhere from <strong>20,000 to 60,000 units</strong>. That's a pretty broad range. And it's not always steadfast.</p>

                            <p>So remember, <strong>one unit of platelets</strong>... of a single donor type... may increase the <strong>platelets by approximately 20k to 60k</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Let's take the Fresh Frozen Plasma and do a little bit more to it though. Because we got all these clotting factors. Maybe I can fractionate it a little bit. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to fractionate out the Fresh Frozen Plasma. One of the things that I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of fractionate it as I said, so I'll <strong>fractionate the clotting factors</strong>... the proteins that are present in the Fresh Frozen Plasma. And the other thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to <strong>de-thaw</strong>. So I'm going to unfreeze the Fresh Frozen Plasma.</p>

                            <p>What happens in these two processes when you fractionate out the proteins or you de-thaw is you get two new products.</p>

                            <p>So we're going to thaw the FFP. So when I thaw out the FFP what happens is some of the proteins in the FFP precipitates out of solution. So it precipitates out of solution. So what I'm going to do is... those proteins that precipitate out of solution, I'm going to put that in one bag and then I'm going to pull or decant all of the other stuff that didn't precipitate. The stuff that precipitates is going to be called <strong>Cryoprecipitate</strong>. Kind of a cool name here.</p>

                            <p>Now Cryoprecipitate is a great kind of blood product. When you cause this thing to precipitate out of solution, it only contains certain proteins that do precipitate. And guess what it is? <strong>Fibrinogen</strong>, <strong>von Willebrand factor</strong>, and only a couple, like two clotting factors. And so what you're left with here is you're left with a very high concentration of:</p>
