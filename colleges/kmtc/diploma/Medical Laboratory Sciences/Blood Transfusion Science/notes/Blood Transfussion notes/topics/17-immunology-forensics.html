                            <p>It's the study of immunoglobins which are responsible for the body's defence mechanism.<br>
                            An antigen must be introduced to a host in a relevant route for it to cause any immunological response i.e. formation of antibodies. The host must be lacking that antigen i.e. the antigen should be self. When an antigen enters the host, there are various functions which occur e.g. the antigen is modified in some way by the host macrophages hence referred to as non-specific reactions. The second stage is more specific in that the host produces antibodies against that antigen. The production of immunoglobulins is conjured on two classes of cells being the T - cells and B - cells.<br>
                            T cells are responsible for cellular immunity. B - cells are responsible for Humoral immunity. These cells manifest what is called Immunological memory.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-t-b-cells">T - CELLS AND B - CELLS:</h3>
                            <p>Depending on the type of antigen involved, the antigenic material stimulate a response in either the cellular or the Humoral immune system. On some occasions both systems are involved. The cells which get involved in one of the two types of immune response, begins life as undifferentiated stem cell in the bone marrow. The classic work on chicken showed that primitive cells programmed by Thymus developed into T - cells and manifest cellular immunity while cells programmed by an organ known as BURSA OF FABRICUS develop into Bcells and produce antibodies as part of humoral response. The bursa equivalent in man is not clear. Is no discrete organ in man that functions like Bursa of fabricus in chicken. But there is evidence that cells located in the gut perform this function as the bursal equivalent. There often is referred to as gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).<br>
                            B - cells develops free of thymus and also T- cells. Following there formation in the bone marrow, cells which has been involved in one of the immune mechanism develops through the lymphoid cells series and eventually reach the small lymphocyte stage, when lymphocyte reach the above stage (small lymphocyte) they are uncommitted.<br>
                            The lymphocytes becomes committed when instructed by the thymus or the Bursa dependant systems. Following the instruction, the cells proceed to a blast cell stage and are now known as committed immune blast. The committed immune blast in thymic dependant system develops into cells that are called committed effector cells or immunocytes or activated T - cells at this stage the T - cells at this stage the T - cells morphological resemble the small lymphocyte stage and migrate to the small lymphocyte stage and migrate to the lymphoid tissue, committed immunoblasts which develop through the instruction of the Bursa of fabricus develops into cells called plasma cell or immunocytes or Activated B - cells.</p>

                            <p>Production of antibodies is part of natural defence mechanism of the body.<br>
                            The antibodies produced help in fighting bacteria and some viruses that enables an individual to repel infection. Indeed, some viruses are deliberately injected in those individuals e.g. in vaccination and these viruses stimulate the immune mechanism to produce antibodies against these viruses.<br>
                            It is the same concept of immunization whereby non-harmful form of bacteria are injected or given by whatever form so that the immune system of the body will later on produce antibodies against such bacteria when a person is incapable of producing antibodies to fight the infections, then antibodies can be passively given. Passive immunization is usually short lived.<br>
                            There are some abnormalities in which individuals cannot produce antibodies to fight whichever infection present.<br>

                            Immunoglobulin molecules are composed of one or more basic structural units that are common to all classes of immunoglobulins. The basic structure unit is composed of 4 polypeptide chains i.e. there are two identical Heavy chains (H) and 2 identical light (L) chains.<br>
                            Each heavy chain (H) and adjacent light chains interact through non-covalent interaction called disulphide bond. The 2 light chains and the heavy chain pairs are linked by non-covalent forces (interaction) and one or more disulphide bonds.</p>

                            <p>If an 1 gG molecule is treated with an enzyme e.g. Papain, the molecule splits into 3 fragments, this will this will give rise to 2 identical fragments.<br>
                            The two identical fragments are capable of combining specifically with an antigen though cannot cause agglutination or precipitation (agglutination is visible ag - ab reaction - visualised).<br>
                            The two are called Fragment antigen binding (FAB) and each has a single binding site and each of these combining site has the ability to combine with an antigen. The F2b fragment, each is composed of one eight chain and $\frac{1}{2}$ the H-chain.<br>
                            The $3^{\text{rd}}$ fragment is termed as fragment crystallization (FC) which is composed of two $\frac{1}{2}$ H-chains. These FC fragment is termed has no ability to combine in an antigen. FC region is responsible for various biological functions of given immunoglobulins.<br>
                            Some of these functions are:<br>
                            (b) Complement activation<br>
                            (c) Placental transverse i.e. passage through placenta<br>
                            (d) Conveys the major antigenic determinants of the class.</p>

                            <h4 id="heading-constant-variable">CONSTANT AND VARIABLE REGION</h4>
                            <p>A unique feature of 1 gG chain is that the amino terminal, $\frac{1}{2}$ of each light chain and $\frac{1}{4}$ of each heavy chain, has amino acid sequence that demonstrate considerable variation in amino acid sequence from a molecule to molecule. This called variable region ( V - region). The variable region is concerned in antigen binding thus antibody specificity results from variation in the amino-acid sequence in the source of various differences in different blood groups and sub-groups. The amino acid sequence in remainder of heavy and light chains are identical in immunological molecule of a given class and sub-class, this is what we call the constant region (unshaded area).<br>
                            The constant region of a molecule demonstrates class and sub-class specificity, genetic polymorphism and various biological effector functions of the molecule.<br>
                            The two regions of the molecules are believed to be produced under separate genetic control.</p>

                            <p>A very large primary (1%) dose of antigen or Hapten may inhibit or suppress the formation of specific antibodies, such conditions formerly called antigenic paralysis but today known as immunological tolerance.<br>
                            Immunological tolerance does not occur if production of antibodies had been initiated earlier on. Due to the commonly encountered mode of infection whereby only a small antigen is produced by an invading microbe, the invading microbe initiates formation of antibodies hence immunological tolerance is in the natural infections diseases.</p>

                            <p>Forensic Science deals with problem of identify (Blood Serology).<br>
                            Blood groups help in this forensic science trying to identify the identity.<br>
                            Blood groups do not however show positive identity e.g. if:<br>
                            1) This man is the father of the child.<br>
                            2) This old stain originated from this person.</p>
                            
                            <p>But blood groups do show definite non-identity if;<br>
                            1) This man is not the definite father of this particular child.<br>
                            2) This blood cannot have originated from that person.</p>

                            <p>Blood grouping is applied in cases of doubtful paternity or maternity.</p>

                            <h4 id="heading-general-principle">General Principle;</h4>
                            <p>Blood group antigens are inherited according to Mendelian law. So in cases of doubtful paternity, two relevant rules of inheritance are used;<br>
                            1) A blood group gene cannot appear in a child unless present in one or the other or both the parents.<br>
                            2) If one parent is homozygous of a particular blood group gene, its product must appear in the old group of the child.<br>
                            (a) e.g. The assumed father and mother are both O and the child is A . The A gene which is the child must have been inherited from the other (real) father.<br>
                            A father of blood group O cannot pass A gene to the child, therefore the serological test excludes him from paternity.<br>
                            (b) In homozygous (co-dominant) e.g. Rh system Cc, all the children inherit the gene present.</p>
                            
                            <p>The exclusion of paternity due to differences in blood groups e.g. mother and father "O" and child.<br>
                            A is known as first order of exclusion.<br>
                            While exclusion due to homozygous e.g. father Cc and child is $\mathrm{c}^{-} \mathrm{c}^{-}$ is known as second order of exclusion. Exclusion of paternity by the second order of exclusion always must be supported by at least one other second order of exclusion e.g. dosage titration.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-dosage-titration">Dosage titration:</h3>
                            <p>Is a titration test which is done to show whether an individual is 2 homozygous or not for 2 particular antigen. Homozygous cells when reacted selected antisera gives a double reaction and a higher titration score than a heterozygous which gives single dose reaction.<br>
                            e.g. Cells Mn Mm<br>
                            antigen M ++ ++++</p>

                            <p>But there are other blood groups which can be used to increase the chances of proving non-paternity<br>
                            e.g. Kell Duffy Kid Lutheran<br>
                            <strong>NOTE:</strong><br>
                            Blood groups used must have reliable and stable antigens. E.g. ABO system is known to be entirely reliable because of its inheritance. The anomalies in ABO are rare and when they occur can be easily detected particularly by using "O" serum or Anti - AB.<br>
                            Secretor gene can be applied with confidence to the problems of paternity but only in the mating of the Sese and sese (shows the exclusion maternity cases). Blood group used in cases of mixing or kidnapping of babies in maternity.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-stains">Identification of stains and fragments from individuals;</h3>
                            <p>This is used in cases of assaults. The first and foremost in identification is<br>
                            (a) To prove that the blood is human blood before any other test is per formed.<br>
                            (b) In most cases the material to be identified are inadequate quantity and is al ways irreplaceable, hence the technique involved in identifying stains must be such that they require small amount of material for
                            their performance since the stained areas are not always visible and may be difficult to distinguish them from dirt.</p>

                            It has been replaced by KASTLEMEYER test and is referred to as highly sensitive and it's capable of detecting blood spots practude invisible to the eyes. If Kastermeyer test is negative, then there's no point of continuing with any other test.<br>
