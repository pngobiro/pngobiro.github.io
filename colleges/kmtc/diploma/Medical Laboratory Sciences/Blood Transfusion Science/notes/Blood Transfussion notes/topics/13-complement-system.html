                            <p>A term applied to a system of 25 to 30 serum and membrane proteins that act in a cascading manner similar to coagulation, fibrinolytic and kinin systems to produce numerous biologic effects. The participating proteins remain inactive until an event initiates the process, following which the product of one reaction becomes the catalyst for the next step. Each evolving enzyme or complex can act on multiple substrate molecules, creating the potential for tremendous amplification of an initially modest or localized event.</p>

                            <p>Takes place in two ways (pathways)<br>
                            (i) Classical pathway<br>
                            (ii) Alternate pathway OR Properdin pathway</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-classical">(i) CLASSICAL PATHWAY:</h3>
                            <p>Immune complexes consisting of IgM or IgG molecules when they combine with the antigen on the red cell surface activate classical pathway.<br>
                            IgM antibodies are more potent because of the pentavalent complex. For the classical pathway of complement activation to occur, an immunoglobulin must react with target antigen. Combination with antigens alters the configuration of the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin, rendering accessible an area in one of the heavy chain constant domains that interacts with the C 1 component of
                            complement. C1 can combine only with Ig molecules having an appropriate heavy-chain configuration. This configuration exists in the $\mu$ heavy chain and in the $\gamma$ chains in IgG subclasses 1, 2,3 and 4.<br>
                            The C 1 component of complement attaches to activation sites on the Fc portion of two or more Ig monomers. The pentameric IgM molecule provides an abundance of closely configured Fc monomers: hence, a single IgM molecule can initiate the complement cascade. For IgG antibodies to activate the sequence, two separate molecules must attach to antigen sites close together. Hence, complement activation by IgG antibodies depends not only on the concentration and avidity of the antibody, but also on the topography of antigen.<br>
                            Circulating C1 is a macromolecule consisting of three distinct proteins (C1q, C1r and C1s). When an antigen antibody reaction occurs, two or more chains of C 1 q attach to the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ domain of IgG or the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}} 3$ domain of the IgM. This causes a conformational change, resulting in activation of two C1r molecules into activated C1s (a strong serine esterase). The C1r, C1s and C1q complex is stabilised by $\mathrm{Ca}++$ ions. In the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}++$, the complex dissociates; hence, chelating agents often used in the laboratory such as citrate and oxalate anticoagulants prevent stabilization of the C 1 complex and subsequent activation of complement proteins.<br>
                            Activated C1s works on two substrates. C1s cleaves C4 into two fragments; a large fragment (C4b) and smaller fragment (C4a) that has modest anaphylatoxic activity. Most of the C4b generated is inactivated; however, some C4b binds to the cell surface and acts as a binding site for C2. C1s also cleaves the bound C2, releasing a fragment called C2b. The C2a fragment that remains bound to C4 forms an activated complex C4b2a, also known as C3 convertase. Each C3 convertase can cleave more than 200 native C3 molecules, splitting the molecule into two fragments. A small fragment (C3a) that has anaphylatoxic activity is released into the plasma; the larger fragment (C3b) attaches to proteins and sugars on the cell surface.<br>
                            The classical pathway and the alternative pathway are both means of generating a C3 convertase. Once C3 is cleaved, the same events occur in the two pathways.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-alternate">(ii) ALTERNATE PATHWAY</h3>
                            <p>Also referred to as Properdin pathway<br>
                            The alternate pathway allows complement activation in the absence of an antigen / antibody interaction. This pathway is a first-line antimicrobial defence for vertebrates and a mechanism whereby prevertebrates can enhance their inflammatory effectiveness.<br>
                            The alternative pathway is a surface-active phenomenon that can be triggered by such initiators as:</p>

                            <p>The alternative pathway of complement activation can also occur spontaneously in the plasma at a slow but steady rate (tick-over activation)<br>
                            Four proteins participate in the alternate pathway: factor B , factor D , Properdin (factor P ) and C3. Fluid-phase C3 undergoes continuous but low level spontaneous cleavage, resulting in C3i that is rapidly inactivated by fluid-phase control proteins. If C3i encounters factor B, a complex called C 3 iB is formed and additional interactions can occur. Factor D acts on bound factor B , generating a C3iBb complex capable of cleaving C3 into C3a and C3b. most of C3b generated in the fluid phase is inactivated; however if C3b binds to a foreign surface such as a bacterial cell wall, the activation of the complement cascade can be accelerated.<br>
                            When C3b binds to a cell surface, factor B is bound to give C3bB. Factor D can also react with this cell-bound substrate, releasing the small Ba fragment leaving cell-bound C 3 bBb . This complex will dissociate unless it is stabilised by Properdin, resulting in the complex C 3 bBbP . Like the C4b2a complex of the classical pathway, C3bBbP is capable of converting more C3 into C3b. In summary; both the classical pathway and alternative pathway result in C3b generation. The C3 convertase of the classical pathway is C4b2a, whereas the C3 convertases of the alternative pathway are C 3 iBb in the fluid in fluid phase and C 3 bBbP when cell bound.</p>

                                THE MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX (MAC)

                            <p>The final phase of activation is called membrane attack complex and can occur once C3b has been cleaved through either the classical or alternate pathway. C3 convertase cleaves C5 into two fragments; a small peptide (C5a) having potent anaphylatoxin activity and a larger fragment (C5b). The C5b fragment binds C6, C7, C8 and up to 14 monomers of C9, resulting in a lytic hole in the membrane. Small amounts of lysis can occur when C8 is bound; however, the binding of C9 facilitates cell lysis.</p>
                            
                            <p>The binding of C3b to a cell membrane is the pivotal stage of the pathway. The cell-bound C3b can proceed to activate the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5-C9) and cause cell lysis; or alternatively , inhibitors may stop the activation sequence, leaving the cell coated with C3b. facto I is an inhibitor that can cleave cell-bound C3b, leaving iC3b on the membrane. This can be further cleaved, leaving a small fragment called C3dg. These two subcomponents of C3 (C3b, iC3b) can facilitate phagocytosis by acting as opsonins.</p>

                            <p>Neutrophils and macrophages phagocytose any particle that protrudes from the surface of a cell or micro-organism with no regard to the nature of the material. Phagocytosis is more intense if the particle adheres firmly to the membrane of the phagocytic cell. To achieve adherence, phagocytic cells have various receptor molecules such as the Fc receptors for certain immunoglobulins and receptors for C3b. the enhancement of phagocytosis resulting from antibody or complement coating of cells is called opsonization.</p>

                            <p>Complement fragments C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins and they play an important role in acute inflammation. These anaphylatoxins bind to the receptors on mast cells and basophils, causing them to release histamine and other biologic response modifiers that can be associated with anaphylaxis. More frequently, anaphylatoxins affect vascular permeability, membrane adhesion properties, and smooth muscle contraction that constitute a large part of the acute inflammatory response. C5a and C3a also cause neutrophils and macrophages to migrate to the site of complement activation.</p>

                            <p>A number of soluble mediators.<br>
                            They are diverse group of intracellular signalling peptides and glycoproteins that have molecular weights ranging from 6,000 to 60,000 Daltons.<br>
                            Each cytokine is secreted by particular cell types in response to different stimuli, and has been implicated in a wide variety of important regulatory biologic functions such as: inflammation, tissue repair, cell activation, cell growth, fibrosis, and morphogenesis.<br>
                            One cytokine can have several different functions, depending on the type of cell to which it binds. Several hundred different cytokines have been described.<br>
                            Cytokines have been implicated in a variety of important factors of transfusion medicine (haemolytic and febrile transfusion reactions, immunomodulation, and stem cell collection e.t.c.</p>
