                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Genes at three separate loci ( ABO, Hh, and Se ) control the occurrence and the location of the A and B antigens. Three common alleles ( A, B and O ) are located on the ABO locus on chromosome 9.<br>
                            The A and B genes encode glycosyltransferases that produce the A and B antigens respectively. The O gene does not encode a functional enzyme. The red cells of group O persons lack A and B antigens, but carry an abundant amount of H antigen, the precursor material on which A and B antigens are built.<br>
                            Genes at the other two loci Hh and Se (Secretor) are on chromosome 19, and are closely linked. Each locus has two recognized alleles one of which has no demonstrable product and is considered an amorph. The active allele at the H locus, H , produces a glycosyltransferase that acts at the cellular level to form H antigen on which A or B is built. The amorph, h , is very rare. The Se gene is directly responsible for the expression of H , which may then be modified to express A and B on the glycoproteins (antigens) in epithelial secretions such as saliva.</p>
                            
                            <p>Eighty per cent of the population are secretors. Secretors have inherited the Se gene and their secreted glycoproteins express H , which can be converted to A and / or B if they also have the A and / or B gene. The amorph is called šē.<br>
                            The ABH system is the system that determine the existence of A, B and H antigens the formation of these antigens depends on presence of A, B and H genes these genes are responsible for the formation of the respective antigens however H gene is the most important in this system.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-role-h">The role of gene H:</h3>
                            <p>The H gene produces a transferase (fucosyltransferase) that adds fucose (Fuc) to the precursor substance.<br>
                            This gene is inherited independent of ABO gene. The H gene is the first gene that acts on the basic material and therefore it is responsible for the formation of A and B antigens. The basic material is the precursor substance.</p>

                            <h4 id="heading-precursor">Composition of the precursor substance.</h4>
                            <p>Precursor substances are macromolecules, which are composed of peptide backbone, or polypeptide carbohydrates chains that are attached irrespective of specificity within the ABO blood group system. Each macromolecule contains the following</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">-L-fucose</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">-D-galactose</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">-N-acetyl galactosamine</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In addition to the above it has fifteen (15) amino acids<br>
                            The actual specificity of the molecule is determined by the actual sugar occurring at the end of the molecule (antigen) terminal sugar, thus making it able either to react with antibody A or antibody B</p>

                            <h4 id="heading-transferase">Transferase:</h4>
                            <p>An enzyme that catalyses addition of specific sugar units to give A B and H. The enzymes are also specific for A B and H .<br>
                            -The H gene acts on the precursor substance by addition of its terminal sugar L -fucose and thus making it <strong>H</strong> active substance.<br>
                            The H active substance forms a substrate to which another Transferase specific enzyme adds its sugar. After the addition of another sugar there is the formation of A and/or B antigen.<br>
                            The H -active substance must be formed first by the formation of at least one H -gene in order for the sugars to be attached in response to an inherited ABO genes</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>A and B transferases add specific sugars to oligosacchide chains that have been converted to H by the fucosyltransferase produced by the H gene.</strong></p>
                            <p>The number of potential A, B and H sites on the red cells is thought to be in excess of two million.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 id="heading-role-a">Role of gene A:</h3>
                            <p>The A-gene encodes for the production of glycosyltransferase enzyme which adds N -acetylgalactosamine (GAINAc) sugar to the H-active substance. This structure is responsible for Aspecificity, consecutively blood group A<br>
                            This sugar converts the H -active substance to A antigen.<br>
                            The A-gene tends to elicit higher concentration of glycosyltransferase than the B-gene. This leads to one conversion of all the H -antigens on the red cells to A -antigens sites as many as $1,000,000$ to $1,700,000$ antigens sites exist on any adult red cells in response to inherited Agenes.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-role-b">Role of gene B:</h3>
                            <p>The B-gene encodes for the production of D-galactosyl-transferase enzyme that transfers Dgalactose (Gal) sugar to the H -active substance. This sugar is responsible for the B-specificity. Anywhere from 600,000 to 830,000 B-antigen sites exist on B-adult red cells, in response to the conversion of the H -antigen by the glycosyltransferase elicited by the B-gene.<br>
                            Blood group AB is got by addition of both sugars -N -acetylgalactosamine and D -galactose. When A and B genes are both inherited B enzymes seems to compete more efficiently for the H structure and the A enzymes is not as successful. Therefore the average number of A-antigens on an AB adult is approximately 600,000 sites.</p>

                            <h3 id="heading-role-o">Role of gene O:</h3>
                            <p>Gene O is an amorph (silent gene) therefore it doesn't add any terminal sugar to the H- active substance and thus we get blood group O . It has H antigens only-Highest concentration, because none is acted upon.</p>

                                BOMBAY PHENOTYPE ($\text{O}_{\text{h}}$)
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>It was first discovered in Bombay in 1952 by Dr. Y. M. Bhende. It is due to con-sanguineous marriages. It is a very rare blood group. Individuals with this blood group are devoid of all ABO antigens (antigen) because they lack H gene which converts precursor substance to H -active substance which would be charged to A, B and H in the presence of ABO genes<br>
                            The term 'Bombay' has been used for the phenotype in which red cells lack H , A and B because examples of such red cells were first discovered in Bombay, India. The symbol $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ has been selected to denote the phenotype because results of routine ABO typing tests mimic those of blood group ' O ' persons. $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ red cells are not agglutinated by anti H , anti A and anti B reagents, and the serum contains a strong anti H , anti A and anti B . The $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ phenotype becomes apparent when serum of $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ person is tested against group O red cells, and strong immediate-spin agglutination and / or haemolysis occur. The anti-H of an $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ person reacts over a wide thermal range ($4 - 37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$). $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ persons must be transfused only with $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ blood because their non-red-cells stimulated
                            antibodies rapidly destroy cells with A B or H antigens. At the genotype level, the $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ phenotype arises from the inheritance of hh at the H locus and se/se at the Se-locus.<br>
                            The genotype hh is usually with individuals of consanguineous (relatives) marriages.<br>
                            Bombay phenotypes are all non-secretors of ABH substances<br>
                            Bombay individuals are Non-secretors, although they have Se/Se genes -Se/se genes (former homozygous later heterozygous) this is because they lack the H gene<br>
                            ABO Genes are present but because individuals have hh genes there is no formation of ABH antigens.<br>
                            They posses all antibodies Anti A, Anti B and Anti H</p>

                            <p>The Se gene and its allele šē are inherited independently of ABO and H-genes. Se/Se and še- šē genotype is given the name secretor and non-secretor respectively. The Se/Se system regulates the formation of H -antigen and, subsequently, of A and B antigens in secretory cells. People who inherit šē / šē genes are termed "non-secretors". The H-specific transferase (Lfucosyltransferase) is found only in the secretors, indicating that the secretor genes control the expression of the H gene in the secretory cells. The Se gene does not, however, affect the formation of A, B or H antigens on the red cell. The Se gene does not control the presence of A, B or H transferases in haematopoietic tissue. In fact, A or B transferases enzymes, unlike A or B glycoprotein substances or antigens, are found in the secretions of A or B individuals regardless of their secretor status. However, it is the presence of the H -gene specific L -fucosyltransferase (which is dependant on the inheritance of the Se gene) that determines whether ABH soluble substances will be secreted in as much as H -substance must be synthesized prior to the formation of A or B substance.</p>
                            
                            <p>Secretors are individuals who have blood group specific substances in their body fluids while Non secretors lack the blood group specific substances<br>
                            About $80 \%$ of the population are secretors and the remaining $20 \%$ non -secretors<br>
                            The secretion of blood group specific substances is controlled by a pair of allelomorphic genes Se/Se. The Se is dominant over se gene i.e. if Homozygous Se/ Se or heterozygous Se/se you are a secretor.<br>
                            There are three types of secretors</p>

                            - Alcohol soluble - glycolipids / present in RBC's and almost all other tissues but antibodies in body fluids<br>
                            The water form of blood group specific substance is controlled by the secretor gene whereby the alcohol soluble is not controlled<br>
                            Secretors will either secrete A, B or H specific substances the secretion is as follows:</p>
