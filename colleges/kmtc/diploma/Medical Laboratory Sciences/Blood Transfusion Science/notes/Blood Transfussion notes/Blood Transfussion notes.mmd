\section*{Definition}

Blood transfusion is the process of receiving blood products into ones circulation intravenously. Transfusions are used in a variety of conditions to replace lost components of blood. Early transfusion used whole blood but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood such as red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, plasma, clotting factors.
Globally 85million units of red blood cells are transfused in a given year.
Blood: - Is a living tissue composed of cellular elements suspended in a watery fluid called plasma.
Plasma: -its principal component is water ( $90 \%$ ). It also contains ( $10 \%$ ) carbohydrates, plasma proteins, inorganic constituents such as sodium, potassium, calcium chloride, carbonate, and bicarbonate; sugar; hormones; enzymes; fats; amino acids; and such waste products as urea and creatinine. All these substances occur in minute quantities.

\section*{Cellular elements:}
- Erythrocytes (R.B.C's).
- Leucocytes (W.B.C's).
- Thrombocytes (Platelets).

\section*{Functions:}

Erythrocytes: - Transport oxygen from lungs to tissues. Carries oxygen combined with haemoglobin from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs.
Leucocytes: - Defence mechanism.
- Divided into two Granulocytes \& Agranulocytes.

Granulocytes contain granules in the cytoplasm.
Agranulocytes don't have granules in the cytoplasm.

\section*{Granulocytes:}
- Neutrophils.
- Basophils.
- Eosinophils.

\section*{Agranulocytes}
- Lymphocyte, small/large.
- Monocytes.

Neutrophils: Ingest foreign bacteria by phagocytosis.

\section*{Basophils: Produces Heparin an anticoagulant that helps in preventing the clotting of blood in blood in circulation. Also involved in hypersensitivity. Basophils bind IgE on their surface and are involved in anaphylactic, hypersensitivity, and inflammatory reactions. Basophils interact with eosinophils and macrophages in allergic reactions. When specific antigen react with IgE bound to basophils, degranulation of the cells occurs with the release of inflammatory substances including heparin, histamine, and platelet activating factor.}

Eosinophils: Antigen antibody infection parasitic infection and allergies
(Hypersensitivity) by producing Anti- histamine.
Eosinophils enter the blood from the bone marrow. They circulate for about 8 hours after which they enter the tissues. They are found mainly in the skin gastrointestinal tract and lungs where they are involved in hypersensitivity reactions e.g. asthma, hay fever, eczema. Eosinophils contain substances that are able to inactivate histamine and factors released during anaphylaxis.

\section*{Lymphocytes:}

B-lymphocytes produce of antibodies.
T-helper T lymphocytes regulate the immune system by directing immune responses, either antibody mediated or cellular
Monocytes: Scavengers. Ingest bacteria in the second line of defence.

\section*{Pus is degenerated leucocytes that form acne or abscess.}

Platelets: Plays a major role in coagulation mechanism.

\section*{TYPES OF BLOOD SAMPLES:}

Whole blood: Blood that has both cells and plasma intact or blood that is not clotted.
Plasma: Is the fluid potion from anti-coagulated blood. Plasma can be obtained by centrifuging whole blood, or by living the whole blood to settle.
Serum: The fluid part of clotted blood

\section*{PLASMA}

Proteins in plasma include:
a) Albumin 4.5g \%
b) Globulin 2.5g \%
c) Fibrinogen 0.3 g \%

Plasma proteins are albumin, the principal agent in maintaining the osmotic pressure of the blood and therefore in controlling its tendency to diffuse through the walls of blood vessels.

Other proteins, including fibrinogen and prothrombin, participate in clotting; (agglutinins), which cause the agglutination reaction between samples of blood of different types and the reaction known as anaphylaxis, a form of allergic shock; and globulins of many types, which include the antibodies that provide immunity against many diseases. Other significant plasma proteins function as carriers of such essential tissue nutrients as copper, iron, other metals, and a variety of hormones.
Globulin: are antibodies (poly peptides)
- Alpha globulin
- Beta globulin
- Gamma globulin.

Gamma globulins are mostly used in formation of most antibodies.
Plasma is considered to be anti-complementary. This is because the ions (e.g. $\mathrm{Mg}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{++}$) that are vital for activation of complement have been removed by anticoagulant.
$\mathrm{Mg}^{++}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{++}$ions are responsible for activation of complement in serological test in blood transfusion.
Fibrinogen: Used up in clotting of blood.

\section*{SERUM:}

Liquid potion of coagulated blood or clotted blood. Obtained through leaving blood in a bottle (bijou) with no anti-coagulant.
Serum has two proteins:
- Albumin
- Globulin

There is no fibrinogen in serum because it has been used during clotting mechanism, by thrombokinase to form a fibrin.
Serum is used in serological tests in Transfusion Sciences because there is a complement which activates the $\mathrm{ab}-$ antigen reaction e.g. haemolysis.

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF BLOOD:}

Nutrition and respiration of tissues located far from food and air supplies.
Transportation of waste products from the tissues to the excretory organs e.g. kidneys, lungs (urea, uric acid, carbon-dioxide, xanthine, creatinine).
Chemical and thermo co-ordination of the body: -
Normal body Temperature - $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
PH -7.3-7.4
Electrolytes maintain the balance of PH of blood.
Defence mechanism, against infections through actions of antibodies and Monocytes

\section*{BLOOD GROUPS:}

\section*{Reasons of Blood Transfusion:}
- Replace blood lost by haemorrhage, haemorrhage can be caused by haematemesis, trauma, and surgery.
- To increase the amount of circulating Hb, especially with patients suffering from anaemia e.g. in Thalassaemia, Sickle Cell Disease, leukaemia e.t.c.

\section*{THE ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM}

In 1901, Karl Landsteiner discovered the ABO blood group system. He was working closely with Sturli Von Decastero who discovered AB blood group.
Karl Landsteiner and Weiner discovered the Rhesus blood group - in 1940.
Thus there are four blood groups $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{AB}$, and O in the ABO blood group system.

\section*{Inheritance:}

Three common alleles ( $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and O ) are located on the ABO locus on chromosome 9.
Three Allelomorphic genes determine it.
Allele: - pair of chromosomes found on the same loci of gene.
The Allele A gene, B gene, O gene.
O gene is an amorph - cannot express itself when $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, genes are present.
Genes are inherited from parents according to Mendelian law.
The antigens from the genes inherited

\begin{tabular}{ll}
A antigen & A gene \\
B antigen & B gene.
\end{tabular}

An individual inherits either $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{O}$ gene from one parent or the other thus the offspring has a gene called genotype, individual for a particular trait.
Thus if the chromosome inherited from the father carries gene A and that from the mother carries gene B , the offspring will be of AB genotype.
Different genotypes are $\mathrm{AA}, \mathrm{AO}, \mathrm{AB}, \mathrm{BB}, \mathrm{BO}$, and OO .
It is difficult to know whether an individual is AA or AO genotype.

\section*{Phenotype:}

Visible expression of genotype. There are four phenotypes in A, B, O blood groups.

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Phenotype & Genotype & Blood Groups \\
A & AA AO & Genotypes 6 \\
B & BB BO & Phenotypes 4 \\
AB & AB & \\
O & OO &
\end{tabular}

Genes inherited can either be the same or they can be different.

Homozygous: Inherits similar genes, $\mathrm{AA}, \mathrm{BB}$, and OO .
Heterozygous: Inherits different genes, $\mathrm{AO}, \mathrm{BO}, \mathrm{AB}$.
Antigens and antibodies cause reactions in blood. Genes are responsible for the production of the corresponding antigen thus A and B genes in the $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{O}$, blood groups are the causes of the production of A and B antigens.
A and B antigens are the major antigens found in ABO blood group system.
There are two antibodies found in ABO blood system ab A and B antibody.
The antigens and antibodies are the ones that enable us to determine the blood group of an individual.

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Blood group & Antigen & Antibody \\
A & A & B \\
B & B & A \\
AB & A \& B & None \\
O & None & A \& B.
\end{tabular}

The distribution of blood groups depends with the race of the people and geographical location.

\begin{tabular}{clll} 
Blood group & Africans & White & Chinese \\
A & $27 \%$ & $41 \%$ & $28 \%$ \\
B & $21 \%$ & $10 \%$ & $23 \%$ \\
AB & $4 \%$ & $4 \%$ & $13 \%$ \\
O & $45 \%$ & $45 \%$ & $36 \%$
\end{tabular}

According to the distribution table
- AB is the most rare
- Chinese have a fair distribution of all blood groups

The best distributed blood is O .

\section*{ANTIGENS \& ANTIBODIES: ANTIGEN (IMMUNOGENE).}

It is a foreign substance which when introduced into the body of an individual who lacks it stimulates the production of antibodies and it can react to those specific antibodies produced.
E.g. If we introduce antigen A in a blood group B individual, it produces antibody A which can react with A antigen.
Antigens are made of poly-saccharide amino acid complex.
$$\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{O}_{5}\right)-\mathrm{COOH}$$

\section*{$\mathrm{NH}_{2}$}

The purpose of poly-saccharide is concerned with the specificity of the antigen.
The amino-acid is antigen.
Antigenicity is the strength/ability of the antigen to stimulate the production of the antibodies.
Specificity: the ability of antigen to react with a specific corresponding antibody e.g. Antigen A reacts with antibody A.
Antigen B reacts with antibody B .

\section*{ANTIBODY:}

Proteinous in nature produced due to antigenic stimulant. They react specifically with corresponding antigen.

\section*{HAPTEN:}

A substance that combines specifically with an antibody but does not stimulate the production of antibodies.
They are antigens with little antigenicity.
Thus it has specificity but does not have antigenicity.

A hapten is a small molecule that can elicit immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING ANTIGENICITY}

\section*{1. Chemical structure of the antigen}

For an antigen to be recognised by the body (host) it has to have a high molecular weight of at least 10,000 Daltons

\section*{2. Route of entry}

Either through the mouth, intravenously, peritoneal (skin). The body is able to recognise the antibody depending on where it is introduced. If the route is normally intravenous the body cannot recognise if the route of entry is changed.

\section*{3. Dosage}

The right quality and quantity. Low dosage does not impact immunological response.

\section*{4. Susceptibility of the host}

The body of the host must recognise the material as foreign failure to which it will not stimulate the production of antibodies

\section*{5. Frequency of exposure}

The more the exposure the body has for a particular disease or antigen, the more the immunity it develops. Secondary immunity in response to antigenic stimuli acts as a booster.

\section*{SUB GROUPS OF THE ABO SYSTEM:}

Discovered by Von-Dungein and Hisszfield- in 1911. There are various types of subgroups of A . There are two main agglutinogens $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ \& $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. They divide A \& AB into $\mathrm{A}_{1}, \mathrm{~A}_{2}, \mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$. The other subgroups of A are $\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{el}}, \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{x}}$
The classification of these sub-groups is dependent on the amount of A -antigens on A cells. Thus $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ has the highest antigen antibody reaction (titre).

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Phenotype & Genotype \\
$\mathrm{A}_{1}$ & $\mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{~A}_{1}, \mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~A}_{2}$ \\
$\mathrm{~A}_{2}$ & $\mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~A}_{2}, \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ \\
$\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ & $\mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ \\
$\mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ & $\mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$.
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Subgroup & Antigen & Antibodies \\
\hline $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ & $\mathrm{A}_{1}, \mathrm{~A}$ & B \\
\hline $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ & A & B - $2-6 \%$ have anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ \\
\hline $\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ & $\mathrm{A}_{1}, \mathrm{~B}, \mathrm{~A}$ & None \\
\hline $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ & A, B & None $-25 \%$ have anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ \\
\hline B & B & A \& $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ \\
\hline O & None & $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{A}_{1}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Anti: A1}

Reacts with $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ cells
It is an atypical cold agglutinin that is present in individuals who lacks the corresponding antigen.
There are two methods of production
- By Adsorption with anti A. (Method).
- From plants - Lectins - Dolichos biflorous.

Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ occurs as an allo-antibody in the serum of $1-8 \%$ of $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ persons and $22-35 \%$ of $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ persons. Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ can also sometimes be found in the sera of $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ individuals or those of other weak subgroups of A . Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ can cause incompatibility in cross matches with $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ or $\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ red cells.

Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ usually reacts better or only at temperatures well below 37 degrees and is considered clinically insignificant unless there is reactivity at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, only $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ or O red cells should be used for transfusion.
In simple Adsorption studies, the Anti A of group B serum appears to contain separable anti A and anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$. Native group B serum agglutinates $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ red cell. If further tests are performed, however, the differences in A antigen expression between $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ red cells appear to be quantitative rather than qualitative.
A reliable Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ reagent from lectin of Dolichos biflorous is commercially available or may be prepared. The raw plant extract will react with both $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ red cells, but the appropriately diluted reagent preparation will not agglutinate $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cells and thus constitute an anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$.

\section*{Subgroups of B:}

In group B there is no variation in Antigen strength comparable to that of A nor is group B divisible into two main subgroups as A is divided. However subgroups of B do occur and may very rarely be cause of anomalies in ABO grouping. Thus they have no clinical importance. Examples of subgroups of B are $\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{z}}, \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{w}}, \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{x}}, \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{x}}, \mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{v}}$.

\section*{Importance of ABO sub- groups}
- Can be used in cases of disputed paternity.
- They can cause incompatibility thus transfusion reactions.
- Can cause problems in grouping e.g. $\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{x}}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{0}$ can be grouped as O
- Are used for identification of sub-groups. We normally use $\mathrm{A}_{1}$.
- Professional and academic purposes.

As we increase from $\mathrm{A}_{1}, \mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}, \mathrm{~A}_{2}, \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$

In blood group O we have antibody A and no antigen.
Thus the blood can be mistaken for O .
The amount of H antigen detected on red cells is, in order of diminishing quantity, $\mathrm{O}>\mathrm{A}_{2}>\mathrm{B}>\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}>\mathrm{A}_{1}>\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$.
As for A and B configurations, H -like substances are found in nature.

\begin{tabular}{rlrl} 
Subgroup & Anti A & \multicolumn{1}{c}{ Anti B } & Anti A1 \\
$\mathrm{A}_{1}$ & + & - & + \\
$\mathrm{A}_{2}$ & + & - & $2 \% \mathrm{~A}_{1}$ \\
$\mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ & + & + & + \\
$\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ & + & + & $25 \% \mathrm{~A}_{1}$
\end{tabular}

ANTIGEN ANTIBODY REACTIONS;

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
& Antigen & antibody \\
i) Agglutination - & agglutinogen & agglutinin \\
ii) Precipitation - & precipitinogen & precipitin \\
iii) Haemolysis - & Haemolysinogen & haemolysin
\end{tabular}

A complement is required for Haemolysis to occur.

\section*{1. AGGLUTINATION:}

Is a visible antigen - antibody reaction causing R.B.C's to clump together. The antigen involved is known as agglutinogen. An example is Antigen A and Antigen B. The antibody involved in agglutination is agglutinin. E.g. Antibody A and B.
Agglutination takes place in two stages (phases).

\section*{Sensitization ( ${ }^{\text {st }}$ stage)}

It is not visible - invisible.
The antibody (agglutinin) attaches itself on the agglutinogen on the cell surface (R.B.C's), and thus the red cell that has taken up the agglutinin is said to be sensitised. There is no reaction. This process takes a very short time.
Actual agglutination ( $\mathbf{2}^{\text {nd }}$ stage) or clumping of R.B.C's takes place. The red blood cells form agglutinates which are large enough to be seen by the naked eye. The cells change in shape and become distorted, and sometimes the R.B.C's membranes break to release haemoglobin.
Agglutination is the most important of the reactions (Antigen - Antibody).

\section*{2. HAEMOLYSIS:}

It is a visible Antigen - Antibody reaction causing the lying of R.B.C's (lyse - break down) in the presence of a complement. The antibody involved in haemolysin and the antigen is haemolysinogen.
Complement is a group of enzymatic proteins found in normal fresh serum (not in plasma).
The complement is thermo labile - destroyed at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes.
There are three phases in haemolysis;

\section*{Sensitization:}

The haemolysin attaches itself on the surface of R.B.C's
$2^{\text {nd }}$ stage: Compliment fixation
The complement fixes itself on the antigen/antibody complex.

\section*{Final stage ( $3^{\text {rd }}$ stage). Haemolysis}

Haemolysis occurs and haemoglobin is liberated from the R.B.C's and can readily be observed staining the supernatant fluid.

\section*{3. PRECIPITATION:}

The main difference:
In agglutination and haemolysis we use cellular antigen.
In precipitation the antigen and the antibody are soluble
Precipitinogen is the antigen involved in precipitation.
Precipitin is the antibody used in precipitation.
The soluble antibody and antigen react in the solution causing a precipitate or flocculation.

\section*{IMMUNOGLOBULINS (ANTIBODIES)}

They are made of amino-acids (proteins) that are regulated in sequence by the genes concerned in the reproduction of antibodies. The antibodies are produced in the gamma globulin. The immunoglobulins are classified into five classes.
IgG
IgM
IgA Antibodies
IgE
IgD

It is only the $\operatorname{IgG}$ which have sub-classes i.e. $\operatorname{IgG}_{1} \operatorname{IgG}_{2} \operatorname{IgG}_{3} \operatorname{IgG}_{4}$.

\section*{IgG - Immunoglobulin Gamma ( $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ )}

It is composed of 4 chains that are made of amino - acids. Among the 4 - chains there are two identical heavy chains (H).
The heavy chains are the ones that are Gamma ( $\gamma$ ).
There are also two identical light chains Kappa or Lambda.
The chains are joined together by a covalent di-sulphide bond.

\section*{IgG is a monomer.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/4f93a461-9cf1-439f-9600-7257c2abf6eb-013.jpg?height=610&width=1476&top_left_y=1726&top_left_x=241)

\section*{IgM - Immunoglobulin Mu. (μ)}

It is made up of five structural units arranged in a circular manner and forms a crab lice shape. The two light chains are made of Kappa or Lambda and the heavy chain is made up of Mu (ц). (DIAGRAMME)

\section*{IgA - Immunoglobulin Alpha ( $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ )}

Molecule is a dimmer (2)
The heavy chain is Alpha and the light chain is either Kappa or Lambda.

\section*{IgD: Immunoglobulin Delta ( $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ )}

Made up of two delta heavy chains and two light chains made up of Kappa or Lambda. It is catabolised and has a half life of only 3 -days. It was first encountered as a myeloma protein.

\section*{IgE Immunoglobulin Epsilon ( $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ )}

Two heavy chains made up of epsilon and two identical light chains that can be lambda or kappa. After research it has been found IgE is increased in parasitic infection. It's also increased in allergic reactions. It's also increased in myelomas, liver disease and auto-immune diseases, and helminthiasis.

\section*{ZONES OF ANTIBODIES/ANTIGEN REACTION.}

There are basically three zones of antigen-antibody reactions.
1. Zones of antibody excess in which un-combined antibody is present i.e. antibody is more than antigen also referred to as PROZONE phenomenon.
In an antigen antibody system, a negative reaction is obtained with low dilutions (concentrations) of the antibody, although a positive reaction is obtained with higher dilutions (low concentration) of the same antibodies. This presents problem (anomaly) in grouping and cross-matching because of false positive and false-ve reactions.
2. Zone of antigen excess in which all antigen have combined with antibody and antigen are more than antibody(un-combined antigen) e.g. while preparing sensitized pooled O cells for use as positive control in Coomb's test.
3. Zone of equivalence. Both antigen and antibody are present in equal amounts and we have equal antigen-antibody reaction and maximum compliment fixation.

\section*{GROUPING ABO CELL GROUPING:}

This is the detection of presence or absence of A antigen or B antigen on cells of RBC's. Thus we use known antibodies, Anti-A and Anti-B.
e.g.

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Anti A & Anti B & Blood group \\
+ & - & A \\
- & + & B \\
- & - & O \\
+ & + & AB
\end{tabular}

ABO cell grouping is also known as forward grouping or forward typing / direct grouping direct typing

\section*{ABO serum grouping}

This is detection of presence or absence of Anti A or Anti B using known antigens (cells) We use known A B and O cells e.g.

\begin{tabular}{llll} 
A cells & B cells & O cells & Blood group \\
+ & + & - & O \\
- & - & - & AB \\
+ & - & - & B \\
- & + & - & A
\end{tabular}
-O cells are used as control - no reaction is expected.
-ABO serum grouping is also known as backward cell grouping or reverse cell typing.
In routine work both reverse and forward grouping methods are used. The reason being one confirms the other e.g.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Forward Anti A & Anti B & A cells & Reverse B cells & O cells & Blood group \\

\section*{Methods used in ABO Grouping}

There are basically three methods
- Tube method
- Slide method
- Tile method

Tube method is the most effective method and the best. It is the most commonly used.

\section*{TUBE METHOD}

Label five test-tubes ( 8 mmx 75 mm ) in a blood grouping rack Anti-A, Anti-B, A-cell, B-cells, Ocells
-Add one volume of $4 \%$ patient/donor cell suspension to tubes labelled anti-A and anti-B.
-Add one drop of $4 \%$ known cell suspension of known $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and O cells in $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and O (respective test tubes).
-Add one drop of the anti-serum anti-A \& anti-B in respective test tubes Anti-A and Anti-B and mix
-Add one drop of donors or patient's serum tubes A , B and O cells
-Take the tubes and centrifuge at 1000 r.p.m. for a minute OR 3000 rpm for 20 seconds
-Examine the tubes for agglutination both macroscopically and microscopically.
-Chart your results (after examination).

\begin{tabular}{lllllll} 
Anti-A & Anti-B & A-cells & & B-cells & O-cells & Blood group \\
+ & & - & & - & & + \\
- & + & - & - & - & A \\
- & - & - & + & - & B \\
+ & + & - & - & - & AB
\end{tabular}
-The method is mostly recommended because one can't miss agglutination;
-centrifugation enhances agglutination.

\section*{SLIDE METHOD}

Take two slides and divide them into two. Label them anti A anti B, A cells and B cells.
Slide 1 slide 2
-Put one volume (drop) of anti-serum into respective positions (Anti-A and anti-B)
-Put 1 volume of cell suspension to the respective positions (A-cells and B-cells)
-Add one drop of donor's (patient's) cells in position marked anti-A and anti-B
-Add one drop of donors (patients) serum on slide 2 (A-cells, B-cells)
-Use an applicator stick and mix.
-Leave slides at room temperature for 2 minutes
-Examine for agglutination and chart the results

\section*{Disadvantages of slide method}
- False negative results can be obtained if mixing is not done properly.
- False results can occur as a result of blood drying on the glass slide.
- If glass is divided as above contents on one portion could mix with contents on the other portion.

\section*{Advantages}
- It is simple and quick
- It is cheap

\section*{TILE METHOD}

It employs the use of plates as a depression of surface.
The technique is the same as the slide method.

\section*{Advantages of tile method over slide method}

It can be rotated so as to observe agglutination
The cells may adhere to the walls when mixing the contents giving a false positive reaction

\section*{PROBLEMS (ANOMALIES) ENCOUNTERED IN GROUPING}

\section*{1. Rouleaux formation}

This is pilling of cells on top of each other appearing as coins. This is not agglutination. Another name of Rouleaux is Pseudo-agglutination
Pseudo agglutination occurs by other means other than antigen-antibody reaction. It is chiefly associated with a shift of protein ratio in the serum
-Albumin/globulin ratio is altered:
This occurs in patients with e.g.
- Kalaazar
- Multiple myelomatosis where there are abnormal cells e.g. macroglobulins are present.
- Patients administered with Dextran-40 (plasma expander)

There is more globulin than albumin in infections and chronic conditions.

\section*{Differentiating between Rouleaux formation \& Normal agglutination}

Use washed cells or add a drop of normal saline and the agglutination will disperse.

\section*{2. Pan-agglutination}

This is a spontaneous clumping of all red cells.
-The phenomenon occurs in two ways
Either red cells are altered upon by bacteria or certain viruses in such a manner they become agglutinated by all human serum said to be pan-agglutinationary.
Bacteria and viruses remove certain receptors e.g. T-receptors exposing T-antigenic sites. All human serum contains anti-T.
Example of micro-organisms Staphylococci, Clostridium welchi, Vibrio cholerae
A sample of serum may be contaminated with certain organisms e.g. Corynebacteria rendering it capable of agglutinating all samples of r.b.c's. In this case the serum is said to be panagglutinum serum.
The organisms act upon the patient's red blood cells in-vitro to expose H-antigens. In our blood there is agglutinogen- H and there will be a reaction between agglutinin- H and agglutinogen- H .

\section*{Solution/correcting the discrepancy}

Cells should be washed at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ using warm Normal saline and the grouping done at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Auto agglutination}

It is caused by auto agglutins. The patient's antibodies agglutinate his own r.b.c's. These autoantibodies can either be cold or warm e.g. cold anti I, anti M anti N, anti-I, anti-P e.g. warm anti e
These cases occur in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria (P.N.H.), passing bloody urine at night.
Other causes;
Viral pneumonia

Leukaemia
Syphilis (It has anti P specificity)

\section*{Solution/resolving the discrepancy}

Wash the r.b.c in warm saline at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to free them from auto agglutinins.

\section*{Poly-agglutination}

A few individuals have been described whose red cells are agglutinated by a proportion of normal human serum. These cells are said to be poly agglutinable (agglutinated by many sera) as opposed to pan-agglutination (agglutinated by all sera)

\section*{CONTROLS IN ABO GROUPING}

The following are common controls used in ABO grouping.

\section*{Auto controls}

Patient's serum pt's cells

\section*{Negative control}
E.g. saline and cells

Use of O-cells in reverse grouping is considered a control. No agglutination is expected.

\section*{Positive control}

Known sera and known cells
E.g. anti-A agglutinates group A red blood cells

Anti-B agglutinates group B red blood cells

\section*{Importance of controls}
- Confirm the blood group
- Test potency of reagents used
- Test accuracy of the test
- Test efficiency of technician / technologist
- Test specificity of test.

\section*{RHESUS BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM:}

It was discovered by Landsteiner and Weiner in 1940. It was discovered through a Rhesus monkey (genus).
He took Rhesus monkey's r.b.c's and injected them into rabbits and guinea pigs
The rabbit produced antibodies against Rhesus monkey's r.b.c's (foreign bodies)
Immune antibodies produced by rabbit after injection reacted with rhesus monkey's r.b.c's, and about $85 \%$ human r.b.c's.
-Anti serum from rabbit was detecting and unknown human blood group antigen and used it to type -Rh positive (those which reacted $=85 \%$ )
Rh negative (didn't react $=15 \%$ )

Antigen involved is RhD antigen or antigen D
Rh-blood group system is governed by two theories
- Fisher - Race theory
- Weiner theory

\section*{FISHER - RACE THEORY:}

States that antigens of Rh system are determined by three pairs of genes which occupy closely linked loci.
Either two or three alleles on a chromosome
The gene d appears to be a silent gene because there is no demonstrable product of d . thus d (gene) is assumed to be an amorph. Thus the order of loci is D-C-E- but it's only the D antigen that determines whether you are RhD positive or RhD negative.
The three loci that carry the Rh gene are so closely linked on the chromosome that they never separate but they are passed from generation to generation as a unit or as a gene complex.
In the fisher-Race notation the gene and the red cell antigen it produces are given the same symbol gene E and antigen E, however the letter is italicized for the antigen. Each of the alleles gene mentioned controls the presence of respective antigens on the r.b.c's except d which is a morph.

\section*{WEINERS THEORY:}

Postulates that two genes are on each chromosome of the pair controls the entire expression of the Rh system in one individual.
The pairs on each genes might be alike homozygous or different heterozygous.
There are eight major alleles which can be produced.
According to Weiner's hypothesis each gene produces a structure on the red cells called agglutinogen and each agglutinogen can be identified by its parts or factors, but react with specific antibodies e.g. gene $\mathrm{R}^{1}$ produces agglutinogen $\mathrm{Rh}_{1}$, on r.b.c.
The agglutinogen has three factors Rh, rh and hr
$$\mathrm{D}-\mathrm{Rh}^{0}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{rh}{ }^{\prime}, \mathrm{E}-\mathrm{rh} ", \mathrm{c}-\mathrm{hr} ', \mathrm{e}-\mathrm{hr} "$$
- Rh
- rh
- hr
-gene r determines agglutinogen rh. Agglutinogen rh has two factors
- -hr'
- -hr"

\section*{RH $_{\text {NULL }}$ PHENOTYPE}

This is an individual lacking all the representation of Rhesus antigens on the R.B.C. The person is devoid of any Rhesus antigens. It was discovered among the Australian Aborigines due to consanguineous marriages. $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ individuals are of phenotype and genotype ---/--- (minus minus minus)
The common allele $\mathrm{X}^{1} \mathrm{r}$ is responsible for converting precursor substance I to precursor substance II which is then converted by the Rh genes DCE into Rh antigen DCE/Dce depending on genes inherited.
The more common regulator type of $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ mutations occur in the RHAG gene that result in complete absence of core Rh complex ( Rh polypeptides and Rh-Ag) that is necessary for the ex-
pression of Rh antigens. The other form of $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ the amorph type has a normal RHAG gene; however, there is a mutation in each RHCE gene, together with the common deletion of RHD. The $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ individuals lack the common allele and they instead have the modifier / regulator gene $\mathrm{x}^{0} \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{x}^{0} \mathrm{r}$ which does not convert precursor substance I to precursor substance II. Thus there is no production of Rh antigens. When $\mathrm{x}^{0} \mathrm{r}$ is heterozygous $\mathrm{x}^{0} \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{x}^{1} \mathrm{r}$, partial expression of Rh - antigens results. When $\mathrm{x}^{\circ} \mathrm{r}$ is homozygous, there is complete suppression of Rh gene. $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ individuals have inherited homozygous $\mathrm{x}^{0} \mathrm{r}$ gene which suppresses the expression of Rh genes.
$\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ phenotype when tested with any or all Rh antibodies CDEce the cells fail to react and they appear to be devoid of Rhesus antigens. However the Rh genes are normal as shown by the fact that $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ individuals transmit to their offspring functional Rh genes which they inherited from their parents. An individual who is $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ is considered to be Rh negative because of lack of D antigen
A person with $\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ cannot be transfused with Rh negative blood to avoid contamination of $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{E}$ antigens. They form allo-antibodies on exposure to rhesus antigens.
$\mathrm{Rh}_{\text {null }}$ individuals present with stomatocytosis, with mild haemolytic process.

\section*{RH - TYPING:}

This is a test donor to ascertain whether an individual is Rh -positive or Rh -negative and normally in Rh typing it's normally the Rh cell grouping
This is the detection of presence or absence of antigen D . When present the patient is classified rhesus-D positive and when negative he is classified rhesus-D negative
D antigen and D antibody account for over $90 \%$ of all haemolytic reactions caused by Rh misgrouping
There are two kinds of anti D
- Complete anti D saline (monoclonal)
- Incomplete anti D (albumen anti D)

\section*{Various methods of Rh typing}
- Slide method
- Tube method
- Tile method

If the test is positive (presence of agglutination), record the results Rh-D positive
If negative, carry out the tube technique.
After doing tube technique and results are still negative, perform $D^{u}$ test.
If all is negative, the donor / patient is Rhesus negative

\section*{D ${ }^{\text {u }}$}

These are weakly reacting form of antigen D . The normal D antigen has been found to be more complex than the other antigens. 4 fractions have been detected with the number of reactions and components present.
D antigen with all the four fractions is the complete Rh-D antigen.
D antigen has three variations (grades):-

\section*{High grade D ${ }^{\text {u }}$}

The cell lacks one fraction. It also reacts with commercial anti D. both polyclonal and monoclonal.

\section*{Medium or $\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{u}}$}

It lacks two components. It gives positive reaction with monoclonal commercial anti D. but not polyclonal.

\section*{Low grade $\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{u}}$}

It lacks three fractions

It doesn't give positive reaction with commercial anti D . $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ test is performed to detect low grade $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$.
$\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ test utilizes anti human globulin (AHG Test)
It has been established that the $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ is inherited. A parent who has the $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ will pass to a child $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ antigen which will not react with anti D sera.
$\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ presents a problem (anomalies) when typing red cells using Anti-D serum
If $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ antigen is injected to persons who lacks D antigen ( $\mathrm{dcE}, \mathrm{dCe}$ ) the $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ will immunize causing anti-D. All D negative individuals should be considered as Rh-positive and a $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ test should be conducted to confirm that they are negative.

\section*{D $^{\text {u }}$ Test:}

It's a test which is done for the detection of presence or absence of weak D reacting antigen.

\section*{Method:}

Make a 4\% cell suspension of the specimen.
Label the test tubes, test and control.
Add two drops of $4 \%$ cell suspension to all the test tubes.
Add one drop of complete anti D to the test tube labelled test.
Add one drop of Bovine albumen to the test tube labelled control.
Incubate both tubes at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in water bath for 30 minutes- 60 minutes
Remove the tubes from the water bath and centrifuge for about 1 min @ 1000 r.p.m.
Examine for agglutination in both tubes
If the test is negative after centrifugation wash three times in large volumes of normal saline / to remove excess globulin / to avoid neutralizing anti human globulin
Add at least two drops of antihuman globulin or (Coomb's serum) A.H.G
Centrifuge for 1 min and examine for agglutination. Record your findings
- Agglutination $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ positive - Rh positive
- No agglutination $\mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{u}}$ negative - Rh negative

\section*{CONTROLS IN RH -TYPING}

There are three
- positive control,
- negative control and
- Auto-control

\section*{Positive control:}
-Known Rh positive cells +AntiD (antisera) serum/commercially prepared
-It should be set at exactly the same conditions as the test reaction
-unless it gives a satisfactory positive reaction, all other tests should be repeated i.e. if negative the test is invalid

\section*{Negative control:}
-Rh -ve cells / anti D serum used
-set them to the same test conditions
-unless it gives -ve reaction, all other tests should be repeated i.e. if positive the test is invalid

\section*{Auto control:}
-patients cells and patients serum/normal saline are used
-Patients cells + patients serum ought to be negative / No agglutination. If positive the test is invalid

\section*{TESTING MEDIUMS:}
-Enzymes
-Bovine
-Anti-human globulin
-Normal saline
-LISS

\section*{Normal saline:}
0.85 gms of sodium chloride in 100 mls of distilled water.

Free from contamination of bacteria, metal, detergents and silicones
It must not be stored for long periods in glass /metal containers /non- -sterilized containers. It may get moulds and pH changes.
Storage containers should be washed frequently.

\section*{Bovine globulin:}
-Albumin specifically prepared for in-vitro serological tests should be used
-Used concentrations are 20-30\%
-It should always be used according to manufacturer's direction.
-Final concentration for albumin during testing should be about $12 \%$

\section*{Enzymes:}

There are many proteolytic enzymes which have been used in serological tests.
Enzymes are organic compounds that catalyze the digestion of the R.B.C membrane. It is said to be effective because they lower the negative surface charge and thus the Zeta potential on the
R.B.C by digesting the red cell membrane and removing the Sialic acid residues. Thus there is altering of the structure of the cell agglutins such that they are exposed.
NB. Receptors (antigens) were originally inside the cell membrane
There are different types of enzymes used in artificial serological reactions
- Papain $\_\_\_\_$ Pawpaw
- Trypsin $\_\_\_\_$ Pancrease /stomach of the pig
- Bromeline $\_\_\_\_$ pineapples
- Ficin $\_\_\_\_$ fig tree

\section*{Properties of enzymes}
- Speeds up the $\mathrm{Ag}-\mathrm{Ab}$ reaction
- Increase the specificity of antigen
- Increase the sensitivity of a reaction
- Increase the avidity of antigen (power of agglutination rapidly and strongly)

\section*{Disadvantages:}

Some sera cause pan - agglutination of enzyme treated cells due to cells containing auto antibodies against enzymes treated cells which causes agglutination of all the cells Some enzymes cause damage to the mucous membrane e.g. Ficin.
Some antigens are destroyed by enzymes

ALBUMIN:
Def: Protein used as diluent in blood typing and a potentiator solution in serologic testing to enhance ag/ab reaction.
Albumin is produced from healthy cattle (bovine). It is then standardized for avidity / concentration. Normally the concentration is $20 \%$ bovine albumin in ab/ag reaction
-The albumen is usually supplied as $30 \%$ thus it has to be diluted in a ratio of $1: 2$ It can be diluted by use of human AB serum or Normal Saline
-Part of AB serum is added to 2 parts of bovine albumen
which gives $20 \%$ of bovine albumen concentration required for $\mathrm{ab} / \mathrm{ag}$ reaction
$30 \%$ conc. is not used. If we use $20 \%$ it is easy to make -ve reactions. If conc. was high $30 \%$ it would be hard to know whether the reaction was -ve
Uses (characteristics)
Minimizes tendency of Rouleaux formation
Composition of commercial bovine albumen
Sodium Azide -preservative
Caprylate: - it prevents over depolymerization of the albumin
NB. Albumin is a protein -protein is amino acid
Two amino acids make a polymer /peptide
Peptides form proteins: depolymerization is breaking up of peptide bonds thus hard for reaction.
The albumin is a colloidal medium for the ag/ab reaction. It is used in blood transfusion to increase the di-electric constant. It thus reduces the Zeta potential for ag-ab reaction. If Zeta potential is reduced the distance between cells in minimized and thus agglutination.
The force of repulsion between two cells can be reduced in two ways
Altering the media in which the cells are suspended during testing e.g. by using albumin. Always
follow the manufacturer's direction while using product like albumin
\end{abstract}

\section*{IONIC CLOUD:}
-It is a cloud of ions that surrounds each cell. If r.b.c's are suspended in saline and looked in a microscope, they appear to touch each other when viewed but they are not. This is because they are surrounded by ionic cloud.
(DIAGRAMME)
-Red cells have -ve electrostatic charges on their surface. The negative charge is due to the ionization of carboxyl group (-COOH) of the cyalic acid present on the surface (membrane of R.B.C) - which attracts positive ions from the surrounding media - e.g. Sodium from N. Saline

The positive layer attracted by the -ve layer subsequently attracts negatively charged ions to its surface e.g. Chloride ions. This process continues in layers until there is no more sufficient force to attract more ions to the cell-thus equilibrium is reached. The outer edge is then known as the surface of shear or slipping plane after reaching equilibrium
This is the effective surface of the cell in relation to the approach of another cell. When the slipping plane of one cell approaches the S.P of another the likely charges repel because they have
the same conditions /they oppose any motion towards each other. Unless these forces are counteracted the cells won't come close together even in the presence of an antibody. Since the IgM molecules are large enough they will be able to strangle the cloud and cause reaction.
Since the IgG molecules are small they are unable to join the two receptors (reacting sites) and they just block them (sensitize the red blood cells). Thus the cells are suspended in bovine albumen to / decrease Zeta potential.

\section*{Sources of error in grouping:}
- Failure to add necessary reagents
- Use of expired reagents (potency lost -false negative)
- Use of dirty glass ware (pipettes - T.T Slides )
- Failure to incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when using AHG
- Use of low cell suspension -More anti-sera used: Prozone
- Use of high cell suspension (false -ve)
- Clerical error in reporting
- Contamination of blood e.g. Bacteria (cloudy serum)
- Patient with Kalaazar and Multiple myeloma don't have factors. It is difficult to use the serum for typing
- Patients administered with Dextran 40 / Rouleaux formation -(False positive)
- Excessive centrifugation (False positive) cells pack tightly can also cause haemolysis thus when shaken they don't disintegrate
- Use of haemolysed blood specimen (false negative)
- Failure to follow manufactures instructions.

\section*{ABH SYSTEM:}

Genes at three separate loci ( $\mathrm{ABO}, \mathrm{Hh}$, and Se ) control the occurrence and the location of the A and B antigens. Three common alleles ( $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and O ) are located on the ABO locus on chromosome 9.
The A and B genes encode glycosyltransferases that produce the A and B antigens respectively. The O gene does not encode a functional enzyme. The red cells of group O persons lack A and B antigens, but carry an abundant amount of H antigen, the precursor material on which A and B antigens are built.
Genes at the other two loci Hh and Se (Secretor) are on chromosome 19, and are closely linked. Each locus has two recognized alleles one of which has no demonstrable product and is considered an amorph. The active allele at the H locus, H , produces a glycosyltransferase that acts at the cellular level to form H antigen on which A or B is built. The amorph, h , is very rare. The Se gene is directly responsible for the expression of H , which may then be modified to express A and B on the glycoproteins (antigens) in epithelial secretions such as saliva.

Eighty per cent of the population are secretors. Secretors have inherited the Se gene and their secreted glycoproteins express H , which can be converted to A and / or B if they also have the A and / or B gene. The amorph is called šē.
The ABH system is the system that determine the existence of $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H antigens the formation of these antigens depends on presence of $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H genes these genes are responsible for the formation of the respective antigens however H gene is the most important in this system.

\section*{The role of gene $\mathbf{H}$ :}

The H gene produces a transferase (fucosyltransferase) that adds fucose (Fuc) to the precursor substance.
This gene is inherited independent of ABO gene. The H gene is the first gene that acts on the basic material and therefore it is responsible for the formation of A and B antigens. The basic material is the precursor substance.

\section*{Composition of the precursor substance.}

Precursor substances are macromolecules, which are composed of peptide backbone, or polypeptide carbohydrates chains that are attached irrespective of specificity within the ABO blood group system. Each macromolecule contains the following
-L-fucose
-D-galactose
-N-acetyl galactosamine
In addition to the above it has fifteen (15) amino acids
The actual specificity of the molecule is determined by the actual sugar occurring at the end of the molecule (antigen) terminal sugar, thus making it able either to react with antibody A or antibody B

\section*{Transferase:}

An enzyme that catalyses addition of specific sugar units to give A B and H. The enzymes are also specific for A B and H .
-The H gene acts on the precursor substance by addition of its terminal sugar L -fucose and thus making it $\mathbf{H}$ active substance.
The H active substance forms a substrate to which another Transferase specific enzyme adds its sugar. After the addition of another sugar there is the formation of A and/or B antigen.
The H -active substance must be formed first by the formation of at least one H -gene in order for the sugars to be attached in response to an inherited ABO genes

\section*{A and B transferases add specific sugars to oligosacchide chains that have been converted to H by the fucosyltransferase produced by the H gene.}

The number of potential $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H sites on the red cells is thought to be in excess of two million.

\section*{Role of gene A:}

The A-gene encodes for the production of glycosyltransferase enzyme which adds N -acetylgalactosamine (GAINAc) sugar to the H-active substance. This structure is responsible for Aspecificity, consecutively blood group A
This sugar converts the H -active substance to A antigen.
The A-gene tends to elicit higher concentration of glycosyltransferase than the B-gene. This leads to one conversion of all the H -antigens on the red cells to A -antigens sites as many as $1,000,000$ to $1,700,000$ antigens sites exist on any adult red cells in response to inherited Agenes.

\section*{Role of gene B:}

The B-gene encodes for the production of D-galactosyl-transferase enzyme that transfers Dgalactose (Gal) sugar to the H -active substance. This sugar is responsible for the B-specificity. Anywhere from 600,000 to 830,000 B-antigen sites exist on B-adult red cells, in response to the conversion of the H -antigen by the glycosyltransferase elicited by the B-gene.
Blood group AB is got by addition of both sugars -N -acetylgalactosamine and D -galactose. When A and B genes are both inherited B enzymes seems to compete more efficiently for the H structure and the A enzymes is not as successful. Therefore the average number of A-antigens on an AB adult is approximately 600,000 sites.

\section*{Role of gene O:}

Gene O is an amorph (silent gene) therefore it doesn't add any terminal sugar to the H- active substance and thus we get blood group O . It has H antigens only-Highest concentration, because none is acted upon.

\section*{Reaction with Anti- $H$}
$\mathrm{O}>\mathrm{A}_{2}>\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}>\mathrm{B}>\mathrm{A}_{1}>\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$

\section*{BOMBAY PHENOTYPE ( $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ )}

It was first discovered in Bombay in 1952 by Dr. Y. M. Bhende. It is due to con-sanguineous marriages. It is a very rare blood group. Individuals with this blood group are devoid of all ABO antigens (antigen) because they lack H gene which converts precursor substance to H -active substance which would be charged to $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H in the presence of ABO genes
The term 'Bombay' has been used for the phenotype in which red cells lack H , A and B because examples of such red cells were first discovered in Bombay, India. The symbol $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ has been selected to denote the phenotype because results of routine ABO typing tests mimic those of blood group ' O ' persons. $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ red cells are not agglutinated by anti H , anti A and anti B reagents, and the serum contains a strong anti H , anti A and anti B . The $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ phenotype becomes apparent when serum of $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ person is tested against group O red cells, and strong immediate-spin agglutination and / or haemolysis occur. The anti-H of an $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ person reacts over a wide thermal range (4 $\left.37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ persons must be transfused only with $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ blood because their non-red-cells stimulated
antibodies rapidly destroy cells with A B or H antigens. At the genotype level, the $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ phenotype arises from the inheritance of hh at the H locus and se/se at the Se-locus.
The genotype hh is usually with individuals of consanguineous (relatives) marriages.
Bombay phenotypes are all non-secretors of ABH substances
Bombay individuals are Non-secretors, although they have Se/Se genes -Se/se genes (former homozygous later heterozygous) this is because they lack the H gene
ABO Genes are present but because individuals have hh genes there is no formation of ABH antigens.
They posses all antibodies Anti A, Anti B and Anti H

\section*{Difference between group O and Bombay}

Group the two blood groups with Anti-H
- Bombay blood group
- Blood group O

\section*{Grouping}

\begin{tabular}{llllllll} 
& \multicolumn{2}{c}{ Cell grouping } & \multicolumn{3}{c}{ Serum grouping } & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ bl } \\
Anti A & Anti B & Anti H & A cells & B cells & O cells & \\
- & - & - & + & + & +++ & $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{h}}$ \\
- & - & +++ & + & + & - & O
\end{tabular}

Blood group O contains H antigens and hence will react with Anti H in a Bombay individual. Thus a Bombay individual should be cross -matched and transfused with blood from another Bombay individual

\section*{Characteristics of Anti-H in Bombay individuals:}

It has a wide reacting range. $+4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
It reacts weakly or not at all with $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ or $\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ cells due to the little H antigens present but reacts strongly with O cells.
$\mathrm{O}>\mathrm{A}_{2}>\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}>\mathrm{B}>\mathrm{A}_{1}>\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$
Anti H can also be found in the serum of blood group $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ and blood group $\mathrm{A}_{1} \mathrm{~B}$ individuals
Anti H can be obtained from Lectins e.g. Ulex europaeus

\section*{BLOOD GROUP SPECIFIC SUBSTANCES:}
$\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H in tissue and body fluids.
There are antigens found in body fluids, not on the RBCS. They are also referred to as soluble antigens, and they are found suspended in body fluids e.g. saliva, gastric juice, semen, amniotic fluid, ovarian cyst fluid. It can also be found in sweat, urine, tears, bile and milk i.e. in all body fluids except C.S.F.

The most rich and mostly available source of blood group specific substances (BGSS) is saliva, and thus it is used for detection of the presence of these substances.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF SOLUBLE ANTIGENS.}
- Used for the detection of the red cells agglutinogen in blood samples in which the r.b.c's are damaged and have failed to agglutinate properly e.g. Leukaemia Patients who have cellular antigens deformed
- In forensic medicine / detection of antigens in blood stains
- Neutralization test / for screening a universal donor
- To determine presence of immune anti-A and immune anti-B this is because the two cannot be neutralized during the test.

\section*{SECRETORS / NON SECRETORS:}

The Se gene and its allele šē are inherited independently of ABO and H-genes. Se/Se and še- šē genotype is given the name secretor and non-secretor respectively. The Se/Se system regulates the formation of H -antigen and, subsequently, of A and B antigens in secretory cells. People who inherit šē / šē genes are termed "non-secretors". The H-specific transferase (Lfucosyltransferase) is found only in the secretors, indicating that the secretor genes control the expression of the H gene in the secretory cells. The Se gene does not, however, affect the formation of $A, B$ or $H$ antigens on the red cell. The Se gene does not control the presence of $A, B$ or H transferases in haematopoietic tissue. In fact, A or B transferases enzymes, unlike A or B glycoprotein substances or antigens, are found in the secretions of A or B individuals regardless of their secretor status. However, it is the presence of the H -gene specific L -fucosyltransferase (which is dependant on the inheritance of the Se gene) that determines whether ABH soluble substances will be secreted in as much as H -substance must be synthesized prior to the formation of A or B substance.

Secretors are individuals who have blood group specific substances in their body fluids while Non secretors lack the blood group specific substances
About $80 \%$ of the population are secretors and the remaining $20 \%$ non -secretors
The secretion of blood group specific substances is controlled by a pair of allelomorphic genes $\mathrm{Se} / \mathrm{Se}$. The Se is dominant over se gene i.e. if Homozygous Se/ Se or heterozygous Se/se you are a secretor.
There are three types of secretors
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/4f93a461-9cf1-439f-9600-7257c2abf6eb-037.jpg?height=111&width=339&top_left_y=2324&top_left_x=618)
$$\text { se/se- } 20 \%$$

There is evidence that there are two distinct groups of blood group specific substances
- Water soluble -glycoproteins / normally present in the body fluids
- Alcohol soluble - glycolipids / present in RBC's and almost all other tissues but antibodies in body fluids
The water form of blood group specific substance is controlled by the secretor gene whereby the alcohol soluble is not controlled
Secretors will either secrete A, B or H specific substances the secretion is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{lc} 
Blood group & blood group specific \\
$A$ & $A+H$ \\
$B$ & $B+H$ \\
$A B$ & $A+B+H$ \\
$O$ & $H$
\end{tabular}

Normal antigens are not soluble / present on RBCS.
The blood group specific substances can be obtained from:
- human beings
- Hog pepsin -very rich immunoglobulin A
- Gastric lining of a house -mostly B

\section*{DETECTION OF BLOOD GROUP SPECIFIC SUBSTANCES:}

Based on the fact that the soluble antigens are capable of dissolving / neutralizing specific corresponding antibodies; A antibody and A antigen $/ \mathrm{B}$ ag \& B antibody
Saliva is mostly used / easily available for the test of blood group specific substances
Immune antibodies are not neutralized but natural antibodies are neutralized.
Detection procedure consists of two phases;
- collection \& preparation of saliva
- screening test / neutralization test

\section*{Collection and preparation of saliva}

Rinse the mouth using water
Collect about 5 mls of saliva in a test tube
Boil the saliva in boiling water bath for 10 minutes / to remove enzymes
Take the tube and centrifuge / 1000 rpm
Pipette out the clear supernatant to a clean test tube

\section*{Neutralization Test}

Procedure
Label test tubes A B H
Dilute anti sera A-1:16
B-1:16
H-1:2
Dilute using N. Saline
$\left.\begin{array}{ll}\text { - } & \text { Antisera A is added to tube A } \\ \text { - } & \text { Antisera B is added to tube B } \\ \text { - } & \text { Antisera H is added to tube H }\end{array}\right\} \quad$ one drop
- In each tube add one drop of saliva
- Mix and incubate at room temp for 10 minutes
- Add at least one drop of respective cells A-cells, B-cells and O-cells.
- Incubate at RT for 30-60 minutes
- Centrifuge and examine for agglutination
- Set your control secretors and Non secretors
- Table your results / Read your results
- -When there is agglutination the test is negative (non-secretor)
- -When there is no agglutination the neutralization test is positive (secretor)

If there is agglutination it indicates a non secretor i.e. the diluted Anti-A, B\& H were not neutralized thus a negative neutralization test
If no agglutination the individual is a secretor i.e. Anti $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and H were neutralized thus we have a positive neutralization test.

\section*{How a universal donor is screened using the Neutralization test:}

Reagent required
- Donors serum (blood group O individual)
- Known A and B cells
- Specific substances A and B

\section*{Procedure}
-Label two test tubes A and B
-Add two drops of donor's serum in both tubes
-Add two drops of specific substances A \& B to respective tubes
-Incubate at R.T. for 30 minutes for neutralization to take place
-Add known A and B cells to respective tubes
-Mix / centrifuge and look for agglutination

\section*{Results}

Agglutination - negative neutralization test -Dangerous Universal Donor
No Agglutination - positive neutralization test -Universal Donor

If natural Anti-A \& B are added they react with respective soluble antigens. Immune antibodies are not neutralized by blood group specific substances. When the cells are added there is a reaction (agglutination) due to immune antibodies
Known A and B cells are used to confirm antibodies are not neutralized by blood group specific substances.

\section*{TYPES OF IMMUNIZATION}

Immunization is a process by which antibodies are produced in response to antigenic stimulus. It involves the immune mechanism. There are three types of immunization

\section*{Iso-immunization}

It is the production of antibodies after the antigenic simulation of a member of the same species e.g. A person who is blood group A-negative is transfused with person with A-positive he's going to be stimulated and produces antibodies against D antigens. Antibodies involved in Isoimmunization are iso-agglutinins. They are also referred to as Allo-agglutinins.

\section*{Hetero-immunization}

It is the production of antibodies after antigenic stimulation from different species like in Coombs reagent production. Hybrid-rabbits are injected with human serum (Immunoglobulins) and the rabbit produces anti human globulin (antibodies) otherwise called AHG or Coomb's reagent. Antibody involved in hetero immunization is hetero-agglutinin.

\section*{Auto Immunization}

It is the production of antibodies against ones cells auto haemolytic reaction. This is due to:
Malfunction of the thymus glands
Patients with auto haemolytic anaemia
They can cause problem during blood transfusion. The anti body which reacts with the individual's antigen is referred to as auto-antibody

\section*{ANTI HUMAN GLOBULIN (COOMBS) SERA \\ Preparation}

There are several animals used for preparation of A.H.G. The rabbit is the most commonly used.
It can also be prepared from goats and sheep. Not all strains of rabbits are good for A.H.G preparation. Brown rabbit (Hybrid-type) are mostly used
This is achieved by use of purified human sera e.g. -Gamma globulins
-Beta globulin
Adjuvants are the compounds used to increase the production of A.H.G.

\section*{Examples of adjuvants -}
- Ammonium sulphate (saturated or $40 \%$ )-
- Freud's Adjuvant,
- Sodium alignate.

Human group O serum pooled from several donors is used. The rabbit is injected with purified gamma globulin or human Beta globulin in either one of the adjuvants. The rabbit is normally injected in the peritoneal area (cavity area). Afterward Calcium chloride ( $\mathrm{Cacl}_{2}$ ) is injected and the area is massaged. Massaging is done to prevent swelling. It also helps adjuvant mixed to flow properly.
The A.H.G can be prepared from separate colonies. Beta globulin or globulin can be used. One colony is injected with human Gamma globulin. The other colony is injected with human Beta globulin. It produces antibodies specific for B-globulin e.g. compliment-component (reacts with compliment component). The two are blended to come up with poly-specific reagent
-When a reagent is prepared separately it is known as mono-specific. If combined together they are referred to as poly-specific or broad-spectrum A.H.G. Broad spectrum A.H.G detects both immunoglobulins and compliment-components.

\section*{Principle behind A.H.G.}

When the anti-sera is added to the sensitized cells (cells attached with antibodies) the rabbits an-ti-IgG molecules attach their antigen binding pieces to the F.C.P's (fragment crystallization pieces) of the coated cells resulting to agglutination.
In a similar manner the rabbit anti-compliment attaches to the compliment-component and since the compliment is attached to the red cell haemolysis occurs.
Anti human globulin doesn't react with antigen it just forms bridges for agglutination to the sensitized red blood cells.

\section*{COOMBS TESTS:}

Any method using Coomb's (AHG) reagent is Coomb's test.
They are of two major types.
- Direct Coomb's test
- Indirect Coomb's test

\section*{DIRECT COOMB'S TEST}

It is a test used for detection of sensitized cells in vivo. Under normal circumstances there are no sensitized cells found in the body.
Sensitized red blood cells are fond in;
- Children born with H.D.N.B (Haemolytic disease of the new born).
- Patients with Haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) Also
- Auto immune haemolytic anaemia AIHA
- Acquired haemolytic anaemia:

\section*{Procedure}

Label test tube Direct Coomb's
Put two drops of test cells in a clean grouping tube 8 mmx 75 mm
Wash the test cells with large amounts of normal saline for about three times.
Discard the last wash of N. saline completely
Add two drops of A.H.G.
Mix and centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min (3000 for 20 seconds)
Examine for agglutination/haemolysis
Record results:
If agglutination record Direct Coomb's test positive
If no agglutination record Direct Coomb's test -ve
Set positive and -ve control
In positive control we use coated (sensitized red cells). Prepared by diluting AntiD 1:20 with Normal-saline and making 5\% cell suspension using this solution.

\section*{INDIRECT COOMB'S TEST:}

The test is used to detect the presence of sensitized cells in vitro. Therefore it is used to detect antibodies in serum using known antigens e.g. O-positive pooled cells or panel cells or reagent cells.

\section*{Significance}

Cross -match to detect incompatibility
Detection and identification of irregular antibodies (immune antibodies)

\section*{Indirect Coomb's test has three stages}
- Sensitization
- Washing cells to free from all globulin
- Mixing washed cells with A.H.G

\section*{Procedure}

Label test tube as I.C. (Indirect Coomb's)
Make a 4\% cell suspension of O positive pooled cells
Add two drops of cell suspension into a test tube
Add 2 drop of patient's serum
Mix and incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $30-60$ minutes (sensitization)
Wash contents with large volumes of normal saline and discard the last wash
Add two drops of A.H.G. to re-suspend the cell.
Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for one minute
Examine for agglutination. Both macro and microscopically
Record results

If agglutination is present record Indirect Coomb's test= positive
If no agglutination is present record Indirect Coomb's Test $=$ negative.

\section*{COMMENT}

Positive test is due to presence of immune antibodies
Negative test $=$ no immune antibodies in the test serum

\section*{ANTI BODY SCREENING TEST:}

Test done to detect irregular antibodies in vitro. (Immune antibodies) the test is done on women suspected to be immunized and would like to get pregnant, or patients who have undergone multiple transfusions and is suspected to be immunized and requires blood transfusion.
Conditions indicating presence of irregular antibodies where antibody screening is requested are;
- Jaundice in new born
- Incompatible cross match
- blood transfusion reaction

Antibody screening test has six phases
- $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- RT
- A $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- $\mathrm{C} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- $\mathrm{S} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Enzyme. (Apply Enzyme technique)
$4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ PHASE; Detects cold antibodies which react at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ Anti-I, Anti-i, anti-M, N etc.
RT PHASE also detects cold antibodies Anti I and Anti $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ react strongly at low temp. $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Anti A anti B, (complete Anti -A and B) react well at RT.
Most of the immune antibodies are detected at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Technique used in screening test}

Requirements / Reagents
- Test Serum
- $\mathrm{O}^{+}$pooled cells, or panel cells or Selectogen I \& II
- Albumen

Incubate the tubes at respective temperatures $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{RT}$ for 1 hr. - this is to allow reaction to take place at optimum temp.
Wash the Coombs test tube in large volumes of normal saline X3, Add A.H.G (two drops) Centrifuge the test tubes and look for agglutination.

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
$4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & RT & $\mathrm{S} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{A} 37^{0} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{C} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & $\mathrm{ENZYME} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & \\
- & - & - & - & ++ & +++
\end{tabular}

Presence of immune (irregular) antibodies

\section*{PERFORM ANTIBODY IDENTIFICATION TEST:}

This is to identify the particular antibody present in the serum / encountered during screening test. The identification of an antibody is based on the characteristic of the particular antibody. It is also based on the media at which it reacted and the temp e.g. C37 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. (Coombs @ $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) In identification panel cells are used e.g. panel cells in Rh system: They include
1. $\mathrm{Rh}_{0}$, (2) $\mathrm{Rh}_{1}$, (3) $\mathrm{Rh}_{2}$,
(4) $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{z}}$, (5) rh, (6) rh ${ }^{1}$, (7) rh ${ }^{\mathrm{ii}}$, (8) rh ${ }^{\mathrm{y}}$

\section*{Procedure}

Label 8 test tubes according to panel cells "Weiners"
Add two drops of serum to all test tubes
Add two drops of panel cells according to the test tubes / respective test
Add two drops Albumin -if occurred at $\mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
Incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 60 min
Read for agglutination

\begin{tabular}{llllllll}
$\mathrm{Rh}_{0}$ & $\mathrm{Rh}_{1}$ & $\mathrm{Rh}_{2}$ & $\mathrm{Rh}_{\mathrm{z}}$ & rh & rh' & rh" $^{\prime}$ & rh $^{\mathrm{y}}$ \\
+ & + & + & + & - & - & - & -
\end{tabular}

Indicates presence of irregular AntiD

Indicates C

Indicates c

Negative all over. -Could be due to anti A or anti B

\section*{TITRATION OF ANTIBODY}

It's a test that determines the titre / strength relative amount of ab in serum against corresponding antigen. The titre of antibodies is acquired by making serial dilutions in a media that has been selected as the most suitable.
Factors that affects the antibody titration
Media e.g. when saline is used as a diluent, red cells should be suspended in saline /if high protein diluent is used, $20 \%$ albumin is also used to suspend. The characteristic of the ab determines the media to be used.

\section*{Dilutions used /not excess}

When performing dilutions, separate graduated pipette should be used to avoid carry over of antibodies also rinse the pipette after each transfer. If dealing with high titred serum, as little as 0.0005 ml carried over would cause a change in entry.

\section*{Incubation temperature \& time}

Governed by the characteristic of the antibody.

\section*{Centrifugation}

Might cause haemolysis (over centrifugation) or lack of agglutination. (Under centrifugation)

\section*{Red cells}

Test red cells should be freshly prepared, preferably from the donors, homozygous for the antigenic determinant concerned /or from the most strongly reacting type of cells available. Avidity of cells should be known
After performing the test, results should be Read macroscopically.
Also Readings are taken from test tube labelled 512 to test tube labelled 1

\section*{Techniques}

\section*{Purpose of titrating:}
- Test the potency of serum in ABO typing / high titred serum is the most potent -strong
- To screen for blood give O-negative donor distinguish between dangerous universal donor and some universal donor / low titre is a save universal donor.
- To check the strength of an offending antibody (anti-D) in HDNB,

\section*{Comments:}

The donor is safe universal donor.
Serum for typing will be acquired from a person of high titre e.g. 1:128 and above.

\section*{TITRATION OF ANTI-D (RH SYSTEM). Purpose.}

Determine good antiserum to use in Rh typing.
Ante-natal clinic to predict occurrence of H.D.N.B by monitoring the immunization of an Rhnegative mother who has developed immune anti-D.
PROCEDURE
Similar to that of anti A and anti B except that $20 \%$ albumin is used and test tubes are incubated $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $30-60$ minutes.
Sources of error in anti D titration.
- Poor technique for serial dilution / avoid air bubble in Pasteur pipettes. Rinsing of Pasteur pipettes between dilutions.
- Using very old reagents-expired.
- Failure to incubate long enough and at the required temperature.

\section*{ELUTION:}

Elution frees antibody from sensitised red cells and recovers antibody in a usable form. OR: This is the removal of antibodies that has been antibodiesorbed onto the red cells, either in vivo or in vitro. The product of elution is known as eluates. In elution, we use AB serum as a diluent or $6 \%$ bovine albumen. If not available saline can be used but potency of antibodies is deteriorated. In cases of HDNB or HTR's, specific antibody (or antibodies) is usually detected in the eluate, which may or may not be detectable in the serum.
Application from elution in blood transfusion
1. Elution techniques are used to demonstrate an identify the antibody on the red cells of umbilical cord blood, or infants blood, in case of H.D.N.B when mothers serum is not available. The eluate can be used from the baby's blood cells to perform compatibility test eluates is antibody delivered from elution.
2. Used to demonstrate and identify antibodiesorbed antibodies on the red cells of pts with acquired haemolytic anaemia.
3. Used to demonstrate and identify antibodies coating transfused red cells in suspected haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR's).
4. To separate and identify an antibody in a mixture of antibodies
5. Confirmation of antibody specificity

\section*{Techniques:}

There are three methods commonly used in elution
1. Rubin's ether method.
2. Heat elution Landsteiner and Muller method
3. Weiner freeze and thaw method (Lui)
4. Methylene chloride elution
5. Glycine-HCL EDTA elution
6. Cold acid elution.

\section*{HEAT ELUTION METHOD:}

\section*{Landsteiner and Muller:}

Principle: Heat_elution uses an increase in temperature to dissociate antibodies from red cells. Mostly used for ABO HDNB.
- Wash the cells (clot) / sensitised six times.
- Make sure the supernatant is removed completely.
- To one volume of packed cells, use one volume of the suspending media (serum or $6 \%$ Bovine albumin).
- Mix well and incubate @ $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a water bath for about $10-20$ mins agitating the mixture frequently during incubation.
- Immediately transfer the tube to a pre-warm centrifuge bucket at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at a high speed. (3000 r.p.m.)
- Remove the Hb tinted supernatant and place in another tube. This is the eluate

\section*{RUBINS ETHER METHOD:}
- Wash the cells 4-6 times in Normal saline.
- Add an equal volume of N. saline and mix.
- Add di-ethyl-ether reagent equal to the total volume of cells and N. saline.
- Stopper the test tube and mix by inversion for 1 min .
- The mixture is then incubated @ $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 mins .
- Centrifuge @ 3000 rpm (speed) for 5 mins .
- The tube will have three layers
- The first layer has red cells stroma.
- Second, layer Di-ethyl ether.
- The bottom layer constitutes eluate.

Aspirate and discard the top two layers. OR by use of a long Pasteur pipette access the eluate and aspirate.
Transfer eluate to another tube and incubate @ $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 mins to drive off residuals Diethylether. Or bubble air through at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 mins .

\section*{Principle}

Di- ethyl ether lyses cells.
Disadvantages eluate is heavily stained with Hb that one might think lysing has not occurred.

\section*{LUI FREEZE-THAW ELUTION:}

PRINCIPLE: As RBC's freeze, extracellular ice crystals form that attract water from their surroundings.
This increases the osmolarity of the remaining extracellular fluid, which then attracts water from the red cells. The red cells shrink, resulting in lysis. As the membranes are disrupted, antibody is dissociated. This method is used for investigation of ABO HDNB.

\section*{Procedure.}

DAT positive red cells washed six times with Normal Saline.
Mix 0.5 mls of red cells to be tested with 3 drops of saline in a test tube.
Cap the test tube, and then rotate the tube to coat the tube wall with cells.
Place the tube in a freezer at ${ }^{-} 20$ to ${ }^{-} 70^{0} \mathrm{C}$ for 10 minutes.
Remove the tube in a freezer and thaw quickly with warm tap water.
Centrifuge for 2 minutes at $900 \times 1000 \times g$
Transfer supernatant (eluate) to a clean test tube and test in parallel with the supernatant saline from last wash.

\section*{COMPATIBILITY TEST OR CROSS MATCH}

Compatibility test is a laboratory procedure to determine ahead of time that there is serology compatibility between a blood donor and the intended recipient. This test is one of the most important tests done in a transfusion service. Great care is necessary because of its importance, since an error in cross match may not be recognized until the recipient has received part or even the entire selected unit of blood with adverse and likely fatal reactions.

\section*{Purpose of performing cross-match:}
1. To detect irregular antibodies in the recipient's serums that are directed against donor's cells. This is known as the major crossmatch
To detect donor's antibodies directed against the recipients r.b.c's. This is minor x-match.
2. To detect errors in ABO grouping
3. To detect errors in labelling, recording or identifying donors or recipients
4. Assurance of maximum benefit for the recipient receiving the blood. This is done by
(i) Preventing transfusion reaction by giving compatible blood to recipient
(ii) Prevent allo-immunization

Cross match does not:
- Ensure normal survival of donors r.b.c's
- Prevent iso-immunization of the pt
- Detect all the ABO grouping errors
- Detect all errors of identification

Transfusion is required in
- Surgical cases
- Anaemic patients; Thalassaemia, S.C.D.
- Haemorrhage / Accident
- H.D.N.B-exchange transfusion
- Maternity cases-elective surgery

\section*{TYPES OF X-MATCH}
(i) Major X-match
(ii) Minor X-match

\section*{Major X-match}

To check whether serum has antibodies, which will react with donor's cells. Pts serum is used \& donors cells.

\section*{Minor X-match}

To check whether donor's serum has irregular antibodies which would react with pts cells hence causing transfusion ration. Donor's serum \& pts cells are used.

\section*{Phases of X-match}

There are four phases in X-match
(i) S.R.T
(ii) $\quad \mathrm{S} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(iii) $\quad \mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(iv) $\quad \mathrm{C} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(v) Enzymes (not commonly used) because
(a) There is tendency to give false +ve due to auto-antibodies
(b) Extremely sensitive cold antibodies are detected e.g. anti P

\section*{Importance of the Phases}
(i) R.T (saline)
(i) To detect ABO incompatibility
(ii) To detect incompatibility caused by other naturally occurring antibodies
(iii) To detect incompatibility caused by the few immune antibodies that react in saline at R.T
(II) $\quad \mathrm{S} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(i) To detect saline reacting antibodies e.g. of Rh system-warm agglutinins (antibodies)
(ii) To distinguish between warm and cold antibodies
(III) A $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Detects most of Rh incomplete antibodies
(IV) $\mathrm{C} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Best techniques for the detection of most irregular antibodies
- Detects almost all Rh antibodies
- Detects most antibodies associated with haemolytic anaemia e.g. acquired haemolytic anaemia
- The only means to detect antibodies found in rare blood groups particularly antibodies found in- Duffy, Kidd, Kell blood group system

\section*{METHODS:}

There are three methods of x-match
1. 2 tube method
2. 3 tube method
3. 4 tube method

\section*{4 TUBE METHOD:}

Procedure
- label test tubes S.R.T, S37, A37, C37
- Make $4 \%$ cell suspension of donors cells and add two drops of cells to the four test tubes
- Add two drops of pts serum to each tube
- To A $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ add two drops of $20 \%$ Albumin
- Incubate the test tube to respective temperature for $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{hr}-1 \mathrm{hr}$
- Wash the Coombs cells with saline X3
- Add 1 drop of AHG and mix to resuspend the cells
- Centrifuge all test tubes and observe for agglutination record results
- If negative, label blood/pint=COMPATIBLE and put your initials/sign

\section*{3 TUBE METHOD:}

Procedure:
- Label RT, S $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and A $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Add two drops of $4 \%$ donors cell suspension to the three tubes
- Add two drops of pts serum to the three tubes
- Add two drops of bovine albumin $20 \%$ to t.t. labelled $\mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Incubate tubes at respective temps for $30-60$ minutes
- Centrifuge the tubes and examine for agglutination (centrifugation 1000 r.p.m for 1 min )

Results
- If positive (agglutination) the blood is incompatible
- If negative, convert A $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to Coombs $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Wash with large volumes of N. saline /Three times
- Add 2 drops of AHG
- Centrifuge and examine for agglutination
- Table the results
- If negative, label blood/pint=COMPATIBLE and put your initials/sign

\section*{2TUBE METHOD:}
- label the tube as R.T and $\mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Add 2 drops of $4 \%$ donors cell suspension to the two tubes
- add two drops of pts serum to both test tubes
- in a $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ add two drops $20 \%$ bovine albumin
- Incubate at respective temps test tube at $30-60 \mathrm{mins}$
- Centrifuge the t.t. and examine for agglutination

Results
- If positive the blood is incompatible
- If negative convert $\mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $\mathrm{C} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Centrifuge and examine for agg
- Tabulate results

\section*{Commenting on match}
-If all phases are ----- (minus, minus, minus) blood is compatible
If phase 1 is positive and other phases are negative, the blood can the transfused but if there is another unit that is not + ve in this phase it should be used. If with $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is weakly positive and all other phases are negative, this is due to weak antibodies Davy / Kidd / Kell that can cause delayed extravascular HTR's. To be on blood for transfusion that is positive

\section*{EMERGENCY X-MATCH}

In cases of emergency the patient's physician must weigh the risks of transfusing un-xmatched blood against the hazards of waiting for a compatibility test. If the physician/Doctor believes the urgency of situation warrants releasing of blood without x-match then it may justifiably be done. But the physician/Doctor must accept any responsibility of any incompatibility to the compatibility test ( $\mathrm{Ab} / \mathrm{Ag}$ reaction) and should put it in writing.
In urgent situation:
- Give the un x-matched blood to physician if he demands it. (He puts it in writing)
- Make sure the physician signs the release of the blood.
- Begin the routine compatibility testing procedures.
- Compare the tests as soon as possible and if incompatibility is noticed at any stage of testing, notify the physician so that he stops the transfusion.

In cases of extreme emergencies blood group O-ve with low titre is given although transfusions of such blood is not without a risk.

\section*{PROCEDURE}
- It's almost the same although time is shortened $15-30 \mathrm{mins}$.
- Four phases are in-corporated, if +ve at any step blood is incompatible warn the physician.

\section*{ERRORS IN X-MATCHING:}

False +ve reactions.
i) Poor quality of normal saline can cause false +ve reaction in x - matching.
ii) Over-centrifugation can cause false +ve reaction.
iii) Blood with fibrin clot can cause false +ve reaction.
iv) Dirty glassware.
v) Use of contaminated reagents.
vi) Slight haemolysis that goes unnoticed.

\section*{False-ve reactions}
- Failure to add serum to tubes
- Failure to incubate for right time with right reagents
- Incomplete washing of $\mathrm{A} 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, due to traces of globulin that neutralizes AHG.

\section*{SELECTION OF BLOOD FOR TRANSFUSION:}
i. Choice of ABO group

ABO is the most dangerous in causing incompatible blood transfusion. This is because over $90 \%$ of the population have Anti A or Anti B in their body, Thus the patient should receive blood of their own blood group. This minimizes possible serological reaction to the patient.
Emergencies due to clinical or shortage of certain blood in the bank it is not always possible to select homologous blood.

\section*{Group O recipients}
- If possible even when in emergency blood group A should receive from blood group A. If circumstances do not allow blood group A individual can be transfused with blood group O. Blood group A recipients are more in danger (risk) more than blood group B individual if given blood group O . This is because antibody A found in blood group O is more potent than the antibody B in blood group O. Even when blood group O is selected from a bank from which even low titre has been performed it is not advisable to give more than one or two units if it's of high titre. If of low titre, amount required can be given.

\section*{Blood group B recipients}

It is normally preferable to give the patient his own blood group. But group B individuals have a better chance of receiving blood group O than blood group A. AntiB in blood group O is not very potent.

\section*{Blood group AB recipients}

Group AB individuals were regarded to be universal recipients. AB individuals lack Antibody A \& B thus red cells of all donors are compatible with blood group AB individuals. Transfusion with blood group O should be avoided at all times. If AB donors are not available, either group A or group B blood can be used. Blood group A is likely to be more available and its anti B is slightly weaker than anti A in blood group B.
1. Choice / consideration of Rh type

Typing with anti D is a routine procedure for all recipients all D -ve individuals should receive D ve blood when the Rh -ve blood is in short supply the following have the following priority 1 pt that has Rh antibody
2. Rh -ve women not past child bearing age
3. Infant with HDNB

NB: it is very important that girls and women who are $\mathrm{Rh}-$ ve should never receive $\mathrm{Rh}+$ ve blood this is because of possible future effect on their pregnancy.

\section*{OTHER ANTIBODIES (APART FORM ANTI D)}

Atypical Antibody Present
Type of the blood to give
1. AntiD
2. Anti CD
3. Anti DE
4. Anti C is Present in O-ve pt
5. Anti E is present in O -ve pt
6. Anti C is present in O-ve pt
7. Anti C is present in O-ve pt
8. Anti Ce is present in O-ve pt

\section*{UNIVERSAL DONORS:}
U.D is an individual whose blood can be safely transfused to any other blood group. Group O dangerous blood donor exists. It's an individual blood group O of high titre (anti-A and B ). Group O individual with low titre is a safe blood donor (Below 100). The safety with which group O blood group can be administered to individuals of other than blood group O depends on the titre.
Therefore, the titre of both auto agglutinins should be screened.

\section*{SCREENING FOR A UNIVERSAL DONORS:}

\section*{There are three methods}
i. Titre for saline methods
ii. Test for haemolysis antibodies A and B
iii. Test for haemolysis (immune anti A anti B)
iv. Neutralization

\section*{Titre for saline antibodies}

\section*{Procedure}
- Make a dilution of 1:100 of donors fresh serum with N. saline e.g. 0.1 mls of O serum -9.9 mls N. saline.
- Label two test tubes as A and B.
- Add two drops of donor's diluted serum to both test tubes.
- Add two drops of known / washed A , cells to test tube labelled A and washed B cells to test tubes labelled B .
- Mix the tubes gently. Let stand at R.T for about 15 mins .
- Examine for agglutination both macro and microscopically.

\section*{Results}

The test specific for natural antibodies
No agglutination-the individual is a U.D and thus blood can be used for transfusion.
Agglutination -dangerous U.D and thus not good for transfusion.

\section*{Haemolysis}

Specific for immune anti A and B
-Undiluted serum (fresh used)

\section*{Procedure}
- label two test tubes as A and B
- Add two drops of undiluted serum to both test tube
- Add two drops of $4 \%$ known A cells to test tube A and known B cells to test-tube labelled B.
- Mix and incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for at least $15 \mathrm{mins}-1$ hour.

\section*{Results}

Haemolysis -presence of immune antibodies-Dangerous Universal Donor
No haemolysis -No presence immune antibodies -Safe U.D

\section*{NEUTRALIZATION TEST}

Immune antibodies are not usually neutralized by blood group specific, while Natural antibodies are neutralized by blood group specific substances, so that when A cells or B cells are added there is no agglutination.

\section*{How a universal donor is screened using the Neutralization test:}

Reagent required
- Donors serum (blood group O individual)
- Known A and B cells
- Specific substances A and B

\section*{Procedure}
-Label two test tubes A and B
-Add two drops of donor's serum in both tubes
-Add two drops of specific substances A \& B to respective tubes
-Incubate at R.T. for 30 minutes for neutralization to take place
-Add known A and B cells to respective tubes
-Mix / centrifuge and look for agglutination/Haemolysis

\section*{Results}

Agglutination - negative neutralization test -Dangerous Universal Donor
No Agglutination - positive neutralization test -Universal Donor

If natural Anti-A \& B are added they react with respective soluble antigens. Immune antibodies are not neutralized by blood group specific substances. When the cells are added there is a reaction (agglutination) due to immune antibodies
Known A and B cells are used to confirm antibodies are not neutralized by blood group specific substances.

\section*{UNIVERSAL RECIPIENTS}

Individuals who can receive blood group from any other blood group. They are usually AB +ve individuals.

\section*{GENERAL PROCEDURES:}

Collection of blood specimen
Requirements
Request form, which has been filled properly with
1. Pts full names
2. Hospital number / in-patients number
3. If not, ward No
4. Sex-male/female
5. Age
6. Name of Doc. signed
7. A telephone message should be accompanied by request form
-Before collection of specimen identify the patient. If the patient is unconscious one can write on the form "unknown" but immediately he regains consciousness ask his name and put it on the form. Label the specimen immediately after collection .The label should contain the following information
i. Hospital Number
ii. Date of collection
iii. Ward No (in pts)

If you did not collect the specimen -collected by Doc or Nurse check whether the label on the sample contains the same information as that on the request form. In- patients number is important because several people will have common names and may be in the same ward. If you feel, the information is contradicting and you're to perform a x-match, request for another specimen. If the sample has overstayed don't use it. It's important to always use fresh specimen/samples.
-Check for haemolysis -if present take or ask for fresh specimens.

\section*{CROSS-MATCH}

\section*{Before a cross match}
i. Check on the type of blood -select the same blood as that of the patient in terms of ABO grouping and Rhesus system.
ii. Check on the type of blood group required, plasma, white blood cells, platelets, packed cells e.t.c.
iii. Check the expiry date on the donor's pint.
iv. Inspect the donors blood in the pint -if there's haemolysis, put a label NOT TO BE USED on it. One can determine cause of haemolysis later.
v. Make sure donor's number on the pilot tube corresponds with the number on the plastic bag.

\section*{Labelling:}

Labels that will adhere effectively on a container are used. General requirements for labels are as follows:
i. Must adhere to both plastic and glass containers.
ii. Adherence should not be affected by moisture in refrigerators during period of storage.
iii. Printing on the label must be clear.
iv. Paint used / ink should not be affected by moisture.
v. If label is removed there should be evidence of removal ink used should be indelible and none leaking.
After performing x-match -small form it carries the following information
i. Name of patients
ii. In -patients number
iii. Ward/room which patient is
iv. Compatibility results
v. Put your signature/initials

Attach label tag firmly on the donor's bag. The blood is kept at $2-6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until when it is required.

\section*{Release of x-matched blood}
- Check for expiry date of the blood.
- Check for haemolysis or any other changes on the blood group turbidity fat or any other abnormal appearance on the blood, clots in the plasma, leakage at the pig tails, any change in colour to the cells.
- There should be proper identification of the patient on the card.
- The nurse has to sign that she has taken the blood, in a register.

\section*{Complications in x-matching:}
i. Rouleaux formation
ii. Pan- agglutination
iii. Poly agglutinations
iv. Auto agglutination

\section*{TRANSFUSION REACTIONS:}

Transfusion reaction is a term used to describe any unfavourable response by the patient following transfusion of blood or blood products.
They are classified into two
i. Intravascular (in blood vessels)
ii. Extravascular (liver , spleen, organs )

\section*{Intravascular.}

Intra vascular is more severe causing massive release of Hb it is usually caused by anti A and anti B, which are readily haemolytic in vitro. This severe transfusion reaction will follow transfusion with the wrong blood group e.g. a receiver of blood group A being transfused with blood group B the reaction can be fatal
Symptoms:
- Fever
- Chills
- Burning sensations
- Severe headaches
- Severe lumbar pain
- Constrictive chest pain
- Low blood pressure
- Increased pulse rate
- Sense of fainting (increase)

Other symptoms - they follow initial symptoms
- Jaundice
- Haemoglobinuria

Factors influencing severity of the intravascular reactions:
- Amount of blood transfused.
- Rate of transfusion.
- Antibodies present in the patient.
- Baby's develop antibodies in about 6 months.
- Antibodies of other blood grouped e.g. anti Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ anti Tj ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$

\section*{Extra-vascular reactions:}

It is less severe and occurs when incompatible blood has been transfused. The patient plasma does not have an antibody capable of activating compliments.

\section*{Symptoms involved are:}

Mild fever
Chills it may occur after a whole pint has been given. Causes DHTR's (Delayed Haemolytic Transfusion Reactions). The mechanism of a cell removal involves neutrophils (engulfing macrophages engulfing the cells Antibody coated cells are phagocytosed and removed by the tissue bound macrophages. In most cases, there might not be haemolysis. Antibodies involved are such as Rhesus, Kell, Kidd and Duffy blood group systems. The reaction occur in spleen, liver and lymph nodes.

\section*{DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTRA AND EXTRA VASCULAR REACTION Intravascular. \\ Extravascular.}

Occurs in the veins.
Very severe
Immediate red cell destruction releasing a
lot of Hb to the plasma

Immediate increase in Hb by-products
e.g. bilirubin
Haemolysis is always present

Occurs in the R.E.S. organs
Not very severe
Slow rate of red cell destruction,
no immediate increase of blood products

Bilirubin may not be present in
DHTR's
There might be no haemolysis

\section*{3. FEBRILE REACTIONS:}

Due to bacteria products / toxins.
It is brought about by pyogens -bacteria.
The pt feels unwell and has fever and chills temperature rises rapidly in the patient.
They are caused by:
-Anti leukocyte and antiplatelet antibodies
-Use of unclean tubes.

\section*{4. ALLERGIC REACTIONS:}

Most common and they are the least dangerous reactions / due to tissue bound antibodies.
Signs: Urticaria rashes
Rx -administering cortisones

It is good to take the history of the patient before transfusion.

\section*{5. OTHER CAUSES OF AB/AG REACTION:}
N.B. Don't administer any drugs when transfusing.

Ensure you do not cause circulatory overload / should be avoided because it can cause cardiac arrest.
Expired blood or haemolysed blood (pt develops jaundice within 12--24 hours) plasma levels of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in ACD -Acid citrate dextrose is distorted after 21days. It can keep for 21 days.
Adenocide -keeps for 35 days.
-gives energy to red blood cells.
Frozen blood should NEVER be given.
Wrong anticoagulant should be avoided.

\section*{6. ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION: (very rare)}

Occurs to pts with 1gA deficiency. Thus the pt forms compliment binding e.g. IgG. The reaction is rare but when it occurs it has very severe symptoms e.g.
- Laryngeal oedema
- Chills
- Fever sweating

Avoid the problem by transfusing plasma free blood IgA deficient blood and also washed cells.

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS AFTER TRANSFUSION REACTION:}

Specimen: Blood / pre sample -cells and serum
Post sample-clotted and un-clotted
Remains of donors pint-that was transfused
Urine sample (for spectroscopy \& Iron stain)

\section*{PROCEDURE:}

Forward and reverse grouping to rule out mis-grouping
Repeat crossmatch using patient's samples and donors samples-Rules out any antibody which would react.
Perform direct Coombs test to the post sample
-detects antibodies coating the cells in vivo (sensitized cells)
AB screening test / detects presence of antigens performed on all samples of blood.
Antibody titration -to know the level of reacting antibodies.
On urine perform spectroscopy and stain for iron PPB on the deposit.
Hb-Will be low
Peripheral blood film
Schistocytes are observed -fragments of blood cells
Bilirubin level -serum of post sample

Urine after centrifugation
-check for iron (stain)
-presence of bile pigments
On remains of pint:
-check for haemolysis.
-culture for bacteria.
After a month and if the patient develops jaundice, perform hepatitis B surface antigen test.

\section*{PREPARATION OF ANTISERA:}

Normally preparation of antiserum is done in specialized reference laboratories. There are four points to consider:
i. Potency
ii. Avidity
iii. Specific
iv. Free from Rouleaux
v. Free from contamination
vi. Not turbid

The antisera should be tested for the above four things it must contain a powerful antibody that reacts only with the red cells carrying the corresponding antigen.

\section*{CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING SERUMS SUITABILITY POTENCY}

\section*{1. Titre}

This is the strength of the antisera. It should have a titre of at least 1:256

\section*{1. Avidity}

This is a measure of avidity, the speed at which antisera agglutinates red cells. The avidity is determined by adding one drop of $10 \%$ saline suspension of washed red cells to an equal volume of antiserum to a microscope slide or a glass tile. Record the time it takes for the cells to agglutinate. Repeat this three times and then take an average. Should be less than 10 seconds

\section*{2. Specificity}

The antisera should react with the corresponding antigen. A-cells B-cells and O-cells are used. Anti-A should react with only A-cells etc

\section*{3. Rouleaux formation}

Check under a microscope x4 to ensure it is true agglutination

The antisera should be free from fat since it gives antisera a turbid appearance falsely suggesting presence of bacteria.

\section*{-If plasma is used to prepare antisera:}
i. Recalcification
ii. Adsorption of fibrinogen (Kaolin and Benfonile)

\section*{Recalcification}
- place the separated plasma in an incubator @ $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 mins .
- Add 2 mls of calcium chloride for each 100 mls of plasma
- The mixture is left for half hour $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{hr}$ to allow clot to form.
- The clot broken by shaking and left in an incubator for $1 \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{hr}$.
- The fluid is stored at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ centigrade overnight.
- Sterilize by passing through muslin.

Steps involved in preparation of Antisera
i. Identify the source of antisera (sheep/horse/rabbit)
ii. Titrate to test the strength of antiserum by steps likely to be used routinely.
iii. Select suitable antisera according to criteria laid down.

\section*{ADSORPTION:}

This is the removal of an antibody from a serum by adsorption on to red cells that have the corresponding antigen determinants, hence an adsorbed serum is serum from which antibodies have been sorely removed.

\section*{Purpose of adsorption in blood transfusion:}
i. Adsorption is used un separating antibodies in sera containing several antibodies
ii. Used in the identification of antibodies
iii. Used in confirmation of antibody specificity
iv. Preparation of typing antisera
v. Used as a preliminary step in preparation of eluates. Elution / removal of antibodies adsorbed in the red cells
vi. Confirmation of the presence of antigens on the red cells.

\section*{Adsorption procedures}

Preparation of adsorbed anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ serum
Reagents
$\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cells, $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ cells B serum and O serum $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ serum $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ serum.
Anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ can be isolated from the blood group $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{A}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$.

\section*{Procedure}

Select and wash $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ cells in large volumes of saline for three times depending on what blood group you are using. Blood group B serum use $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cells. Blood group O serum use $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ cells.
Select either blood group B serum group O serum from healthy donors / the blood is clotted to get the serum.
NB: suitable titre for A is 1:512.
Titration of anti A is performed, first to determine the titre.
- in a large test tube / universal bottle combine 2 mls of group B serum and 1 ml packed $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cells / for O serum 2 mls of O serum and 1 mls of packed $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ cells
- Mix the contents gently.
- Incubate at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 hours or overnight.
- Centrifuge the mixture in chilled centrifuge cups, remove the supernatant serum immediately and put it in a clean test tube labelled "ADSORBED ANTI $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ "
- Test for specificity of anti $A$, with $A_{1}$ cells $A_{2}$ cells $A_{2}$ or $A_{1} B$ cells $A_{2} B$ cells.

\section*{Principles:}

Preparation of anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ serum is based on the fact that $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cells and $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}$ cells both have antigenic sites for the anti A to attach itself. Thus living the anti $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ in the supernatant which is not attached to the cells.

\section*{LECTINS:}

Lectins are extracts from certain plants normally from the seeds of particular plants. These extracts are capable of causing agglutination of the red bld cells. The agglutination is not specific in most cases (can react c any antigens present). Not all the extracts, some show blood group specificity. It is important to note that the extracts are not antibodies but they have a similar effect as antibodies they are thus referred to as phytoagglutins. There are many types of phytoagglutins. But the two most commonly used are:
1. Dolichos biflorous (Indian cattle bean) house gram/grain. Its specificity shows a reaction similar to antibody $\mathrm{A}_{1}$-Aggregates $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ cells.
2. Ulex europaeus (common gorse) it has Anti H specificity can agglutinate O cells but not Bombay cells.

\section*{THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM:}

\section*{DEFINITION}

A term applied to a system of 25 to 30 serum and membrane proteins that act in a cascading manner similar to coagulation, fibrinolytic and kinin systems to produce numerous biologic effects. The participating proteins remain inactive until an event initiates the process, following which the product of one reaction becomes the catalyst for the next step. Each evolving enzyme or complex can act on multiple substrate molecules, creating the potential for tremendous amplification of an initially modest or localized event.

\section*{Complement's major roles are}
- Promotion of acute inflammatory events
- Alteration of surfaces so that phagocytosis is enhanced
- Modification of cell membranes, leading to cell lyses
- Making bacteria / viruses / fungi more susceptible to phagocytosis
- Directly lysing some bacteria and foreign cells
- Producing chemotactic substances
- Increasing vascular permeability
- Causing smooth muscle contraction promoting mast cell degranulation

These actions cause destruction of bacteria, protect against viral infection, eliminate protein complexes and enhance development of immune events.
However, activation of complement can also initiate inflammatory and immune processes that may harm the host cells, especially those in the blood.
Their major role in transfusion sciences is to take part in foreign blood cell lyses.

Different mechanisms exist for activating the complement cascade; the classical pathway, which is situated by interaction between an antibody and its antigen, and the alternative pathway, which is not antibody mediated.

\section*{Sites of Production}
- Liver.
- Lymph nodes.
- Bone marrow.
- Intestinal tissues.
- Macrophages situated at the peritoneal.

\section*{Characteristics:}
1. Very unstable:
2. Destroyed by heat @ $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min .
3. Inactivated by storage for long periods.
4. $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ can maintain for $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$.
5. Always fresh samples are used to perform tests involving complements.
6. They cause lyses of cells both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of antigen antibody components
7. Found in normal fresh serum in active state
8. Destroyed or inhibited by most anticoagulants.
9. Plasma should not be used in place of serum in serological tests involving complements. (Anti-coagulants are anticomplementary)

\section*{COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION:}

Takes place in two ways (pathways)
(i) Classical pathway
(ii) Alternate pathway OR Properdin pathway

\section*{(i) CLASSICAL PATHWAY:}

Immune complexes consisting of IgM or IgG molecules when they combine with the antigen on the red cell surface activate classical pathway.
IgM antibodies are more potent because of the pentavalent complex. For the classical pathway of complement activation to occur, an immunoglobulin must react with target antigen. Combination with antigens alters the configuration of the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin, rendering accessible an area in one of the heavy chain constant domains that interacts with the C 1 component of
complement. C1 can combine only with Ig molecules having an appropriate heavy-chain configuration. This configuration exists in the $\mu$ heavy chain and in the $\gamma$ chains in IgG subclasses 1, 2,3 and 4.
The C 1 component of complement attaches to activation sites on the Fc portion of two or more Ig monomers. The pentameric IgM molecule provides an abundance of closely configured Fc monomers: hence, a single IgM molecule can initiate the complement cascade. For IgG antibodies to activate the sequence, two separate molecules must attach to antigen sites close together. Hence, complement activation by IgG antibodies depends not only on the concentration and avidity of the antibody, but also on the topography of antigen.
Circulating C1 is a macromolecule consisting of three distinct proteins (C1q, C1r and C1s). When an antigen antibody reaction occurs, two or more chains of C 1 q attach to the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ domain of IgG or the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}} 3$ domain of the IgM. This causes a conformational change, resulting in activation of two C1r molecules into activated C1s (a strong serine esterase). The C1r, C1s and C1q complex is stabilised by $\mathrm{Ca}++$ ions. In the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}++$, the complex dissociates; hence, chelating agents often used in the laboratory such as citrate and oxalate anticoagulants prevent stabilization of the C 1 complex and subsequent activation of complement proteins.
Activated C1s works on two substrates. C1s cleaves C4 into two fragments; a large fragment (C4b) and smaller fragment (C4a) that has modest anaphylatoxic activity. Most of the C4b generated is inactivated; however, some C4b binds to the cell surface and acts as a binding site for C2. C1s also cleaves the bound C2, releasing a fragment called C2b. The C2a fragment that remains bound to C4 forms an activated complex C4b2a, also known as C3 convertase. Each C3 convertase can cleave more than 200 native C3 molecules, splitting the molecule into two fragments. A small fragment (C3a) that has anaphylatoxic activity is released into the plasma; the larger fragment (C3b) attaches to proteins and sugars on the cell surface.
The classical pathway and the alternative pathway are both means of generating a C3 convertase. Once C3 is cleaved, the same events occur in the two pathways.

\section*{(ii) ALTERNATE PATHWAY}

Also referred to as Properdin pathway
The alternate pathway allows complement activation in the absence of an antigen / antibody interaction. This pathway is a first-line antimicrobial defence for vertebrates and a mechanism whereby prevertebrates can enhance their inflammatory effectiveness.
The alternative pathway is a surface-active phenomenon that can be triggered by such initiators as:
- dialysis membranes,
- the cell wall (lipolysaccharides) of many bacteria, yeasts and viruses,
- protein complexes, including those containing antibodies such as dextran;
- some tumour cells.
- Aggregates of IgA molecules
- Enzymes e.g. Trypsin
- C3bB
- Snake venom

The alternative pathway of complement activation can also occur spontaneously in the plasma at a slow but steady rate (tick-over activation)
Four proteins participate in the alternate pathway: factor B , factor D , Properdin (factor P ) and C3. Fluid-phase C3 undergoes continuous but low level spontaneous cleavage, resulting in C3i that is rapidly inactivated by fluid-phase control proteins. If C3i encounters factor B, a complex called C 3 iB is formed and additional interactions can occur. Factor D acts on bound factor B , generating a C3iBb complex capable of cleaving C3 into C3a and C3b. most of C3b generated in the fluid phase is inactivated; however if C3b binds to a foreign surface such as a bacterial cell wall, the activation of the complement cascade can be accelerated.
When C3b binds to a cell surface, factor B is bound to give C3bB. Factor D can also react with this cell-bound substrate, releasing the small Ba fragment leaving cell-bound C 3 bBb . This complex will dissociate unless it is stabilised by Properdin, resulting in the complex C 3 bBbP . Like the C4b2a complex of the classical pathway, C3bBbP is capable of converting more C3 into C3b. In summary; both the classical pathway and alternative pathway result in C3b generation. The C3 convertase of the classical pathway is C4b2a, whereas the C3 convertases of the alternative pathway are C 3 iBb in the fluid in fluid phase and C 3 bBbP when cell bound.

\section*{iii) THE MEMBRANE ATTACK COMPLEX:}

The final phase of activation is called membrane attack complex and can occur once C3b has been cleaved through either the classical or alternate pathway. C3 convertase cleaves C5 into two fragments; a small peptide (C5a) having potent anaphylatoxin activity and a larger fragment (C5b). The C5b fragment binds C6, C7, C8 and up to 14 monomers of C9, resulting in a lytic hole in the membrane. Small amounts of lysis can occur when C8 is bound; however, the binding of C9 facilitates cell lysis.

The binding of C3b to a cell membrane is the pivotal stage of the pathway. The cell-bound C3b can proceed to activate the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5-C9) and cause cell lysis; or alternatively , inhibitors may stop the activation sequence, leaving the cell coated with C3b. facto I is an inhibitor that can cleave cell-bound C3b, leaving iC3b on the membrane. This can be further cleaved, leaving a small fragment called C3dg. These two subcomponents of C3 (C3b, iC3b) can facilitate phagocytosis by acting as opsonins.

\section*{IN SUMMARY}

Classical pathway:
The first complement to be activated is C1
When $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ is activated it is broken down into three sub-units $\mathrm{C1}_{\mathrm{q}}, \mathrm{C1}_{\mathrm{r}}$, and $\mathrm{C1s}$.
The subunits are activated in sequences $\mathrm{C} 1_{\mathrm{q}}, \mathrm{C} 1_{\mathrm{r}}, \mathrm{C} 1_{\mathrm{s}}$.
Calcium ions are very important.
When activated they form esterase activity (capability of breaking ester bonds.)= Starting of lysing.
$\mathrm{C}_{4}$ is the next complement to be activated.
Magnesium ions are required for this reaction.
Complement $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ activates complements $\mathrm{C}_{2}$.
$\mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{C}_{4}, \mathrm{C}_{2}$ are called $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ convertase.
$\mathrm{C}_{3}$ is the most abundant
C 3 activates $\mathrm{C} 5 \longrightarrow \mathrm{C} 6 \longrightarrow \mathrm{C} 7$ which circulate together as single molecule
(unit) and they activate $\mathrm{C}_{8}$
$\mathrm{C}_{9}$ is activated and cell lyses occurs.

\section*{Alternate pathway:}

Is a complex mechanism that does not require ag /ab complex for its activation.
The pathway diverges the first three factors of the classical pathway.
It is activated principally by snake poison (cobra), endotoxins (bacterial toxins), zymosan, yeast, and properdin - in presence of $\mathrm{Mg}^{++}$can destroy R.B.C's.

\section*{Biological Significance}
- Plays a major role in defence mechanism destruction of organisms e.g. bacteria, fungi, parasites.
- When incompatible blood is given, RBC's lyses by complement fixation.
- Attract macrophages at the site of infection makes it easy for ingesting.
- They are used in serology test. C. F. T.
- Identifying Immune globulins IgG, IgM.
- Detect the ag / ab reaction i.e. lyses.

\section*{Side Effects}

Excessive complement activation causes tissue damage, kidney damage, and incompatibility.

\section*{COMPLEMENT RECEPTORS:}

Some phagocytic cells have receptors that can bind to C3 on the cell. Four different complement receptors have been identified on phagocytic cells CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4.
CR1 receptor: The CR1 receptor is found on a variety of cells. On red cells and platelets, the CR1 receptor plays an important role in clearing immune complexes. On phagocytic cells and Blymphocytes, it is an opsonic receptor that is involved in lymphocyte activation. CR1 also has a regulatory role in complement activation by assisting factor I in cleaving C3b into iC3b and C3dg.
CR2 Receptor: The CR2 receptor is found on B-cells, some epithelial cells, and follicular dendritic cells. It plays an important role in mediating B-cell activation. It is also the receptor for interferon $\alpha$ and Epstein-Barr virus.
CR3 Receptor: The CR3 receptors are found on cells of the myeloid lineage. CR3 mediates phagocytosis of particles coated with iC3b and is also an important adhesion molecule capable of binding to certain types of bacteria and yeast.

\section*{REGULATION OF THE COMPLEMENT CASCADE}

There is need to control or regulate the enzyme and activation factors of the complement cascade. The regulatory actions of these control proteins prevent damage to host tissue. These control systems act by several different mechanisms:
1. Direct inhibition of serine proteases
2. Decay and destruction of convertases
3. Control of membrane attack complexes
- C1 inhibitor-a serine protease inhibitor that binds and activates C1r and C1s

C1 inhibitor inhibits the production of C3b by combining with and inactivating of C1r and C1s. this prevents formation of C3 convertase, C4b2b.
- Protein H inhibits the production of C3b by inhibiting the binding of Factor B to mem-brane-bound C 3 b , thereby preventing cleavage of B to Bb and production of the C 3 convertase, C3bBb
- Factor 1 plus C4 binding protein C4-bp)

Factor 1 inhibits the production of C3b into C3c and C3d, which are inactive. Fac tor I only works on cell membrane bound C3b, mostly on red blood cells (i.e. non- activator surfaces)
- Decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55)

\section*{PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF COMPLEMENTACTIVATION.}

\section*{OPSONIZATION}

Neutrophils and macrophages phagocytose any particle that protrudes from the surface of a cell or micro-organism with no regard to the nature of the material. Phagocytosis is more intense if the particle adheres firmly to the membrane of the phagocytic cell. To achieve adherence, phagocytic cells have various receptor molecules such as the Fc receptors for certain immunoglobulins and receptors for C3b. the enhancement of phagocytosis resulting from antibody or complement coating of cells is called opsonization.

\section*{ANAPHYLATOXINS PROMOTE INFLAMMATION}

Complement fragments C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins and they play an important role in acute inflammation. These anaphylatoxins bind to the receptors on mast cells and basophils, causing them to release histamine and other biologic response modifiers that can be associated with anaphylaxis. More frequently, anaphylatoxins affect vascular permeability, membrane adhesion properties, and smooth muscle contraction that constitute a large part of the acute inflammatory response. C5a and C3a also cause neutrophils and macrophages to migrate to the site of complement activation.

\section*{CYTOKINES}

A number of soluble mediators.
They are diverse group of intracellular signalling peptides and glycoproteins that have molecular weights ranging from 6,000 to 60,000 Daltons.
Each cytokine is secreted by particular cell types in response to different stimuli, and has been implicated in a wide variety of important regulatory biologic functions such as: inflammation, tissue repair, cell activation, cell growth, fibrosis, and morphogenesis.
One cytokine can have several different functions, depending on the type of cell to which it binds. Several hundred different cytokines have been described.
Cytokines have been implicated in a variety of important factors of transfusion medicine (haemolytic and febrile transfusion reactions, immunomodulation, and stem cell collection e.t.c.

Example of cytokines
- Interleukins IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
- TNF,
- Interferon $\gamma$ (IFN $\gamma$ ),
- Transforming growth factor- $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ),
- Colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF, M-CSF, G-CSF)

\section*{HAEMOLYTIC DISEASE OF THE NEW BORN. (H. D. N. B.)}

It is also called erythroblastosis foetalis. This is a condition in which the life span of the infant's red cells is shortened by the action of specific antibodies derived from the mother by placement transfer.

\section*{Symptoms of an infected infant}
a) Anaemia (severe)
b) Jaundice
c) Liver enlargement-hepatomegally (blood forming organs)
d) Hydrops foetalis (oedomatosis foetalis)
e) Spleenomegary

The foetus erythropoetic system is affected and becomes hyperactive causing the presence of erythroblasts in the blood circulation. This is what led to this condition being called erythroblastosis foetalis.
The most common cause of HDNB is blood group incompatibility whereby antibodies from the mother cross the placenta and attach to the red cells of the foetus, which therefore get destroyed (haemolysed).
The foetal bone marrow is then forced to produce excess red cells to replace the destroyed R.B.C's. The liver spleen and the lymph nodes are also called upon to produce excessive R.B.C.S

Congestive cardiac failure will also occur due to lack of blood cells circulating resulting from severe anaemia. After the breakdown of the R.B.C.S

\section*{THE ORIGIN OF THE MATERNAL ANTIBODY Anti -D}

Blood group antibodies are gamma globulins produced by an individual after an exposure to red blood cells having antigens, which are leaking in the host.

The common cause of HDNB is anti D (anti Rh). This is produced in females who are Rh-ve carrying Rhesus positive foetus.
Antibody productions depend on the amount of the antigen released into the maternal circulation and the routine of administration.
Prenatal antibodies are formed due to blood transfusion, incompatible foetus, during delivery the mothers immune system is triggered by the crossing of D antigen infant to produce anti-D, the antibody production may continue for years without stimulation and the introduction of any other same antigen there after may act as a booster.
The production of the antibody quantities will just increase.

\section*{THE PLACENTAL BARRIER}

The placenta plays a major role in the development of the foetus. These roles include the following:
i. Transfer nutrients from mother to foetus
ii. Protection of foetus
iii. Excretory organ for the foetus

The placenta plays a vital role in iso-immunization.
The placenta consists of blood vessels' vesicular spaces and supportive tissue.
The foetus and the mother's circulation are separated there's an extensive surface contact.
The placental vessel villi and connective tissue rapture during birth allowing the foetal red blood cells to escape into the maternal circulation.

\section*{Other Causes of HDNB:}
1. ABO blood group incompatibility cause $2 / 3$ of the cases, however they are so mild that they can go undetected.
2. Rhesus incompatibility causes $1 / 3$ of the cases but is the most severe.
3. Other blood groups e.g. Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNSs is however very rare.

\section*{HDNB DUE TO RHESUS INCOMPATIBILITY:}

Rhesus antigens of the foetal red cells are well developed early in foetal life and if released into maternal circulation may stimulate ab formation. Only incomplete anti Rh antigens (antibodies) (IgG) are able to cross the placenta and sensitise the foetal red cells. HDNB due to rhesus incompatibility is common with infants who are $\mathrm{Rh}^{+}$ve while the mother is Rh -ve. Usually the first born (Para 1) is not very much affected because the sensitisation before is minimal. Sensitization during pregnancy follows the release of foetal red cells into the maternal circulation. This release is maximum during caesarean section and abortion. After the release and transfer of the

D antigen the mother produces anti D thus during the second pregnancy the antibody crosses the placenta sensitising the foetal red cells and thus destroying them (haemolyses).
After birth the antibody action continues destroying the foetal red cells haemolysing them and thus bilirubin is increased (due to Hb release). The poorly developed hepatic enzymes glucoronyl transferase. (Conjugates free bilirubin ready for excretion). Doesn't convert the free bilirubin and so there is accumulation of the toxic (free bilirubin) in the tissues causing jaundice - yellowing of tissues - (eyes) if it accumulates in the brain it causes Kernicterus. (Irreversible damage of brain cells)

\section*{SYMPTOMS IN ORDER OF SEVERITY}
(i) Kernicterus (brain damage)
(ii) Cardiac arrest. (Due to severe anaemia)
(iii) Jaundice
(iv) Severe anaemia
(v) Haemoglobinuria
(vii) hepato spleenomegally
(viii) Hydrops foetalis (still birth)

\section*{HAEMATOLOGICAL FINDINGS OF HDNB}

Hb estimation is reduced
Red cell count is reduced on the P.B. F. (peripheral blood film)
- Anisocytosis - with macrocytes and microcytes
- Poikilocytosis -schistocytes (fragmented cells)
- Polychromasia
- Nucleated r.b.c. increased $=$ up to $6 \%$

Bilirubin level of the cord blood is increased especially indirect bilirubin. This is a biochemical test.
Serological test - Direct coomb's test antibody screening test should be positive.

\section*{THE ROLE OF RHOGAM}

Rhogam is a purified form of anti-D. It is given to Rhesus ${ }^{-}$ve mothers who have given birth to a Rhesus ${ }^{+}$ve positive baby. Or within 72 hrs of delivery. The reason why it is given is to remove of all $\mathrm{Rh}+\mathrm{ve}$ cells before they get a chance to sensitise the mother or cause stimulation of antibodies by the mother.

\section*{RX OF HDNB}

\section*{1. Exchange transfusion}

This is a process whereby the baby's blood is removed and a similar amount of blood is transfused.

\section*{2. Intra Uterine transfusion}

This is the transfusion of blood into the foetus when it still is in uterus. This is done when the foetus is in distress from severe anaemia or jaundice and is still too young to be delivered.

\section*{3. Early induction of Labour}

This means inducing labour-in the mother b4 the normal time.

\section*{Criteria for exchange Transfusion}
1. Laboratory findings e.g. haematological finding, jaundice etc.
2. The doctor examines the physical condition of the infant and the history of the family.

\section*{SELECTION OF BLOOD FOR BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
- Blood should be fresh preferably not more than three days old.
- Should not contain gas corresponding to be antibodies in the mother's circulation
- The safer blood to give is O-ve because it has no antigens.

\section*{H.D.N.B. due to ABO incompatibility}
- Caused by immune anti A or AntiB
- H.D.N.B. due to ABO is more fragment than rhesus HDNB.
- It comes about when the mother blood group O and the child (baby) is blood group A or B or AB.
- Jaundice is mild and it is rare that exchange transfusion will be required.

\section*{RX for HDNB is Photo therapy:}
- ABO HDNB is not severe due to body's natural protection. Once antibodies are introduced they are recognised and removed.
- The response is not severe as in Rhesus H.D.N.B.

\begin{tabular}{lcllr}

\section*{Factors limiting primary immunization: \\ Placenta:}

Normally very little blood is able to leak only $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mls}$ of blood.
Thus the little blood is not able to cause the primary response.

\section*{Steroids:}

Hormones produced during pregnancy e.g. ergosterol.

\section*{ABO Protection:}

Due to natural antibodies, Anti A and Anti B. This happens when mother and child are of different blood group.

\section*{ADSORPTION}

In a patient who has not been recently transfused, autologous adsorption is the best way to detect alloantibodies in the presence of warm-reactive autoantibodies. The adsorbed serum can be used in the routine antibody detection procedure.
Auto-adsorption generally requires some initial preparation of patient's red cells. At $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, invivo adsorption will have occurred and all antigen sites on the patient's own red cells may be blocked. It may be necessary, therefore, to remove autoantibody from the red cells to make sites available for adsorption.
A gentle heat elution at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 3 to 5 minutes can dissociate some of the bound IgG. This can be followed by treatment of the autologous red cells with proteolytic enzymes to increase their capacity to adsorb autoantibody. Treatment of the RBC's with ZZAP, a mixture of papain or ficin and DTT accomplishes both of these actions in one step; the sulfhydryl component makes the IgG molecules more susceptible to the protease and dissociates the antibody molecules from the cell.

\section*{ZZAP treatment removes IgM and complement from autologous cells and uncovers antigen sites that can be used to bind free autoantibody in serum.}

Multiple sequential auto-adsorptions with new aliquots of RBC's may be necessary if the serum contains high levels of autoantibody. Once autoantibody has been removed, the adsorbed serum is examined for alloantibody activity
Autologous adsorption is not recommended for patients who have been recently transfused, because they may have an admixture of transfused red cells that might adsorb alloantibody. RBC's normally live about 110 to 120 days. In patients with AIHA, autologous and transfused RBCs can be expected to have shortened survival. However, determining how long transfused RBCs remain in circulation in patients who need repeated transfusion is not feasible. It has been demonstrated that very small amounts (<10\%) of antigen-positive RBCs are capable of removing alloantibody reactivity in in-vitro studies; therefore. It is recommended to wait for three (3) months after transfusion before autologous adsorption are performed.
The patient's own red cells, a portion of which will be younger and less dense than transfused red cells can sometimes be separated by simple or gradient centrifugation for use in autoadsorption experiments. However, these techniques are highly variable and may require expensive equipment and/or considerable expertise in interpretation.
If patient is to be transfused, it can be advantageous to collect and save additional aliquots of pretransfusion cells, to be used for later adsorptions.

\section*{ALLOGENEIC ADSORPTION}

The use of allogeneic red cells for adsorption may be helpful when the patient has been recently transfused or when insufficient autologous red cells are available. The goal is to remove autoantibody and leave the alloantibody in the adsorbed serum. The adsorbing cells must not have the antigens against which the alloantibodies react. Because alloantibody specificity is unknown, red cells of different phenotypes will usually be used to adsorb several aliquots of the patient's serum.
Given the number of potential alloantibodies, the task of selecting cells may appear formidable. However, the selected cells need only demonstrate those few alloantibodies of clinical significance likely to be present. These include the common Rh antigens ( $\mathrm{D}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{E}, \mathrm{c}$, and e ), $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Fy}^{\mathrm{a}}$, $\mathrm{Jk}^{\mathrm{a}}$, and $\mathrm{Jk}^{\mathrm{b}}$ and S and s . Cell selection is made easier by the fact that some antigens can be destroyed by appropriate treatment (e.g. with enzymes) prior to use in adsorption procedures. Antibodies to high-incidence antigens cannot be excluded by allogeneic adsorption because the adsorbing cells will almost invariably express the antigen and adsorb the alloantibody along with autoantibody.
When the patient's Rh phenotype is not known, group O red cell samples of three different Rh phenotypes ( $\mathrm{R}_{1} \mathrm{R}_{1}, \mathrm{R}_{2} \mathrm{R}_{2}$, and rr ) should be selected. One should lack Jka and another Jkb. If
treated with ZZAP, these cells would lack all antigens of the Kell system, M, N, S, Fya and Fy ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$. If ZZAP is not available, cells treated only with proteolytic enzyme can be used, but at least one of the adsorbing cells must be K-negative because Kell system antigens will not be destroyed. Untreated cells may be used, but antibody may be more difficult to remove and the adsorbing cells must, at a minimum, include at least one negative for the S , s , Fya, Fy ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$, and K antigens in addition to Rh and Kidd requirement above.
Each aliquot may need to be adsorbed two or three times. The fully adsorbed aliquots are tested against reagent red cells known either to carry lack or to carry common antigens of the Rh , MNS, Kidd, Kell and Duffy blood group systems. If an adsorbed aliquot is reactive, that aliquot (or an additional specimen similarly adsorbed) should be tested to identify the antibody. Adsorbing several aliquots with different red cell samples provides a battery of potentially informative specimens. For example, if the aliquot adsorbed with Jk(a-) red cells subsequently reacts only with Jk(a+) red cells, the presence of allo-anti-Jka can confidently be inferred.
The adsorbed serum can also be used for crossmatching; if necessary, adsorbed aliquots may be pooled for compatibility tests.
If the patients Rh and Kidd phenotypes are known or can be determined, adsorption can be performed with a single sample of allogeneic ZZAP-treated red cells of the same Rh and Kidd phenotypes as the patient.
Occasionally autoantibody will not be removed by three sequential adsorptions. Further adsorptions can be done, but multiple adsorptions have the potential to dilute the serum. If adsorbing cells do not appear to remove the antibody, the autoantibody may have an unusual specificity that does not react with the cells used for adsorption. For example, autoantibodies with Kell or LW specificity would not react with cells treated with ZZAP or proteolytic enzymes.

\section*{AUTOLOGOUS ADSORPTION OF WARM-REACTIVE AUTOANTIBODIES PRINCIPLE}

Warm-reactive autoantibodies in serum may mask the concomitant presence of clinically significant alloantibodies. Adsorption of the serum with autologous red cells can remove autoantibody from the serum, permitting detection of underlying alloantibodies. However, autologous red cells in the circulation are coated with autoantibody. Autologous adsorption of warm-reactive autoantibodies can be facilitated by dissociating autoantibody from the red cell membrane, thereby uncovering antigen sites that can bind free autoantibody to remove it from the serum. Some autoantibody can be dissociated by a gentle heat elution for 3 to 5 minutes at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. subsequent treatment of the cells with enzymes enhances the adsorption process by removing membrane structures that otherwise hinder the association between antigen and antibody. The most effective procedure involves the use of ZZAP reagent, a mixture of a proteolytic enzyme and sulfhydryl reagent. ZZAP removes immunoglobulins and complement from the red cells and enhances the adsorption process. Red cells from patients transfused within the last three months should not be
used for auto-adsorption because transfused red cells present in circulation are likely to adsorb the alloantibodies that are being sought.

\section*{SPECIMEN}
1. 2 ml of serum to be adsorbed
2. 2 ml of autologous red cells

\section*{REAGENTS}
1. 1\% cysteine-activated papain or $1 \%$ ficin
2. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.3
3. 0.2 M of DTT prepared by dissolving !gram of DTT in $32,4 \mathrm{~mL}$ of pH 7.3 PBS . Dispense into $3-\mathrm{mL}$ aliquots and store at $-18^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or colder.

\section*{PROCEDURE}
1. Prepare ZZAP reagent by mixing 0.5 mL of $1 \%$ cysteine-activated papain with 2.5 mL of 0.2 M DTT and 2 mL of pH 7.3 PBS. Alternatively, use 1 mL of $1 \%$ ficin, 2.5 mL of 0.2 M DTT and 1.5 mL of pH 7.3 PBS. Check pH and adjust to between 6.0 and 6.5 if necessary.
2. to each of the tubes containing 1 mL of packed red cells add 2 mL of ZZAP reagent. Mix and incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes with periodic mixing.
3. wash the red cells in saline. Centrifuge the last wash for at least 5 minutes at 900 to 1000 xg . Use suction or a Pasteur pipette to remove as much of the supernatant as practically possible.
4. add serum to an equal volume of ZZAP treated red cells, mix, and incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for approximately 30 to 45 minutes.
5. centrifuge and carefully remove serum.
6. steps 4 and 5 should be repeated once more using the once-adsorbed patient's serum and the second aliquot of ZZAP-treated cells.
7. after the second adsorption, test the serum against a specimen of group O reagent cells. If reactivity persists repeat steps 4 and 5.

\section*{INTERPRETATION}

Two adsorptions ordinarily remove sufficient autoantibody so that alloantibody reactivity, if present, is readily apparent. If twice auto-adsorbed serum reacts with defined specificity, as shown by testing against a small antibody identification panel, then the defined specificity of the antibody is probably an alloantibody (e.g. Ant-Kpb) that does not react with ZZAP-treated cells and thus will not be adsorbed by this procedure. To check this latter possibility, test the reactive autoadsorbed serum against reagent cells that have been pre-treated with ZZAP reagent.

\section*{NOTES}
1. ZZAP treatment destroys all Kell system antigens and all other antigens that are destroyed by proteases e.g. M, N, Fya, Fyb, and S. ZZAP reagent also denatures the antigens of the LW, Yt, Dombrock and Knops systems. If the autoantibody is suspected to
have specificity in any of these latter blood groups, an alternative procedure is to perform auto-adsorption with untreated autologous red cells or autologous red cells treated only with 1\% ficin or 1\% cysteine-activated papain.
2. there is no need to wash packed red cells before treatment with ZZAP
3. cold autoantibodies reactive at room temperature can also be present in the serum of about $30 \%$ of patients with warm reactive autoantibodies. Removal of these cold antibodies can be facilitated by placing serum and cell mixture at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for about 15 minutes after incubation at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
4. greater than four adsorptions increases the risk of diluting alloantibody reactivity.

\section*{Lu-linkage.}

Lutheran gene is independent of all other blood groups otherwise linkage exists between the secretor genes. Lutheran a (Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ ) is a weak antigen and possibly plays a minor role in transfusion reactions.
Anti-Lu ${ }^{\text {a }}$ has not been found to cause HDNB.
Lutheran b (Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ ) is a weak antigen. It rarely forms Anti-Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$. Anti Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ when formed can cause transfusion reactions.

\section*{Serology.}

Anti-Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ can be natural or immune antibody. It is best detected in saline at a temperature below $20^{0} \mathrm{C}$ (R.T) $\mathrm{opt}=15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It rarely reacts at temps beyond $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It doesn't react in albumin, A.H.G. or enzyme Anti-Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ reacts strongly in saline @ $18-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, rarely at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
The strongest reaction is when using A.H.G. Both $\mathrm{Lu}^{\mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{Lu}^{\mathrm{b}}$ are well developed at birth. The Lu antigens are confined to the red cells. It is rare to find $\mathrm{Lu}^{\mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{Lu}^{\mathrm{b}}$ in the body fluids. Neither Anti-Lu ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ nor Anti Lub has ever been produced in animals.
Lutheran antigens exhibit dosage effect.

Lutheran antigens also exhibit Mulberry like agglutination.

\section*{KELL.}

Mouran and Race discovered this blood group system in 1946. These antibodies were discovered after they had caused H.D.N.B. they are represented as

It is the third blood group of importance from ABO \& Rhesus. The genotypes of Kell +ve are KK and Kell -ve are $\Re$ R. (Or cellano). Anti-K and Anti- $\Re$ (cellano) exists. They are immune antibodies though some natural antibodies have been encountered. No linkage exists between this blood group and others.
K is a strong antigen in man. Anti-K causes H.D.N.B. and transfusion reactions.
The antigenicity of anti cellano is not of importance but when present it can cause H.D.N.B. and transfusion reactions.

\section*{SEROLOGY.}

Both antibodies fail to agglutinate cells suspended in saline. They are best detected by A.H.G. method.
Agglutination best occurs when the cells are suspended on the human serum.
Agglutination is inhibited by bovine albumin.
Immune anti-K best reacts at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Kell antibodies are labile so fresh specimens are required every time for reliable results.
Anti-K exhibits dosage effect (reacts more strongly in monozygous than heterozygous).
Both Kell and cellano antigens are well developed at birth.
Neither Kell nor Cellano has been produced in animals.
The Kell antigens are confined to the R.B.C's.

\section*{LEWIS BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM.}

An unknown antibody believed to be naturally occurring was found in samples of blood from two different persons.
This antibody recognised an antigen present in about $22 \%$ of individuals in English population. The system was called Lewis after one of the two individuals after whom it was first found.
Lewis substances are rarely found in other body fluids. The only cases whereby they can be detected in red cells is when the concentration in body fluids or in serum is so high such that they are adsorbed onto the red cells. The system is related to the secretor status (A.B.H.) in such a way that all the $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}+}$ ve individuals are always non-secretors of A.B.H. specific substances, but secretors of $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{s}}$ substances.
Lewis system plays no part in paternity disputes. This is because both parents will have $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}+\mathrm{ve}$ and still have babies who are $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$-ve. $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ antigens are not inherited. They can be found in the plasma.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS}

\section*{ANTI Le ${ }^{\text {a }}$}

It mostly occurs as a natural cold complete antibody. It reacts in saline and also in the albumin medium. It is a common cause of difficulties in compatibility tests. Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ has got lytic properties. It can lyse cells in the presence of complements and enzymes (Ficin, Papain). Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ precipitating and agglutinating sera has been
prepared in animals. The reaction of Anti Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ appears like a necklace. Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ occurs more frequently in blood group $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$ and AB more than in blood group O . it can be obtained by immunization of $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}-\mathrm{b}-}$ phenotype individuals. (Lewis negative.). In adults the Ag is detectable by using fresh samples. $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ soluble substances are found in the ovarian cyst fluid. The frequency of $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ substance is highest in infant's upto 18 months. This is because $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ antigen can be detected in heterozygous state, $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}}$ in infants but in adults it has to be homozygous $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{a}+}\left(\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}} \mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}\right)$. $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ substances can be detected in saliva in the inhibition state.

\section*{CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF ANTI-LE ${ }^{\text {a }}$ ANTIBODIES.}

Many haemolytic transfusion reactions are due to Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ but it does not cause H.D.N.B. anti $\mathrm{Le}^{\mathrm{a}}$ are of IgM, 19s class and they are compliment binding. Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ lyses cells treated with enzyme e.g. Papain. Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ always has anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ as an extra antibody. Anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$ develops more slowly and agglutinates more weakly in pregnancy more than anti-Le ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$. This is because the plasma of a pregnant woman has substances that antibodiesorb the Lewis substances

\section*{THE P BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM}

Landsteiner and Levine discovered this blood group in 1927. They were doing research by immunising rabbits with human R.B.C's. They discovered antibodies, which they named anti-P, then later called anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1} .75 \%$ of the people were found to be $\mathrm{P}_{1}+$ ve and $25 \%$ were found to be $\mathrm{P}_{1}$-ve. Those who were found to be $\mathrm{P}_{1}$-ve were termed as $\mathrm{P}_{2}$.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF ANTI $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{1}}$.}
1. A naturally occurring antibody (very rare)
2. It belongs to IgM class
3. It is the antibody that most commonly causes problems in grouping and compatibility tests.
4. It binds complement in enzyme treated cells.
5. It is gotten from individuals of $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ (when immunized)
6. It is also gotten from pigs, horses and rabbits.
7. It is inhibited by Hydatid cyst fluid.
8. It does not cause H.D.N.B. or transfusion reaction.
9. It is detected at room temperature and $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when blood grouping (cold agglutinin)
10. It gives the best reaction with enzyme treated cells. It can also be detected by Indirect antiglobulin method. (ICT)
Tj ${ }^{\text {a }}$
This is an antigen, which was later discovered by Levin, Bobbit Waller and Kuhmichel. The antigen is part of P bld grp system. Anti-Tj ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ reacts as anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}$. If Anti- $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ is antibodiesorbed with $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ cells anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ is left behind. This shows that $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ is specific for P . P antigens are not fully developed at birth. $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ does not cause H.D.N.B. but anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}$ (Anti $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ ) causes H.D.N.B) and transfusion reactions.

In some cases it is known to cause early miscarriages. Anti- $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ in the presence of a compliment lyses red cells. People with anti- $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ are always $\mathrm{P}_{1}-\mathrm{ve}$.

\section*{$\mathbf{P}^{\mathbf{k}}$ an extension of $\mathbf{P}$.}
$\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ was discovered due to difficulties encountered in compatibility tests. Cells of the $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ are agglutinated by both anti $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ and anti $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}$. (Anti $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ ). Anti- $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ was found to haemolyse $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ cells @ RT strongly.
Investigations showed that $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ cells do not antibodiesorb Anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ or anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}\left(\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}\right)$. Anti $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ or anti- $\mathrm{Tj}^{\mathrm{a}}$ antibodiesorbed with $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ cells still agglutinates $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ cells. This concludes that the P system apart from having and $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}$ ( $\mathrm{TJ}^{\mathrm{a}}$ ) has $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$, which will react with patient's red cells.
Anti $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ alone has not been found but can be prepared from anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}+\mathrm{P}$ by antibodiesorption with $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ cells. It has not been isolated from anti $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ serum and this could be due to anti- $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ cross-reacting with $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ antigen or possibly due to the $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{k}}$ antigen also having $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ antigens.

\section*{MNSs Blood Group System:}

- It is hard to obtain $\mathrm{Jk}^{\mathrm{b}}$ because they are impotent and unstable.
N.B. DHTR's occur when antibody develops so rapidly in an anamnestic response to antigens on transfused red cells that it destroys the still circulating red cells. In many cases, retesting the patients pretransfusion serum confirms that the antibody was, indeed, undetectable in the original tests. This highlights the importance of consulting previous records before selecting blood for transfusion. Patients whose antibody has previously been detected and identified can, by review of past records, be protected against repeated contact with the known immunising stimuli.

\section*{THE I BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM}
- Discovered by Weiner in 1956 in a case of a cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

Ags: I; i Antibodies:- anti I, anti i
The strength of the ags vary from childhood to adult hood. Difference in age.
- Cord blood cells fail to reaction in the cold anti I but reaction strongly in cord anti I
- The I ags reaches maximum strength after 18 months from birth and the amount of i falls.
- Individuals with I ags have i ab and vice - versa.

\section*{Anti I Xtics}
- It's a cold natural iso - antibody of the IgM class.
- The antibodies usually occur in the serum of i individuals.
- Reacts at RT and $4^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.
- It reacts in saline and albumin media
- Causes auto - cold haemolytic anaemia AIHA-cold (individual can't go to extremely low tempts.)
- Does not cause HDNB or transfusion reaction.
- Causes problems in grouping and X-matching.
- Can be detected by enzyme technique at RT and indirect antiglobulin method.
- Inhibited by Hydatid cyst fluid in E. granulosis
- Inhibited by human milk since it has I substances
- Both I \& i sp. substances are found in serum of both adults and children.

\section*{Xtics of Anti i}
- Xtics the same
- Very rare
- Mostly found in serum of individuals suffering from Infectious mononucleosis.
- Detected by "monotest" kit;
- Reticulosis predominant

\section*{THE Xg system:}
- The sex linked blood group
- Discovered by Mann in 1962. It is carried in the X -chromosome that makes it unique from other blood groups.
Antigens $\div \mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$
$$A b \div A n t i X g^{a}$$
- Genes $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ can be either inherited as heterozygous or homozygous.
- If a male is $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ positive, all the daughters will be $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ positive.
- A mother who is $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ positive can either be homozygous or heterozygous.
- If all parents are $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}(+\mathrm{ve})$ the daughters are $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ positive and $1 / 2$ the sons will have $\mathrm{Xg}^{\mathrm{a}}$ negative.

\section*{Xtics of Anti Xg ${ }^{\text {a }}$}
- Shows dosage effect
- AntiXg ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ is an uncommon antibody that usually reacts only in antiglobulin testing.
- Found mostly in-ve men.
- It has not been implicated in HDN or HTR's.
- It may be usefull for tracing the transmission of genetic traits associated with the X chromosome, although linkage with the Xg locus has been demonstrated for few traits.
- It is of IgG class.
- Has a titre of 1:32
- Papain and Ficin denatures the antigen.
- Can be obtained from animals e.g. Gibbons "Long armed apes".

There are more other blood groups e.g. Diego, Yt, Scianna, Dombrock, Colton, LW, Chido/Rodgers, Hh, Kx, Gerbich, Cromer, Knops, Indian, Ok, Raph, John Milton Hagen.

\section*{PLANING AND SETTING OF A BLOOD DONOR CENTRE. \\ (Blood Bank)}

\section*{Roles of donor centre;}
1. Donor recruitment
2. Phlebotomy.
3. Blood screening e.g. blood grouping
4. Preparing of blood products e.g. Fresh Frozen Plasma
5. Advisory centre or Research centre.

\section*{STAFF}
1) The centre should be headed by a qualified staff either a medical technologist or pathologist. The in charge serves as the administrator, public relation adviser and a research worker.
2) Technical staff worker in the centre must have a thorough knowledge of blood donor recruitment. They should make sure that they perform phlebotomy to donors who are fit medically to avoid any undue legal implications.
3) Only people in experience in vene-puncture should perform phlebotomy to donors using aseptic technique. It is important that donors have confidence in the staff.
4) Clerical officers are also essential for record keeping and read other supporting officers for cleaning the place and equipment that does no require any skills.

\section*{THE BUILDING:}
1) The donor, area includes - space for reception (waiting)
2) Counselling room)
3) Phlebotomy area
4) Recovering room.
5) It should be located in an area that has a free and unobstructed flow of traffic.
6) It should have good lighting and ventilation.
7) All surfaces should be of materials that could be easily and thoroughly cleaned.
8) The room for registration and waiting should be arranged to prevent observation of other hospital activities.
9) A private waiting room is always desirable particularly if the centre is in the hospital premises since some people may be discouraged from donating blood after observing other hospital activities.
10) Privacy is desirable for interview and examination of prospective donors. Donors may not give a reliable medical history or may fail to ask questions if other donors, visitors or other blood donor personnel can hear what they are saying. Physical examination cannot be done in open place.
11) The donor bleeding room should be arranged to have the least disturbance either from visitors or non-essential personnel. If possible curtains should be used to separate one donor from the other.
12) Air conditioning may be required during warm humid whether.
13) A canteen may be just adjacent to the bleeding room for a drink and can be combined in an observation room.
14) A separate and private room should be available for treatment of donors who have reactions during or after donation.
15) The centre should have room or area for processing blood and storage purposes.
16) The centre should always have blood taking sets or bags.

Its always important to take detailed information of the donor e.g. address, names, locality, where they work.

\section*{RECRUITMENT OF DONORS:}

In order of the blood donor centre to be able to cope in blood supplies due to increased demand, a blood donor centre should formulate a programme for getting it's own donors. i.e. Voluntary Non remunerated Safe Blood Donors.
Where applicable relatives should be encouraged to donate blood for their patients.
Some of the methods of recruitment of donors is to lecture in schools, colleges and even factories and also through chief's baraza.
There are some people due to superstitious or religious belief shall the responsibility for donating blood. Great effort should be done to educate such a people.
Other mode of blood campaign is thro' posters mass media e.g. T.V, radio(most effective) and even local newspapers.

\section*{EQUIPMENT:}

At no time should a blood donor centre lack blood-taking sets.
Pressure cuffs
Hb machines
Haematocrit machines
Clinical thermometer
Centrifuges
Water baths
Blood bank refrigerator(s)
Refrigerated centrifuges for preparation of blood components.
Hand magnification lens
Microscopes
Equipment for testing Aids, syphilis, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Sterilising equipment
Glassware should be carefully washed and rinsed in detergent.
Refrigerators in which blood is stored must contain only blood or blood products , grouping seras or reagents that are necessary for blood bank.
Food should never be kept in refrigerators where blood is kept; even bacteriological specimen.
The refrigerator should have adequate circulatory of air preferably by means of a fan. Blood should never be kept near freezing compartment because of the risk of haemolysing the blood.
The interior of blood storing refrigerator must be immaculate, should have light preferably internal light system necessary in facilitating inspection of blood. Should have reliable thermometer and normal temperature range 2
$-6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Temperature of each refrigerator must be recorded by automating recording thermometer and should be checked from time to time to ascertain its reliability.
The sensor of the thermometer recording system must be in water or $10 \%$ glycerol in a container similar to a blood container. This should be located in an ideal place in the refrigerator fluid is used because it changes like temperature of blood. Temperature records must be dated.
Alarm system in the storage refrigerator protects against accidental loses of blood due to failure of proper refrigerator, audible bell, visible light signals or both should be arranged to warn the changes outside the permissible limits of $2-6^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.

Alarm system must be separate from electrical circuit that operates the refrigerator e.g. run by battery. It can be connected to a police station if the premise is not guarded at night.
Fridge for blood should have a standby generator that switches on automatically once there is a power failure.

\section*{DONOR SELECTION:}

\section*{Receipt and Registration:}

The prospective donor should be made to feel welcome relaxed and at ease.
Donor registration sheet (card) should be designed such that they give as much details regarding the donor. The information given will be of value in present or future references.

\section*{DONOR CRITERIA:}

A prospective donor is only allowed to donate if she/he fulfils the following criteria.
1. Age - $16-65$ years
2. Physical appearance: A donor should not have rushes on the body - or many scars especially on the arms.
3. Lactating, pregnant women are not allowed to donate blood
4. Period of last donation $=$ Not less than 4 months for Female and 3 months for male.
5. Anyone who has suffered from hepatitis and/or HIV are permanently deffered
6. Anyone who is alcoholic or drug addicted should be permanently deferred.

10. Low risk group.
11. Should NOT have taken a heavy meal prior to the procedure and also should at least have taken a meal in 12 hrs .

NB: Those transfused in blood must be treated for malaria.

\section*{PHLEBOTOMY:}

The donor should be greeted cheerfully and should be assisted to the phlebotomy bed. The room should be a peaceful, pleasant and cool one.

\section*{PROCEDURE:}

Always confirm the serial number of the pint and donors card sample tube and vice versa.
1. Sterilise the vein puncture site, after it has been prepared nothing should be touched to this area except the needle.
2. Select the best vein for the sterilised area and unless the veins of donors are visible, apply a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff to the donor upper arm and inflate to $50-60 \mathrm{mmHg}$ and instruct the donor to open and close the first.
3. Immediately do the phlebotomy without delay.
4. After phlebotomy, tape the needle and place sterile gauze over it. Donor must never be left unattended during donation. Should take approx. 9 minutes
5. Mix blood and anticoagulant gently, frequently enough to prevent coagulation.
6. If the blood is adequate, this can be determined by either weighing the pint or apply pressure, the pint should never be too hard or flappy.

After collection:
i. = Heat seal the tube, apply a knot or put a clip. (metal clip with a hand sealer)
ii. = Apply gentle pressure on the punctured site in the thumb using a sterile gauze.
iii. = Tell the donor to raise his arm and elbow kept straight and to hold the gauze firmly on the punctured site in his other hand.
iv. = Another seal should be made near the beg.
v. = Recheck the blood pint number and the donors card again and refrigerate the unit immediately either in a special blood transportation box with enough ice packs (should not go $>10^{0} \mathrm{C}$ during transportation) or in a refrigerator at $2-4^{0} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{INSTRUCTION TO BLOOD DONORS AFTER PHLEBOTOMY:}
1. The donor should lie at least for 10 minutes.
2. Drink more fluids than usual for the next few hours and have a good meal 24 hrs .
3. In case of any bleeding from the puncture, should apply pressure with the finger to stop it.
4. Should he/she feel faint or dizzy after leaving the bed, should sit down immediately and put head between knees or lie with head lower than the rest of the body until the dizziness stops.
5. Donor should avoid strenuous activities for the next 24 -hrs e.g. playing football.
6. Should not donate again for the next $3 / 4$ months.

\section*{BLOOD INSPECTION:}

All blood units in storage refrigerator should be examined periodically during storage and immediately before issuing. A record of this inspection must be maintained and show date and description of any abnormal findings.
Blood should be rejected for transfusion if the colour or physical appearance is abnormal or any suspicion of contamination e.g. if the blood has a purplish colour or if a zone of haemolysis is observed in the plasma or if clots appear.
Other features are, purple, golden yellow or excessive greenish plasma. At times green colour develops in the plasma of blood stored in the dark. It fades on exposure to light, units of these nature are used for transfusion. Inadequate sealing or closure of bag renders that blood unsuitable for transfusion. In case a donor unit is rejected it should never be discarded in the form of intact unit in public waste collecting system i.e. for both health and public relationship reasons may cause; Risk of spreading infection; discourage donors.

\section*{CHECKLIST FOR SIGNS OF DETIRIORATION IN BLOOD AND PLASMA:}
- Any leaks at the pig-tails/heat seal /clip
- Haemolysis in plasma/pink plasma
- Haemolysis on the line between red cells and plasma
- Clots in the plasma
- Red cells -are they normal or purple or black?

\section*{BLOOD PRODUCTS:}

\section*{1. PACKED RED CELLS;}

These are cells from which virtually all plasma has been removed.

\section*{Preparation:}
i. Centrifuge whole blood at about 2000rpm for 15-30 minutes.
ii. Remove the supernatant - plasma
iii. What remains is packed cells.

Uses:
iv. For treating anaemic pts particularly those requiring many pints: For pts who had formed mild reactions to some none - red cell components of the blood.

\section*{2. WASHED RED CELLS:}

Also called white cells poor blood.

\section*{Preparation:}
i. Centrifuge whole blood
ii. Remove the supernatant - plasma
iii. Add sterile physiological saline to the remaining packed cells/resuspend the cells.
iv. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for about 15 minutes.
v. Remove the supernatant.
vi. Repeat washing for about 3 times and all this is done in sterile conditions.

Washing - is to remove all traces of plasma and some white cells and platelets.
Washed cells are used in cases of ;
(i) Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria - PNH
(ii) Patients who have transfusion reactions due to antibodies against platelets, WBC \& protein components.

\section*{3. WHITE CELLS:}

Are prepared by continuous plasmapheresis. This involves cell separators, which will specifically remove white cells from whole blood of the donor, and the rest is returned to the donor. The best donors for white cells are pts who have Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia who are undergoing leucopheresis.
White cells can also be obtained from the buffy coat.
White cells are used to Rx pts with Aplastic anaemia \& also patients with low white cell count. 20 - 30 pints for one patient. The procedure takes $2-3 \mathrm{hrs}$.

\section*{4. PLATELETS RICH PLASMA:}

Diagram:
Platelet rich plasma is prepared by bleeding donor in double (satellite) bags in 1 or 2 bags. The blood is collected in the main bag and centrifuge at low speed about 1000 r.p.m. for $20-30$ minutes at R.T.

The reason of centrifuging at low speed is to avoid packing of platelets.
After centrifuging the platelet rich plasma is extracted to the satellite bag.
The pilot tube connecting the satellite bag is cut after clipping.
Platelet rich plasma must be used immediately or in 24 hrs and stored at R.T(btn 20-24oC) ambient temperature and mixed continuously. Kept at R.T in continuous shaking with a platelet mixer.

\section*{Uses:}

To treat pts in thrombocytopenia, to stop spontaneous bleeding; in pts with platelet dysfunction; hypoplastic anaemia; or bone marrow failure due to replacement or to the effects of chemotherapy.

\section*{5. PLATELET CONCENTRATE:}

Preparation is the same as platelet rich plasma but after obtaining the platelet rich plasma the pilot tube is not cut from the main bag immediately.
The satellite bag in the platelet rich plasma is centrifuged hard at approximately 3000 rpm for $10-20$ minutes.
Then the plasma is taken back to the main bag leaving about 20 ml of the plasma in the satellite bag for resuspending the packed platelets.

\section*{Uses:}

In cases of thrombocytopaenia where plasma is not required in large quantity to avoid overloading/ pts in acute bleeding/those in purpura platelet deficiency has been established. In acute bleeding particularly where platelet deficiency has been established.

\section*{Purpura.}

A condition where a pt bleeds through the skin due to platelet deficiency.

\section*{6. FRESH FROZEN PLASMA (F.F.P.)}

Is prepared from fresh blood less than 4 hrs old.
Is prepared by centrifuging whole blood a $2000-3000 \mathrm{rpm}$ for $20-30$ minutes and then plasma extracted to the satellite bag at Room temperature.
The two bags are then separated.
F.F.P is immediately stored @ $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ or less.

\section*{Uses:}

Pts with burns
Pts in shock
Surgery (heart surgery)

\section*{7. CRYOPRECIPITATE:}

Is prepared from fresh blood less than 4 hrs old.
Blood is collected in double bag and then centrifuged @ $4^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ @ 1000 rpm for 10 - 15minutes.
Plasma is then extracted into the satellite bag.
The satellite bag is then immediately immersed completely in a mixture of dry ice and alcohol (methyl alcohol).
This mixture freezes the plasma immediately and attains a temperature of about $-70^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.

At this stage the pilot tube is still attached to the main bag.
The main bag should be kept away from the mixture to avoid haemolysis.
The plasma is then thawed @ $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ overnight
When thawed, the bags are centrifuged hard at 2000 rpm for about $10-20$ minutes.
The clear supernatant - plasma - is extracted back to the main bag.
About $10-20 \mathrm{mls}$ of plasma is left in the satellite bag.
After thawing the plasma contain cotton - wool like precipitate.
This precipitate is rich in factor VIII and Fibrinogen and is what is known as cryoprecipitate and does not dissolve back in plasma.
After allowing almost all clear supernatant to the main bag and leaving $10-20 \mathrm{mls}$ in the satellite the main bag is separated from the satellite.
The cryoprecipitate in satellite bag is stored @ $-20^{\circ}$.

\section*{Uses:}

Treatment of haemophilic patients.
vii. Cryoprecipitate is thawed before use contents from units are given intra - venously using syringes.

\section*{STORAGE OF WHOLE BLOOD}

\section*{Anticoagulants;}

These are anticoagulants used primarily for blood transfusion.
Include: ACD, CPD, CPDA, and Heparin.

\section*{1. A.C.D. - Acid - Citrate - Dextrose:}
- Citric acid - monohydrate
- Dextrose
- Trisodium citrate - dihydrate
- Water

80g
25g
22g
1000 mls (1litre)

\section*{Purpose of the ingredients:}
(a) Trisodium citrate:

Prevents coagulation by binding calcium
(b) Citric Acid.

Maintain the pt
(c) Dextrose

Nutrient for cells/energy
(d) Water

Solvent.
ACD:
When used in plastic bags, contains $60-75 \mathrm{mls}$ and should be mixed in 450 mls of whole blood.
Blood collected in ACD should be used in 21 days and should be stored @ $4^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.
After 21 days $\mathrm{K}^{+}$escapes from the cells into the solution through osmosis and combine in citrate to form K citrate that is toxic.

Has pH 5 (acid) which makes RBC's loose visibility faster Likewise Na+ escapes from anticoagulant to cell hence ion content of cells is altered.

\section*{2. C.P.D. (Citrate Phosphate Dextrose)}

Trisodium citrate (dihydrate) -26-3g
Citric acid 3.27 g
Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (monohydrate) 2.22 g - for buffer pH .
Dextrose 25.5g
Water 1000 mls .

\section*{USES}

63 mls of C.P.D is mixed in 450 mls of whole blood.

\section*{Blood to be used in 28-32 days}
C.P.D is less acid than ACD and hence causes less haemolysis.

Loss of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from RBC is also less.
Cell viability in CPD is better than ACD.
CPD maintains the RBC's D.P.G - diphosphoglyceric acid.
Due to less acidity, an enzyme known as mutase is capable of producing D.P.G.
Acid pH enhances production of phosphatase that breaks down D.P.G

\section*{3. C.P.D.A}

Trisodium citrate (dihydrate)
Citric acid
Na HPO4
Dextrose
Adenine
Water.

The addition of adenine to C.P.D raises the ATP level in stored blood.
It also increases the post - survival level of cells when blood is transfused.
It also maintains the D.P.G better than when C.P.D is used alone.

\section*{Adenine has no adverse clinical reactions}

It is safe even for exchange transfusion in new - borns.
Blood stored in C.P.D.A can be used between $32-35$ days.
Available as CPDA I and II

\section*{4. HEPARIN:}

Is the best anticoagulant but does not keep blood for long.
Blood collected in heparin must be used immediately within 24 hours.
A large quantity of heparin is needed to collect a pint of blood - Heparin is very expensive.

\section*{SAFE STORAGE OF BLOOD}

\section*{WHOLE BLOOD.}

Whole blood and red cells must always be stored at a temperature between ${ }^{+} 2^{0} \mathrm{C}$ and $6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The main reasons for giving a blood transfusion are to restore or help to maintain the body's oxygen carrying capacity and the volume of blood circulating around the body. If blood is not stored at between ${ }^{+} 2^{0} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }^{+} 6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, its oxygen carrying ability is greatly reduced.
The anticoagulant/preservative solution in the blood bag contains nutrients for the blood during storage and stops the blood from clotting. The red cells can only carry and deliver oxygen if they remain viable: that is, if they retain the same properties as they have during their normal circulation in the body.
The most important substances in maintaining the viability of red cells are glucose and adenosine triphosphste(ATP). It is essential to maintain an equilibrium between ATP, 2,3 Diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG), glucose and pH . One of the anticoagulant/preservatives most commonly used is citrate phosphate dextrose with adenine (CPDA-1). The dextrose and adenine help the red cells to maintain ATP during storage, and the citrate is the anticoagulant which stops the blood from clotting.
Another important reason for storing blood between ${ }^{+} 2^{0} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }^{+} 6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is to keep the growth of any bacterial contamination in the unit of blood to a minimum. If blood is stored above ${ }^{+} 6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, bacteria that may have inadvertently entered the unit during collection may grow to such an extent that transfusion of the contaminated blood could be fatal.
The lower limit of ${ }^{+} 2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is also very important. This is because red cells are very sensitive to freezing. If they are allowed to freeze, the red red cells membranes rupture and haemoglobin is released; that is, the cells are haemolysed. The transfusion of haemolysed blood can also be fatal.

\section*{Changes that take place in stored blood.}
1. During storage there is fall in ATP.
2. Depletion of ATP during storage have the following effects.
3. The R.b.c changes their shape from disc shape to spherical.
4. RBC's loose their membrane lipids, integrity of cell membrane is interfered with
5. There is an increase in cellular rigidity rbc's loose the bi-concave shape
6. The depletion of 2,3-DPG lowers cell/RBC's $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity.
7. Potassium leaves the red cells into plasma
8. Sodium leaves plasma into red cells
9. Formation of citrate toxicity
10. Haemolysis is evident
11. Bacterial contamination

\section*{IMMUNOLOGY:}

\section*{Definition:}

It's the study of immunoglobins which are responsible for the body's defence mechanism.
An antigen must be introduced to a host in a relevant route for it to cause any immunological response i.e. formation of antibodies. The host must be lacking that antigen i.e. the antigen should be self. When an antigen enters the host, there are various functions which occur e.g. the antigen is modified in some way by the host macrophages hence referred to as non-specific reactions. The second stage is more specific in that the host produces antibodies against that antigen. The production of immunoglobulins is conjured on two classes of cells being the T - cells and B - cells.
T cells are responsible for cellular immunity. B - cells are responsible for Humoral immunity. These cells manifest what is called Immunological memory.

\section*{T - CELLS AND B - CELLS:}

Depending on the type of antigen involved, the antigenic material stimulate a response in either the cellular or the Humoral immune system. On some occasions both systems are involved. The cells which get involved in one of the two types of immune response, begins life as undifferentiated stem cell in the bone marrow. The classic work on chicken showed that primitive cells programmed by Thymus developed into T - cells and manifest cellular immunity while cells programmed by an organ known as BURSA OF FABRICUS develop into Bcells and produce antibodies as part of humoral response. The bursa equivalent in man is not clear. Is no discrete organ in man that functions like Bursa of fabricus in chicken. But there is evidence that cells located in the out perform this function as the bursal equivalent. There often is referred to as out associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
B - cells develops free of thymus and also T- cells. Following there formation in the bone marrow, cells which has been involved in one of the immune mechanism develops through the lymphoid cells series and eventually reach the small lymphocyte stage, when lymphocyte reach the above stage (small lymphocyte) they are uncommitted.
The lymphocytes becomes committed when instructed by the thymus or the Bursa dependant systems. Following the instruction, the cells proceed to a blast cell stage and are now known as committed immune blast. The committed immune blast in thymic dependant system develops into cells that are called committed effector cells or immunocytes or activated T - cells at this stage the T - cells at this stage the T - cells morphological resemble the small lymphocyte stage and migrate to the small lymphocyte stage and migrate to the lymphoid tissue, committed immunoblasts which develop through the instruction of the Bursa of fabricus develops into cells called plasma cell or immunocytes or Activated B - cells.

\section*{T-CELLS FUNCTION:}
1. Are responsible for cellular immunity.
2. Play a key role in tissue rejection or homograft rejection.
3. Responsible for allergy and hypersensitivity.
4. Graft against host reactivity
5. T-cells do not produce circulating serum antibodies.

\section*{B - CELLS FUNCTIONS:}

B- cells that produce antibodies are immunocytes of great importance in the study of blood group antibodies. B - cells involves immunoglobulins IgA, IgE incorporated in the cells as intra-cellular materials.

Other B- cells function by producing antibodies which are then secreted and become circulating antibodies in the serum. In this class of immunoglobulins, we have $\operatorname{IgG}, \operatorname{IgM}$, and $\operatorname{IgA}$.
B-cells are responsible for production of $\operatorname{IgG}, \operatorname{IgM}, \operatorname{IgA}$, and $\operatorname{IgE}$.
Blood group antibodies fall into this category of Humoral antibodies for circulating extracellutory .

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF ANTIBODIES:}

Production of antibodies is part of natural defence mechanism of the body.
The antibodies produced help in fighting bacteria and some viruses that enables an individual to repel infection. Indeed, some viruses are deliberately injected in those individuals e.g. in vaccination and these viruses stimulate the immune mechanism to produce antibodies against these viruses.
It is the same concept of immunization whereby non-harmful form of bacteria are injected or given by whatever form so that the immune system of the body will later on produce antibodies against such bacteria when a person is incapable of producing antibodies to fight the infections, then antibodies can be passively given. Passive immunization is usually short lived.
There are some abnormalities in which individuals cannot produce antibodies to fight whichever infection present.
Example:
- Agammaglobulinaemia - B
- Thymic dysplasia - T
- Reticular dysgenesis \& Thymic dysplasia - T/B
- D-George syndrome - T
- Aids syndrome - T
1. Agammaglobulinaemia: (lack of antibody in blood)

It's a genetic or acquired defect people in this condition, their B-cells functions are inhibited (do not produce B-cells) hence they have no Humoral response to produce antibodies. A child born with such a defect, will only survive for few months because all this time the child will be surviving using acquired maternal antibodies.
2. Thymic dysplasia:

This condition affects the production of T-cells but not the B-cells. This condition is also termed as the Nezelof syndrome. The T-cells are inhibited.
3. D-George syndrome:

This also involves the production of T-cells. The most serious abnormality is the one which affects both T and B cells.
4. Reticular dysgenesis \& Thymic dysplasia. (Swiss Type):

These two conditions both affect T and B cells production hence no cellular or Humoral immunity can develop.
5. Aids syndrome:

This also affects T-cells production.

\section*{ANTIBODY STRUCTURE:}

The term immunoglobulin collectively refers to all proteins molecules having antibody activity i.e. the ability to combine or react specifically with an antigen as well as structurery related protein molecules such as - Bence

Jones proteins, Myeloma proteins and Waldenstrome's macroglobulin that are found in various pathological conditions.
There are five major classes of immunoglobulins that can be distinguished on the basis of chemical, physical and biological characteristics. Blood group antibodies mostly encountered belongs to IgG and IgM, though occasionally IgA and other antibodies are found.
Immunoglobulin molecules are composed of one or more basic structural units that are common to all classes of immunoglobulins. The basic structure unit is composed of 4 polypeptide chains i.e. there are two identical Heavy chains (H) and 2 identical light (L) chains.
Each heavy chain (H) and adjacent light chains interact through non-covalent interaction called disulphide bond. The 2 light chains and the heavy chain pairs are linked by non-covalent forces (interaction) and one or more disulphide bonds.

There are 2-types of L-chains namely
1) KAPPA
2) LAMBDA.

The 5 classes of immunoglobulins are characterized by their H-chains and its this characteristic of immunoglobulin which is given by the H-chain.
There are five major types or classes of Heavy chains (H) and are:

\section*{Chains}

1 gamma $\gamma$
2. Delta ( $\delta$ )
3. Alpha ( $\alpha$ )
4. Mu ( $\mu$ )
5. Epsilon ( $\varepsilon$ )

\section*{BASIC STRUCTURAL UNIT OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN:}

\section*{Molecule:}

\section*{Diagram}

\section*{FUNCTIONAL REGIONS OF IMMUNOGLOBULIN MOLECULES:}

If an 1 gG molecule is treated with an enzyme e.g. Papain, the molecule splits into 3 fragments, this will this will give rise to 2 identical fragments.
The two identical fragments are capable of combining specifically with an antigen though cannot cause agglutination or precipitation (agglutination is visible ag - ab reaction - visualised).
The two are called Fragment antigen binding (FAB) and each has a single binding site and each of these combining site has the ability to combine with an antigen. The F2b fragment, each is composed of one eight chain and $\frac{1}{2}$ the H-chain.
The $3^{\text {rd }}$ fragment is termed as fragment crystallization (FC) which is composed of two $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}$-chains. These FC fragment is termed has no ability to combine in an antigen. FC region is responsible for various biological functions of given immunoglobulins.
Some of these functions are:
(b) Complement activation
(c) Placental transverse i.e. passage through placenta
(d) Conveys the major antigenic determinants of the class.

\section*{CONSTANT AND VARIABLE REGION}

A unique feature of 1 gG chain is that the amino terminal, $\frac{1}{2}$ of each light chain and $\frac{1}{4}$ of each heavy chain, has amino acid sequence that demonstrate considerable variation in amino acid sequence from a molecule to molecule. This called variable region ( V - region). The variable region is concerned in antigen binding thus antibody specificity results from variation in the amino-acid sequence in the source of various differences in different blood groups and sub-groups. The amino acid sequence in remainder of heavy and light chains are identical in immunological molecule of a given class and sub-class, this is what we call the constant region (unshaded area).
The constant region of a molecule demonstrates class and sub-class specificity, genetic polymorphism and various biological effector functions of the molecule.
The two regions of the molecules are believed to be produced under separate genetic control.

\section*{ANTIGEN DOSAGE}

The size of dosage and spacing is of great influence in antigen response. Doses below the minimum required dose of a given antigen may not produce any significant antibody response. Excessive dose of antigen may cause immunological tolerance.

\section*{IMMUNOLOGICAL TOLERANCE:}

A very large primary (1\%) dose of antigen or Hapten may inhibit or suppress the formation of specific antibodies, such conditions formerly called antigenic paralysis but today known as immunological tolerance.
Immunological tolerance does not occur if production of antibodies had been initiated earlier on. Due to the commonly encountered mode of infection whereby only a small antigen is produced by an invading microbe, the invading microbe initiates formation of antibodies hence immunological tolerance is in the natural infections diseases.

\section*{FORENSIC SCIENCE:}

Forensic Science deals with problem of identify (Blood Serology).
Blood groups help in this forensic science trying to identify the identity.
Blood groups do not however show positive identity e.g. if:
1) This man is the father of the child.
2) This old stain originated from this person.

But blood groups do show definite non-identity if;
1) This man is not the definite father of this particular child.
2) This blood cannot have originated from that person.

\section*{Blood Grouping;}

Blood grouping is applied in cases of doubtful paternity or maternity.

\section*{General Principle;}

Blood group antigens are inherited according to Mendelian law. So in cases of doubtful paternity, two relevant rules of inheritance are used;
1) A blood group gene cannot appear in a child unless present in one or the other or both the parents.
2) If one parent is homozygous of a particular blood group gene, its product must appear in the old group of the child.
(a) e.g. The assumed father and mother are both O and the child is A . The A gene which is the child must have been inherited from the other (real) father.
A father of blood group O cannot pass A gene to the child, therefore the serological test excludes him from paternity.
(b) In homozygous (co-dominant) e.g. Rh system Cc, all the children inherit the gene present.

The exclusion of paternity due to differences in blood groups e.g. mother and father "O" and child.
A is known as first order of exclusion.
While exclusion due to homozygous e.g. father Cc and child is $\mathrm{c}^{-} \mathrm{c}^{-}$is known as second order of exclusion. Exclusion of paternity by the second order of exclusion always must be supported by at least one other second order of exclusion e.g. dosage titration.

\section*{Dosage titration:}

Is a titration test which is done to show whether an individual is 2 homozygous or not for 2 particular antigen. Homozygous cells when reacted selected antisera gives a double reaction and a higher titration score than a heterozygous which gives single dose reaction.
e.g. Cells $\mathrm{Mn} \quad \mathrm{Mm}$
antigen M ++ ++++

\section*{BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS USED IN PATERNITY (MATERNITY) PROBLEMS.}
1) ABO System
2) Rhesus System Rh D, C, Cw, E, C, e.
3) MNSs (M, N, S, s)

But there are other blood groups which can be used to increase the chances of proving non-paternity
e.g. Kell Duffy Kid Lutheran
NOTE:
Blood groups used must have reliable and stable antigens. E.g. ABO system is known to be entirely reliable because of its inheritance. The anomalies in ABO are rare and when they occur can be easily detected particularly by using "O" serum or Anti - AB.
Secretor gene can be applied with confidence to the problems of paternity but only in the mating of the Sese and sese (shows the exclusion maternity cases). Blood group used in cases of mixing or kidnapping of babies in maternity.

Identification of stains and fragments from individuals;
This is used in cases of assaults. The first and foremost in identification is
(a) To prove that the blood is human blood before any other test is per formed.
(b) In most cases the material to be identified are inadequate quantity and is al ways irreplaceable, hence the technique involved in identifying stains must be such that they require small amount of material for
their performance since the stained areas are not always visible and may be difficult to distinguish them from dirt.

\section*{ADJUVANTS:}

These are substances which are them - selves not antigenic but when incorporated in an antigen they enhance or increase antibody production .
Adjuvants are simple and commonly used in immunization of human beings in diphtheriae and tetanus toxoids. Example of adjuvants;
1. Freud adjuvant (complete and incomplete)
2. Alum gel

Freud adjuvants are most powerful of the adjuvants known. Antigen is added to adjuvants and this make an venous solution, injected into the host subcutaneously or cutaneously to provoke antibody production.
Its 2 high molecular weight substance used to suspend a given antigen to enhance its antigenic performance of the antibody production.
Example of other adjuvants;
1. $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}, \mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{PO} 4)_{3}$
2. Silica.
3. Vitamin A
4. Saponia
5. Mineral oil emulsion
6. Calcium and sodium (4\%) alignate
7. Berylin sulphate
8. Tapioka
9. Ammonium Sulphate
10. Sodium alignate
11. Endotoxins of gram -ve organisms
12. Exotoxins of $\mathrm{G}+\mathrm{ve}$ organisms.
13. Acid fast bacilli
14. Bordetella pertusis.

There are various tests which are used and the first one Benzidine test.
But this test is nowadays not used because of the carcinogenic nature of its reagent.
It has been replaced by KASTLEMEYER test and is referred to as highly sensitive and it's capable of detecting blood spots practude invisible to the eyes. If Kastermeyer test is negative, then there's no point of continuing with any other test.
There are other tests such as Acid Phosphatase for vaginal fluids and seminal fluids.

\section*{SPECIES IDENTIFICATION:}

To identify the species, antiseras which are specific to them are used. These antisera will react in the proteins contained in the serum of the stain. All medical legal laboratories have antiseras for various common species e.g. Man, sheep, cow, dog, chicken e.t.c. In many cases all what is necessary is to establish whether the blood is from human.
Antiseras specific for various species can be obtained commercially.
Example;
1) Ring test
2) Antiglobulin consumption test
3) Immuno - electrosmophoresis.
