                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>During the foetal life, production of blood cells occurs in various body tissues, but mainly in the liver and the bone marrow. Shortly after birth, under normal conditions, the marrow is the only tissue that continues to produce red cells, granulocytes, monocytes and platelets. Until about 5 years of age, the marrow in all the bones is red and cellular. However, this red marrow is gradually replaced by yellow inactive bone marrow and by the age of 18 to 20 years the active red marrow remains only in the sternum, the ribs, the vertebrae, the skull, the pelvic bones and the proximal ends of long bones.</p>
                            
                            <p>Lymphocytes also originate in the bone marrow, but the lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, etc.) has a prime function in their maturation. These formed elements of blood go through a series of developmental steps consisting of duplication, differentiation and maturation in the marrow or the lymphoid tissue. They are released in the circulating peripheral blood only when they are sufficiently developed or mature.</p>

                            <p>All these blood cells have a predetermined life span. The plasma components, mainly proteins, also have a fixed rate of turnover, which is often expressed as $T_{50}$, i.e., the time during which half the substance is removed from the circulation and replaced. The loss of cells through the normal process of aging, physiological consumption and sometimes by loss from the body, is normally compensated for by proliferation, maturation and release of new cells. This process is referred to as haemopoiesis. The constituents of the blood are in a state of balance between loss, regeneration and replacement. This state of equilibrium is known as homeostasis.</p>

                            <p>The mechanism by which the multipotential stem cells are induced to become stem cells (progenitor cells) for the various cell lines is not clearly understood. The stem cells have the capability of self-renewal and of responding to various stimuli and hormonal messages with increased production of one or the other cell line when the need arises. There are very few pluripotential stem cells in the body. Their number is regulated and kept constant by a feedback mechanism and in a healthy individual, they are capable of supplying the blood cells according to requirements.</p>

                            <p>The development of a mature blood cell from a pluripotential cell takes place in three phases.</p>

A normal red blood cell (RBC) is a biconcave disc, with an average diameter of 7.3 microns, thicker at the edges and thinner at the centre. It is non-nucleated and contains haemoglobin. The whole sequence of maturation from the pronormoblast to a mature RBC takes about 3–5 days; and each RBC has a total life span of approximately 120 days. There are about 5 million erythrocytes per mm³ ($5 \times 10^6/\mu l$) of peripheral blood in a healthy individual.</span>

                            <h3>Function of Red Blood Cells</h3>
                            <p>The main function of the RBC is to carry oxygen to the cells of the body. Haemoglobin within each RBC acts as the oxygen carrier. The concentration of haemoglobin in blood is thus an indication of its capacity to carry oxygen, on which all cells are absolutely dependent for life and energy.</p>

                            <h3>Elimination of Red Blood Cells</h3>
                            <p>At the end of its life span of 120 days, the worn-out RBC is removed from circulation by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) by a process called phagocytosis. The RES cells are located in sinusoids (small blood vessels) in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, etc. The old RBCs show some changes on their surface which are recognised by the phagocytes in the RES and removed by engulfing and digesting them. All the re-usable components, such as protein and iron are recovered and re-circulated, while non-reusable components are eliminated.</p>

                            <p>Under normal conditions, five types of mature white blood cells (WBCs) or leucocytes are found in the peripheral blood. Three of these types contain granules in their cytoplasm, and are therefore called granulocytes. Depending on the nature of the granules, they are called neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. The other two types of cells, called agranulocytes, are monocytes and lymphocytes.</p>
                            
                            <p>Out of these cells, granulocytes and monocytes are formed in the bone marrow from a pluripotential cell by differentiation, proliferation and maturation. Lymphocytes, however, have a very complex method of maturation and this process takes place in the reticulo-endothelial system. The blood granulocytes and monocytes, on the other hand, are controlled by a feedback system similar to that of RBCs. There are colony stimulating factors (CSFs) or leucopoietins which stimulate and produce colonies of a particular white cell line.</p>

                            <p>There are certain criteria for identifying the cells:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>size of the cell,</li>
                                <li>ratio of size of nucleus to that of the cytoplasm,</li>
                                <li>appearance of nuclear membrane,</li>
                                <li>presence of nucleoli,</li>
                                <li>staining reaction of the cytoplasm,</li>
                                <li>presence of cytoplasmic granules, and</li>
                                <li>the type, size and distribution of granules.</li>
