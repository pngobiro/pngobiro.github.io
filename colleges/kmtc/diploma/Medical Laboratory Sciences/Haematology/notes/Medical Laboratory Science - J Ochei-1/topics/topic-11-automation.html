                                    <p>The Coulter counter system is based on the principle that the red or white cell is a poor conductor of electricity compared to the diluent such as saline. When the diluent is displaced by a cell, it causes a measurable change in resistance.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>In the basic Coulter counter, the cells are allowed to pass through an aperture through which an electric current is flowing. Cells passing through the aperture displace the diluent; and being bad conductors of electricity, increase the resistance which is counted as a voltage pulse. The cell suspension is drawn through the aperture with the help of a vacuum pump into a system of tubing.</p>

                            <p>As the vacuum pump draws the mercury up the tube, the cell suspension flows through the aperture into the aperture tube. When a cell passes through the aperture, it displaces an equal volume of the conducting solution and increases the electrical resistance, creating a voltage pulse. The height of the pulse (impedance) is proportional to the volume of the cell. The number of pulses indicate the cell count.</p>

                            <h3>2. Optical Methods Using Focused Laser Beams</h3>
                            <p>This method is also known as flow cytometry. The blood is diluted in isotonic saline and passed through a laser beam as a stream of single cells. Light is scattered at an angle proportional to the structural details of the cell. There are two types of light sensors: a light sensor that detects forward scatter of the beam, i.e., at 180 degrees from the light source, which correlates with the cell volume and density, and another that detects the right angle or 90 degrees scatter, which depends on the cellular contents such as the granularity of the cytoplasm.</p>

                            <p>There are two types of automated blood group systems.</p>

                            <h3>1. Photometric System</h3>
                            <p>In this system, patient’s cells and serum are mixed with appropriate reagents in cuvettes. The cuvettes are centrifuged to accelerate the agglutination process. The next step involves agitation of cuvettes to resuspend and disperse all unagglutinated red blood cells. The agglutinated red cells remain in the central area of the cuvette. Each cuvette is then read photometrically twice. One reading is for the central position and the other for the peripheral portion. No variation in both readings indicates absence of agglutination whereas a significant variation denotes a positive result.</p>

                            <h3>2. Continuous Flow System</h3>
                            <p>This system of blood grouping is adapted from autoanalysers used in Clinical Chemistry. Patient’s red cells and plasma are aspirated separately and carried through a system of tubings. Two specimens are separated by air bubbles. Reagents are drawn in by another system of tubings. The volume of each reagent is controlled by the diameter of the tubes. After the reaction, the free red cells are dispersed by a jet of saline, leaving the agglutinated red cells behind. The dispersed free cells are then lysed and the degree of lysis is determined colorimetrically. A higher degree of lysis denotes absence of agglutination.</p>
