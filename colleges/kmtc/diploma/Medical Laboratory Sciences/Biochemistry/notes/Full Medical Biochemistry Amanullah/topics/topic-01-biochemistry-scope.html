In short, answers to two of these most important questions can be cited here.</p>

                            <p>It is said that man is made out of mud and there are about 93 elements in the mud or the earth's crust. Among these many elements, only a few of them arrange in a specific order to give rise to life. Any disorder in these elements results in a disease which may lead to death. Therefore, Biochemistry is the study of elements which make life and the fashion in which they are arranged. It also explains the functioning of these elements which trigger and continue the process of life. The extent of de-arrangement of the life making elements, may either lead to disease or cause death.</p>

                            <p>Medical professionals undertake Biochemistry in order to deal specifically with different methodologies of prevention and rectification of various disorders thus bringing back the body to function normally thereby helping in leading a healthy life and delaying the process of death.</p>

How are they aligned with each other to make possible the living state? In this book we will study the molecules forming the living matter and correlation of biological function with the molecular structure. From its study, Biochemistry has come to the conclusion that, matter in an appropriate physico-chemical state of organization acquires the traits of living substances.</p>

                            <p>These elements combine in different ratios and proportions to make a molecule. For instance C, H, and O combine in 1:2:1 ratio to make carbohydrates. Similarly, C, H, O and N combine to form proteins and lipids. Nucleic acids are the result of combination of C, H, O, N and P. Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, grouped under a category called macromolecules, form the basic components that make life possible. In addition to these molecules there are micromolecules like hormones, vitamins and minerals that also play a vital role in the process of life. Among the macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids are known as informational macromolecules and the other two, viz., carbohydrates, lipids are non-informational macromolecules. The areas of study of Biochemistry are the study of structure of these molecules, their properties, their functions, their inter-relationship and their metabolism. In order to study these characters it becomes necessary to isolate them, separate them, purify them and bring them into a suitable form so that it can easily be analyzed and characterized. Hence, Biochemistry also deals with methods and techniques to isolate, purify and characterize various compounds.</p>

                            <p>Biochemistry deals not only at the molecular level but also at the level of the cell. A cell can suitably be defined as the theatre of life, where each and every artist (molecules) play their role (functions) exactly as the director (DNA) wants, and the director directs exactly as that appreciated and enjoyed by the audience (cell organelles). Biochemistry has proved that the above cooperation exists well for normal functioning of a cell and thereby of a living organism. A little misunderstanding between them leads to disturbances in the cell and finally may lead to death of the living organism.</p>

                            <p>Investigations of diabetes mellitus are completely based upon the laboratory tests in Biochemistry labs, where the presence of sugar in urine is tested by Benedict's test. Similarly, investigation of other disorders like albuminuria, lactosuria, etc. are carried out here.</p>
                            
                            <p>Due to the recent knowledge of cell receptors for various substances it has become possible to treat hormonal disorders and to kill cancerous cells without affecting other cells. Toxic substances are encapsulated in membranous cells having complimentary surface receptors to that of cancerous cells. These capsulated cells when injected gets attached to the cancerous cells due to their complimentarity and release the toxic substances into the cancerous cells destroying them.</p>
                            
                            <p>The technique of enzyme immobilization has helped in the treatment of various in born errors of metabolism. The most recent advancement in the technique of "gene manipulation" has helped in the large scale, artificial synthesis of peptide hormones like insulin and synthesis of enzymes making the use of micro-organism. Hence it can be concluded that Biochemistry is the tool to make diagnosis of certain diseases.</p>
