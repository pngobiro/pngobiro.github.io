                                <dd>Jelly-like material present outside the nucleus in which the cell organelles are located. It is the site of protein synthesis and many metabolic events. The cytoplasm contains many enzymes for general metabolism. It contains fibre of the cytoskeletal system, which organizes cytoplasmic structure.</dd>

                                <dt>Mitochondria</dt>
                                <dd>Spherical to rod-shaped organelles with a double membrane. The inner membrane is infolded many times, forming a series of projections (called cristae). The mitochondrion is known as the power house of the cell as it generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of the cell.</dd>

                                <dd>Small organelles composed of RNA-rich cytoplasmic granules that are sites of protein synthesis. Ribosome size is measured in Svedberg (S) units; derived from sedimentation in ultracentrifuge (used before electron microscopes were available). In prokaryotes the ribosomes are made of 30S and 50S subunits, assemble into 70S ribosome whereas in eukaryotes the ribosomes are made of 40S and 60S subunits, assemble into 80S ribosome. In bacteria they occupy 25% of cell volume and use 90% of cell energy. Less in many specialized eukaryotic cells but still are the dominant activity of almost all the cells.</dd>

                                <dd>It is a spherical body containing many organelles, including the nucleolus. It controls many of the functions of the cell (by controlling protein synthesis) and contains DNA (in chromosomes). The nucleus is surrounded by the nuclear membrane. It is the locus of DNA/RNA synthesis and protein assembly. It contains chromatin i.e., DNA-protein complexes. Chromatin can condense into chromosomes during cell division.</dd>

                                <dt>Nuclear membrane</dt>
                                <dd>The nuclear membrane is a double layered structure surrounding the nucleus containing many nuclear pores. These pores allow different materials to move in and out of nucleus. The pores have octagonal 'doors' made of protein which open and close on either side depending on specific signals. Pore diameter is about 10 nanometers ($10 \times 10^{-9}$ m), smaller than the diameter of a complete ribosome. They can open up to as much as 26 nm in response to certain signals. Some signals allow motion in but not out, other signals control reverse transport.</dd>

                                <dt>Nucleolus</dt>
                                <dd>The nucleolus is present within the nucleus. Some cells have more than one nucleolus. It is the assembly plant for ribosomes. Ribosomal proteins are made in cytoplasm and transported back into the nucleus. Ribosomal RNA is made in the nucleus. These two elements are integrated inside nucleolus to create ribosomal subunits. These are then exported out of nucleus through nuclear pores.</dd>

                                <dt>Centrosome</dt>
                                <dd>A small body located near the nucleus, also called the 'microtubule organizing centre'. It has a dense center and radiating tubules. The centrosomes are where microtubules are made. During cell division (mitosis), the centrosome divides and the two parts move to opposite sides of the dividing cell. The centriole is the dense centre of the centrosome.</dd>

Rough ER is covered with ribosomes that give it a rough appearance. Rough ER transports materials through the cell. It synthesizes proteins in sacks called cisternae for export or movement to different cell organelles like the golgi body, or inserted into the cell membrane but not to cytoplasm. The transport proteins designated for export carry a peptide signal at growing end, causing growing protein to move to ER (docking), insert peptide into membrane, translocate growing polypeptide chain across ER membrane.

It produces the membranes that surround the lysosomes. The golgi body packages proteins and carbohydrates into membrane-bound vesicles for export from the cell. Functions as intracellular 'post office' for sorting new proteins made on rER. Vesicles containing protein pinch off from ER, fuse with cis face of golgi. Inside golgi, oligosaccharide chains on proteins are modified. Vesicles pinch off from trans face of golgi, carry proteins to several possible destinations: export (out of cell), lysosomes, peroxisomes, cell membrane, etc.</p>

                            <h3>Lysosomes</h3>
                            <p>These are round organelles surrounded by a membrane where the digestion of cell nutrients takes place due to presence of the digestive enzymes. They contain $\sim 40$ hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases, proteases, nucleases, etc. which break down organic polymers of all types. Lysosomes continuously break down old proteins, foreign materials, and many wastes. They also bring about phagocytosis, a process in which foreign materials are brought into the cell and 'chewed up'. Sometimes lysosomes open up in cell itself causing death of the cell termed as apoptosis, hence are called <strong>suicide bags</strong> of the cell.</p>

                            <h3>Vacuole</h3>
                            <p>Fluid-filled, membrane-surrounded cavities inside a cell. The vacuole fills with food being digested and waste material that is on its way out of the cell. There are specialized vacuoles which function to store fat as fat droplets (TAG).</p>

                            <h3>Peroxisomes</h3>
                            <p>These are single membrane oval or spherical cellular organelles. They are also called as microbodies. They contain catalase enzyme. Peroxisomes are involved in the oxidation of long chain fatty acids and synthesis of plasmalogens and glycolipids.</p>

                            <h3>Cytoskeletal system</h3>
                            <p>It provides internal fibrous structure to cells because cell is not 'just a bag in a bubble', it contains lots of internal fibres or internal 'skeleton'. It is not rigid like bone, instead it is capable of being assembled, allows cell movement, cell division, internal motion of the organelles and is broken down in minutes. The cytoskeletal system is composed of microtubules and microfilament.</p>

                                        <strong>Microtubules:</strong> The microtubules has the largest diameter among the fibres found in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotes. It involves many structures: Cilia, flagella, spindle fibres that polymerize from centrioles during mitosis/meiosis. They are made of the protein called tubulin and polymerizes into hollow tubules of $25\mathrm{nm}$ diameter.

                            <p>Animal cells do not have cell walls, but have ECM, i.e., a meshwork of macromolecules outside plasma membrane. It consists mainly of glycoproteins (proteins with oligosaccharide chains), especially collagen. Some cells are attached directly to ECM by bonding to collagen or fibronectin.</p>

                            <h3>Intracellular junctions</h3>
