                            <p>The history of entrepreneurship in Kenya began when the Indians built the railways, making it easier for people to move goods from one town to another and trade. After independence, the Kenyan government created several policy frameworks to recognise entrepreneurship as a medium for employment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Interest in the development of entrepreneurship and small enterprise in Kenya gained momentum as a possible remedy to the stagnation of economic development and the escalating unemployment problem between the early 1960 and 1970s.</p>
                            
                            <p>Although there were attempts by the government to develop entrepreneurship, the main impetus came from the international labor organization (ILO) report. The report centered on the potential of the informal sector and suggested that the bulk of Kenya's urban workers were self-employed in small enterprises.</p>
