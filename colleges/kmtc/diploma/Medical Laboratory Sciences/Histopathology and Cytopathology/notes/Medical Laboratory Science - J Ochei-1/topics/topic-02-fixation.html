                            <p>Fixation is the preservation after death of the shape, structure and chemical constituents of tissues and cells. Soon after death, tissues and cells begin to undergo changes leading to their break down and ultimate destruction. Such changes may be due to the action of enzymes normally present in the tissues themselves and so the changes are termed autolytic action (or self destruction). The changes can also be due to external influences such as bacteria which cause decomposition and putrefaction. These bacteria may be those that constitute the normal flora of the body or pathogens that are present due to a disease process.</p>
                            <p>These changes can be slowed down by low temperatures or prevented by fixation. Adequate and complete fixation is the foundation of all good histological preparations. Faults in fixation cannot be rectified at any later stage and the finished section can only be as good as its initial fixation. The stabilisation of the protein part of the framework of the cell is an important function of fixation. In addition to preserving the tissues and cells, the fixatives (i.e. the fixing fluid or vapour) also makes them resistant to subsequent treatment during processing.</p>
                            <p>It is essential that tissues are fixed as soon as possible after death or removal from the body. The tissue should never be allowed to dry as it will shrink. The length of time required for adequate fixation varies according to the size and consistency of the tissue and the fixative employed. If delay in fixation cannot be avoided, the tissue should be kept moist and chilled.</p>

                                Choosing a Fixative
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>So far in the search for diagnostic perfection, there is no single fixative that fulfils all of the above requirements. Many substances on their own have individual properties that make them fairly good fixatives. These substances are referred to as simple fixatives. So in order to obtain a fixative which will comply as closely as possible with the conditions required for fixation, it becomes necessary to combine several simple fixatives to achieve the desired effect. The resulting solution is referred to as compound fixative. Compound fixative is therefore by definition, a solution of two or more simple fixatives mixed together in order to obtain the combined effect of their individual actions upon the cells and tissue constituents.</p>
                            
                            <p>The choice of a fixative is determined by the nature of the investigation required. Several mixtures have become established as routine general fixatives, but most of them have been devised for a specific purpose and are not suitable for routine use.</p>

                            <p>Fixatives are usually grouped according to their action upon the cell and tissue constituents.</p>
                            
                            <div class="grid grid-2">
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Microanatomical fixatives</h4>
                                    <p>Those which preserve the tissue as well as allow the general microscopical study of the tissue structure, and also allow the various layers of tissues and cells to retain their former relationship with each other.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Cytological fixatives</h4>
                                    <p>Those fixatives which are devised for specific actions upon specific areas of the cell. This group of fixatives are further subdivided into nuclear and cytoplasmic fixatives. Practically, those cytological fixatives with a pH of less than 4.6 or those which contain glacial acetic acid are nuclear fixatives and the reverse is true for cytoplasmic fixatives.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Secondary fixation is a technique whereby considerable improvement over the results obtained by the use of 10% formalin alone is achieved. All specimens are collected in 10% formalin and the blocks selected by the pathologist for processing are then treated with a second, more specialized fixative for a shorter length of time. Thus the function of formalin for bulk use, distribution outside the laboratory, frozen section work, storage of gross specimens etc. is enhanced and supplemented by the secondary fixatives. The method is however, not without some shortcomings. It complicates the processing schedule and for preparations such as saturated mercuric chloride solution, extreme caution is needed in handling and it is also necessary to remove pigment from the section. This consideration has made the technique less popular.</p>
                            
                            <p>Whatever method of fixation is used, a large volume of fixative is required. It is recommended that the volume of the fixative should be about 20-40 times that of the tissue. In case of large specimens such as whole spleen this is not practicable. Such large specimens should be sliced at intervals of 2 cm or less to allow adequate penetration of the fixative. For the same reasons, hollow specimens like intestines and stomach, should be slit open.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Formaldehyde (HCHO)</dt>
                                <dd>Formaldehyde is a gas which is soluble in water to approximately 40% by weight. It is produced by the oxidation of methanol. This saturated gaseous solution is available commercially as formalin. The term formalin often brings about confusion. For example, a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated solution may be referred to as either 4% formaldehyde or 10% formalin. Formaldehyde preserves fats and proteins well with no precipitation. On long storage, particularly at low temperature, a white precipitate of paraformaldehyde forms. This can be prevented by storing formalin at room temperature or it can be removed by filtration through it does not adversely affect the fixing property of the reagent. Formalin is acid in reaction due to the presence of formic acid. Though not harmful, the acid can be neutralised by the addition of a small quantity of magnesium carbonate, or 3-4 drops of sodium hydroxide. Using magnesium carbonate may result in the sudden release of carbon dioxide which can cause an explosion. For this reason a wide mouth vessel should be used for neutralisation and later stored in a Winchester quart bottle. It is a reducing agent and therefore not compatible with potassium dichromate and osmium tetroxide solutions.</dd>

                                <dt>Mercuric chloride (HgCl₂)</dt>
                                <dd>Mercuric chloride is a constituent of many fixatives. It is often used as saturated aqueous solution. It is a good protein precipitant which rapidly penetrates and hardens the tissue. Unfortunately the rate of penetration decreases after the initial few millimeters, as a result large pieces of tissues tend to be hard and overfixed at the periphery and soft and underfixed in the middle. Because of this, and because it causes shrinkage, mercuric chloride is seldom used alone. Fixatives containing mercuric chloride are listed among the intolerant or harsh fixatives because exposure of tissue to their action in excess of the recommended times will produce excessive hardness and make the cutting of thin sections more difficult. It is radio-opaque and its presence in calcified tissue precludes the use of x-ray to test the end point of decalcification. Its presence in tissues inhibits freezing and makes frozen sections difficult to prepare, even though it neither destroys or preserves lipids. Staining of cytoplasm is enhanced following mercuric chloride fixation; and metachromatic staining is improved and better differentiated. Tissues fixed in mercuric chloride containing fixative will require treatment to remove the brownish black pigment which always forms. This is easily done by treating the sections with Lugol’s iodine for a few minutes and decolourising in sodium thiosulphate prior to staining. Mercuric chloride corrodes most metals and so the fixative should be kept in plastic containers. It is poisonous and should be handled with great care.</dd>

                                <dt>Picric acid (C₆H₂(NO₂)₃OH or trinitrophenol)</dt>
                                <dd>This fixative is explosive when dry and therefore must be stored damp, preferably under water. It is normally used as saturated aqueous solution at approximately 1% concentration. Picric acid precipitates proteins and combines with them to form picrates, some of which are soluble in water. For this reason, tissues fixed in picric acid containing fixatives are transferred directly to alcohol to render those picrates insoluble. Glycogen is well preserved. Picric acid causes shrinkage and it is not ideal for fixing kidney due to extreme distortion produced. It imparts yellow colour to tissues so that tiny tissues are easily picked out.</dd>

                                <dt>Osmium tetroxide (OsO₄—Osmic acid)</dt>
                                <dd>It is a pale yellow substance, soluble in water up to 6% at 20°C. The solution is a strong oxidising agent. The aqueous solution is easily reduced by light or by contamination with organic matter. For this reason, it should be stored in a chemically clean bottle in the dark at 2–6°C. Osmium tetroxide fixes lipids permanently. It preserves cytoplasmic structures well and that is why it is widely used in electron microscopy. It is usually used in combination with chromium salt. It has a poor penetrating power and so it is used to fix small pieces of tissues. Sometimes the vapour of osmium tetroxide is used to fix some tissues such as adrenal because it penetrates better than the solution. Thus washing in running water becomes unnecessary and the production of artefacts is highly reduced. The vapour is however hazardous as exposure to it can result in the deposition of the black oxide (OsO₂) in the cornea and may lead to blindness.</dd>

                                <dt>Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)</dt>
                                <dd>Acetic acid is usually referred to as glacial acetic acid because at approximately 17°C, it solidifies. It is a colourless solution with a pungent smell. Acetic acid is not used as a fixative alone because of its swelling effect on tissues especially collagen fibres. Its use in compound fixatives is to counteract the shrinking effect of other reagents. Acetic acid is a powerful nucleoprotein precipitant. It destroys mitochondria and golgi element and destroys the lipid-fixing property of potassium dichromate when used together. It is often used by cytologists to study chromosomes.</dd>

                                <dt>Ethyl alcohol (C₂H₅OH)</dt>
                                <dd>Ethyl alcohol is colourless, miscible with water and highly inflammable. It is of little use as a simple fixative except for smears and the occasional blood film; but it is frequently incorporated into compound fixatives. It penetrates slowly and tends to harden tissues as well as cause shrinkage which makes staining difficult. Alcohol denatures protein and tends to dissolve lipids. Glycogen is precipitated but not fixed. Being an oxidising agent it should never be used in conjunction with potassium dichromate or osmium tetroxide.</dd>

                                <dt>Potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇)</dt>
                                <dd>It is a widely used simple fixative. Depending on the pH of the solution, two different forms of fixatives can be effected. At a pH of less than 4.6, it precipitates protein and fixes carbohydrates. At pH higher than 4.6, the cytoplasm is well preserved and the mitochondria fixed. It is very useful in the study of myelinated nerve fibres. Tissues fixed in a potassium dichromate containing solution should be thoroughly washed in running tap water prior to dehydration to prevent the formation of an insoluble precipitate.</dd>

                                <dt>Chromic acid</dt>
                                <dd>It is a solution of chromium oxide (CrO₃) in water. It is stored as 2% stock solution. It is a powerful oxidising agent and so should not be combined with alcohol or formalin. Tissues fixed in chromic acid should be thoroughly washed in running water to avoid the formation of an insoluble precipitate.</dd>

                                <dt>Acetone</dt>
                                <dd>Acetone is mainly used in fixatives that allow the demonstration of enzymes. Acetone is similar in its fixing property to alcohol. Glycogen is not well preserved.</dd>

                            <p>This is a micro anatomical fixative that is not a compound one. It is probably the most widely used micro anatomical fixative. It is suitable for the fixation of surgical and post-mortem tissues and produces even fixation with very little shrinkage. It is useful for tissues intended as museum specimens as it allows the natural colour to be restored to the specimens. Formal saline is very tolerant and it allows the tissue to be left in it for long periods without excessive hardening or damages, and permits easy sectioning and most staining techniques.</p>
                            <p>Tissues containing much blood and fixed for a long period in formal saline may contain a fixation artefact, formalin pigment or acid formaldehyde chromatin, which should be removed with picric acid before staining the sections.</p>
                            <p>Formal saline is the fixative of choice for tissues undergoing subsequent decalcification, for the fixation of brain and other neurological tissues. It is also useful for the fixation of tissues from which frozen sections are to be prepared. Formal saline is a slow fixative and tissues fixed in it may shrink during dehydration but the shrinkage can be reduced by secondary fixation in formal saline sublimate. It is not very suitable for amyloid as the metachromatic reaction is reduced, while some acid dyes stain less intensely than they do following mercuric chloride fixation. Formalin vapour is very irritating and may cause damage to the nasal mucosa or cause sinusitis. It is advisable to wear rubber gloves when handling tissues fixed in formal saline to prevent dermatitis as a result of prolonged contact of formalin with skin.</p>

                            <p>This is a microanatomical fixative which is specially suitable for the prolonged fixation of routine, surgical, post-mortem and research specimens. Fixation time is 24 hours or longer depending on the size and consistency of the tissue.</p>
                            <p>The tissue should be washed in running tap water prior to cutting frozen sections or dehydration commencing in 70% alcohol. One big advantage of buffered formalin is the non-formation of acid-formaldehyde—haematin pigment. This fixative is also used extensively for tissues which require immunocytochemistry.</p>

                            <p>This fixative is used for detailed nuclear studies and the demonstration of glycogen. It is the fixative for embryos. Fixation of small pieces of tissue is complete in 12-24 hours and these tissues should be transferred directly to alcohol without washing in water. This is in order to render the picrates formed insoluble in water. The fixative keeps well, penetrates poorly but rapidly and evenly. It causes little shrinkage. It imparts yellow colour to tissues which is an advantage when dealing with tiny pieces of tissues. Staining of connective tissue by the trichrome methods is improved but when the fixative is employed for fibrous tissues, the acetic acid should be left out.</p>
                            <p>A disadvantage of the fixative is that it should not be used to fix kidney due to the gross distortion it produces. Bouin’s fluid is not reliable for cytological observation due to its acetic acid content since structures such as mitochondria may be distorted or totally destroyed.</p>

                            <p>This is a general fixative which is highly recommended for small pieces of liver and spleen. It gives excellent cytological detail and brilliant staining of nuclei and connective tissue fibres with the acid aniline dyes. Penetration is poor and tissues should not exceed 0.5 cm in thickness. Fixation is complete in 24 hours. When the tissue is immersed in this fixative for longer than the specified time, it becomes brittle and makes sectioning difficult. Sections must be treated with iodine to remove mercuric artefact pigment.</p>

                            <p>Helly’s fluid is widely used both as microanatomical and cytological fixative. It is recommended for the fixation of pituitary tissue and bone-marrow. Fixation, though slower than in Zenker’s fluid, is complete within 24 hours. Prior to dehydration, the fixed tissue must be thoroughly washed in running water to remove all traces of dichromate. Although the fixative contains an oxidising agent, potassium dichromate and a reducing agent, formaldehyde, it gives excellent nuclear fixation. Staining of the nuclei is more intense than after fixation with Zenker’s solution and cytoplasmic granules are well preserved. Tissues left in the fixative for longer than the specified period form a brown scum over the surface. Removal of mercuric pigment with Lugol’s iodine must be carried out.</p>

                            <p>This is a good general fixative that is widely used for routine surgical tissues and fibrous tumours. It causes minimal shrinkage and hardening. Fixation of small tissues is usually complete in 12-24 hours. After fixation, tissues are transferred directly to 95% or absolute alcohol. Tissues left longer than 24 hours tend to be excessively hardened. Following Susa fixation, many staining procedures including silver impregnation, are permitted giving enhanced results with sharp nuclear details. Fibrous tissues are easy to section. Weigert’s elastic fibre stain is, however, difficult to perform satisfactorily. As a routine, sections should be treated for mercuric artefact pigment.</p>

It is rapid in action and also dehydrates thereby allowing for urgent diagnosis to be made. Following fixation, the tissues are transferred directly to absolute alcohol. Fixation period ranges from half an hour to three hours. Glycogen and Nissl granules are well preserved while lipids are destroyed. It causes excessive shrinkage and is only suitable for small biopsies. Red blood corpuscles are haemolysed.</p>

                            <p>This perhaps is the most widely used fixative for the preservation of nuclear structures, especially chromosomes. With the omission of acetic acid, the solution becomes a useful cytoplasmic fixative. Small pieces of tissue not more than 2 mm in thickness, are adequately fixed in 12–24 hours. It preserves fat permanently. It is a costly fixative and has a poor penetrative power and so should be used for only small pieces of tissues. It deteriorates rapidly and should be prepared just before use. Following fixation, the tissue should be washed in running tap water for 6–24 hours. Flemming’s fluid minus acetic acid is very good for mitochondria and other cytoplasmic structures. Fixation is usually complete within 48 hours. The omission of acetic acid enhances cytoplasmic details.</p>

                            <p>This is the routinely used cytological fixative for wet smears. It is specially recommended for use with the Papanicolaou staining technique. Smears are fixed within 30 minutes but can be left in the fixative for longer period. Smears are rinsed in water before staining.</p>

                            <h4>Alcohol</h4>
                            <p>95% ethyl or methyl alcohol is an excellent fixative for both wet and dry smears. It is used in the same way as the ether-alcohol mixture.</p>

                            <p>It may be necessary sometimes to fix whole organs. The 10% formal saline fixative or any of the museum fixatives made up of formaldehyde in conjunction with various acetates may be used. For example:</p>

For this reason, the tissues are to be fixed as soon as after death as possible. A whole brain is preserved by being suspended in 10% neutral formal saline by means of a thread under the basilar artery. When required whole, the spinal cord should be laid flat on a narrow strip of wood or cork. The dura mater is then incised lengthwise, and pinned onto the board with plastic pins (metal pins will rust and distort the tissue). The pinned spinal cord is then floated with the board uppermost, in 10% neutral formal saline to fix.</span>

                            <p>Some workers prefer to refix tissues fixed in formal saline for further 4-24 hours. The fixatives usually employed as secondary fixatives are formal sublimate, Zenker formol and Heidenhain’s Susa. This procedure is claimed to impart firm texture to the tissue and also improve staining results.</p>

                            <p>This technique is employed in the study of the central nervous system when the demonstrations of myelin and phospholipids are required. Following primary fixation in formalin, the tissues are immersed in either potassium dichromate or chromium chloride.</p>

To achieve the desired result, a post fixing preservative may be used; examples of such preservatives are 30% solution or diethylene glycol and phenoxethol, the latter possesses bactericidal and fungicidal properties. However, it is always better to block out in paraffin wax or in any other embedding medium; alternatively museum mounting fluid can be used if it is a gross specimen.</span></li>
