                            <p>Histotechnique necessitates that thin sections of the fixed tissue be cut. In order that these thin sections may be cut, the fixed tissues must be of suitable hardness and consistency when presented to the knife edge. The desired hardness and consistency can be imparted by infiltrating and surrounding (embedding) the tissue with paraffin wax, celloidin or low viscosity nitrocellulose (LVN); various types of resins; or by freezing. Each of these methods has its own special use.</p>

                            <p>Following fixation, the selection of tissue blocks for sectioning is done by the pathologist who briefly describes the gross specimen. The description is recorded by, usually, a histotechnologist who also numbers the gross specimen and prepares a tag (small piece of quality paper e.g. Whatman filter paper) on which the number is written in pencil (ball point pen ink is soluble in alcohol). The tag is placed in a perforated cassette with a snap cover along with the tissue block. The block taken can be up to $3 \times 2.5 \text{ cm}$ in area and about $4 \text{ mm}$ thick. The histotechnologist notes the number of blocks taken and whether or not the whole gross specimen (e.g. curretings) has been taken. The rest of the gross specimen is placed back in the container of fixative and stored as long as is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Some tissues may require special attention, and for easy identification of such tissues, the tag or identification label should be marked with asterisk, and the special information noted on the back of the working card. If it is necessary to cut a block from a particular surface, then the surface is easily identified by passing a thread through one corner of the opposite surface of the tissue to that which is to be cut. The whole procedure of processing can be carried out either manually or by automated machines.</p>

                            <p>Dehydration of tissue occurs when the water constituent of the tissue is removed. Dehydration is important because most embedding media are not miscible with water, and the removal of water facilitates the subsequent impregnation with the embedding media. Naturally, dehydration is carried out by the use of the same reagent that mixes with both water and the ante-media.</p>

                            <div class="grid grid-1">
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Alcohol</h4>
                                    <p>The best agent for dehydration is ethyl alcohol which has the advantage of not being poisonous. The dehydration process is carried out by the use of series of increasing strengths of alcohol. Routinely, 70% is dilute enough for the first bath. Transfer of tissue directly from formalin to higher grade of alcohol could lead to distortion. For delicate tissues like brain and embryos, dehydration should be more gradual, beginning with 50% alcohol, with smaller intervals between the different grades of alcohol.</p>
                                    <p>To check for the presence of water in the final bath, add a small amount of dried white copper sulphate. If water is present, the copper salt will show a tinge of blue. Alternatively, a layer of anhydrous copper sulphate covered with filter paper is kept at the bottom of the jar used. The salt acts as an indicator, turning blue when water is present. When this happens, the alcohol should be replaced.</p>
                                    <p>It is essential to use high quality top grade alcohol. The alcohols which are in general use in histopathology are ethanol (ethyl alcohol), industrial alcohol (methylated spirit), isopropanol, amylalcohol, rebutanol, tertiary butanol and polyvinyl alcohol. Ethanol and methylated spirit are the most popular. In the absence of a high grade alcohol, isopropanol is the next choice of alcohol for dehydration.</p>
                                    <p>It has been claimed by some workers that the time necessary for dehydration may be shortened when processing is carried out at $37^{\circ}\text{C}$ instead of at room temperature. This makes the method ideal for urgent work.</p>

                                    <h4>Acetone</h4>
                                    <p>Acetone may be used and has been found to be a good dehydrant, cheap but very volatile. It hardens tissue more than alcohol and much greater volume of it is required than ethanol. Dehydration time is 1/2 hour to 2 hours with resultant shrinkage, and for this reason it is not quite suitable for routine work. Furthermore, only small pieces of tissues should be treated in acetone.</p>

There is very little shrinkage to the tissue. But it is not recommended for routine use because it is a dangerous substance with little warning odor and a cumulative toxic action.</p>

                            </h2>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>This stage of tissue processing can conveniently be referred to as de-alcoholisation—the removal of alcohol from blocks or sections of tissue by immersing them in a fluid that will dissolve the wax with which the tissue must be impregnated. This fluid is the ante-medium. In addition to removing the alcohol from the tissues, most of the well known ante-media have the property of making the tissues transparent. Therefore this stage of tissue processing is referred to as clearing stage and the anti-media as clearing agents. It should be pointed that some ante-media (e.g. chloroform) have no clearing property. A good clearing agent must be miscible with alcohol and wax, should remove alcohol quickly and clear rapidly without over hardening of the tissue. It should not evaporate too quickly in the wax bath or dissolve aniline dye while staining. Clearing fluids should be used in amounts not less than 10 times the volume of the tissue. The most popular clearing agents are:</p>

                            <dl>
                                <dt>Xylene (Xylol)</dt>
                                <dd>This is a very good and true clearing agent. It tends to make tissues such as brain and blood containing tissues excessively hard and brittle. Tissues should never be left in xylene for more than 2 hours. Biopsies and tissue blocks not more than 3 mm thick are cleared in 20–30 minutes. When dehydration is not complete, xylene becomes milky when the sections or tissues are immersed into it. Xylene is cheap and is usable with celloidin sections. It is highly inflammable.</dd>

                                <dt>Toluene (Toluol)</dt>
                                <dd>As an ante-medium for routine work, toluene is slower than xylene in action. Otherwise in general properties, it is similar to xylene. It has practically superseded benzene because its fumes are less toxic.</dd>

                                <dt>Benzene</dt>
                                <dd>It has properties very similar to xylene. It is not recommended for usage as it is known to be carcinogenic.</dd>

                                <dt>Chloroform</dt>
                                <dd>It is the most ideal clearing agent for the central nervous system tissues, lymph nodes and embryos because it causes little shrinkage and does not harden tissues excessively. It is good for large blocks. It is not inflammable. It is not a classical clearing agent as it does not render tissues transparent, and as a result its end-point is difficult to assess. De-alcoholization time for tissues 3–5 mm thick is 5–20 hours. Precautionary measures are necessary when handling chloroform as its vapour is toxic and anaesthetic. It must be used in a well ventilated room and in a tightly closed container. It is relatively expensive.</dd>

                                <dt>Cedar wood oil</dt>
                                <dd>Due to the high cost and very slow action of cedar wood oil, it is rarely used for routine clearing purposes. It is very gentle and causes little or no damage to the most delicate tissues. It is ideal for research work especially in the study of embryos. This reagent imparts proper consistency to dense fibrous tissues and skin tissues which allows easy cutting of the sections. It also imparts transparency to the tissues. One major disadvantage is the difficulty in eliminating the oil from the wax oven.

                                <dd>Other agents that can be used but are not of great importance are carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulphide, paraffin oil, propyl clove oil, and methyl benzoate (used in conjunction with celloidin for double impregnation, or tough or fragile tissues). A number of proprietary reagents for clearing are commercially available. Most of them are cheap, non-toxic derivatives of good grade materials. One such reagent is Histoclear. These reagents have shown good promise and may become very popular in future.</dd>

                            <p>These two stages in the processing schedule involve the impregnation of the tissues with a medium that will fill all natural cavities, spaces and interstices of the tissues and then solidify to form sufficiently firm consistency that can give considerable support during the cutting of sections without distortion to or alteration of the tissue and cellular constituents. The specimen is surrounded with a mass or block of embedding medium, thereby allowing the specimen to be handled and attached to the microtome.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Paraffin Wax Infiltration</h3>
                            <p>Paraffin wax is obtained by distillation of shale which gives liquid oil that is separated by refrigeration and then purified to give the final product of paraffin wax. When clearing is completed, the tissues are transferred to molten paraffin wax in the embedding oven. The molten wax diffuses into the tissues to replace the clearing agent which diffuses into the surrounding medium. The penetration of the tissues by paraffin wax occurs more readily if the cell proteins have been coagulated. This is why protein coagulating fixatives are preferred for paraffin wax embedding. Impregnation occurs by immersing the tissues in a succession of molten wax baths accompanied by agitation on an automatic tissue processor. The number of changes of wax and the time required for the tissues in each bath depend on the nature of the clearing agent, the size and the density of the block of tissues. But generally, blood and grossly congested tissues, muscles and fibrous connective tissues tend to become excessively hard if left for more than 3 hours in the wax. Brain, skin, dense bone tissues and materials from female breast having a large amount of retained secretions in dilated ducts, require longer time in wax. Such tissues are best processed using blocks of tissues not more than 3 mm thick.</p>
                            <p>The melting point (MP) of paraffin wax ranges between $54^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $60^{\circ}\text{C}$. It is kept molten at a temperature $2–5^{\circ}\text{C}$ higher than the melting point. Some workers claim that mixtures of waxes of different MPs give better result than a single wax. A good and popular such mixture is the paraplast which is a mixture of highly purified paraffin wax and several synthetic plastic polymers. Its MP is $56–57^{\circ}\text{C}$. It gives a more uniform block than any other medium. With paraplast, there is no need for rapid cooling or embedding. Ribbon sectioning is made easy; it is more resilient than paraffin wax and allows large blocks and dense bone blocks to be cut fairly easily. Embeddol is mainly a synthetic wax substituent that is similar to and as good as paraplast. Its MP is $56–58^{\circ}\text{C}$.</p>

                                    <p>These are more or less the traditional embedding moulds. They consist of two pieces of L-shaped heavy metal such as brass and a base made of copper or brass or a plate glass. The L-shaped pieces are usually purchased in pairs of various sizes. They are laid on the base plate and arranged to form a mould of desired size. The mould is filled with molten wax. When the wax has completely solidified, the moulds and the encased blocks are removed from the base plate. The two L pieces come away easily from the wax block and are ready to be re-used. The Leukhart's moulds are simple to use. They give even blocks with parallel sides. However, they are cumbersome when processing a large number of tissues.</p>

                            <h3>Embedding Procedure</h3>
                            <p>It is essential to use clean high grade paraffin wax. The wax is kept molten in a wax oven at $2^{\circ}\text{C}$ higher than the melting point of the wax. It is possible to take down the final beaker of wax on the automatic processing machine to the work bench and plug to an electrical outlet to keep the wax molten. The small perforated metal buttons containing the tissues are picked out of the beaker of wax one at a time. The button is opened, the identifying label is noted and kept. A suitable mould is chosen and filled with the molten wax. With a pair of blunt forceps that has been slightly heated over the bunsen flame, the tissue is placed in the mould of molten wax with the surface to be cut facing downwards. It is important that this is carefully oriented so that the plane of sectioning will be correct, e.g. biopsies of skin must be embedded so that the plane of the surface is vertical to the bottom of the mould; and wall of a cyst must be embedded edge down. It is usual to press down the tissue and hold it for a few seconds until it is held by the cooling wax. Immediately, one end of the identifying label is immersed in the wax. The forceps are flamed frequently to prevent wax and tissue sticking to it. The setting of the wax can be hastened if, as soon as a film has formed over the surface of the wax, the complete unit is lowered into a bowl of cold water or placed in the refrigerator. This rapid cooling also minimizes crystallisation of the wax which may occur if allowed to cool and set slowly at room temperature.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Embedding for cytology</h4>
                            <p>Cytological specimens are sometimes required to be sectioned. In such a case, the processing and embedding can be carried out in a glass tubing which has one end sealed with a cork. The specimen is centrifuged between each stage of processing. The small pieces of tissue will collect at the bottom of the tubing and this facilitates sectioning. On the solidifying of wax, the cork is removed and the block pushed out of the tubing.</p>

                            <p>Many factors are taken into consideration in setting up the processing schedules. The type of fixative used will determine the point of entry to the processing schedules. The size of the tissue block is an important factor. For example, a block of only 1–2 mm in size will need shorter time than one of 3–5 mm. Room temperature will affect the rate of penetration of the various reagents. Heat generally speeds up, and cold slows down the process. Each individual laboratory should determine its own standard processing schedules.</p>

                            <p>The automatic tissue processors greatly reduce the time and labour needed to process tissues. Therefore, they allow a more rapid investigation to be carried out. The reduction in processing time is due to the fact that the tissues are constantly agitated, and therefore, the transfer of tissues from reagent to reagent is performed at shorter intervals. The use of the automatic machines permits the transfers to take place even during shut down hours of the laboratory. All models feature a mechanism of suspension and agitation and automatic transfer from solution to solution at pre-set times. Most of them have twelve stations, the last two being wax baths.</p>

                            <p>Dehydration, clearing and preparation for embedding are accomplished with the automatic tissue processors. Most of these machines work on the principle of a central, rotating spindle that carries a bucket or basket containing the tissue blocks suspended from the outer end of a horizontal radial arm. A clockwork device which is electrically operated, rotates a notched clock-face card on the circumference of which a spring loaded 'tooth' or hook moves. Notches are cut to suit the desired time schedule. When the tooth moves into one of the notches, a motor is automatically activated to lift the central spindle which, by means of a fixed helical screw, automatically rotates as it rises so that the bucket arm is swung over the next beaker of solution. The spindle is then lowered, placing the bucket in the solution. The bucket is continuously agitated by a short repetitive up and down motion of the entire assembly head or the arm. The last two beakers are made of metal and contain the molten wax which is kept at a constant temperature by thermostats located within the walls of the beakers.</p>

The technique is based on the production of negative pressure inside the embedding oven. This negative pressure hastens the extrusion of air bubbles and of the clearing agent from the tissue block, thus resulting in the rapid penetration of the wax.</p>

Fixed and dehydrated tissues are impregnated with increasing concentrations of celloidin or LVN dissolved in a mixture of absolute alcohol and ether. Clearing agents or antemedia are not utilised and no heat is required in the process. As a result, distortion to the tissues is minimal.</p>

                            <h3>Gelatin Embedding</h3>
                            <p>Gelatin as an embedding medium finds its main use as a supporting medium for frozen sections. Generally, tissue from which frozen sections are to be cut is not embedded, the freezing itself provides sufficient support for sectioning. But when frozen sections are to be prepared from tough or friable tissues, a supporting medium is required to prevent the tissue from fragmenting. This is where gelatin is very useful. After embedding, the blocks of tissue are put in formalin to harden.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Tissue (max 3 mm) in Gelatin Sol A (12 hrs @ $37^{\circ}\text{C}$) $\rightarrow$ Gelatin Sol B (12 hrs @ $37^{\circ}\text{C}$) $\rightarrow$ Embed in Sol B $\rightarrow$ Cool/Trim $\rightarrow$ Harden in Formalin (Sol C). Cut as frozen section.</p>

                            <h3>Plastic Embedding</h3>
                            <p>Epoxy resins such as Epson, Araldite, and Vestapol give less distortion to the tissue than the butyl and methyl methacrylates which they have displaced. The main use of plastics is in electron microscopy though modified forms of the above plastics are used in histology to produce 1 $\mu\text{m}$ sections. There is very little distortion with plastic embedding and they permit very thin sections to be cut in histology and 60–70 nm for ultra thin sections.</p>

                            <p>When the blocks have hardened, they are removed from the cold water or refrigerator. The identification number is carefully removed and the block is freed from the moulds. Excess wax is trimmed from the block so that the block forms a four sided prism. The important point is to have the opposite sides parallel in order to produce serial sections. The trimming away of excess wax prevents the blocks from cracking. At least 2 mm of wax should surround the tissue block. The small piece of paper bearing the identification number of the tissue may then be affixed to the block using a hot spatula.</p>
