                            <p>The deposition of calcium salts (calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and calcium fluoride) usually makes the cutting of fine sections by the usual methods, very difficult. The removal of these calcium salts is known as decalcification. The most suitable method of decalcification depends on the strength, temperature and volume of the decalcifying solution as well as on the size, consistency of the tissue and the type of investigation to be carried out.</p>
                            
                            <p>Calcium salts occur normally in bones and teeth or in some pathological conditions. There are two types of pathological calcification:</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Dystrophic calcification:</strong> In which the calcium salts are deposited in the cells or surrounding tissues which have been damaged or injured by disease, e.g. tuberculosis or cancerous changes.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Metastatic deposition:</strong> This is seen in other lesions and may occur as a result of the pathological processes; for example, in hyperthyroidism, there is a change in calcium metabolism causing an increase in blood calcium level.</span>

                            </ol>

                            <p>The principle of decalcification is based on the removal of calcium cations via the anions. The anions are derived from the decalcifying solution which is usually an acid. A good decalcifying agent should remove all calcium without any adverse effect on the cells or tissue fibres and with no impairment of subsequent impregnation or staining.</p>

All acid decalcifying solutions are injurious to the organic ground substance of the bone and other tissues which therefore must be protected by adequate fixation before decalcification is commenced. Fixation is best achieved by selecting suitable blocks from the bone or other calcified tissue, about 2 to 4 mm thick with the aid of a fine hacksaw, or fretsaw and placing them in buffered neutral formalin or in any other non-acid fixative (e.g. Zenker or Helly’s fluids) for 15 to 24 hours. A long stay in formalin helps the nucleic acid become resistant to the hydrolytic action of the acids used in decalcification.</p>

                            <h3>Effects of Heat, Agitation and Vacuum</h3>
                            <p>Though heat will accelerate the process of demineralisation, it enhances the destructive action of acids. Heat, also when applied to hasten decalcification, reduces nuclear staining, reduces the effectiveness of trichrome and Van Gieson stains and also affects Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) technique. Heat should therefore not be used in decalcification especially in the warm tropical climate. Agitation of the tissue in the acid solution has little or no accelerating effect on the decalcification process. The same can be said of partial or complete vacuum in decalcification, though it eliminates bubbles.</p>

                            <p>Haemosiderin is generally removed by acids but more haemosiderins are left over after treatment with formic acid. Preservation of haemosiderin in tissues to be decalcified is carried out as follows:</p>

                            <h3>Tests for Completion of Decalcification</h3>
                            <p>End point of decalcification can be tested in a number of ways. The physical methods of probing the tissue with needle, knife or finger nail are not reliable and they damage the tissue and small pieces of bone may be undetected. The x-ray method is excellent but not always convenient and available and it is not useful when radio-opaque metallic salt such as mercuric chloride has been used in fixation. The chemical method is favoured because it is simple and reliable. The method depends on the detection of dissolved calcium in the decalcifying fluid.</p>

                            <p>This fluid is ideal for post mortem and research specimens. It permits excellent staining results. It is the most widely used decalcifying fluid. Decalcifying time is 2–7 days. Due to its slow action, it is not suitable for urgent work. At a concentration higher than 8%, the action may become quicker but the resultant cloudiness produced interferes with the chemical test for the end point. X-ray as well as chemical test can be used to test for the end point.</p>

                            <p>This fluid is used mainly for routine purposes. It is rapidly acting and carries very little hydrolysis. The tissue is not allowed to remain immersed in the fluid beyond the required time for decalcification. Due to the formation of nitrous oxide, the fluid usually imparts yellow colouration to the tissue which may affect the staining reaction. The addition of 0.1% urea to the acid will temporarily check the formation of yellow colour.</p>
                            <p>This acid, like formic acid, can be used with 40% formaldehyde, in which case it becomes ideal for biopsies. Following decalcification and cutting of section, the section should be treated with 1% lithium carbonate overnight.</p>

                            <p>The Perenyi’s fluid is a well established decalcifying fluid even though it was originally designed as a fixative. Decalcification time is from 2–10 days. Perenyi’s fluid is more often employed as a tissue softener before dehydration. It produces no hardening, and preserves cellular details well, thus making the subsequent staining good. Decalcified tissues need not be washed in water and can be transferred directly to 70% alcohol. The fluid is slow in action.</p>

                            <p>The principle of this method is that calcium ions are removed from solution by the resins which increases the rate of solubility of calcium from the tissue. The incorporation of ion exchange resins in decalcifying solution adds very little or no improvement to the staining results and the method has no special advantage.</p>
                            <p><strong>Technique:</strong> A layer of the resin about 13 mm thick, is spread over the bottom of the vessel being used and the specimen is allowed to rest on it. The decalcifying fluid, about 20 times the volume of the resins is added. The chemical test is not used to test the end point, instead the x-ray method is used.</p>

                            <p>This solution is very slow in action and is useful where urgency is not needed. Decalcification time is about three weeks and the fluid is changed on every three-day interval, reduced to one day towards the end of decalcification. It is employed for detailed microscopical studies. Its use also minimises the formation of histological artefacts. The subsequent staining results are good.</p>

                            <p>The principle of decalcification by electrolysis is based on the attraction of the positively charged calcium ions to a negatively charged electrode. The calcified tissue is placed in an electrolyte solution composed of 5% HCl and 5–10% formic acid in equal parts. The temperature is raised during electrolysis and may or may not enhance the rate of decalcification. The rise in temperature may also bring about the charring of the tissue and definitely results in distortion and poor nuclear staining. The method is therefore not recommended.</p>

                            <h3>8. RDC</h3>
                            <p>This fluid known as RDC is obtainable from Bethlehem Instruments Ltd. in the U.K. Its formula is a trade secret. The fluid has been found very valuable in all routine work, and more rapid than conventional fluids.</p>

                            <h3>9. Calex</h3>
                            <p>This is another proprietary fluid whose formula is not made public by the manufacturers. It is considered much better than RDC.</p>

                            <h3>10. Ultrasonic decalcification</h3>
                            <p>Ultrasonic waves are produced from an ultrasonic generator which is housed in a metal jacket. This is known as an ultrasonic bath. The fluid which consists of 7.5% acetic acid is placed in the bath and then the bone or tissue placed in it. The technique which was first described by Thorpe, Bellamy and Sharp, is said to be seven times faster than the conventional acid treated controls, and that distortion and interference with staining was minimal. Protagonists of this method attribute the fast rate to the high temperature (up to 50°C) and vibration produced during decalcification.</p>

                            <p>Dense fibrous tissues though not containing calcium salts, are too tough for sectioning. Blocks of such tissues may be softened using Lendrum's method, i.e. adding 4–6% phenol to the dehydrating alcohols. Commercially produced reagents are also available for softening tissue following embedding in paraffin wax.</p>
