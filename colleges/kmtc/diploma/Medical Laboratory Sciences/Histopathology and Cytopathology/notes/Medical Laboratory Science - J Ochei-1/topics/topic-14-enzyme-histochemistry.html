                            <p>When histology and biochemistry come together, the science is known as Histochemistry. This branch of science aims at identifying chemical substances and determine their significance at the cellular level. Enzyme histochemistry is therefore a sub-division of this field that specifically deals with enzymes.</p>
                            <p>Enzymes are catalysts that speed up chemical reactions that occur in living cells. In addition to accelerating reactions, enzymes are highly specific in their activity. They act on specific substrates—the active reagents that must be present for enzyme activity to occur. In ordinary histological demonstration, there is a direct interaction between the tissue constituents in the section and a dye or reagent to produce visible colouration of the tissue. With enzyme histochemistry, the final opaque or coloured product is derived from the substrate rather than the tissue. Enzymes are very unstable and almost all of them disappear from the tissues quickly and progressively after removal of tissue from the body and after cellular death. Many of them are simply dissolved in the cell cytoplasm (soluble enzymes) and others are tightly attached to certain cell organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes. Special precautions are necessary to preserve them.</p>

                            <h3>Factors Affecting Enzyme Demonstration</h3>
                            <p>The factors that influence enzyme demonstration should well be borne in mind in order to successfully identify the enzymes and determine their significance. The following factors affect enzyme demonstration:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Optimal temperature:</strong> Optimal temperature is one at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved. Most enzymes require incubation at temperatures between $25^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $37^{\circ}\text{C}$.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Optimal pH:</strong> Maximal enzyme activity will occur at an optimal pH level.

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Concentration:</strong> The speed of enzyme reaction is greatly influenced by the amount (concentration) of the enzyme, the substrate, and of the reaction product.</span></li>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Histochemical methods for enzymes have played a great role in the identification and evaluation of enzyme activity. Many specimen preparations have been tried and used over the years until the arrival of refrigerated microtome (cryostat). The important aim always is that tissue must be prepared in such a way as to preserve and retain the enzymes as much as possible in their original sites. Enzymes should not deteriorate or diffuse during fixation and the final colour reaction should be sharp and precise. Fresh frozen (cryostat) sections have almost completely superseded sections of freeze-dried tissue, tissue that has been fixed in conventional fixatives and sectioned on carbon dioxide freezing microtome; or fixed tissues embedded in paraffin.</p>

                            <h3>Fresh Tissue Preparations</h3>
                            <p>The fresh unfixed tissue may be frozen by the cryostat freezer plate method, or the liquid nitrogen immersion method or by the pre-chilled isopentane method which is particularly suitable for muscle tissue. Within 3 or 4 minutes of obtaining fresh tissue, cryostat sections can be prepared and introduced into the substrate solution thus bypassing the complicated and prolonged processing. This method of tissue preparation for enzyme demonstration is fast and easy to handle.</p>

                            <h3>Fixed Tissue Preparations</h3>
                            <p>Some soluble enzymes survive fixation to the extent that sufficient amounts of the enzyme is retained for demonstration. Fixed tissues tend to show just few diffusion artefacts. Ice-cold acetone is the fixative of choice, alternatively ice-cold alcohol or formalin or ice-cold formal-calcium can be used. Paraffin embedding must be brief at $56^{\circ}\text{C}$ in the vacuum oven. It is also possible to cut frozen sections following complete fixation especially with ice-cold formalin. Also, cryostat sections can be post-fixed for 10–30 minutes in any of the aforementioned ice-cold reagents. This method is particularly useful for such enzymes as the phosphatase and lipases.</p>

                            <p>Most of the enzyme histochemical methods are based on the formation of a primary reaction product (PRP) as a result of the action of the enzyme upon the substrate. Following this, is the production of a coloured or opaque final reaction product (FRP) from the combination of PRP with a second reagent.</p>

                                    <p>For example the blackening of the PRP by chemical reaction with a diazonium salt to form a diazo-dye. The enzyme activity frees the naphthol moiety on the substrate (containing naphthol compounds), which combines with the diazonium salt. When the production of the PRP and its transformation as a coloured FRP take place at the same time, it is called 'simultaneous coupling'. In a reaction where the two reactions occur one after the other, it is 'post incubation coupling'.</p>

A good number of oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by the methods that depend on the transfer of hydrogen from the substrate to a tetrazolium salt.

                            <p>The alkaline phosphatase hydrolyses at alkaline pH while the acid phosphotase does it at acid pH. Alkaline phosphatase is widely distributed in tissues. It is usually activated by certain ions such as magnesium, manganese, zinc and cobalt. It is inhibited by cysteine, cyanides and arsenates. The optimum pH for activity is 9.27 but the range is 9.0–9.6.</p>
