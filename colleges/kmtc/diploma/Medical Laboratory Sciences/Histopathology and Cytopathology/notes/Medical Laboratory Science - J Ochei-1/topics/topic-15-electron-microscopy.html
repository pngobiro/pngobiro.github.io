                            <p>There are several techniques and methods required and employed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by the electron microscope (EM) histotechnologist. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is not a fast diagnostic procedure since it takes several days for results as opposed to frozen sections which takes an hour or less, or general routine histology that produces results within 24–48 hours. It nevertheless offers information and answers to questions in long term diseases involving the kidneys, lungs and tumours among others. In most cases, such information complements light microscopy, histochemistry and histoimmunology.</p>

It is very essential to fix surgical tissue within 15 minutes of it being removed from the patient’s body. This is to prevent cellular changes due to autolysis and to obtain a correct picture of the cells in the tissue.</p>

It penetrates fairly rapidly, preserves optimally and is stable at room temperature for up to one year.

It penetrates rapidly with little shrinkage. It is important to make it fresh because it tends to become too acidic and it should be kept in the refrigerator. Microtubules are well preserved but lipids are extracted.</p>

It must be prepared fresh and regularly checked for acidity as the pH decreases with time. Ideally stock solutions in 8% or 25% concentration are prepared and sealed in vials which are kept in the refrigerator until ready to use.</p>

                            <p>Dehydration of tissues for EM is carried out starting with a lower grade of alcohol (40%). The concentrations and number of grades chosen depends upon the type of tissue.</p>

                            <h3>Clearing</h3>
                            <p>The clearing agents in EM are referred to as transitional fluids and consist of media miscible with ethanol and embedding medium. Examples are xylene, toluene and epoxypropane (propylene oxide).</p>

                            <h3>Embedding</h3>
                            <p>Thin sections (50–90 nm) are used in TEM in order for the electrons to penetrate and allow photons to reach the fluorescent viewing screen of the EM. For routine purposes, the epoxy resins are employed. These resins are relatively easy to handle and are fairly easily available. Paraffin is much too soft to permit ultra thin sections to be cut.</p>
                            <p>The most commonly used types of epoxy resins are those with an Araldite base and those with an Epon 812 base. Araldite, a resin that is relatively stable under electron bombardments, is soluble in acetone and ethanol. Araldite formulas for embedding must be prepared with great care so as to obtain the correct consistency. Epon resin is also stable in the face of electron bombardment.</p>

                            <p>Thick and thin sections are cut with an ultramicrotome. The thick sections are cut at between 0.5 and 2 mm and they are used to study general picture of the tissue and to locate area of special interest, such as a glomerulus in a kidney biopsy. These sections are cut with glass knives.</p>
                            <p>Thin sections are usually cut at between 50 and 90 nm and appear grey in reflected light colours. These sections are cut with diamond knives if available, otherwise fresh or new glass knives may also be used. Some laboratories prefer to make their own glass knives instead of purchasing from knife making companies.</p>

                            <h3>Staining of Thick Sections</h3>
                            <p>A variety of stains has been used to stain thick sections in electron microscopy. The most effective of these stains are the basic dyes. Toluidine blue and Trypan blue in 1% sodium borate have proved very useful. The toluidine blue is metachromatic in reaction and accentuates cytoplasmic differentiation. Equally important is the fact that it is simple and easy to make up and also gives reproducible results. Trypan blue is used as 2% in 1% sodium borate. It is similar to toluidine blue in action and procedures.</p>

                            <h3>Staining of Thin Sections</h3>
                            <p>Uranyl and lead stains are the more widely employed stains for thin sections. An important factor common to both stains is the possession of electron dense metal which is essential for proper contrast in cellular components for photomicrography.</p>

                                    <p>A nuclear stain that specifically binds to nuclear proteins. It is used in saturated concentration in distilled water. It has a tendency to break down or dissociate so that the stock solution should not be kept in the refrigerator beyond one month. It is also soluble in alcohol. Many workers prefer to use 25% to 50% concentration in ethyl or methyl alcohol. The alcoholic solution penetrates faster and requires a shorter staining time of about 2 to 5 minutes.</p>
