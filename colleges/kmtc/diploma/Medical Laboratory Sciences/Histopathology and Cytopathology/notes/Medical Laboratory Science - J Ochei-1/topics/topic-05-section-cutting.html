                            <p>The earliest recorded form of microtomes was a non-mechanical, hand operated device which was nothing more than an elaborated scalpel. The first truly mechanical microtome was perhaps the sliding microtome devised by Adams in 1798.

                            <p>This is a highly rigid and precision made instrument. The tissue block holder is attached to a sledge resting on precision machined runners. The sledge is pushed beneath a fixed knife. The size and range of adjustment for cutting angles makes it most effective for cutting very hard tissues; and is also useful for dealing with celloidin or LVN embedded tissues by means of a special extended clamp that gives very oblique knife angles. Large tissue blocks up to approximately $8 \times 10 \text{ cm}$ can be cut when special large tissue stages are attached to the instrument. It can also be adapted for cutting frozen sections. The base sledge microtome is very versatile and so very ideal for a laboratory handling a wide variety of tissues and block sizes.</p>

                            </figure>
                            <p>The instrument was invented by Coldwell and Treefall in 1881 and was developed by the Cambridge Company. The name of the microtome was derived from the rocking action of the upper arm. It is a simple machine in which the tissue block is swung across the fixed knife-edge in an arc. The movement is governed by a spring that is located by a handle attached to a piece of cord. After each cutting stroke, the movement of the handle advances the tissue block. Sections are cut in a slightly curved plane and its freed mechanism is graduated in units of 1 or $2 \mu\text{m}$. Though primarily meant for paraffin wax embedded tissues, it is easily adapted for frozen sections. This is mainly due to the simplicity of its mechanism and small number of moving parts. This machine is however no longer manufactured.</p>

                            <p>The rotary microtome was invented independently by the Americans, Charles Minal and Feifer. The instrument is most ideal for routine and research work. It is excellent for cutting serial sections. The microtome is smaller in size than the sledge microtome and has a smaller knife area which limits the size of tissue blocks to about $3 \times 4 \text{ cm}$.</p>
                            <p>The tissue block is moved up and down in a flat plane across the knife-edge. The movement is effected by the turning of a handle at the side of the instrument which simultaneously advances the block after each section is cut.</p>

                            <p>The freezing microtome generally consists of a central advancing screw on which the block holder is situated. A cylinder of CO₂, the cooling agent, is connected by means of a reinforced flexible lead to the stage which is hollow with perforations around the perimeter. These perforations, known as baffles, allow the gas to flow and easily escape, thus providing uniform freezing of the tissue. To facilitate section cutting, the knife edge is kept cool by means of another cooling device.</p>
                            <p>The more recent models of freezing microtomes are connected to a thermoelectric cooling units called thermal modules instead of CO₂. The module works on the principles of the Peltier effect. Peltier in 1884 found that by passing an electric current through two different conductors there was either absorption or generation of heat at the point where the two met, depending on the direction of the current. The adaptation of the Peltier effect to the microtome knife stage was by Ioffle in 1958 though it was only in 1964 that Rutherford and his colleagues fully adapted the thermo-electric cooling device to both knife holders and block stage. With thermal module there is a continuous thawing and freezing of tissue.</p>

                            <p>Before the advent of cryostat, the preparation of frozen sections was confined to freezing microtomes which were operated at room temperature with $\text{CO}_{2}$ as the tissue refrigerant. This method has now been replaced by the cryostat.</p>
                            <p>The cryostat is a precision machine which is housed in a deep freeze cabinet maintained at a temperature of about $-15^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $-30^{\circ}\text{C}$. The major advantage of the cryostat is that it maintains the tissue block, knife and the section at the same temperature. This eliminates difficulties such as cutting of unfixed tissues with knife freezing attachment, and obtaining thin sections. Further more there is no more thawing and freezing of the tissue and knife.</p>
                            <p>The initial freezing or quenching techniques can be carried out by any of the following:</p>

                            <p>Rapid freezing is essential with mammalian tissues if enzyme histochemistry is to be performed. The different models incorporate various types of microtomes. Pearce for one, regarded the Cambridge rocker to be the most suited for use in cryostats because the knife was insensitive to cold of any degree likely to be attained in any cryostat chamber. Pearce also found that the coating for the anti-roll plate with polytetra fluoroethylene or teflon was advantageous. Today anti-roll plates are made of perspex instead of glass. Models of cryostat available include the bench top, free standing, manual and automatic.</p>

                            <p>Most knives are wedge shaped with the sides inclined at an angle of about 15 degrees. The surfaces are polished so that sections do not stick to them but will move on the surface minimising folding and distortion and thereby facilitating good ribbon formation. The sides of the cutting edge are called cutting facets and the angle formed between the cutting facets where they meet is known as the bevel angle or facet angle and is normally about $27^{\circ}–33^{\circ}$. This angle is kept constant for each knife by means of a slide-on back for use on each knife during honing and stropping. The slide-on back should be pushed in carefully, evenly and symmetrically so that cutting facets are equal. Knives should be inclined relative to the cutting plane so that there is 5–10 degrees clearance between the cutting facet presenting to the block and the surface of the block. Without this clearance the cutting facet will compress the block as it goes under the knife. The effect of this is that there may be no cutting of section at all or very thick and thin sections may be produced.</p>

                                <dd>Tilt or the incline of a microtome knife is the angle between the surface of the block and the line which bisects the edge of the knife. For soft blocks, less tilt is used than for hard blocks. There must be sufficient clearance in order to avoid compression of the blocks on passing under the knife and sections being alternatively thick and thin. Tilt angle varies between 10–40 degrees depending on the angle of the cutting facet.</dd>

                                <dt>Compression</dt>
                                <dd>This is the difference which exists between the sides of the section which is cut and the side measurements of the tissue block. The compression of sections can also be influenced by room temperature, the sharpness of the knife and the humidity of the air. Excessive compression causes damage of the cells and tissue structures and it should therefore be kept to a minimum.</dd>

                                <dt>Rate of cutting</dt>
                                <dd>Soft tissues embedded in soft media, e.g., brain in celloidin, require a slow smooth cutting action. A fast forced cutting movement leads to compression. Blocks embedded in paraffin wax requires a fast stronger movement when ribboning. A good combination of knife, slant, tilt, sharpness and cutting rate is a prerequisite to obtain good sections.</dd>

                                <dt>Ambient temperature</dt>
                                <dd>Paraffin wax gets softened if the temperature is too hot and this presents difficulty in obtaining sections. Blocks of ice, preferably in polythene sachets, can be used to cool the cutting surface of the tissue block; prolonged treatment with blocks of iced water should be avoided as it tends to macerate the tissues. In addition, too low temperature results in the cracking of the surface of the block, variation in thickness of the sections and difficulty in cutting serial sections (ribboning). Application of nominal degree of heat supplied by breathing on to the surface of the block helps when cutting paraffin section. But a real increase in heat can lead to expansion of the material thereby resulting in thick sections being produced. The degree of heat supplied by breathing onto the block comes with experience.</dd>

                                <dt>Orientation</dt>
                                <dd>Orientation is the proper placement of the blocks on the microtome and this must be in such a way as to facilitate the cutting of sections of uniform thickness. All microtomes have adjusting mechanisms for the orientation of the blocks in relationship to the knife edge. In practice, most blocks cut well if the blocks are initially trimmed with parallel upper and lower edges and slanting sides.

                            <p>There is a cogent need for the microtome knife to be sharp. Successful section cutting to a large extent depends on the microtome knife edge. The histotechnologist should, as a matter of duty, be skilful in handling his microtome knife. When the cutting edge becomes blunt or damaged, the knife should be subjected to sharpening. Sharpening of the microtome knife is divided into two stages: honing or the removal of metal nicks to obtain a straight cutting edge free from nicks, and stropping or polishing the cutting edge. Each of these procedures may be performed either by hand or with the automatic knife sharpener.</p>

                            <h3>Hand Sharpening (Honing)</h3>
                            <p>This can be done with hones or with plate glass and abrasives. The hone is usually a rectangular block of natural or synthetic stone with hard grinding surface for sharpening a knife or other cutting tools. The stone is graded coarse, medium or fine based on the degree of its abrasiveness. The finer the grain in the hone, the harder the hone. The size of the hone used depends on the size of the knife to be sharpened. The hone should be long enough to allow the whole of the knife edge to be sharpened in a single stroke.</p>
                            <p>Popular stones of various grades of fineness are:</p>

                            <h4>Procedure of Honing</h4>
                            <p>The hone is first wiped clean with a soft cloth to remove loose particles of stone and metal. Wipe with soft cloth moistened in xylene. The hone is then covered with a thin film of lubricant such as soap-water. The knife is fitted with its own back and held obliquely on the stone, edge forward. Gentle even pressure is applied on the knife with thumbs or forefingers, and the knife is drawn obliquely forward on the stone in an easy, steady motion, 'heel' first so that when the 'toe' is reached it is still on the stone. The knife is then turned over on its back, and with the heel leading again, it is still steadily drawn towards the operator. This is called the 'heel' to 'toe' motion. Such sequence as described makes up a double stroke.</p>

                            <p>These machines are fast becoming indispensable in histopathology laboratories. They are time saving and fairly easy to manipulate so that an inexperienced hand can produce a well sharpened knife with an even bevel. There are some that can safely be referred to as semi-automatic while others are fully automatic.</p>

                            <h3>Stropping</h3>
                            <p>Following honing the edge of the knife is polished on a leather strop made from the best quality horse hide. The strop surface should be of ideal size, e.g., 7–9 by $45\text{cm}$. The strop may be hanging type or one fixed to a solid wooden block. The hanging type strops are attached by one end to a bench or wall at a suitable height for the user. The strops are pulled as far as possible to prevent sagging and create enough tension to prevent rounding the cutting edge of the knife. A canvas back is fitted to most of these strops and serves as a preliminary stropping surface before using the leather surface. Stropping is manipulated with one hand while the other hand pulls on the strop. The movement is that of 'toe to heel', just the reverse of the honing process. The stropping surface is usually impregnated with a fine abrasive (diamond dust or fine carborundum).</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The block having been attached to the wooden holder, is now fixed in the microtome. The knife is inserted and secured firmly with tightening screws. The block is moved forward until the tissue surface is almost touching the knife edge. The surface of the tissue block is pared off in $15 - 25\mu \text{m}$ slices to expose the tissue face before taking sections. This rough trimming is carried out either using one end of the knife or with an old microtome knife that is specifically kept for that purpose. Keep the block in ice while resetting the knife.</p>
                            <p>Set the microtome gauge for the desired thickness, which routinely is $4 - 6\mu \text{m}$. Remove the block from the ice, wipe dry and fix firmly in the sleeve or chuck of the microtome. Cutting is carried out with regular even strokes. The general rule is that hard tissue, e.g., thyroid, is best cut with firm, quick strokes, while soft tissues will require slow gentle strokes. Lymph nodes and nervous tissues should be cut slowly with even regular strokes. It should be noted that the harder the tissue, the cooler the block should be, so that the resistance between the knife and the wax and the tissue will be as even as possible. Ideally, the disparity between the consistency of the tissue and that of the wax should be minimal. The microtome is operated until complete sections are being cut and a cutting rhythm is being maintained.</p>
                            <p>Using a diamond pencil, glass slides are numbered, the numbers corresponding to those on the blocks to be cut. To minimise mistakes and confusion, frosted end slides are used and numbered with pencil as each block is cut. The slides are wiped clean with fine soft cloth and the numbered surface of each slide is smeared with a thin coat of adhesive mixture which is spread with the pad of the finger.</p>

                            <h3>Ribbon Sectioning</h3>
                            <p>To obtain 'ribbons' of sections, it is important that the upper and lower surfaces of the block are parallel. Cutting of ribbon sections is an eloquent testimony of experience of a good microtomist. The first section is raised carefully with the index finger or flat tipped forceps or a pencil or camel's hair brush. As the knife makes contact with the block to start cutting the next section, locally generated pressure welds the edge of the second section to the edge of the first section. This continues with succeeding sections with the result that a ribbon of sections is formed. An experienced section cutter can produce a ribbon of up to 10 inches long.</p>

It is composed of 50 ml of white of fresh egg and 50 ml of glycerol which are mixed and then filtered through several layers of gauze. Thymol (100 mg) is added as the preservative.
