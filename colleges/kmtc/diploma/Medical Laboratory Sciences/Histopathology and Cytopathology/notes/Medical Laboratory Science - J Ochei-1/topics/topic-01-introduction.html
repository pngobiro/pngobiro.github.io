                            <p>Histology is the microscopic study of normal tissues; and histopathology is the study of abnormal or diseased tissues. This division of medical laboratory science was once referred to as morbid anatomy. At present, many workers prefer to call it 'cellular pathology'. Cytology, the study of cells, is an integral part of histopathology; and in most histological preparations, the components of individual cells are studied. Most of histopathological techniques are applied to killed tissues which have been fixed in such a way that they retain their structures and components as closely as possible to those of living tissues.</p>
                            <p>There are various techniques and methods designed and employed in histopathological investigations as it is impossible to study all normal and abnormal tissue components in a single preparation. For this reason, preparation of thin sections enables separate sections to be studied and stained in a variety of ways. However, a good knowledge of the structures of cells, organs and tissues is essential for the study to be worthwhile.</p>

The name protoplasm is given to the main constituents together with water, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and inorganic substances. The cell which is a bundle of protoplasm enclosed within a plasma membrane has two main parts—Cytoplasm and Nucleus.</p>

                            <p>The cytoplasm is surrounded by the cell membrane which allows selective flow of substances to and from the cell. Within the cytoplasm lies a variety of very fine structures known as organelles. These structures comprise the living material of the cell and each has its individual functions. In addition to the organelles, the cell contains some non-living substances which are collectively referred to as inclusions.</p>

Parts of the lining of the canals (tubules) are coated with granules of ribosomes (ribonucleoprotein) and this is referred to as rough or granular ER.

They are filamentous, measuring up to $7\text{ nm}$ in length and between $0.5 - 1.0\text{ nm}$ in diameter. They vary in numbers and may be evenly distributed in the whole cytoplasm or form aggregates in selected sites. They can be demonstrated either in fresh unfixed specimens or in stained preparations. They are often referred to as the power house of the cell. They disappear quickly on the death of the cell due to autolysis. They are easily destroyed by acetic acid which therefore should not be part of cytoplasmic fixative.</p>

It is seen in section as a clear area of cytoplasm just about 1.0 nm in diameter. The nucleus lies within the centrosome. Lying near the nucleus are pairs of small cylindrical bodies called the centrioles. They are associated with the organisation of chromosomes during cell division and in the formation of fibrillary material such as cilia.</p>

                            <p>The female ovum and the male spermatozoan contain the haploid set which is a single set of 23 chromosomes. One half of the spermatozoa contains an X chromosome and the other half contains a Y chromosome. The chromosomes of the spermatozoan therefore consists of 22 autosomes and 1 X or Y. Those of the ovum consists of 22 autosomes and 1 X. When the ovum and the spermatozoan fuse together (fertilisation), the sex of the new embryo is determined by the sex chromosome carried by the spermatozoan.</p>

                            <p>To replace damaged and worn out cells, and essentially for growth, multiplication of cells takes place. The orderly process by which cell divides is called mitosis. In mitosis, two new cells (daughter cells) are produced with each having 46 chromosomes which carry genes identical to those of the original cell. Mitosis is a continuous process even though four distinct stages (phases) are recognised. Just before the cell division begins, there is a resting phase during which there is an increase in DNA, RNA and proteins in preparation for the cell division. This phase is known as the interphase. When the nuclear material in the cell has doubled, cell division can begin in the following sequence.</p>

Pieces of the tissue are picked onto a microscope slide and mounted as a wet preparation under a coverslip. The slide is then examined by the ordinary light microscope or better still by phase contrast microscope. Stains like methylene blue can be applied to enhance the recognition of cellular structures. This method allows cells to be examined in living state. A big drawback is that it is not a permanent preparation.</span>

                                    <p>To study normal or diseased tissues microscopically, thin sections of the tissue have to be cut. Sections are normally prepared from fixed tissues. Tissues are fixed to prevent putrefaction and other post mortem changes which occur soon after removal from the body. The choice of fixative depends to a large extent on the type of investigation, nature of the specimen, urgency of the examination and whether or not serial sections are required.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>PARAFFIN SECTIONS</h4>
                                    <p>The most popular embedding medium for histological preparations is the paraffin wax. The embedding medium confers rigidity to the piece of tissue so that sections can be cut. The selected fixed pieces of tissue are first passed through a series of baths of alcohol to remove water from the tissues (dehydration). This is done because the fixative is not miscible with paraffin wax. The tissues are passed further to a bath or two of a medium that is miscible with alcohol and paraffin. This medium is the clearing agent. The clearing medium also raises the refractive index of the tissue, making it look transparent. It is this clearing medium that is eventually replaced by the molten paraffin wax. When the tissues have been sufficiently impregnated, they are embedded in fresh wax which solidifies on cooling. It should be noted that workers refer to clearing agents as ante-media because some of them don’t actually clear the tissue. Using paraffin wax allows thin and serial sections to be cut easily, allows many staining techniques and facilitates handling and storage.</p>

                                    <h4>Celloidin</h4>
                                    <p>Next to paraffin wax, celloidin is a commonly used embedding medium. Celloidin is a purified form of nitro-cellulose which is soluble in many solvents. Celloidin allows thicker sections to be cut and that makes it very useful in the study of central nervous system. It is a better medium for very hard tissues or tissues with varying consistency. It causes little or no shrinkage. However, it is a very slow method and serial sections are very difficult to produce. A variety of celloidin, the low viscosity nitro-cellulose (LVN) is also very popular. The LVN dissolves more easily and permits thinner sections to be cut.</p>

                                    <h4>Resin embedding</h4>
                                    <p>This is a new method adopted for light microscopy from electron microscopy techniques. The major advantage of using resins is that much thinner sections can be cut though specially adapted knives and microtomes are required. The various stages of dehydration, clearing and embedding are referred to as processing and are usually done manually or by automatic processing machine.</p>

                            <p>Sections are cut with the microtome from the paraffin wax blocks. The microtome is a most useful piece of equipment in the histopathology laboratory and the microtome is as good as its knife. The different types of microtome are discussed later in this section. The cut sections are floated out in warm water, mounted on clean microscope slides, dried and then stained.

                            <p>After examining the slides, the pathologist writes his report which is passed on to the secretary for typing and dispatch. In most cases the pathologist may require additional sections to be cut or special staining techniques to be carried out before making a final report. The slides are dried at 37°C for about two weeks and then filed away. The gross specimen is kept for at least one month before it is finally disposed off.</p>
