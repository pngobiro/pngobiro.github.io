                        <p>When James Watson coined the term "molecular biology," he was referring to the biology of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Of course, there are other molecules in nature. The term, however, is still used to describe the study of nucleic acids. In the clinical molecular laboratory, molecular techniques are designed for the handling and analysis of the nucleic acids, DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Protein analysis and that of carbohydrates and other molecular species remain, for the most part, the domain of clinical chemistry. Molecular techniques are, however, being incorporated into other testing venues such as cell surface protein analysis, in situ histology, and tissue typing. The molecular biology laboratory, therefore, may be a separate entity or part of an existing molecular diagnostics or molecular pathology unit.</p>
                        
                        <p>Nucleic acids offer several characteristics that support their use for clinical purposes. Highly specific analyses can be carried out through hybridization and amplification techniques without requirement for extensive physical or chemical selection of target molecules or organisms. This sensitivity allows specific and rapid analysis from limiting specimens. Furthermore, information carried in the sequence of the nucleotides that make up the DNA macromolecule is the basis for normal and pathological traits from microorganisms to humans and, as such, provides a valuable means of predictive analysis. Effective prevention and treatment of disease will result from the analysis of these sequences in the clinical laboratory.</p>

                                <p>Johann Friedrich Miescher is credited with the discovery of DNA in 1869. Miescher had isolated white blood cells from seepage collected from discarded surgical bandages. He found that he could extract a viscous substance from these cells. Miescher also observed that most of the nonnuclear cell components could be lysed away with dilute hydrochloric acid, leaving the nuclei intact. Addition of extract of pig stomach (a source of pepsin to dissolve away contaminating proteins) resulted in a somewhat shrunken but clean preparation of nuclei. Extraction of these with alkali yielded the same substance isolated from the intact cells. It precipitated upon the addition of acid and redissolved in alkali. Chemical analysis of this substance demonstrated that it was 14% nitrogen and 2.5% phosphorus, different from any then known group of biochemicals. He named the substance "nuclein." (Analytical data indicate that less than 30% of Miescher's first nuclein preparation was actually DNA.) He later isolated a similar viscous material from salmon sperm and noted: "If one wants to assume that a single substance…is the specific cause of fertilization, then one should undoubtedly first of all think of nuclein."</p>

                            <p>DNA is a macromolecule of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and hydrogen atoms. It is assembled in units or nucleotides that are composed of a phosphorylated ribose sugar and a nitrogen base. There are four nitrogen bases that make up the majority of DNA found in all organisms in nature. These are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Nitrogen bases are attached to a deoxyribose sugar, which forms a polymer with the deoxyribose sugars of other nucleotides through a phosphodiester bond. Linear assembly of the nucleotides makes up one strand of DNA. Two strands of DNA comprise the DNA double helix.</p>

                            <p>The double helical structure of DNA (Fig. 1-1) was first described by James Watson and Francis Crick. Their molecular model was founded on previous observations of the chemical nature of DNA and physical evidence including diffraction analyses performed by Rosalind Franklin. The helical structure of DNA results from the physicochemical demands of the linear array of nucleotides. Both the specific sequence (order) of nucleotides in the strand as well as the surrounding chemical microenvironment can affect the nature of the DNA helix.</p>

                                    <p>The double helix first described by Watson and Crick is DNA in its hydrated form (B-form) and is the standard form of DNA. It has 10.5 steps or pairs of nucleotides (bp) per turn. Dehydrated DNA takes the A-form with about 11 bp per turn and the center of symmetry along the outside of the helix rather than down the middle as it is in the B-form. Both A- and B-form DNA are right-handed helices. Stress and torsion can throw the double helix into a Z-form. Z-DNA is a left-handed helix with 12 bp per turn and altered geometry of the sugar-base bonds. Z-DNA has been observed in areas of chromosomes where the DNA is under torsional stress from unwinding for transcription or other metabolic functions.</p>

                            <h3>Nucleotides</h3>
                            <p>The four nucleotide building blocks of DNA are molecules of about 700 kd. Each nucleotide consists of a five-carbon sugar, the first carbon of which is covalently joined to a nitrogen base and the fifth carbon to a triphosphate moiety (Fig. 1-2). A nitrogen base bound to an unphosphorylated sugar is a nucleoside. Adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytidine (C), and thymidine (T) are nucleosides. If the ribose sugar is phosphorylated, the molecule is a nucleoside mono-, di-, or triphophosphate or a nucleotide. For example, adenosine with one phosphate is adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Adenosine with three phosphates is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Nucleotides can be converted to nucleosides by hydrolysis. The five-carbon sugar of DNA is deoxyribose, which is ribose with the number two carbon of deoxyribose linked to a hydrogen atom rather than a hydroxyl group (see Fig. 1-2). The hydroxyl group on the third carbon is important for forming the phosphodiester bond that is the backbone of the DNA strand.</p>

                            <p>Nitrogen bases are planar carbon-nitrogen ring structures. The four common nitrogen bases in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Amine and ketone substitutions around the ring as well as the single or double bonds within the ring distinguish the four bases that comprise the majority of DNA (Fig. 1-3). Nitrogen bases with a single ring (thymine, cytosine) are pyrimidines. Bases with a double ring (guanine, adenine) are purines.</p>

                            <p>The nitrogen base components of the nucleotides form hydrogen bonds with each other in a specific way. Guanine forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine. Adenine forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine. Hydrogen bonds between nucleotides are the key to the specificity of all nucleic acid-based tests used in the molecular laboratory. Specific hydrogen bond formation is also how the information held in the linear order of the nucleotides is maintained. As DNA is polymerized, each nucleotide to be added to the new DNA strand hydrogen bonds with the complementary nucleotide on the parental strand (A:T, G:C). In this way the parental DNA strand can be replicated without loss of the nucleotide order. Base pairs (bp) other than A:T and G:C or mismatches, e.g., A:C, G:T, can distort the DNA helix and disrupt the maintenance of sequence information.</p>

                            <h3>Substituted Nucleotides</h3>
                            <p>Modifications of the nucleotide structure are found throughout nature. Methylations, deaminations, additions, substitutions, and other chemical modifications generate nucleotides with new properties. Changes such as methylation of nitrogen bases have biological consequences for gene function and are intended in nature. Changes can also be brought about by environmental insults such as chemicals or radiation. These changes can affect gene function as well, resulting in undesirable effects such as cancer.</p>

                            <p>Due to their specific effects on enzymes that metabolize DNA, modified nucleosides have been used effectively for clinical applications (Fig. 1-5). The anticancer drugs, 5-bromouridine (5BrdU) and cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine, ara-C), are modified thymidine and cytosine nucleosides, respectively. Azidothymidine (Retrovir, AZT), cytosine, $2^{\prime},3^{\prime}$-dideoxy-$2^{\prime}$-fluoro (ddC), and $2^{\prime},3^{\prime}$-dideoxyinosine (Videx, ddI), drugs used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, are modifications of thymidine and cytosine and a precursor of adenine, respectively. An analog of guanosine, 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6H-pur in-6-one (Acyclovir, Zovirax), is a drug used to combat herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus.</p>

                            <h3>Nucleic Acid</h3>
                            <p>Nucleic acid is a macromolecule made of nucleotides bound together by the phosphate and hydroxyl groups on their sugars. A nucleic acid chain grows by the attachment of the $5^{\prime}$ phosphate group of an incoming nucleotide to the $3^{\prime}$ hydroxyl group of the last nucleotide on the growing chain (Fig. 1-6). Addition of nucleotides in this way gives the DNA chain a polarity; that is, it has a $5^{\prime}$ phosphate end and a $3^{\prime}$ hydroxyl end. We refer to DNA as oriented in a $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction, and the linear sequence of the nucleotides, by convention, is read in that order.</p>

                            <p>DNA found in nature is mostly double-stranded. Two strands exist in opposite $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$ to $5^{\prime}$ orientation held together by the hydrogen bonds between their respective bases (A with T and G with C). The bases are positioned such that the sugar-phosphate chain that connects them (sugar-phosphate backbone) is oriented in a spiral or helix around the nitrogen bases (see Fig. 1-1). The DNA double helix represents two versions of the information stored in the form of the order or sequence of the nucleotides on each chain. The sequences of the two strands that form the double helix are complementary, not identical (Fig. 1-7). They are in antiparallel orientation with the 5' end of one strand at the 3' end of the other (Fig. 1-8). Identical sequences will not hybridize with each other.</p>

                            <p>DNA has an antiparallel orientation because of the way it is synthesized. As DNA synthesis proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction, DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for polymerizing the nucleotides, uses a guide, or template, to determine which nucleotides to add. The enzyme reads the template in the 3' to 5' direction. The resulting double strand, then, will have a parent strand in one orientation and a newly synthesized strand oriented in the opposite orientation.</p>

                                    <p>Before the double helix was determined, Erwin Chargaff made the observation that the amount of adenine in DNA corresponded to the amount of thymine and the amount of cytosine to the amount of guanine. Upon the description of the double helix, Watson proposed that the steps in the ladder of the double helix were pairs of bases, thymine with adenine and guanine with cytosine. Watson and Crick suggested that this arrangement was the basis for a copying mechanism.</p>
                                    <p>A few years later, the mechanism of semiconservative replication was demonstrated by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl using equilibrium density centrifugation. They differentiated true semiconservative replication from dispersive replication by demonstrating that approximately half of the DNA double helices from the next generation grown in normal nitrogen were hybrid molecules.</p>

                            <p>DNA replication proceeds through the DNA duplex with both strands of DNA replicating in a single pass. DNA undergoing active replication can be observed by electron microscopy as a forked structure, or replication fork. Note, however, that the antiparallel nature of duplex DNA and the requirement for the DNA synthesis apparatus to read the template strand in a 3' to 5' direction are not consistent with copying of both strands simultaneously in the same direction.</p>
                            
                            <p>This problem was addressed in 1968 by Okazaki and Okazaki studying DNA replication in <em>Escherichia coli</em>. In their experiments, small pieces of DNA, about 1000 bases in length, were observed. These small fragments, or <strong>Okazaki fragments</strong>, were the key to explaining how both strands were copied at the replication fork. The replication apparatus jumps ahead a short distance on the 5' to 3' strand and then copies backward toward the replication fork, while DNA replication proceeds in a continuous manner on the 3' to 5' strand, or the <strong>leading strand</strong>. The 5' to 3' strand copied in a discontinuous manner is the <strong>lagging strand</strong> (Fig. 1-9).</p>

                            <p>The first purified enzyme shown to catalyze DNA replication in prokaryotes was designated DNA polymerase I (pol I). DNA polymerases II (pol II) and III were later characterized, and it was discovered that DNA polymerase III (pol III) was the main polymerizing enzyme during bacterial replication. In vivo, pol III functions as a multisubunit holoenzyme. The holoenzyme works along with a larger assembly of proteins required for priming, initiation, regulation, and termination of the replication process (Fig. 1-10).</p>

                            <p>Genetic engineering was stimulated by the discovery of deoxyriboendonucleases, or endonucleases. Endonucleases break the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA at internal sites. Restriction enzymes are endonucleases that recognize specific base sequences and break or restrict the DNA polymer at the sugar-phosphate backbone. These enzymes were originally isolated from bacteria where they function as part of a primitive defense system to cleave foreign DNA entering the bacterial cell.</p>

                            <p>Restriction endonucleases have been classified into three types. Type II restriction enzymes are those used most frequently in the laboratory. These enzymes do not have inherent methylation activity in the same molecule as the nuclease activity. They bind as simple dimers to their symmetrical DNA recognition sites. These sites are palindromic in nature.</p>

                                    <p>Some enzymes cut the duplex with a staggered separation at the recognition site, leaving 2-4 base single-strand overhangs at the ends of the DNA. These are said to produce "sticky ends". Another mode of cutting separates the DNA duplex at the same place on both strands, leaving flush, or blunt, ends. Sticky ends can be converted to blunt ends using DNA polymerase.</p>

                            <p>DNA ligase catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between adjacent 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphoryl nucleotide ends. Its existence was predicted by the observation of replication, recombination, and repair activities in vivo. In the laboratory, DNA ligase is used to join cloning vectors and DNA fragments.</p>

                            <p><strong>Helicases:</strong> These enzymes, including topoisomerases and gyrases, untangle and relax the DNA double helix to release it for transcription and replication.</p>
                            <p><strong>Methyltransferases:</strong> DNA methyltransferases catalyze the addition of methyl groups to nitrogen bases, usually cytosine. This modification protects DNA from restriction enzymes and regulates gene expression.</p>

                            <p>Recombination is the mixture and assembly of new genetic combinations. Recombination occurs through the molecular process of crossing over or physical exchange between molecules. A recombinant molecule or organism is one that holds a new combination of DNA sequences.</p>

                            <h3>Recombination in Sexually Reproducing Organisms</h3>
                            <p>Sexually reproducing organisms mix genes in three ways. First, at the beginning of meiosis, duplicated homologous chromosomes line up and recombine by crossing over or breakage and reunion of the four DNA duplexes (Fig. 1-14). Second, these recombined duplexes are randomly assorted into gametes (Fig. 1-15). Finally, the gamete will merge with a gamete from the other parent carrying its own set of recombined chromosomes.</p>
