                            <p>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymer of nucleotides similar to DNA. It differs from DNA in the sugar moieties, having ribose instead of deoxyribose and, in one nitrogen base component, having uracil instead of thymine (thymine is 5-methyl uracil; Fig. 2-1). Furthermore, RNA is synthesized as a single strand rather than as a double helix. Although RNA strands do not have complementary partner strands, they are not completely single-stranded. Through internal homologies, RNA species fold and loop upon themselves to take on as much of a double-stranded character as possible. RNA can also pair with complementary single strands of DNA or RNA and form a double helix.</p>

                            <p>DNA can only store information. In order for this information to be utilized, it must be transcribed and then translated into protein, a process called gene expression. A specific type of RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), carries the information in DNA to the ribosomes where it is translated into protein.</p>
                            
                            <p>Transcription is the copying of one strand of DNA into RNA by a process similar to that of DNA replication. This activity occurs mostly in interphase nuclei. Evidence suggests that transcription takes place at discreet stations of the nucleus into which the DNA molecules move. One of these sites, the nucleolus, is the location of ribosomal RNA synthesis.</p>

                            <p>The polymerization of RNA from a DNA template is catalyzed by RNA polymerase. After binding to its start site in DNA, a specific sequence of bases called the promoter, RNA polymerase and its supporting accessory proteins synthesize RNA using the base sequence of one strand of the double helix (the antisense strand) as a guide (Fig. 2-2). The sense strand of the DNA template has a sequence identical to that of the RNA product (except for the U for T substitution in RNA), but it does not serve as the template for the RNA.</p>

                            <p>Compared with sites of initiation of DNA replication, there are many more sites for initiation of transcription (RNA synthesis) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are also many more molecules of RNA polymerase than DNA polymerase in the cell. RNA polymerases work more slowly than DNA polymerases (50–100 bases/sec for RNA synthesis vs. 1000 bases/sec for DNA replication) and with less fidelity.</p>

                            <p>Unlike DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis does not require a primer. Upon initiation of RNA synthesis, the first ribonucleoside triphosphate retains all of its phosphate groups as the RNA is polymerized in the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ direction. Subsequent ribonucleoside triphosphates retain only the alpha phosphate, the one closest to the ribose sugar. The other two phosphate groups are released as orthophosphate during the synthesis reaction.</p>

                            <p>RNA synthesis proceeds along the DNA template until the polyadenylation signal is encountered. At this point the process of termination of transcription is activated. There is no consensus sequence in DNA that specifies termination of transcription. This might be explained by recent descriptions of termination by specific exonuclease activity. As the polymerase proceeds past the polyA site, the nascent mRNA is released by an endonuclease associated with the carboxy terminal end of the polymerase. RNA synthesized beyond the site trails out of the RNA polymerase and is bound by another exonuclease that begins to degrade the RNA $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ toward the RNA polymerase. When the exonuclease catches up with the polymerase, transcription stops.</p>

                            <p>Gene expression is the fundamental process for cell regulation, differentiation, and development. Signal transduction pathways that are the targets of several therapeutic strategies funnel internal and external signals to the nucleus where transcription factors bind to specific sequences in DNA and initiate or turn off transcription.</p>

                            <p>The largest component of cellular RNA is ribosomal RNA (rRNA), comprising 80%–90% of the total cellular RNA. The various types of ribosomal RNAs are named for their sedimentation coefficient (S) in density gradient centrifugation. rRNA is an important structural and functional part of the ribosomes, cellular organelles where proteins are synthesized (Fig. 2-3).</p>

                            <p>In prokaryotes, there are three rRNA species, the 16S found in the ribosome small subunit, and the 23S and 5S, found in the ribosome large subunit, all synthesized from the same gene. In eukaryotes, rRNA is synthesized from highly repeated gene clusters. Eukaryotic rRNA is copied from DNA as a single 45S precursor RNA (preribosomal RNA) that is subsequently processed into 18S of the ribosome small subunit and 5.8S and 28S species of the large subunit. Another rRNA species, 5S, found in the large ribosome subunit in eukaryotes, is synthesized separately.</p>

In prokaryotes, mRNA is synthesized even as it is being translated into protein. Prokaryotic mRNA is sometimes polycistronic; that is, coding for more than one protein on the same mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA, in contrast, is monocistronic, having only one protein per mRNA. Eukaryotes can, however, produce different proteins from the same DNA sequences by starting the RNA synthesis in different places or by processing the mRNA differently. In eukaryotes, copying of RNA from DNA and protein synthesis from the RNA are separated by the nuclear membrane barrier. Eukaryotic mRNA undergoes a series of post-transcriptional processing events before it is translated into protein (Fig. 2-4).</p>

                            <h4>Messenger RNA Processing</h4>
                            <p><strong>Polyadenylation:</strong> Study of mRNA in eukaryotes was facilitated by the discovery that most messengers carry a sequence of polyadenylic acid at the $3^{\prime}$ terminus, the poly(A) tail. The run of adenines was first discovered by hydrogen bonding of mRNA to polydeoxythymine on poly(dT) cellulose. Polyuridine or polythymine residues covalently attached to cellulose or sepharose substrates are often used to specifically isolate mRNA in the laboratory.</p>

                            <p>The poly(A) tail is not coded in genomic DNA. It is added to the RNA after synthesis of the pre-mRNA. A protein complex recognizes the RNA sequence, AAUAAA, and cleaves the RNA chain 11–30 bases $3^{\prime}$ to that site. The enzyme polyadenylate polymerase is responsible for adding the adenines to the end of the transcript. A run of up to 200 nucleotides of poly(A) is typically found on mRNA in mammalian cells.</p>

                                    <p>A DNA copy (complementary DNA, copy DNA [cDNA]) of mature mRNA can be made by reverse transcription of mRNA. Compared with the original gene on the chromosome, the cDNA version of eukaryotic genes is smaller than the chromosomal version. Restriction enzyme mapping can be used to confirm that this is not due to premature termination of the genomic transcript. The entire functional gene is present in the shorter sequence because cDNA versions of eukaryotic genes can be expressed into complete proteins. The larger chromosomal version of the gene must, therefore, have extra sequences, and these sequences must be inserted between the protein coding sequences. Direct location and size of these intervening sequences were first demonstrated by electron microscopy of hybrids between mRNA and cDNA using the method of R loop mapping.</p>

                                    <p>About 30% of the mRNAs, notably histone mRNAs, are not polyadenylated. The function of the poly(A) tail, or functional differences between poly(A)+ and poly(A)- mRNA, is not clear. The polyA tail may be involved in movement of the mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, association with other cell components, maintenance of secondary structure, or proper stability of the message.</p>

                            <p><strong>Capping:</strong> Eukaryotic mRNA is blocked at the $5^{\prime}$ terminus by an unusual $5^{\prime}$-$5^{\prime}$ pyrophosphate bridge to a methylated guanosine. The structure is called a cap. The cap is a $5^{\prime}$-$5^{\prime}$ pyrophosphate linkage of 7-methyl guanosine to either $2^{\prime}$ O-methyl guanine or $2^{\prime}$ O-methyl adenine of the mRNA.</p>
                            
                            <p>The cap confers a protective function as well as serves as a recognition signal for the translational apparatus. Caps differ with respect to the methylation of the end nucleotide of the mRNA.</p>

                                    <p>Caps are present on all eukaryotic mRNA bound for translation, except for some mRNA transcribed from mitochondrial DNA. Capping occurs after initiation of transcription, catalyzed by the enzyme guanylyl transferase. This enzyme links a guanosine monophosphate provided by guanosine triphosphate to the $5^{\prime}$ phosphate terminus of the RNA with the release of pyrophosphate. Caps of mRNA are recognized by ribosomes just before translation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Splicing:</strong> Prokaryotic structural genes contain uninterrupted lengths of open reading frame, sequences that code for amino acids. In contrast, eukaryotic coding regions are interrupted with long stretches of noncoding DNA sequences called introns. Newly transcribed mRNA, heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), is much larger than mature mRNA because it still contains the intervening sequences. Introns are removed from hnRNA by splicing (Fig. 2-5). The remaining sequences that code for the protein product are exons.</p>

                                    <p>There are four types of introns: group I, group II, nuclear, and tRNA, depending on the mechanism of their removal. Group I and II introns are found in mitochondrial and chloroplast genes. Nuclear introns are removed by specialized RNA-protein complexes (small nucleoprotein particles) containing small nuclear RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Although removal of all nuclear introns requires protein catalysts, some introns are removed without the participation of protein factors in a self-splicing reaction. The discovery of self-splicing was the first demonstration that RNA could act as an enzyme.</p>

                            <p>Splicing may be important for timing of translation of mRNA in the cytoplasm. Introns may have evolved as a means of increasing recombination frequency within genes as well as between genes. The discontinuous nature of eukaryotic genes may also protect the coding regions from genetic damage by toxins or radiation.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Alternative splicing</strong> can modify products of genes by alternate insertion of different exons. For example, the production of calcitonin in the thyroid or calcitonin gene-related peptide in the brain depends on the exons included in the mature mRNA in these tissues. Alternative splicing has been found in about 40 different genes.</p>

                            <p>Another type of cellular RNA is the small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which functions in splicing (removal of introns from freshly transcribed RNA) in eukaryotes. Small nuclear RNA stays in the nucleus after its transcription by RNA polymerase I or III.</p>

                            <p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are the functional intermediates of RNA interference (RNAi), a defense in eukaryotic cells against viral invasion. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) species are believed to originate from transcription of inverted repeats or by the activity of cellular or viral RNA-directed RNA polymerases. These 21–22 nucleotide dsRNAs are derived from successive cleavage of dsRNAs 500 or more nucleotide base pairs in length. The ribonuclease III enzyme, <strong>dicer</strong>, is responsible for the generation of siRNA and another small RNA, micro RNA, from dsRNA precursors.</p>

                            <h3>Micro RNAs</h3>
                            <p>Micro RNAs (miRNA) are tiny regulatory RNAs, 21–25 nt in length, derived from endogenous RNA hairpin structures. Micro RNAs were discovered in the worm <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>. Like siRNAs, these evolutionarily conserved RNAs are involved in control of gene expression. Unlike siRNAs that destroy mRNA, miRNAs pair with partially complementary sequences in mRNAs and inhibit translation. So far, over 100 miRNAs have been identified in eukaryotic cells and viruses.</p>

                            <h3>Other Small RNAs</h3>
                            <p>Since the late 1990s a growing variety of small RNAs (sRNA) have been described in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including tiny noncoding RNAs (tncRNA, 20–22 b), small modulatory RNA (smRNA, 21–23b), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), tmRNA, and others. These small untranslated RNA molecules have been termed sRNAs in bacteria and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in eukaryotes.</p>

Trans factors are proteins that bind to the cis sequences and direct the assembly of transcription complexes at the proper gene.</p>

                            <p>An operon is a series of structural genes transcribed together on one mRNA and subsequently separated into individual proteins. In organisms with small genomes such as bacteria and viruses, operons bring about coordinate expression of proteins required at the same time. The lactose operon contains three structural genes, LacZ, LacY, and LacA, which are all required for the metabolism of lactose.</p>

                            <h3>Epigenetics</h3>
                            <p>Gene activity (transcription) can be altered in ways other than by cis elements and transcription factors. Histone modification, DNA methylation, and gene silencing by double-stranded or antisense RNA regulate gene expression. These types of gene regulation are called epigenetic regulation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Histone Modification:</strong> Chromatin is nuclear DNA that is compacted onto nucleosomes. Histones are not only structural proteins but can also regulate access of trans factors and RNA polymerase to the DNA helix. Modification of histone proteins affects the activity of chromatin-associated proteins and transcription factors that increase or decrease gene expression. Different types of DNA modifications, including methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, establish a complex system of control.</p>

                            <p><strong>DNA Modification:</strong> DNA methylation is another type of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In vertebrates, methylation occurs in cytosine-guanine-rich sequences in the DNA (CpG islands) (Fig. 2-14). CpG islands are found around the first exons, promoter regions, and sometimes toward the $3^{\prime}$ ends of genes. Methylation of DNA is the main mechanism of genomic imprinting, the gamete-specific silencing of genes.</p>

                            <p><strong>RNAi:</strong> Another phenomenon that affects transcription is RNAi. RNAi is mediated siRNAs. The siRNAs and other proteins assemble into an enzyme complex, called the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) (Fig. 2-15). The RISC uses the associated siRNA to bind and degrade mRNA with sequences complementary to the siRNA. In this way translation of specific genes can be inhibited.</p>
