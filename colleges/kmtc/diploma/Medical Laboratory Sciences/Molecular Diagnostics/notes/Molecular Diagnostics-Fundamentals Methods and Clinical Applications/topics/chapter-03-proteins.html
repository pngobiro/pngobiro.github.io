                        <p>Proteins are the products of transcription and translation of the nucleic acids. Even though nucleic acids are most often the focus of molecular analysis, the ultimate effect of the information stored and delivered by the nucleic acid is manifested in proteins. Analysis of the amount and mutational status of specific proteins has long been performed in situ using immunohistochemistry, on live cells using flow cytometry, and on isolated proteins by Western blots. More recently, global protein analysis by mass spectrometry (proteomics) has been applied to clinical work on a research basis. Even if proteins are not being tested directly, they manifest the phenotype directed by the nucleic acid information. In order to interpret results of nucleic acid analysis accurately, therefore, it is important to understand the movement of genetic information from DNA to protein as dictated by the genetic code.</p>

                            <p>Proteins are polymers of amino acids. Each amino acid has characteristic biochemical properties determined by the nature of its amino acid side chain (Fig. 3-1). Amino acids are grouped according to their polarity (tendency to interact with water at pH 7) as follows: nonpolar, uncharged polar, negatively-charged polar, and positively-charged polar (Table 3.1).</p>
                            
                            <p>The properties of amino acids that make up a protein determine the shape and biochemical nature of the protein, such as highly charged, hydrophilic, or hydrophobic. A single protein can have separate domains with different properties. For example, transmembrane proteins might have several stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that will sit in the lipid membrane of the cell; they might also have hydrophilic or charged extracellular domains (Fig. 3-2).</p>

                            <p>Amino acids are synthesized in vivo by stereospecific enzymes so that naturally occurring proteins are made of amino acids of L-stereochemistry. The central asymmetric carbon atom is attached to a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen atom, and the side chain. Proline differs somewhat from the rest of the amino acids in that its side chain is cyclic, the amino group attached to the end carbon of the side chain making a five-carbon ring.</p>

                            <p>At pH 7, most of the carboxyl groups of the amino acids are ionized, and the amino groups are not. The ionization can switch between the amino and carboxyl groups, making the amino acids zwitterions at physiological pH (Fig. 3-3). At a specific pH, amino acids will become completely positively or negatively charged. These are the pK values. At the pH where an amino acid is neutral, its positive and negative charges are in balance. This is the pI value. Each amino acid will have its characteristic pI. The pI of a peptide or protein is determined by the ionization state (positive and negative charges) of the side chains of its constituent amino acids.</p>

                            <p>The amino and carboxyl terminal groups of the amino acids are joined in a carbon-carbon-nitrogen (-C-C-N-) substituted amide linkage (peptide bond) to form the protein backbone (Fig. 3-4). Two amino acids joined together by a peptide bond make a dipeptide. Peptides with additional units are tri-, tetra-, pentapeptides, and so forth, depending on how many units are attached to each other. At one end of the peptide will be an amino group (the amino terminal or NH₂ end), and at the opposite terminus of the peptide will be a carboxyl group (the carboxy terminal or COOH end). Like the 5′ to 3′ direction of nucleic acids, peptide chains grow from the amino to the carboxy terminus.</p>

                                    <p>Peptides can have biological activity. Hormones such as insulin, glucagons, corticotropin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and thyrotropin are examples of peptides (9-40 amino acids long) with strong biological activity. Several antibiotics such as penicillin and streptomycin are also peptides.</p>

                            <p>Proteins are polypeptides that can reach sizes of more than a thousand amino acids in length. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines the nature and activity of that protein. This sequence is the primary structure of the protein and is read by convention from the amino terminal end to the carboxy terminal end. Minor changes in the primary structure can alter the activity of proteins dramatically. The single amino acid substitution that produces hemoglobin S in sickle cell anemia is a well-known example. Replacement of a soluble glutamine residue with a hydrophobic valine at the sixth residue changes the nature of the protein so that it packs aberrantly in corpuscles and drastically alters cell shape.</p>

This procedure involved dissociating the protein, separating amino acids by chromatography, labeling terminals, and using specific cleavage methods (trypsin, Edmund degradation) to identify peptide sequences, which were then assembled by identifying overlapping regions.</p>

                            <p>Interactions between amino acid side chains fold a protein into predictable configurations. These include ordered beta or beta-pleated sheets and less ordered alpha helices or random coils. This level of organization is the secondary structure of the protein. The secondary structures of proteins are further folded and arranged into a tertiary structure. Tertiary structure is important for protein function. If a protein loses its tertiary structure, it is denatured. As previously mentioned, proteins often associate with other proteins in order to function. Two proteins bound together to function form a dimer, three a trimer, four a tetramer, and so forth. Proteins that work together in this way are called oligomers, each component protein being a monomer. This is the quaternary structure of proteins.</p>

                            <p>A gene is defined as the ordered sequence of nucleotides on a chromosome that encodes a specific functional product. A gene is the fundamental physical and functional unit of inheritance. In the early 1960s, Seymour Benzer used the T4 bacteriophage to investigate the gene more closely, organizing many mutants into a series of sites along the linear array of the phage chromosome so that he could structurally define the gene as a continuous linear span of genetic material.</p>
                            
                            <p>We know now that a gene contains not only structural sequences that code for an amino acid sequence but also regulatory sequences that are important for the regulated expression of the gene (Fig. 3-6). Cells expend much energy to coordinate protein synthesis so that the proper proteins are available at specific times and in specific amounts. Loss of this controlled expression will result in an abnormal phenotype, even though there may be no mutation in the structural sequence of the gene.</p>

                            <p>The nature of a gene was further clarified with the deciphering of the genetic code by Francis Crick, Marshall Nirenberg, Philip Leder, Gobind Khorana, and Sydney Brenner. The genetic code is not information in itself but is a dictionary to translate the four-nucleotide sequence information in DNA to the 20-amino acid sequence information in proteins.</p>

                                    <p>Scientists surmised the triplet nature of the code because a 3-nucleotide code would give 64 different possibilities, enough to account for all 20 amino acids. Marshall Nirenberg made initial attempts by using short synthetic DNA sequences to support protein synthesis in a cell-free extract. Nirenberg and Leder used another technique to observe binding of specific amino acids to RNA triplets in ribosome-tRNA mixtures, assigning 50 of the 64 triplets. Gobind Khorana synthesized longer polymers of known nucleotide sequence to confirm codon assignments.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>By 1965, all 64 triplets, or codons, were assigned to amino acids (Fig. 3-7). Once the code was confirmed, specific characteristics of it were apparent. The code is redundant, so that all but two amino acids (methionine and tryptophan) are coded for by more than one codon. Triplets coding for the same amino acid are similar, mostly differing only in the third base of the triplet. Crick first referred to this as <strong>wobble</strong> in the third position.</p>

                            <p>All amino acids except leucine, serine, and arginine are selected by the first two letters of the genetic code. Three codons, UAG, UAA, and UGA, that terminate protein synthesis are termed nonsense codons (amber, ocher, and opal). The characteristics of the genetic code have consequences for molecular analysis. Mutations or changes in the DNA sequence will have different effects on phenotype depending on the resultant changes in the amino acid sequence.</p>

                            <p>Protein synthesis starts with activation of the amino acids by covalent attachment to tRNA, or tRNA charging, a reaction catalyzed by 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent charging reaction takes place in two steps. First, the amino acid is activated by addition of AMP. Second, the activated amino acid is joined to the tRNA. The product of the reaction is an ester bond between the 3′ hydroxyl of the terminal adenine of the tRNA and the carboxyl group of the amino acid.</p>

An errant amino acid bound to the wrong synthetase will dissociate rapidly before any conformation changes and charging can occur.</p>

                                    <p>Once the amino acid is esterified to the tRNA, it makes no difference in specificity of its addition to the protein. The fidelity of translation is now determined by the anticodon of the tRNA. This association has been exploited by attaching amino acids synthetically to selected tRNAs. If amino acids attached are to tRNAs carrying anticodons to UAG, UAA, or UGA, the peptide chain will continue to grow instead of terminating at the stop codon. These tRNAs are called suppressor tRNAs as they can suppress point mutations that generate stop codons within a protein coding sequence.</p>

                            <h3>Protein Synthesis</h3>
                            <p>Translation takes place on ribosomes, small ribonucleoprotein particles. In prokaryotes, 70S ribosomes are assembled from a 30S small subunit and a 50S large subunit. Eukaryotic ribosomes are slightly larger (80S) and more complex with a 40S small subunit and a 60S subunit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Protein synthesis in the ribosome almost always starts with the amino acid methionine in eukaryotes and N-formylmethionine in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. In protein translation, the small ribosomal subunit first binds to initiation factor 3 (IF-3) and then to specific sequences near the $5^{\prime}$ end of the mRNA, the ribosomal binding site. This guides the AUG codon (the "start" codon) to the proper place in the ribosomal subunit (Fig. 3-9). The large ribosomal subunit then associates coordinate with the hydrolysis of GTP and release of GDP and phosphate, IF-2 and IF-3. The resulting functional 70S or 80S ribosome is the initiation complex.</p>

                            <p>Synthesis proceeds in the elongation step where the tRNA carrying the next amino acid binds to the A site of the ribosome in a complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and GTP (Fig. 3-10). The fit of the incoming tRNA takes place by recognition and then proofreading of the codon-anticodon base pairing. The first peptide bond is formed between the amino acids in the A and P sites by transfer of the N-formylmethionyl group to the amino group of the second amino acid, leaving a dipeptidyl-tRNA in the A site. This step is catalyzed by an enzymatic activity in the large subunit, peptidyl transferase (Fig. 3-11).</p>
