                        <p>The purpose of extraction is to release the nucleic acid from the cell for use in subsequent procedures. Ideally, the target nucleic acid should be free of contamination with protein, carbohydrate, lipids, or other nucleic acid (i.e., DNA free of RNA or RNA free of DNA). The initial release of the cellular material is achieved by breaking the cell and nuclear membranes (cell lysis). Lysis must take place in conditions that will not damage the nucleic acid. Following lysis, the target material is purified, and then the concentration and purity of the sample can be determined.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Although Miescher first isolated DNA from human cells in 1869, the initial routine laboratory procedures for DNA isolation were developed from density gradient centrifugation strategies. Later procedures made use of the differences in solubility of large chromosomal DNA, plasmids, and proteins in alkaline buffers. Large (&gt;50 kbp) chromosomal DNA and proteins cannot renature properly when neutralized in acetate at low pH after alkaline treatment, forming large aggregates instead. As a result, they precipitate out of solution. The relatively small plasmids return to their supercoiled state and stay in solution. Alkaline lysis procedures were used extensively for extraction of 1–50 kb plasmid DNA from bacteria during the early days of recombinant DNA technology.</p>

                            <h3>Preparing the Sample</h3>
                            <p>Nucleic acid is routinely isolated from human, fungal, bacterial, and viral sources in the clinical laboratory. The initial steps in nucleic acid isolation depends on the nature of the starting material.</p>

                            <h4>Nucleated Cells in Suspension</h4>
                            <p>Depending on the type of clinical sample that is sent for analysis, the specimen may have to be pretreated to make nucleated cells available from which the nucleic acid will be extracted. For instance, white blood cells (WBCs) must be isolated from blood or bone marrow specimens. This is done by either differential density gradient centrifugation or differential lysis.</p>
                            
                            <p>For differential density gradient centrifugation, whole blood or bone marrow mixed with isotonic saline is overlaid with <strong>Ficoll</strong>. Ficoll is a highly branched sucrose polymer that does not penetrate biological membranes. Upon centrifugation, the mononuclear WBCs (the desired cells for isolation of nucleic acid) settle into a layer in the Ficoll gradient that is below the less dense plasma components and above the polymorphonuclear cells and red blood cells (RBCs).</p>
                            
                            <p>Another method used to isolate nucleated cells takes advantage of the differences in the osmotic fragility of RBCs and WBCs. Incubation of whole blood or bone marrow in hypotonic buffer or water will result in the lysis of the RBCs before the WBCs. The WBCs are then pelleted by centrifugation.</p>

                            <h4>Tissue Samples</h4>
                            <p>Fresh or frozen tissue samples must be dissociated before DNA isolation procedures can be started. Grinding the frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, homogenizing the tissue, or simply mincing the tissue using a scalpel can disrupt whole tissue samples. Fixed embedded tissue has to be deparaffinized by soaking in xylene (a mixture of three isomers of dimethylbenzene) or less toxic xylene substitutes. After xylene treatment, the tissue is usually rehydrated by soaking it in decreasing concentrations of ethanol.</p>

                            <h4>Microorganisms</h4>
                            <p>Some bacteria and fungi have tough cell walls that must be broken to allow the release of nucleic acid. Enzyme products like lysozyme or zymolyase digest cell wall polymers. Alternatively, cell walls can be broken mechanically by grinding or by vigorously mixing with glass beads. Gentler enzymatic methods are less likely to damage chromosomal DNA.</p>

                            <h3>Organic Isolation Methods</h3>
                            <p>After release of DNA from the cell, further purification requires removal of contaminating proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and cell debris. This is accomplished using a combination of high salt, low pH, and an organic mixture of <strong>phenol and chloroform</strong>. The combination readily dissolves hydrophobic contaminants such as lipids and lipoproteins, collects cell debris, and strips away most DNA-associated proteins (Fig. 4-1).</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>When phenol and chloroform are added to the hydrophilic cleared cell lysate, a biphasic emulsion forms. Centrifugation will settle the hydrophobic layer on the bottom, with the hydrophilic layer on top. DNA will dissolve in the upper aqueous phase. The upper phase containing the DNA is collected, and the DNA is then precipitated using ethanol or isopropanol in a high concentration of salt.</p>

                            <h3>Inorganic Isolation Methods</h3>
                            <p>Safety concerns in the clinical laboratory make the use of caustic reagents such as phenol undesirable. Inorganic DNA extraction is sometimes called "salting out" (Fig. 4-2). It makes use of low pH and high salt conditions to selectively precipitate proteins, leaving the DNA in solution. The DNA can then be precipitated using isopropanol, pelleted, and resuspended in TE buffer or water.</p>

                            <h3>Solid-Phase Isolation</h3>
                            <p>More rapid and comparably effective DNA extraction can be performed using solid matrices to bind and wash the DNA. Silica-based products were shown to effectively bind DNA in high salt conditions. For solid-phase separation, the cell lysate is applied to a column in high salt buffer, and the DNA in solution adsorbs to the solid matrix. After the immobilized DNA is washed with buffer, the DNA is eluted in a specific volume of water, TE, or other low salt buffer (Fig. 4-3).</p>

                            <h3>Crude Lysis</h3>
                            <p>There are circumstances that either preclude or prohibit extensive DNA purification, such as screening large numbers of samples or isolation from fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. In these cases, simple lysis of cellular material will yield sufficiently useful DNA for amplification procedures. Paraffin-embedded specimens can be dewaxed, and regions of interest (e.g., tumor cells) can be isolated by microdissection (Fig. 4-4).</p>

                            <h3>Isolation of Mitochondrial DNA</h3>
                            <p>There are two approaches to the isolation of mitochondrial DNA. One method is to first isolate the mitochondria by centrifugation. The mitochondria are pelleted from the cell homogenate by high-speed centrifugation, lysed, and the DNA precipitated. The second approach is to isolate total DNA; the preparation will contain mitochondrial DNA that can be analyzed within the total DNA background.</p>

                            <p>Working with RNA in the laboratory requires strict precautions to avoid sample RNA degradation. RNA is especially labile due to the ubiquitous presence of RNAses. These enzymes are small proteins that can renature, even after autoclaving, and become active. It is useful to allocate a separate RNAse-free (RNF) area of the laboratory for storage of materials and specimen handling. Glassware must be baked for 4–6 hours at 400°C to inactivate RNAses, or treated with DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate).</p>

                            <h3>Extraction of Total RNA</h3>
                            <p>Preparation of specimen material for RNA extraction differs in some respects than for DNA extraction. Reticulocytes in blood and bone marrow samples are lysed by osmosis or separated from WBCs by centrifugation. When dissociating tissue, the sample should be kept frozen in liquid nitrogen or immersed in buffer that will inactivate intracellular RNAses.</p>

                            <p><strong>Organic Extraction:</strong> Acid phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) solution efficiently extracts RNA. For RNA, the organic phase must be acidic (pH 4–5). DNA will remain in the organic phase, while RNA partitions to the aqueous phase (Fig. 4-5).</p>

                            <p>Often the RNA required for analysis is mRNA, accounting for only about 2.5%–5% of the total RNA yield. To enrich the yield of mRNA, protocols employing oligomers of thymine or uracil immobilized on a matrix resin column or beads are used (Fig. 4-7). The polyT or polyU oligomers will bind the polyA tail found exclusively on mRNA.</p>
