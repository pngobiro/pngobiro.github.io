                            <p>Non-specific immunity, also called natural or innate immunity, is the first line of defense against any infectious agent. Non specific host responses provide an effective barrier that prevents the microorganisms from penetrating, inhibit or destroy the invader if it gains access to the tissues, and eliminate or neutralize any toxic substance elaborated by infectious agent. Several mechanisms are available in the immunocompetent host. These include physical or mechanical barrier, biochemical factors, cellular mechanism, role of normal flora & inflammatory reactions.</p>

                                    <p>The unbroken skin and mucus membrane are effective mechanical barriers to infectious agents. The surface of the skin is also inhibitory to the growth of most microorganisms because of low moisture, low pH, and the presence of secreted inhibitory substance. However, it is possible for some microorganisms to enter the skin through hair follicles, sebaceous glands or sweet glands.</p>
                                    <p>Similarly, mucus membranes consist of an epithelial layer and an underlying connective tissue layer. They line the entire digestive, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive tracts. For example, the epithelial surface that lines the nasal cavity and throat are protected by a combination of mucous production and ciliary movement. Because mucous is so viscous, microorganisms adhere to it. Epithelial cells with cilia constantly move the mucus layer to ward the mouth, where it along with the trapped microorganism is swallowed and eliminated.</p>
                                    <p>Besides, the action of coughing removes mucus that contains microorganisms. In the urethra rapid flow of urine washes away most microorganisms. Tear that wash the conjunctiva perform a similar defensive function.</p>

The term normal flora implies that such microbial inhabitants are harmless For the most part, normal flora microorganisms do not cause disease.</p>
                            <p>The commensal can stop the growth of potentially pathogenic organisms through different mechanism such as occupying attachment sites and by producing substance against pathogenic organism. They also compete for essential nutrients for their growth.</p>

                            <p>The damaged cells at the site of injury initiate the tissue response by releasing chemical factors such histamine, which in turn trigger vasodilation and increased permeability of capillaries, permitting influx of fluids and blood cells in to the site. Then, the phagocytic cells accomplish the leukocyte response, by engulfing the microbes and damaged tissue.</p>
                            <p>In addition to destroying and removing an injurious agent such as a microbe or its products, the inflammatory response also limits the effects of the agent or its products by confining it or walling it of from the surrounding tissues. This is possible because blood clots around the site prevent the microbe or its products from spreading to the other part of the body.</p>
                            <p>The final stage of inflammation is tissue repair, when all harmful agents or substances have been removed or neutralized at the injury site. The ability of a tissue to repair itself depends on the part of the tissue involved. Skin, being a relatively simple tissue has a high capacity for regeneration. But nerve tissue in brain, appears not to regenerate.</p>

                            <p>The specific immune response, also called acquired or adaptive immunity, is a defense system that protects the body against pathogenic microorganisms and other type of disease such as cancer. It allows the body to recognize, remember, and respond to a specific stimulus, an antigen. Specific immunity can result in the elimination of microorganisms and in the recovery from disease, and it frequently leaves the host with specific immunologic memory. This condition of memory or recall, acquired resistance, allows the host to respond more effectively if reinfection with the same microorganism occurs. As a consequence of such acquired immunity, we usually suffer from many diseases only once, for example measles. Specific immunity can be active or passive, and each of these types can in turn be naturally or artificially acquired.</p>

                            <p>Many factors appear to be responsible for differences in the immunity of individual's age; nutrition & genetic factor are some of them.</p>

                            <p>Although non-specific and specific body defense are present in the unborn and newborn infants, many of these defenses are not completely developed in this group. There fore young children are at greater risk for disease. In older adults certain natural barriers to infection break don such as changes in the skin & in the lung weakening of specialized defenses against foreign invasion including the cough reflex.</p>
                            <p>In general, the ability to respond immunologically to disease is age related.</p>

                            <h3 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h3>
                            <p>The importance of good nutrition to good health has always been emphasized. Good nutrition is known to be important to growth and development. The consequences of diet in many aspects of the immune response have been documented in multiple disorders. Every constituent of the body defense appears to influence by nutritional intake. Therefore a healthy diet is important for maximum functioning of the immune system</p>

                            <p>The possession of certain genes is linked to immune disorders these include genes that lead to a deficiency in the production of neutrophils & complement.</p>
