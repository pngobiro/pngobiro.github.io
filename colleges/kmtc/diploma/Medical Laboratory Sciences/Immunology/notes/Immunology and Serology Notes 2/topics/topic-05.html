These cells are responsible for cellular immune responses and are involved in the regulation of antibody reactions either by helping or suppressing the activation of B-lymphocytes.</p>
                            <p>There are at least three functionally distinct types of T cells: cytotoxic or effector T cells, helper or regulatory T cells, suppressor T cells</p>

                                    <p>are thought mainly to inhibit the response of helper T cells. T suppressor cells are capable of suppressing a variety of T cell functions such as cytotoxic response, and B cell responses such as suppression or T helper cells or antibody synthesis by plasma cells.</p>

                            <p>All T-cells have antigen receptor protein (T cell receptor) with which they bind foreign antigens. In order to recognize a foreign antigen, T- cells must simultaneously recognize particular types of self-antigens, which are structural components of the surface of human cells. These antigens don't normally stimulate a destructive immune response.</p>
                            <p>In summary, for T-cell antigen recognition, a foreign antigen is taking up and processed by antigen presenting cells usually macrophages and then the processed antigen is combined with a self antigen to form antigen complex.</p>
                            <p>The antigen-binding site of a T-cell must simultaneously recognize and bind both a foreign and a self-antigen. The self-antigen is known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC), it has two major classes:</p>

                            <p>The first cell to be activated in any immune response is the T helper cell. Activation of T helper cell is enhanced by some factors produced by macrophages. The stimulated T helper cell stimulates it self and proliferate in increased amount. This activated T helper cell also helps to stimulate T cytotoxic cells. When these cells recognize antigen presented in combination with the class I major histocompatibility antigen.</p>
                            <p>Activated T cells respond with direct cytotoxic killing (T cytotoxic cells) or with immune regulation either by intensifying the immune response (T helper cells) or by lowering the immune response (T suppresser cells).</p>
                            <p>Helper and suppressor T cells are the principal regulators of immune responses. Sensitized T cells protect the human body against infection by mediating intracellular pathogens that are viral, bacterial, fungal, or protozoal. In addition, T cells are responsible for chronic rejection in organ transplantation.</p>

T cells do not recognize the antigen of microorganisms or other living cells but are immunologically active through various types of direct cell-to-cell contact and by the production of soluble factors.

                            <p>Autoimmunity represents a breakdown of the immune systems ability to discriminate between self and nonself. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the persistent activation of immunologic effectors mechanism that alter the function and integrity of individual cells and organs. The sites of organ or tissue damage depend on the location of the immune reaction.</p>
                            <p>In autoimmune disease, immunoglobulins (autoantibodies) or cytotoxic T cells display specificity for self-antigens or auto antigens and contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. The potential for autoimmunity, if given appropriate circumstances, is constantly present in every immunocompetent individual because lymphocytes that are potentially reactive with self-antigens exist in the body. The development of autoimmunity is influenced by different factors these include; genetic factors, Age and exogenous factors.</p>

E.g. the presence of certain human leukocyte antigen is associated with an increased risk of certain autoimmune state. Another factor related to genetic inheritance is that autoimmune disorders and autoantibodies are found more frequently in women than in men.</span>

These factors may alter antigens, which the body then perceives as non-self.</span>

                            <p>The normal functioning of immunologic regulatory mechanisms usually prevents autoimmune disease. When these controls dysfunction antibodies to self antigens may be produced and bind to antigens in the circulation to form circulating immune complexes or to antigens deposited in specific tissue sites.</p>
                            <p>Some of the examples of autoimmune disease are Addison disease, pernicious anemia, Rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic Lupus erythematosus.</p>
