                            <p>The immune system is a network of cells and organs that extend through out the body and function as a defense against infection. The immune system has been recognized as a separate body system known as lymphoid system because its main cells are lymphocytes.</p>
                            <p>In mammalian immunologic development, the precursors of lymphocytes arise from progenitor cells of the yolk sac and liver. Later in fetal development and throughout the life cycle, the bone marrow becomes the main provider of undifferentiated progenitor cells, which can further develop in to lymphoblast. Continued cellular development of lymphoid precursors and proliferation occurs as the cell travel to the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues.</p>

                            <h3 id="primary-lymphoid-organ">3.1.1 The Primary Lymphoid Organ</h3>
                            <p>The thymus and bone marrow are referred to a primary lymphoid organ because they provide conducive microenvironments that are essential for initial production of lymphocytes from progenitor cells.</p>
                            
                            <div class="grid grid-2">
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Thymus</h4>
                                    <p>The thymus is a gland situated in front of the heart and behind the sternum. Progenitor cells that leave the bone marrow migrate to the thymus for proliferation and differentiation. This process is facilitated by a hormone, thymosin. The differentiated cell is known as thymus- derived T cell.</p>
                                    <p>Involution of the thymus is the first age-related change occurring in the immune system of humans. The thymus gradually loses up to 95% of its mass during the first fifty years of life. This will result in decreased synthesis of thymic hormone and loss of the ability to differentiate immature lymphocytes are reflected in an increased number of immature lymphocytes both with in the thymus and circulating peripheral blood T-cells.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Bone Marrow</h4>
                                    <p>Bone marrow is the source of progenitor cells. These cells can differentiate in to lymphocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, etc. The bone marrow also plays a role in the differentiation of progenitor cells into B-lymphocytes and functions as the bursa equivalent in human. It is from the term bursa, that the B-lymphocytes derived their name. Bursa of fabricius is the primary lymphoid organ in birds.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>B-lymphocyte differentiations in the bone marrow continue through out lifetime. Mature lymphocytes that emerge form the thymus or bone marrow are in a "resting" state. They are mitotically inactive although they are potentially capable of undergoing cell division and of carrying out immunologic functions, they are not yet been stimulated to do either when dispersed in to the blood stream, they are known as 'naïve' or 'virgin' lymphocytes.</p>

                            <h3 id="secondary-lymphoid-organ">3.1.2 Secondary Lymphoid Organ</h3>
                            <p>The secondary lymphoid organs include lymph nodes, spleen, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, tonsils, blood and others, in to which the so-called 'virgin' lymphocytes migrates efficiently. The function of the secondary lymphoid organs is to maximize encounters between lymphocytes and foreign substances, and it is from this site that most immune responses are launched.</p>
                            <p>The relative percentage of T and B cells are different in different locations. The approximate percentage of lymphocytes in lymphoid organs is described in table 3.1.</p>

                            <h4 id="lymph-nodes">Lymph nodes</h4>
                            <p>Lymph nodes act like lymphoid filters in the lymphatic system. It responds to antigens introduced distantly and routed to them by afferent lymphatic. Generalized lymph node reactivity can occur following systemic antigen challenge.</p>

                            <h4 id="spleen">Spleen</h4>
                            <p>The spleen act like a lymphatic filter with in the blood vascular tree. It is an important site of antibody production in response to intravenous particulate antigen (e.g. bacterial). The spleen is also a major organ for the clearance of particles.</p>

                            <h4 id="galt">Gut – associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)</h4>
                            <p>Gut-associated lymphoid tissue includes lymphoid tissue in the intestines (payer’s patches) and the liver. Gut associated lymphoid tissue is involved in lymphocyte circulation, i.e. pre-B cells develop in payer’s patches and after meeting antigen from the gut, they enter to the general circulation and then return back to the gut.</p>

                            <h4 id="tonsils">Tonsils</h4>
                            <p>Tonsils are nodular aggregates of lymphoid tissues, their function is to detect and respond to pathogens in the respiratory secretion.</p>

                            <h4 id="blood">Blood</h4>
                            <p>The blood is an important lymphoid organ and immunologic effector tissue. Circulating blood has enough mature T-cells to produce graft-versus-host reaction.</p>

                            <p>Most virgin lymphocytes have an inherently short life span and are programmed to die within a few days after leaving the marrow or thymus. How ever, if a cell receive signals that induce the presence of a specific foreign substance or pathogen, it may respond to it by a phenomenon known as activation. In the process it may under go several successive cell divisions over a period of several day. Some of the resulting progeny cells then revert to the resting state to become memory lymphocytes (cells that resemble the virgin lymphocytes from which they are derived but which can survive for many years). The other progeny of an activated 'virgin' lymphocyte differentiate into effector cells, which survive for only a few days to carry out specific defensive activities against the foreign invader.</p>

                            <p>The lymphocytes are one of the classes of white blood cells, capable of responding to antigens in specific host defense mechanism. Under the microscope, all lymphocytes look like, differing only in size and other physiologically variable features, yet under this surface of morphological homogeneity, there is a hidden homogeneity. First, the lymphocytes fall in to three large sets, the T, B. and natural killer (NK) cells. The NK cells constitute a special category; we will there fore leave them and focus on T and B cells. The T and B sets are split in to subsets defined by a variety of criteria. Finally, each subset is a mosaic of clones, each clone express a specific receptor for a different antigenic epitope.</p>

                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Concept of Clonal Selection</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Lymphocytes have surface receptors specific for different antigens. As these cells differentiate and each of them expresses a particular receptor for gene, they are subsequently excluded from expressing all other receptor genes. The progeny of a given cell will therefore express the same gene and the same receptor. It will thus form a clone, a group of cells that are derived from the same ancestral cell.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>Since different cells express different receptors, the lymphocyte population of a vertebrate is a mosaic of store selling shoes of all possible sizes. The customer entering the store (the antigen or epitope binding to the receptor) selects a particular pair of shoes (particular lymphocytes) and purchases it (stimulates the lymphocytes). The selected lymphocyte then divides and the progeny form a clone of identical specificity (clonal selection).</p>
                            <p>The fundamental property of lymphocytes is that all of the B-cell or T cell receptor proteins expressed by cells in a given clone are identical. All have precisely the same amino acid sequence.</p>
                            <p>The speed and intensity of response to a given antigen is determined largely by clonal selection. The larger the specific clone, the more lymphocytes are available that can recognize the antigen and can participate in the immune response. Burnet first postulated the principle of clonal selection, in the 1950s.</p>

                            <h3 id="b-lymphocytes">3.2.2. B-lymphocytes</h3>
                            <p>B-cells represent less than 15% of the circulating lymphocytes and are derived from progenitor cells through an antigen independent maturation process occurring in the bone marrow and GALT. These cells serve as the primary source for cells responsible for hormonal (antibody) response, which is a primary host defense against microorganisms.</p>

                            <h4 id="humoral-response">B- lymphocytes and humoral response</h4>
                            <p>Participation of B-cells in the humoral immune response is accomplished by their stimulation in to plasma cells, with subsequent synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins after antigenic stimulation.</p>
                            <p>The humoral immune response; stimulation of B-cells to produce antibodies requires the interaction between macrophages, T-cells and B-cells. In order to recognize antigens, B-cells usually require the cooperation of antigen presenting cells. Macrophages are the major antigen presenting cells that phagocytize, process and present antigen to T-cells. The T-cell that contain an antigen on its surface bound with a specific antigen receptor of B-cell known as B-cell receptor as a result the B-cell recognize its specific antigen and it become activated.</p>
                            <p>Activation causes the selected B-cell to divide producing clone. It also causes the B-cells to differentiate further in to plasma cells, which produce the enormous quantity of antibodies needed to fight infection. Some members of this clone become effector cells that actively fight the current infection while others remain as memory B-cells that are held in reserve to fight future infection by the same antigen.</p>
                            <p>Plasma cells are the end stage of B-cells differentiation, which are capable of synthesing and excreting antibodies. Plasma cells are not found normally in the circulating blood.</p>

                            <h4 id="primary-secondary-response">Primary and secondary humoral immune response</h4>
                            <p>B cells can be stimulated in their resting state to enlarge, divide, mature and secrete antibody. The proper signal for this sequence depend on the type of antigen (foreign material) i.e. exposure of antigen for the first time or second exposure. Depending on the type of espouser the immune response also vary.</p>

                                    <p>The production of antibody during a primary immune response occurs when a person first encounters a particular antigen. The type of antibody first appear are of the IgM class. The production of detectable serum IgM may take 1-2 weeks the produced antibody will decline with in short period.</p>

                                    <p>Secondary immune response is initiated by memory B-cells when there is second exposure with similar antigen. IgG is the major antibody produced in secondary immune response. The production of this antibody in detectable amount may take very short time as compared to the primary response. The IgG may persist for many months or years. The secondary immune response has high affinity than primary immune response because of the memory B-cells.</p>
