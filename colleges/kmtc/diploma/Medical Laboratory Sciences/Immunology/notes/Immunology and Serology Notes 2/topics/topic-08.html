                            <p>Syphilis is caused by a spirochete bacterium, <em>Treponema pallidum</em>.</p>

                            <h3 id="morphology">8.2.1 Morphology and Metabolism of T. Pallidum</h3>
                            <p>Microscopically <em>T. pallidum</em> appears as fine, spiral (8 to 24 coils) organism, approximately 6-15 µm long.</p>
                            <p>They are not cultivatable with any consistency in artificial laboratory media out side the host. <em>T. pallidum</em> are extremely susceptible to a variety of physical and chemical agents. However, they may remain viable for up to 5 days in tissue specimens removed from diseased animals and from frozen specimens.</p>
                            <p>Syphilis is a venereal disease. It can be acquired by kissing a person with active oral lesion. There are very few cases of transfusion-acquired syphilis. In addition, syphilis may be transmitted transplacentally to the fetus. Spirochetes can be transmitted to the fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3 id="stages-of-syphilis">8.2.2 Stages of Syphilis</h3>
                            <p>The progression of untreated syphilis is generally divided in to stages. Initially, <em>T.pallidum</em> penetrates intact mucous membranes or enters the body through tiny defects in the epithelium. Upon entrance, the microorganism is carried by the circulatory system to every organ of the body. Spirochetemia occurs very early in infection, even before the first lesions have appeared or blood tests become reactive. Before chemical or serologic manifestations develop patients are said to be 'incubating syphilis'. The incubation period usually lasts about 3 weeks but can range from 10-90 days.</p>

                                    <h4>Primary syphilis</h4>
                                    <p>At the end of the incubation period, a patient develops a characteristics primary inflammatory lesion called a <strong>chancre</strong> at the point of initial inoculation and multiplication of the spirochetes. The chancre begins as a papule and erodes to form a gradually enlarging ulcer with a clean base and indurate edge. Generally it is relatively painless and commonly located around the genitalia, but in about 10% of cases lesions may appear almost any where else on the body e.g. Throat, lip, hands. Most of the patients with primary syphilis will develop swelling of inguinal lymph nods. The primary chancre will persist for 1 to 5 weeks and will heal completely within about 4 to 6 weeks. Primary syphilis is diagnosed by its characteristics chancre with positive serological test and detection of <em>T.pallidum</em> by dark field examination from the lesion.</p>

                                    <h4>Secondary syphilis</h4>
                                    <p>Within 2 to 8 weeks after the appearance of the primary chancre, a patient may develop the sign and symptoms of secondary syphilis when organisms gain access to the circulation from the infected site. The secondary stage is characterized by a generalized illness that usually begins with symptoms suggesting a viral infection headache, sore throat, low-grade fever and occasionally nasal discharges. The disease progresses with the development of lymhadenopathy and lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. Macular lesions are common, and a rash invariably involves the genitalia and of ten is prominent on the palms and soles.</p>

                                    <p>After resolution of untreated secondary syphilis, the patient enters a latent non-infectious state in which diagnosis can be made only by serologic method. During the first 2-4 years of infection, one fourth of patients will show relapses of manifestation of secondary syphilis. During these relapses, patients are infectious, and the underlying spirochetemia may be passed translucently to the fetus.</p>

About 15% of untreated syphilitic individuals eventually develop late benign syphilis characterized by the presence of destructive granulomas or gummas. 10% develop cardiovascular manifestations (aorta and coronary arthritis). In about 8% of untreated patients, late syphilis involves the CNS (neurosyphilis), causing destructions of the brain parenchyma (paresis) or dorsal root of the spinal cord (tabes).</p>

                            <h4>Congenital syphilis</h4>
                            <p>Congenital syphilis is caused by maternal spirochetemia and transplacental transmission of the microorganism usually after 18 weeks of gestation. Congenital syphilis is diagnosed in three fourths of the cases in patients over 10 years of age. Early congenital syphilis appears either at birth or up to two years of age (cutaneous lesion, mucous membrane lesion). Late congenital syphilis may be characterized by fissuring around the mouth, anus, skeletal lesions, and perforation of the palate and the collapse of nasal bones to produce a saddle-nose deformity.</p>

                            <p>In the treponemes, two classes of antigen have been recognized those restricted to one or a few species and those shared by many different spirochetes. Infection with <em>T.pallidum</em>, <em>T.pertenue</em>, <em>T.carateum</em> <em>T.endemicum</em> produces similar antibody response. Specific and non-specific antibodies are produced in the immunocompetent host.</p>
