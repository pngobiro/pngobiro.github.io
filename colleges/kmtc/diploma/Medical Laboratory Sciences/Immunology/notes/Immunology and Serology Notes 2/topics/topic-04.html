                            <p>Many immunogens, including all microbial pathogens, are complex assemblages containing several different types of molecules, not all of which are antigenic.</p>
                            <p>Not all antigens are immunogenic i.e. not every chemical substance that can be bound by an immunoglobulin is capable of inducing an immune response.</p>
                            <p>Antigenic molecules may be multivalent, having multiple epitope, or monovalent, having only one epitope. Generally, multivalent antigens produce a stronger immune response than monovalent antigens because wide arrays of antibody molecules are made against the multiple antigens.</p>

                            <p>The response to an immunogen is often enhanced if it is administered as a mixture with substances called adjuvants. Adjuvants function in one or more of the following ways;</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>The most widely used adjuvant for humans is alum precipitate, a suspension of aluminum hydroxide on to which the immunogen is adsorbed. This adjuvant increases the effective size of the immunogen and so promotes its ingestion and presentation by macrophages.</p>

                            <p>For a substance or molecule to be immunogenic certain conditions must be fulfilled; these are: chemical composition, molecular size, etc.</p>

                                    <h4>Chemical composition</h4>
                                    <p>Large, macromolecular proteins are the most potent immunogens. Polysaccharides and short polypeptides can also be immunogenic under certain circumstances. Pure lipids and nucleic acids have not been shown to be immunogenic, thus they can be an example of molecules that are antigenic but not immunogenic</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="grid-item">
                                    <h4>Molecular Size</h4>
                                    <p>Extremely small molecules such as amino acids or monosaccharides are usually not immunogenic implying that a certain minimum size is necessary for immunogenicity. A few substances with molecular weights below 1000 have proven to be immunogenic, but as a rule molecules with molecular weights below 10,000 are only weakly immunogenic or not immunogenic at all. The most potent immunogens are proteins with molecular weight, greater than 100,000.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h4>Chemical Complexity</h4>
                                    <p>A molecule must possess a certain degree of chemical complexity to be immunogenic. For instance, simple polypeptides that contain tyrosine are better immunogens than are comparable polypeptides with out tyrosine, and immunogenicity of such polymers is directly proportionate to their tyrosine contents.</p>

                                    <h4>Foreignness</h4>
                                    <p>The immune system normally discriminates between self and nonself, so that only molecules that are foreign to the host are immunogenic. Hence, albumin isolated from the serum of a rabbit and injected back in to the same or another rabbit will not yield an immune response. Every rabbit is tolerant to this endogenous protein. Yet the same protein, if injected in to other vertebrate species, is likely to evoke substantial antibody responses.</p>

                            <h3 id="method-of-administration">Method of administration</h3>
                            <p>Whether a substance will evoke an immune response also depends on the dose and mode of administration. A quantity of substance that has no effect when injected intravenously may evoke antibody response when injected subcutaneous particularly if it is accompanied by an adjuvant.</p>

                            <p>Many antibodies can be isolated in the gamma globulin fraction of protein by electrophoresis separation. The term immunoglobulin, however, has replaced gamma globulin because not all antibodies have gamma electrophoresis mobility. Antibodies can be found in blood plasma or serum and in many body fluids such as tears, saliva and colostrums.</p>
                            <p>The primary function of an antibody in body defenses is to combine with antigen, which may be enough to neutralize bacterial toxins or some viruses. A secondary interaction of an antibody molecule with another effector agent such as complement is usually required to dispose of larger antigens such as bacteria.</p>

                            <p>There are two types of antibodies: complete and incomplete antibodies.</p>

                            <h3 id="basic-structure">4.3.1 Basic Structure of an Immunoglobulin</h3>
                            <p>Immunoglobulins are made up polypeptide chain held together by disulphide bond. Each half of the molecule consists of one heavy (long) chain and one light (short) chain.</p>
                            <p>The heavy (H) chain is roughly twice as large as the light (L) chain. Therefore a monomer molecule of immunoglobulin is composed of four polypeptide chain; a pair of two identical H and L chain. Every immunoglobulin contains equal number of heavy and light chain and can be represented by the general formula $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{L}_2)_n$.</p>
                            <p>All of the light chains and all of the heavy chains in any single immunoglobulin protein are identical. In both heavy and light chains, this variability is confined largely to the N-terminal; where as the sequence of the other domains remain relatively constant. For this reason, the N-terminal in a heavy or light chain polypeptide is called the variable region $\mathsf{V}^{\mathsf{H}}$ and $\mathsf{V}^{\mathsf{L}}$, respectively. The other domains are collectively termed as the constant region $\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{H}}$ and $\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{L}}$.</p>
                            <p>Light chain polypeptide contain only a single $C_L$ domain but heavy chain $C_H$ regions comprise 3 or more domain which are numbered sequentially (CH1, CH2, --- etc) beginning with the domain closest to $V_H$. In overall, the protein has a T or Y shaped configuration when viewed schematically. The region at the base of each arm in the T or Y located between the CH, and $CH_2$ domain is called the hinge region in most immunoglobulin. The hinge region confers flexibility, enabling the two arms to move relatively freely with respect to each other.</p>

                            <h4>Types of light chain</h4>
                            <p>All light chains have protein with molecular weight of about 23,000 and can be classified in to two distinct types, kappa (k) and lambda (λ), on the basis of their constant light region sequence. There is no known functional difference between these two types. A given immunoglobulin molecule always contains exclusively either k or λ chains never a mixture. Similarly, any given B-lineage cell produces only one type of light chain.</p>
                            <p>The proportion of K to λ chain in the entire population of immunoglobulin in an individual is about 2:1 but it may vary from species to species.</p>

                            <h4>Types of heavy chain</h4>
                            <p>Human express five different classes of immunoglobulin heavy chains, which differ considerably in their constant heavy region, which in turn result difference in their physical and biologic properties. All of the heavy chains in a given immunoglobulin molecule are identical. The heavy chain polypeptides range in molecular weight from about 50,000-70,000.</p>
                            <p>The classes of heavy chains are designated as μ, δ, α, γ and ε. The immunoglobulins that contain these heavy chains are designated as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA & IgE, classes, respectively.</p>
                            <p>On the basis of relative minor difference in constant heavy region, they are sub divided as $\gamma 1,2,3,4$, $\alpha 1$ and $\alpha_{2}$. The corresponding immunoglobulin subclasses are denoted as IgG, IgG$_2$, IgG$_3$, IgG$_4$, IgA$_1$, & IgA$_2$. Normal individuals express all these nine classes and subclasses because each is encoded by a separate genetic locus and inherited independently.</p>

                            <h3 id="function-regions">4.3.2 Function of Different Regions of Immunoglobulins</h3>
                            <p>Immunoglobulin chains are cleaved by proteolytic enzyme like papain. These enzymes split an immunoglobulin molecule in to three fragments of roughly similar size.</p>
                            <p>Two of the fragments are identical to one another and each consists of an entire light chain, the variable heavy and constant heavy $(\mathrm{CH}^{1})$ domains of one heavy chain, these fragments thus contain the antigen binding sites of the protein called antigen- binding fragment (Fab fragments). Each basic four-chain unit contains two separate but identical antigen binding sites called divalent.</p>
                            <p>The third fragment comprises the carboxyl terminal portions of both heavy chains held together by disulfide bond, it is designated by crystallizable or Fc fragment. The structure of this third fragment is identical for many different immunoglobulin molecules.</p>
                            <p>Most of the secondary biologic properties of immunoglobulin such as the ability to activate complement are determined by sequence in the Fc region of the protein. This is also the region that is recognized by the Fc receptors found on many types of cells.</p>

                            <h3 id="classes-of-immunoglobulins">4.3.3 Classes of Immunoglobulins</h3>
                            <p>Five distinct classes of immunoglobulin molecules are recognized in most higher mammals: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. These immunoglobulin classes differ from each other in characteristics such as molecular weight, sedimentation coefficient between classes, the immunoglobulins vary with in each class.</p>

                                    <h4>Immunoglobulin G (IgG)</h4>
                                    <p>The major immunoglobulin in normal serum is IgG. It accounts approximately 75% of the total serum immunoglobulin. An IgG molecule consists of two light chain and two heavy chains linked by disulphide bonds. Because it has two identical antigens binding site it is said to be divalent. This immunoglobulin diffuses more readily than other immunoglobulins in to the extra vascular spaces, and it neutralizes toxins and binds to microorganisms in to the extra vascular spaces. It is the only class of immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta, and it is responsible for protection of the newborn during the first months of life. In addition, when IgG complexes are formed, complement can be activated.</p>

                                    <h4>Immunoglobulin M (IgM)</h4>
                                    <p>IgM constitutes approximately 10% of normal serum immunoglobulin. It is the largest of all immunoglobulins, which consists of five monomers joined together by a J-chain in to a pentamer. It has ten antigen binding sites. This antibody is produced early in an immune response and is largely confined intravascularly because of its large size. IgM is effective in agglutination and cytolysis reactions. In human it is found in smaller concentrations than IgG and IgA.</p>

                                    <h4>Immunoglobulin A (IgA)</h4>
                                    <p>IgA represents 15% to 20% of the total circulatory Immunoglobulin pool. It is the predominant immunoglobulin in secretions such as tears, saliva, colostrums, milk, and intestinal secretions. IgA is synthesized largely by plasma cells located on body surface. If cells in the intestinal wall produce the IgA, it may pass directly into the intestinal lumen or diffuse into the blood circulation. As IgA is transported through intestinal epithelial cells or hepatocytes, it binds to a glycoprotein called the secretary piece; it protects IgA from digestion by gastrointestinal proteolytic enzymes and forms a complex molecule named secretary IgA. Secretary IgA is of critical importance in protecting body surfaces against invading microorganisms. It provides external surface of the body with protection from microorganisms. IgA has two subclasses (IgA₁ and IgA₂), which are expressed in a 5:1 ratio in the blood and have similar properties. Unlike IgG, IgA do not activate complement and unable to cross the placental barrier.</p>

                                    <p>IgE is a monomer, which occurs, in minute quantity, 0.004%, in the blood plasma of parasitized individuals. IgE is of major importance because it mediate some types of hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions and generally responsible for an individual's immunity to invading parasites. The IgE molecule is unique in that it binds strongly to a receptor on mast cells and basophiles. Together with antigen, mediates the release of histamines and heparin from these cells.</p>

                            <p>There are four subclasses of immunoglobulin molecule namely IgG₁, IgG₂, IgG₃ & IgG₄. These subclasses differ in their heavy chain composition and in some of their characteristics such as biologic activities.</p>

                            <p>The immune system is composed of a large and complex set of widely distributed elements. The specific recognition system is ultimately composed of receptors on T and B-lymphocytes the only specific components of the immune mechanism. The immune system also has a nonspecific effector mechanism that usually amplifies the specific functions. The nonspecific features include the complement system. The complement system is a heat-labile series of more than 18 plasma proteins. Normally, these proteins are in an inactive form, but specific signal can activate the first protein of the team.</p>

                            <h3 id="complement-activation">4.4.1 Complement Activation</h3>
                            <p>Activation of complement system can be initiated by either an antigen antibody complex or by variety of foreign surfaces; there are two major pathways for complement activation the classical and alternate pathway.</p>

                            <h4 id="classic-pathway">Classic path way</h4>
                            <p>The principal component of the classic path way is $C_1$ through $C_9$. The sequence of complement activation does not follow the expected numerical order. The sequence is $C_{1,4,2,3,5,6,7,8, \text{ & } 9}$.</p>
                            <p>$C_3$ is present in the plasma in the largest quantities; fixation of $C_3$ is the major quantitative reaction of the complement cascade.</p>
                            <p>The classic path way is initiated by the complexing of antigen to its specific antibody, either IgM or IgG, and is the primary amplifier of the biologic effects of humoral immunity.</p>
                            <p>The classic pathway is composed of three stages:</p>

                            <p>The recognition unit of the complement system is the Cl complex Clq, Clr and Cls, an interlocking enzyme system. The Cl complex is a unique feature of the classic pathway subcomponent binds directly to an immunoglobulin molecule. The other two subcomponents, Clr and Cls, do not bind to the immunoglobulin but are involved in subsequent activation of the classic pathway.</p>
                            <p>A single IgM molecule is potentially able to fix Cl, but at least a pair of IgG molecules is required for this purpose.</p>
                            <p>Clr and Cls activate each other and in turn, $C_4$ and $C_2$, splitting each into two fragments. One of the $C_4$ fragments and one of the $C_2$ fragments combine to form $C_3$ convertase ($C_4b2b$) & activate C3, cleaving in to fragments called $C_3a$ and $C_3b$. $C_3a$ is a powerful opsonin and $C_3b$ is an anapylatoxin. $C_3b$ forms a complex with $C_{4b2b}$, producing a new enzyme, $C_5$ convertase, which cleaves $C_5$ chemo tactic factors. $C_{5b}$ binds to $C_6$ and $C_7$ to form a complex that insert into the membrane bilayer. $C_8$ then binds to the $C_{5h} / C_6 / C_7$ complex followed by the polymerization of up to $16_{C9}$ molecules to produce the membrane attack complex that causes cytolysis.</p>

                            <h4 id="alternative-pathway">Alternative Pathway</h4>
                            <p>Alternate pathway is a non-antibody initiated pathway. Microbial and mammalian cells surface can activate the alternate pathway in the absence of specific antigen antibody complexes. The alternate pathway shows points of similarity with the classic sequence. Both pathways generate a $C_3$ convertase that activate $C_3$ to provide the pivotal event in the final common pathway of both systems.</p>
                            <p>A key feature of the alternate pathway is that the first three proteins of the classic activation pathway $C_1$, $C_4$, and $C_2$ do not participate in the cascade sequence. $C_3$ component is activated by means of complement proteins: factor B, which resembles $C_2$; factor D, similar with $C_1$ and properdin.</p>
                            <p>The activator of the alternate pathway, properdin, catalyzes the activation of $C_3$. The uptake of factor B on to $C_{3b}$ occurs when $C_{3b}$ is bound to an activator surface. $C_{3b}$ and factor B combine to from $C_{3b}$, B, which is converted into an active $C_3$ convertase, $C_{3b}$, B. Which is converted in to an active $C_3$ convertase. C3b, Bb. This result from the loss of a small fragment, Ba, through the action of the enzyme, factor D. The C3b, Bb complex is able to convert more C3 to C3b, which binds more factor B.</p>
                            <p>C3b, Bb complex decays due to the loss of Bb with a half-life of approximately five minutes. However, if properdin (P) binds to C3b, Bb, forming C3b, Bbp, and the half-life is extended to 30 minutes.</p>
                            <p>The association of numerous C3b units, factor Bb and properdin on the surface of an aggregate of protein on the surface of a microorganism has a potent activity as a C5 convertase with the cleavage of C5, the remainder of the complement cascade continues as in the classic pathway.</p>

                            <p>Heating at $56^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes can inactivate complements. Aging, especially at room temperature leads to almost complete deterioration within a day or two and even in the refrigerator, considerable loss of activity occurs in 3-4 days. Complement may be destroyed by violet shaking for 20-25 minutes, by some acids and alkalis; ether and soaps. As a result all glassware must be chemically clean, although not necessarily sterile. Complements may be preserved for long periods by freezing and storing at low temperature e.g. lyophilization.</p>
