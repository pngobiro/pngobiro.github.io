                            <p>Precipitins can be produced against most proteins and some carbohydrates and carbohydrates- lipid complexes. Various system are available in which precipitation tests are performed in semisolid media such as agar or agarose, or nongel support medium such as cellulose acetate. Agar has been found to interfere with the migration of charged particles and has been largely replaced as an immunodiffusion medium by agarose. Agarose is a transparent, colorless, neutral gel. In the clinical laboratory several applications of the precipitation reaction are used. These methods include:</p>

                                    <p>Antibody dilutions and specific soluble antigens are placed in adjacent wells. If the well size and shape, distance between wells, temperature, and incubation time are optimal, these solutions diffuse out, bind to each other, cross-link, and form a visible precipitate at the point of equivalence perpendicular to the axis line between the wells. The precipitation bands will be compared with a standard antigen.</p>

                            <p>The precise location of the band depends on the concentration and rate of diffusion of antigen and antibody. In a condition of antibody excess, the band will be located nearer the antigen well. If two antigens are present in the solution that can be recognized by the antibody, two precipitin bands form independently.</p>
                            <p>Antibodies associated with autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus can be identified by double diffusion.</p>

                            <h4>Electroimmunodiffusion (EID)</h4>
                            <p>EID is a variation of the double immunodiffusion reaction in a support medium such as cellulose acetate or agarose through the use of an electric current that enhances the mobility of reactants and increase their movement towards each other.</p>
                            <p>Antibody is placed in the well favoring its migration in the direction of the cathode; antigens that tend to be more negatively charged and placed in the well that favors migration of the anode. Precipitin bands form at a point of equivalence in a shorter periods of time.</p>
                            <p>Electro immunodiffusion method, like immunodiffusion procedures, are classified into one-or-two-dimensional, singles, or double diffusion when a voltage is applied across the gels to move the antigens and antibodies together, immuno-double diffusion becomes counter current immuno electrophoresis (CIE) radial immunodiffusion (RID) becomes electro immunoassay (EIA).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Counter Current immunoelectrophoresis (CIE)</strong> is a variation of the classic precipitin procedure; it merely adds an electrical current to help antigens and antibodies move towards each other more quickly than in simple diffusion. The procedure takes advantage of the net electric charge of the antigens and antibodies being tested in a particular test buffer. Variables such as types of gel, amount of current, a concentration of antigen and antibody must be carefully controlled for maximum reactivity. The sensitivity of CIE is 10 to 20 times greater than in immuno-double diffusion; however, it is more expensive than other techniques such as immunodiffusion</p>

                            <p>Antigens may be quantitated by electrophoresis than in an antibody-containing gel electroimmunoassay. This technique combines the speed of electrophoresis with the accuracy and sensitivity of radioimmunoassay.</p>

                            <p>Precipitation and agglutination are the visible expression of the aggregation of antigens and antibodies through the formation of a framework in which antigen particles or molecules alternate with antibody molecules.</p>
                            <p>Agglutination of particles to which soluble antigen has been absorbed produces a serum method of demonstrating precipitins. Example of artificial carriers includes latex particles and colloidal charcoal. Cells unrelated to the antigen, such as erythrocytes coated with antigen in a constant amount can be used as a biologic carriers. Whole bacterial cells can contain an antigen that will bind with antibodies produced in response to that antigen when it was introduced into the host.</p>
                            <p>Agglutination tests are easy to perform and in some cases are the most sensitive tests currently available. These tests have a wide range of applications in the clinical diagnosis of noninfectious immune disorders and infectious diseases.</p>

                                    <p>In latex agglutination procedures, antibody molecules can be bound to the surface of latex beads. Many antibody molecules can be bound to each latex particle, increasing the potential number of exposed antigen-binding sites. If an antigen is present in a test specimen, the antigen will bind to the combining sites of the antibody exposed on the surface of the latex heads, forming visible cross-linked aggregates of latex beads and antigen. In some test systems, latex particles can be coated with antigen. In the presence of serum antibodies, these particles agglutinate in to large visible clumps.</p>

                            <h4>Direct bacterial agglutination</h4>
                            <p>Direct whole pathogens can be used to detect antibodies directed against pathogens. The most basic tests are those that measure the antibody produced by the host to determinants on the surface of a bacterial agent in response to infection with that bacterium. In a thick suspension of the bacteria, the binding of specific antibodies to surface antigens of the bacteria causes the bacteria to clump together in visible aggregates. This type agglutination is called bacterial agglutination. Because tube testing allows more time for antigen-antibody reaction, it is considered to be more sensitive than slide testing.</p>

                            <h4>Indirect or passive hemagglutination</h4>
                            <p>Hemagglutination is agglutination of red blood cells, and tests for antibody detection. In the indirect or passive hemagglutination technique, erythrocytes are coated with substances such as extracts of bacterial cells, protozoa or purified polysaccharides or proteins.</p>
                            <p>Erythrocyte of animals such as sheep or rabbits, or from group "O" humans, function as carrier for detecting and titrating the corresponding antibodies by agglutination. This technique is called indirect or passive hemagglutination testing because it is not the antigen of the erythrocytes themselves but the passively attached antigens that are bound by antibody. For example, in rubella antibody test, erythrocytes are coated with rubella antigen. In the presence of antibody, agglutination occurs.</p>

                            <h4>Hemagglutination Inhibition technique</h4>
                            <p>Hemagglutination inhibition test is used to detect some viral antibodies, for example, rubella. A known quantity of rubella viral antigen is mixed with dilutions of the patient's serum, to which red blood cells are added. If the serum lacks antibody, the virus will spontaneously attach to the red cells, link together, and agglutinate. If antibody to the virus is present, all of the virus particles will be bound by antibody, which prevents or inhibits hemagglutination. The serum is therefore positive for the antibodies. The highest dilution of serum that totally inhibits agglutination of red cells determines the antibody titer of the serum.</p>

                            <p>Complement fixation is a classic method for demonstrating the presence of antibody in serum. This method consists of two components. The first component is an indicator system consisting of a combination of sheep red cells; complement-fixing antibody produced against the sheep red cells in another animal, and an exogenous source of complement, usually guinea pig serum. When these three components are combined in an optimal concentration, the antisheep cell antibody, hemolysin, can bind to the surface of the red cells. Complement can subsequently bind to this antigen antibody complex and cause cell lysis. The second component consists of a known antigen and patient serum, which are added to a suspension of sheep erythrocytes, hemolysin, and a complement.</p>
                            <p>The two components of the complement fixation procedure are tested in sequence. Patient serum is first added to the known antigen, and complement is added to the solution. If the serum contains antibody to the antigen, the resulting antigen antibody complexes will bind all of the complement. Sheep red cells and hemolysin are then added. If complement has not been bound by an antigen antibody complex formed from the patient serum and known antigen, it is available to bind to the indicator system of indicates both a lack of antibody and a negative complement fixation test. If the patient's serum does contain a complement fixing antibody apposite result will be demonstrated by the lack of haemolysis.</p>

                                    <dd>The concentration of salt in the reaction medium has an effect on antibody uptake by the membrane bound erythrocyte antigens. Sodium and chloride ions in solution have inhibition effect. These ions cluster around and partially neutralize the opposite charges on antigen and antibody molecules, which hinders the association of antibody with antigen. Reducing or lowering the ionic strength of a reaction medium such as low-ionic strength salt can enhance antibody uptake.</dd>

                                    <dd>Bonding of an antigen to an antibody takes place because of the formation of multiple, reversible, intermolecular attraction between an antigen and amino acids of the binding site. The bonding of antigen to antibody is exclusively non covalent. The attractive force of noncovalent bonds is weak when compared to covalent bonds, but the formation of multiple non covalent bonds produces considerable total- binding energy. The strength of a single antigen- antibody bond is termed antibody affinity.</dd>
