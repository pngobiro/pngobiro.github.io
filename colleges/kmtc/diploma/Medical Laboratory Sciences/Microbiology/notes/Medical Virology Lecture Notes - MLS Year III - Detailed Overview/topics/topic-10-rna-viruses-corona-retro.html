                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The Coronaviridae family includes several viral species that can infect vertebrates - dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, rodents, and poultry. The name (corona, as in wreath or crown) refers to the appearance of the viruses. "Spikes", with club or drumstick-like swellings, are located at regular, relatively generous intervals on the pleomorphic envelope.</p>
                            
                            <p>One coronavirus species (human coronavirus, HuCV) is known to be a human pathogen. It has at least two serotypes and probably a number of serological variants. In November 2002, a new coronavirus emerged in China and, after originally being mistaken as a new influenza recombinant, was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in spring 2003. Its origin, possibly from animals, is not known to date.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>Common cold-coronaviruses cause an everyday variety of respiratory infections, which are restricted to the ciliated epithelia of the nose and trachea. They are responsible for about 30% of common cold infections.</p>
                            
                            <p>The immunity conferred by infection, apparently IgA-dependent, is short lived. Reinfections are therefore frequent, whereby the antigenic variability of the virus may be a contributing factor. Various enteral coronaviruses with morphologies similar to the respiratory types have also been described in humans. Their pathogenicity, and hence their contribution to diarrhea, has not been clarified.</p>
                            
                            <p>The SARS virus is transmitted aerogenically with an incubation time of two to 10 days. Clinically, fever and a marked shortness of breath is noted, developing into a severe atypical pneumonia with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. Shedding of virus is by respiratory discharges. Whether the virus present in other body fluids and excreta plays a decisive role for virus transmission is not yet clear.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>The common-cold coronavirus can be grown in organ cultures of human tracheal tissue or in human diploid cells. Isolating the viruses for diagnostic purposes is not routine. Serodiagnosis (complement-binding reaction, immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassay) and electron microscopy are feasible methods. The SARS virus can be identified by PCR or isolated in the Vero cell line.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology and prevention</h3>
                            <p>Transmission of the virus is by droplets, but close contact ("household transmission") with possibly other routes of transmission seems important. The only preventive measure to date is exposure prevention. Under therapy with ribavirin and intensive care, mortality of SARS is around 10%.</p>

                            <p>Retroviridae family is the classification for all RNA viruses with reverse transcription of RNA to DNA in their reproductive cycles (RNA-dependent DNA synthesis).

This virus family includes seven genera, of which, three play significant roles in human medicine.</p>

                            <p>A human pathogen retrovirus was isolated for the first time in 1980 from adults suffering from T-cell leukemias. It was designated as HTLV I (human T-cell leukemia virus). A short time later, a virus was isolated from hairy cell leukemia patients and named HTLV II. HTLV I is found in adults with T-cell malignancy as well as in patients with neurological diseases (myelopathies). HTLV II appears to be associated with T-cell malignancy and other lymphoproliferative diseases. Its own etiological role is still under discussion.</p>

                            <h3>Genomic Organization</h3>
                            <p>HIV has just nine genes (compared to more than 500 genes in a bacterium, and around 20,000-30,000 in a human). Three of the HIV genes, called gag, pol and env, contain information needed to make structural proteins for new virus particles. The other six genes, known as tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr and vpu, code for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect a cell, produce new copies of virus, or cause disease. At either end of each strand of RNA there is a sequence called the long terminal repeat which helps to control HIV replication.</p>

The dead vaccine type is recommended for polio. Live vaccine materials should generally not be used in persons showing AIDS symptoms.</p>
