                            <p>The family Paramyxoviridae is a heterogeneous, both in its biology and pathogenic properties. It is divided into two subfamilies:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Paramyxovirinae</strong> with the genera Paramyxovirus with the human pathogen species parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. Rubulavirus with the mumps virus and parainfluenza virus types 2 and 4. Morbillivirus with the human pathogen measles virus and several zoopathic species that cause severe respiratory infections in various animal species (dogs cats, cattle, seals, dolphins, turtles). The nonclassified, closely related zoopathic and human pathogen Hendra and Nipah viruses.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pneumovirinae</strong>, genus Pneumovirus, probably with several types of RS viruses (respiratory syncytial virus).</p>

                            <h3>Structure of the Paramyxoviruses</h3>
                            <p>All paramyxoviruses have a similar structure, they are pleomorphic. The smallest forms are $120–150\text{ nm}$ in size (with the exception of the somewhat smaller RS virus). They also possess an envelope that encloses the nucleocapsid. The envelope is derived from the cell membrane. The genome consists of a continuous, single-stranded antisense RNA. Various viral proteins are integrated in the envelope, visible in the form of spikes.</p>

                            <p>The generic taxons are based on these spikes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">parainfluenza and mumps viruses have two types of spikes, one containing the hemagglutinin (i.e., possessing hemagglutination activity) coupled with neuraminidase (HN protein), and the other the so-called fusion (F) protein, responsible for fusion of the envelope with the cell membrane.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Measles viruses contain no neuraminidase</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>The <strong>parainfluenza viruses</strong> cause flulike infections, mainly in small children, which occasionally progress to bronchitis or even pneumonia. Occasionally, a dangerous croup syndrome develops. Bacterial superinfections are frequent, as are the usually harmless reinfections.</p>
                            
                            <p>In <strong>mumps virus</strong> infections, the virus first replicates in the respiratory tract, then causes a viremia, after which a parotitis is the main development as well as, fairly frequently, mumps meningitis. Complications include infection of various glandular organs. Orchitis can occur in post puberty boys who contract mumps.</p>
                            
                            <p>The pathogenesis of <strong>measles</strong> has not been fully explained. It is assumed that the virus, following primary replication in lymphoid tissues, is distributed hematogenously. Thereafter the oral mucosa displays an enanthem and the tiny white “Koplik’s spots”. Then the fever once again rises and the typical measles exanthem manifests. Possible complications include otitis in the form of a bacterial superinfection as well as pneumonia and encephalitis. A rare late sequel of measles (one case per million inhabitants) is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in which nucleocapsids accumulate in brain cells, whereby few or no viral progeny are produced for lack of matrix protein. This disease occurs between the ages of one and 20, involves loss of memory and personality changes, and usually results in death within six to 12 months.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nipah and Hendra virus</strong> infections are zoonoses endemic to Southeast Asia (Nipah) or Australia (Hendra). Both infections result in encephalitis with relatively high lethality rates (up to 40%) and in some cases severe interstitial pneumonias.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>RS viruses</strong> cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia, mainly in children up to six months of age, or rarely up to two years. Immune status appears to play an important role in the course of the infection. It has been determined that the course of the disease is more severe in children who have received dead vaccine material (similarly to measles). This is presumably due to antibodies, in the case of small children the mother's antibodies acquired by diaplacental transport. Immunosuppressed patients, for instance, bone marrow recipients, are also at risk for RSV.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                            <p>Paramyxoviruses are transmitted by droplet infection. Generalized contamination levels in the population (except for Nipah and Hendra) are already very high in childhood (90% in 10-year-old children for parainfluenza virus types 1–3). Nipah and Hendra viruses are zoonoses that are transmitted to humans from animals (Nipah: pigs, Hendra: horses). Various different animals can be infected by these pathogens, but bats (Pteropus) appear to be the natural reservoir for both viruses.</p>

                            <h3>Prevention</h3>
                            <p>Attenuated live vaccines are available for measles and mumps. The dead vaccine should not be used due to the aggravating effect mentioned above. No vaccines have as yet been developed for the other parainfluenza viruses.</p>

                            <p>The rhabdoviruses of significance in human medicine are classified in seven genotypes. Type 1 is the classic, worldwide type that occurs in two forms: the "street virus" isolated from humans and animals and the "virus fixe" according to Pasteur. In 1882, Pasteur had transmitted the virus intracerebrally to rabbits. Following repeated passages of the virus in the rabbits, he had developed a dead vaccine type. Due to the brain-to-brain passages in the laboratory animals, the "virus fixe" became so highly adapted to brain tissue that it was unable to replicate in extraneural tissues. Types 2-4 were isolated from African bats, types 5 and 6 from European bats, and type 7 from Australian bats.</p>
                            
                            <p>Rhabdoviruses are rodlike with one end flat and one end rounded ("bulletshaped") and a spiked envelope surrounding a nucleocapsid similar to that of the myxoviruses. The genome consists of antisense strand RNA</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>Rabies viruses are almost always transmitted by the bite, sometimes also the scratch, of a rabid animal. The virus at first replicates at the portal of entry in muscle and connective tissue, then wanders along the nerve cells into the CNS, where more viral replication takes place. Using the same route, the virus then disseminates from the CNS into peripheral organs, above all the salivary glands, cornea, and kidneys. The primary clinical picture is anencephalitis with lethal outcome for humans and animals.</p>

                            <h4>Clinical Course of Rabies</h4>
                            <p>The disease goes through three stages.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">The initial, or <strong>prodromal</strong>, stage involves itching and burning at the portal of entry (bite wound), nausea, vomiting, and possibly a melancholy mood.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">In the second or <strong>excitative</strong> stage, cramps and spasms of the pharynx and larynx are the main symptoms, rendering swallowing very painful. The spasms can be induced by the mere sight of water ("hydrophobia"). Other mild acoustic and visual stimuli may elicit exaggerated reactions including attacks of cramps and violent anger, hitting, biting, and screaming. Death occurs within three to four days at the earliest.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">The third, <strong>paralytic</strong>, stage may develop instead of early death, with ascending paralysis and asphyxia, leading to exitus.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>Therapy is exclusively symptomatic. Since the patient experiences the disease in a fully conscious state, most of the medication serves to alleviate the pain and anxiety states. The disease runs essentially the same course in humans and animals, whereby the behavior of animals is often radically altered: wild animals lose their fear of humans and tame pets become aggressive. Rabies with the excitative stage is known as "furious rabies," without it as "dumb rabies."</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>It is usually made on the basis of clinical signs. There are no tests to confirm rabies with absolute certainty while the patient is still alive. Viruses can be detected by laboratory investigation of the patient's brain after death. The test is not usually carried out in countries with few resources.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                            <p>Lyssavirus type 1 is endemic to North America and Europe in wild animals (sylvatic rabies) and in certain tropical areas in domestic pets as well, in particular dogs (urban rabies). The reservoir for the remaining lyssavirus types are bloodsucking (hemovorous) as well as fructivorous and insectivorous bats. The virus is excreted with the saliva of the diseased or terminal incubator animal and enters other animals or humans through scratch or bite wounds. The virus is highly labile, so transmission on contaminated objects is very rare. Human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed with the exception of cases in which rabies in corneal donors had gone unnoticed.</p>

                                    <p>Immediately after a dog bite, you should thoroughly clean and flush the wound with soap and water, detergent, or a substance that kills viruses, such as 70% alcohol, tincture of aqueous solution of iodine, or povidone iodine. Continue flushing the wound for at least 15 minutes. The wound should not be sutured (stitched) unless this is essential to stop heavy bleeding. If stitches are required, the wound should not be sutured until after post-exposure prophylaxis has occurred.</p>

                            <h3>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)</h3>
                            <p>If a person is bitten by a dog in countries where rabies is endemic, there is no way of being certain that the animal is free from rabies. The bitten person should be given post-exposure prophylaxis as soon as possible after the bite. Every year, around 15 million people receive this treatment worldwide, preventing an estimated 327,000 human deaths from rabies</p>

                            <p>The Marburg virus was isolated for the first time in 1967 as a result of three simultaneous outbreaks among laboratory staff in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Belgrade. The infection victims had been processing the organs of Cercopithecus (African green monkeys) from Uganda. Both the Marburg and Ebola viruses are threadlike, $14\ \mu\text{m}$-long viral particles, in some cases branched and $80\ \text{nm}$ thick in diameter. Their surface consists of an envelope of host-cell membrane with viral spikes. The genome consists of antisense strand RNA in a helical nucleocapsid $50\ \text{nm}$ in diameter.</p>
