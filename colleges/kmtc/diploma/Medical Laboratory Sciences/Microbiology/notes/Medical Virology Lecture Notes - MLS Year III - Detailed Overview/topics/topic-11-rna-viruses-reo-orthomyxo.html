                            <p>The name reovirus is derived from the abbreviation for respiratory enteric orphan virus, recalling that no diseases were associated with the virus upon its discovery (hence "orphan virus"). All of the viruses in the family Reoviridae possess a double icosahedral capsid. It contains the segmented RNA genome, comprising from 10 to 12 double-stranded subunits depending on the species.</p>

                            <h3>Family Reoviridae</h3>
                            <p>The family Reoviridae includes, in addition to phytopathogenic and zoopathogenic strains, three genera in which human pathogens are classified:</p>

                            <p>The rotaviral genome consists of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA. Each segment codes for one viral protein. Some segments in other reoviruses code for two or three proteins.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <h4>Coltiviruses</h4>
                            <p>Colorado tick fever usually runs a mild course with fever, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting, rarely encephalitis.</p>

                            <h4>Reoviruses</h4>
                            <p>Implication in diseases is still uncertain. It appears they are capable of infecting the respiratory and intestinal tracts of children. The fact that they are also found very frequently in asymptomatic persons makes it difficult to correlate them with specific clinical pictures.</p>

                            <h4>Rotaviruses</h4>
                            <p>In the mid-seventies these viruses were recognized as diarrhea-causing viruses in infants and small children. They are the most frequent cause of diarrhea in children aged six months to two years. It was recently discovered that they also play a role in infections of the elderly, and above all in immunosuppressed patients (e.g., bone marrow transplant patients), and can cause severe clinical pictures in these groups. Rotaviruses enter the body per os or by droplet infection, replicate in the villi of the small intestine and cause diarrhea, potentially resulting in exsiccosis.</p>

An elegant typing method for the different rotavirus strains involves analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the 11 dsRNA strands of the viral genome.</span>

                            <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                            <p>Humans are the sole natural reservoir of rotaviruses. Generalized contamination is practically 100% when children reach school age, but carriers and reinfections are still possible despite immunity. Diarrheal infections are among the most important causes of death in small children in developing countries; 20% of these infections are due to rotaviruses. Rotaviruses remain viable for long periods on objects and skin (hands!) and are therefore spread rapidly by infected persons and healthy carriers. The most effective prophylactic approach is to practice stringent hygiene.</p>

                            <p>The family has one genus, Influenza virus. Influenza virus has three types: influenza A, B, and C. Influenza A is the most important and most frequently observed influenza virus. It repeatedly causes epidemics and even pandemics at greater intervals. In contrast, influenza B tends to persist in endemic form and causes few outbreaks. Influenza C is rarely isolated, most frequently in youths. It plays on a minor role as an infective pathogen.</p>

                            <h3>Structure</h3>
                            <p>All influenza viruses show the same and a pronounced pleomorphism. The genome of the influenza viruses is segmented and comprises eight separate antisenses RNA strands each of which codes for one specific protein. Together with the nucleoprotein, they form the helical nucleocapsid. Closely association with this structure is the RNA polymerase complex, which consists of three high-molecular-weight proteins with different functions. The nucleocapsid itself is embedded in a protein (so-called membrane or matrix protein). The virus is enclosed by an envelope made of cell membrane lipids with viral protein inclusions (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, responsible for infectivity and viral progeny release). Both proteins are seen under the electron microscope as protrusions ("spikes") on the virus surface.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>Aerogenically transmitted influenza viruses normally replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx, resulting in a pharyngitis or at most a tracheobronchitis, after an IP of 24-72 hours. Pulmonary dissemination of the infection can result from an upper respiratory infection or manifest without one, whereby the prognosis in the latter case is less favorable. Pneumonia caused solely by the influenza virus is rare. As a rule, bacterial superinfections with staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, or Haemophilus bacteria are responsible. These infections, which used to be the normal cause of influenza deaths (Haemophilus influenzae in the "Spanish flu" of 1918), can be controlled with antibiotics.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>Throat lavages and swabs provide suitable material. The latter must be placed in a suitable transport medium without delay to prevent them from drying out. Influenza viruses can be grown and isolated in cell cultures if the diagnostic specimen is obtained very early, i.e., in the first one or two days of the infection. Identification of the cultured viruses is achieved based on the hemagglutinating properties of the myxoviruses in the hemagglutination inhibition test or by means of immunofluorescence. If the specimen was obtained too late for virus isolation, a diagnosis can be arrived at by serological means, whereby a rise in the antibody titer of patient serum proves infection.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                            <p>Influenza A viruses are genetically variable. Slight antigenic changes are the general rule (antigenic drift, quasispecies) and are explained by selection of point mutants in the hemagglutinin under immunological pressure. More profound changes (antigenic shifts) explain the periodic occurrence of influenza A epidemics and pandemics.</p>

                            <h3>Prevention and therapy</h3>
                            <p>An inactivated adsorbate vaccine and some split vaccines (new: intranasal application) are available for influenza prophylaxis. The vaccine is recommended especially for persons whose occupation exposes them to such infections as well as persons with cardiovascular problems in their medical histories. The therapeutic options include amantadine, which inhibits the viral uncoating process, and more recently neuraminidase inhibitors. These substances shorten the duration of illness by blocking the release of the viruses from the host cells and their further dissemination in the body.</p>
