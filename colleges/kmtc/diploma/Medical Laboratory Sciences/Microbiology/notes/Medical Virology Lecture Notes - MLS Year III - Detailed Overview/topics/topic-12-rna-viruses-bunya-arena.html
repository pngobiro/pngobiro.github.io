                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The family Bunyaviridae comprises over 200 viral species, among them four human pathogen genera: Bunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, and Hantavirus. Bunyaviruses are spherical, $80 - 110\text{ nm}$ in size, and posses envelopes with spikes formed on membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The genome consists of three antisense-strand RNA segments, whereby each segment produces a separate ribonucleoprotein complex, resulting in a unique feature of the virion: it contains three helical nucleocapsids.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and Clinical Picture</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Genus Bunyavirus:</h4>
                            <p>These viruses are transmitted by arthropods. They cause benign forms of encephalitis e.g. California Encephalitis Virus.</p>

                            <h4>Genus Nairovirus:</h4>
                            <p>The main human pathogen in this group is the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, with lethality rate as high as 50%. The virus is endemic to southeastern Europe, Central Asia, China, Saudi Arabia, and Africa and is transmitted by ticks as well as by direct contact with infected animals or patients.</p>

                            <h4>Genus Phlebovirus:</h4>
                            <p>This group includes the pathogens that cause the benign Pappataci or phlebotomus fever ("sandfly fever"), which occurs in Europe (Italy, Yugoslavia), North Africa, Asia, and South America and is transmitted by the phlebotomus sandfly. Rift Valley fever (RVF), an acute, febrile disease, rarely also involving hemorrhagic fever, is transmitted by mosquitoes and is endemic to Africa, usually following epizooties in livestock, in which case aerosol infection occurs (slaughtering). Epidemics have been reported with over 200,000 cases in Egypt and 25,000 cases in Senegal. Further epidemics have occurred in Somalia, Kenya, and Sudan.</p>

                            <h4>Genus Hantavirus:</h4>
                            <p>This genus includes several viral species (or serotypes) that can be classified into two groups according to the clinical symptoms they cause. The pathogens of nephropathica epidemica (NE), and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).</p>
                            
                            <p>The sources of infection are rodents (mice and rats). The infection is acquired by inhaling aerosols of urine, feces, and animal saliva. In NE and HFRS, a renal dysfunction follows the influenza like symptoms. HPS infection results in a rapidly progressive, acute dyspnea with pulmonary edema and is lethal in 60% of cases.</p>

                            <h4>Serotypes of Hantaviruses</h4>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>It is possible to isolate the virus from blood, but the procedure is too drawn-out and costly for routine diagnostics. Serology (IgM detection) is the method of choice, although the results can be difficult to interpret with bunyaviruses due to the rapidly changing antigenic variants produced in many of the viral species.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology and prevention</h3>
                            <p>The bunyaviruses and phleboviruses are transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods, whereby the cycle involves either human and vector only or, as with the togaviruses and flaviviruses, a mammal- arthropod-mammal cycle actually independent of humans, and in which human victims represent a dead end for the infectious agent. Hantaviruses are transmitted aerogenically to humans from rodents, in which the viruses persist apathogenically for the lifespan of the animal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Preventive measures include exposure prophylaxis (avoidance of insect bites and contact with rodents). An active vaccination is available for protection against Rift Valley fever.</p>

                            <p>Most members of the Arenaviridae family were first identified in the 1960s. The protoype arenavirus, the pathogen that causes lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), was identified 30 years earlier, 1933. The human pathogens among the arenaviruses are the LCM virus (Europe, America), the Lassa virus (Africa), and the Junin and Machupo viruses (South America). All arenaviruses are spherical to pleomorphic. They consist of a "spiked" envelope derived from the plasma membrane, with an inner structure that appears to be granulated when viewed in ultrathin sections. It is to these granula the viral family owes its name (arenosus = sandy). They are considered to be host-cell ribosomes. The virion contains at least three strands of host RNA in addition to two viral RNA segments.</p>

                            <p>The source of nearly all human arenavirus infections is to be found in rodents. The virus enters the body per os, aerogenically or possibly also by skin contact. A pronounced viremia develops at first, followed by organ manifestations.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>LCM:</strong> These are normally harmless and flulike, although they can also develop into meningitis or encephalitis, in rare cases with a lethal outcome.</span>

                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Junin and Machupo virus:</strong> Infections are similar to lassa virus. Compared to Lassa infections, CNS involvement is more frequent and the lethality rate is somewhat lower with these two viruses.</span>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>In the acute stage, arenaviruses can be isolated from the patient's blood. Postmortem isolation is best done from liver tissue.</p>

                                    <p>In the hemorrhagic fevers, especially Lassa fever, the blood is highly infectious and handling it requires proper precautions and utmost care (aerosol formation!). Isolation of the virus is relatively easy in cell cultures. For reasons of safety, only special high-security laboratories are qualified to handle these organisms (e.g., at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, USA).</p>

                            <p>Serodiagnosis is also feasible using standard serological techniques.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology and prevention</h3>
                            <p>All arenaviruses are endemic to rodents and are transmitted to humans by these animals. No specific immunoprophylactic tools have been developed for any of these viruses. As far as exposure prophylaxis is concerned, it must be remembered that the LCM, Junin, and Machupo viruses are not transmitted among humans, but the Lassa virus is transmitted by this route. The most stringent precautions are therefore called for when treating Lassa patients. Healthcare staff must wear special clothing and facemasks and special reduced-pressure plastic tents are recommended as patient cubicles. The therapeutic tools available for treatment are ribavirin and human immunoglobulin.</p>
