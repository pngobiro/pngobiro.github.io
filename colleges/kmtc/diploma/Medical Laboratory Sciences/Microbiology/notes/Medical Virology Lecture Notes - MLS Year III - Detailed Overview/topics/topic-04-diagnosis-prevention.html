                            <p>The most important prophylactic measures in the face of potential viral infections are active vaccines. Vaccines containing inactivated viruses generally provide shorter-lived and weaker protection than live vaccines. Passive immunization with human immunoglobulin is only used in a small number of cases, usually as postexposure prophylaxis.</p>
                            
                            <p>Chemoprophylaxis, i.e., administration of chemotherapeutic agents when an infection is expected instead of after it has been diagnosed to block viral metabolism, is now justified in selected cases, e.g., in immunosuppressed patients.</p>

                            <h3>Active Immunization</h3>
                            <p>The antigen (virus) is introduced into the body, either in an inactivated form, or with attenuated pathogenicity but still capable of replication, to enable the body to build up its own immunity.</p>

                            <h4>Inactivated vaccines</h4>
                            <p>The immunity that develops after so-called "dead vaccines" are administered is merely humoral and generally does not last long. For this reason, booster vaccinations must be given repeatedly. The most important dead vaccines still in use today are influenza, rabies, some flavivirus, and hepatitis A and B vaccines. Some inactivated vaccines contain the most important immunogenic proteins of the virus.</p>

                            <h4>Live attenuated vaccines</h4>
                            <p>These vaccines confer effective and long-lasting protection after only a single dose because the viruses contained in them are capable of replication in the body, inducing not only humoral, but sometimes cellular immunity as well. Such live vaccines are preferable when available. Drawbacks and risks the increased potential for contamination with other viruses, resulting in more stringent testing and the possibility that a back-mutation could produce a pathogenic strain.</p>

                            <h4>Vaccines with recombinant viruses</h4>
                            <p>Since only a small number of (surface) viral proteins are required to induce protective immunization, viral vectors are used in attempts to express them in vaccine recipients. Suitable vectors include the least virulent virus strains among the picornaviruses, alphaviruses, and poxviruses. There must be no generalized immunity to the vector in the population so that it can replicate in vaccine recipients and the desired protein will at the same time be expressed. E.g. a rabies vaccine containing the recombinant vaccinia virus for use in animals.</p>

                            <h4>Naked DNA vaccine</h4>
                            <p>Since pure DNA can be inserted into eukaryotic cells (transfection) and the information it carries can be expressed, DNA that codes for the desired (viral) proteins can be used as vaccine material. The advantages of such vaccines, now still in the trial phase, include ease of production and high stability.</p>

                            <h3>Passive immunization</h3>
                            <p>This type of vaccine involves the injection of antibodies using only human immunoglobulins. The protection conferred is of short duration and only effective against viruses that cause viremia.</p>
                            <p>Passive immunization is usually administered as a postexposure prophylactic measure, i.e., after an infection or in situations involving a high risk of infection, e.g., to protect against hepatitis B and rabies (locally, bite wound).</p>

                            <p>Inhibitors of certain steps in viral replication can be used as chemotherapeutic agents to treat viral infections. In practical terms, it is much more important to inhibit the synthesis of viral nucleic acid than of viral proteins. The main obstacles involved are: the low level of specificity of the agents in some cases (toxic effects, because cellular metabolism is also affected) and the necessity of commencing therapy very early in the infection cycle.</p>

                            <p>The virus is identified based on its infectivity and pathogenicity by inoculating in cell cultures with the specimen material. Certain changes observed in the culture indicate the presence of a virus cytopathic effect [CPE].</p>

                            <h3>Cell cultures</h3>
                            <p>Viruses can be grown in many types of human or animal cells available for culture. Primary cell cultures can be created with various fresh tissues and can only divide a limited number of times. Cell lines can be developed from primary cultures with unlimited in-vitro culturing capacity. Example, HeLa cells (human portio carcinoma cells) and Vero cells (monkey renal fibroblasts). Viral replication in cell cultures results in morphological changes in the cells such as rounding off, formation of giant cells, and inclusion bodies (so-called CPE). The CPE details will often suffice for an initial approximate identification of the virus involved.</p>

                            <h3>Sampling and transport of diagnostic specimens</h3>

                                    <p><strong>Sampling:</strong> Selection of suitable material depends on the disease and suspected viral species. Sampling should generally be done as early as possible in the infection cycle since viral replication precedes the clinical symptoms. Sufficiently large specimens must be taken under conditions that are as sterile as possible, since virus counts in the diagnostic material are almost always quite low.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Transportation:</strong> The half-life of viruses outside the body is often very short. Transport must be arranged quickly under cold box conditions. A number of virus transport mediums are commercially available.</p>

                            <h3>Laboratory processing of the material</h3>
                            <p>Before the host is inoculated with the specimen material for culturing, contaminant bacteria must be eliminated with antibiotics, centrifugation, and sometimes filtering.</p>

                            <h3>Selection of a host system</h3>
                            <p>The host system to be used is chosen based on the suspected (and relevant) virus infectors. Observation and incubation times, and thus how long a laboratory diagnosis will take, also depend on the viral species under investigation.</p>

                            <h3>Identification</h3>
                            <p>Identification of the viruses is based first on the observed cell changes, and then determined serologically using known antibodies and appropriate methods such as immunoelectron microscopy, EIA, or the neutralization test. Methods that detect the viral genome are now increasingly used.</p>

                            <h3>Significance of results</h3>
                            <p>It is an indicative of the etiology of the patient's disease. The most sensitive method of viral diagnostic detection, but it cannot detect all viruses in all situations. Another aspect is that the methods of virus isolation, with few exceptions, detect only mature, infectious virions and not the latent viruses integrated in the cells.</p>

                            <h3>Amplification culture</h3>
                            <p>The virus is grown for a brief period in a cell culture. Before the CPE is observed, the culture is tested using the antigen and genomic methods.</p>

                            <p>It is to find the viruses directly in the patient material without prior culturing or replication. Viruses in serous fluids such as the contents of herpes simplex or varicella- zoster blisters can be viewed under the electron microscope (EM). It must be remembered, however, that the EM is less sensitive than virus isolation in cultures by a factor of $10^{5}$. Viral antigens can be detected in secretions using enzyme immunoassay (EIA), passive agglutination, or in smears with immunofluorescence performed with known antibodies, for instance monoclonal antibodies. The viral genome can be identified by means of filter hybridization, or in smears or tissue sections with in-situ hybridization using DNA or RNA complementary to the viral genome as a probe.</p>

                            <h3>Sampling and transport of diagnostic specimens</h3>
                            <p>Transport of patient material for these methods is less critical than for virus isolation. Cold box transport is usually not required since the virus need not remain infectious.</p>

                            <h3>Significance of results</h3>
                            <p>A positive result with a direct virus detection method has the same level of significance as virus isolation. A negative test result means very little, particularly with EM, due to the low level of sensitivity of this method. The antigen assay and genome hybridization procedures are more sensitive than EM, but they are selective and detect only the viruses against which the antibodies or the nucleic acid probe used, are directed.</p>

                            <h3>Virus Detection Following Biochemical Amplification</h3>
                            <p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a highly sensitive test for viral genomes. First, nucleic acid is extracted from the patient material to be analyzed. Any RNA virus genome present in the material is transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase. This DNA, as well as the DNA of the DNA viruses, is then replicated in vitro with a DNA polymerase.</p>

                            <p>If a viral infection induces humoral immunity, the resulting antibodies can be used in a serodiagnosis. When interpreting the serological data, one is confronted by the problem of deciding whether the observed reactions indicate a fresh, current infection or earlier contact with the virus in question. Two criteria can help with this decision. Detection of IgM (without IgG) proves the presence of a fresh primary infection. Concurrent detection of IgG and IgM in blood sampled somewhat later in the course of the disease would also indicate a fresh infection. It could, however, also indicate a reactivated latent infection or an anamnestic reaction.</p>
