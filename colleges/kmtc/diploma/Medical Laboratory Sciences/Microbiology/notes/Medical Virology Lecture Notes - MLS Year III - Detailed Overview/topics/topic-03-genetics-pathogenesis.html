                            <p>Like in higher life forms, viral genetic material is subject to change by mutation. The lack of a corrective replication "proofreading" mechanism results in a very high incidence of spontaneous mutations in RNA viruses. This results in greatly increasing the genotypic variability within each species ("viral quasispecies"). Furthermore, a potential for recombination of genetic material is also inherent in the replication process, not only material from different viruses but also from host cell and virus. This factor plays a major role in viral tumor induction and genetic engineering. Functional modifications arising from interactions between different viral species in mixed infections have nothing to do with genetic changes.</p>

                            <p>In cases where two different viral strains are replicating in the same cell, there is a chance that strand breakage and reunion will lead to new combinations of nucleic acid segments or exchanges of genome segments (influenza), so that the genetic material is redistributed among the viral strains (recombination)</p>
                            <p>New genetic properties will therefore be conferred upon some of the resulting viral progeny, some of which will also show stable heritability.</p>
                            <p>Genetic material can also be exchanged between virus and host cell by the same mechanism or by insertion of all, or part, of the viral genome into the cell genome.</p>

                            <p>When viral RNA replicates, there is no "proofreading" mechanism to check for copying errors as in DNA replication. The result is that the rate of mutations in RNA viruses is about $10^4$, i.e., every copy of a viral RNA comprising 10,000 nucleotides will include on average one mutation. The consequence of this is that, given the high rate of viral replication, all of the possible viable mutants of a viral species will occur and exist together in an inhomogeneous population known as quasispecies. The selective pressure (e.g., host immune system efficiency) will act to select the "fittest" viruses at any given time. This explains the high level of variability seen in HIV as well as the phenomenon that a single passage of the attenuated polio vaccine virus through a human vaccine recipient produces neurovirulent revertants.</p>

                            <h3>Cell Destruction (Cytocidal Infection, Necrosis)</h3>
                            <p>Cell death occurs eventually after initial infection with many viral species. This cytopathological cell destruction usually involves production of viral progeny. Virus production coupled with cell destruction is termed the "lytic viral life cycle." Cell destruction, whether necrotic or apoptotic is the reason (along with immunological phenomena) for the disease manifested in the macroorganism</p>

                            <h4>Structural changes leading to necrosis:</h4>
                            <p>Morphological changes can often be observed in the infected cell. The effects seen in virally infected cell cultures are well-known and are designated by the term "cytopathic effect" (CPE). These effects can also be exploited for diagnostic purposes. They include rounding off and detachment of cells from adjacent cells or the substrate, formation of multinuclear giant cells, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies are structures made up of viral and/or cellular material that form during the viral replication cycle, e.g., viral crystals in the nucleus (adenoviruses) or collections of virions and viral material in the cytoplasm (smallpox viruses).</p>

                            <h3>Shutoff Phenomena</h3>
                            <p>Some viruses are able to block, more or less completely, steps in cellular macromolecule synthesis not useful to them. Such shutoff phenomena apparently contribute to rapid and efficient viral replication by eliminating competing cellular synthetic processes. These shutoff phenomena of course also have a pathogenic effect since they inhibit cellular metabolism, but not in such a way as to necessarily kill the host cell. Herpesviruses, for example, which possess DNA polymerase of their own, block cellular DNA synthesis. DNA replication in adenoviruses, by contrast, is directly coupled to that of the cell.</p>

                            <h3>Apoptosis</h3>
                            <p>Cells possess natural mechanisms that initiate their self-destruction (apoptosis) by means of predetermined cytoplasmic and nuclear changes. Infections with some viruses may lead to apoptosis. In rapidly replicating viruses, the viral replication process must be decelerated to allow the slow, energy-dependent process of apoptosis to run its course before the cell is destroyed by virus-induced necrosis. The body rapidly eliminates apoptotic cells before an inflammatory reaction can develop, which is apparently why virus-induced apoptosis used to be overlooked so often. Apoptosis can thus be considered a defense mechanism, although certain viruses are able to inhibit it.</p>

                            <h3>Virus Replication without Cell Destruction (Noncytocidal Infection)</h3>
                            <p>This outcome of infection is observed with certain viruses that do not cause any extensive restructuring of the host cell and are generally released by "budding" at the cell surface. This mode of replication is seen, for example, in the oncornaviruses and myxoviruses and in the chronic form of hepatitis B virus infection. However, cell destruction can follow as a secondary result of infection. If the immune system recognizes viral antigens on the cell surface, classifies it as "foreign" and destroys it.</p>

                            <h3>Latent Infection</h3>
                            <p>In this infection type, the virus (or its genome) is integrated in a cell, but no viral progenies are produced. The cell is accordingly not damaged and the macroorganism does not manifest disease. This form of infection is found, for instance, with the adenovirus group and in particular the herpesviruses, which can remain latent for long periods in the human body. Latency protects these viruses from immune system activity and thus is part of their survival strategy. However, a variety of initiating events can initiate a lytic cycle leading to manifest disease and dissemination of the virus. Repeated activation of a latent virus is termed recidivation (e.g., herpes labialis).</p>

                            <p>Infections by a number of viruses do not result in eventual host cell death, but rather cause tumor transformation of the cell. This means the cell is altered in many ways, e.g., in its growth properties, morphology, and metabolism. Following an infection with DNA tumor viruses, the type of host cell infected determines whether the cell reaction will be a tumor transformation, viral replication or lytic cycle. The transformation that takes place after infection with an RNA tumor virus either involves no viral replication (nonpermissive infection) or the cell produces new viruses but remains vital (permissive infection).</p>

                            <p>These coding regions are flanked by two control sequences important for regulatory functions called LTR (long terminal repeats). These sequences have a promoter/enhancer function and are responsible for both reverse transcription and insertion of the viral genome into the cell DNA. Certain oncoviruses possess a so-called "onc gene" instead of the pol region (onc gene = oncogene, refers to a cellular gene segment acquired by recombination). These viruses also often have incomplete gag and/or env regions. Such viruses are defective and require a helper virus to replicate (complementation). An exception to this principle is the Rous sarcoma virus, which possesses both an onc gene and a complete set of viral genes and can therefore replicate itself.</p>

                            <h3>Oncogenes</h3>
                            <p>Over 100 oncogenes have been found in the course of tumor virology research to date. These genes enable tumor viruses to transform their host cells into tumor cells. The various types of oncogenes are designated by abbreviations, in most cases derived from the animal species in which the virus was first isolated. Further investigation of these viral oncogenes have now shown that these genes are not primarily of viral origin, but are rather normal, cellular genes widespread in humans and animals and acquired by the oncoviruses in their host cells, which can be transferred to new cells (transduction). Such a cellular gene, not oncogenic per se, is called a proto-oncogene.</p>

                            <p>The normal function of the proto-oncogenes concerns the regulation of cell growth in the broadest sense. Their gene products are growth factors, growth factor or hormone receptors and GTP-binding or DNA-binding proteins. Proto-oncogenes are potential contributors to tumor development that have to be "activated" before they can actually have such effects. This can occur by way of several different mechanisms:</p>

                            <h3>Tumor induction by oncoviruses</h3>
                            <p>Both types of carcinogenic retroviruses, i.e., those with no oncogene and intact replication genes (gag, pol, env, flanked by the LTR regions) and those that have become defective by taking on an oncogene, can initiate a tumor transformation. On the whole, oncoviruses play only a subordinate role in human tumor induction.</p>

                            <h4>Retroviruses without an oncogene:</h4>
                            <p>LTR are highly effective promoters. Since the retrovirus genome is integrated in the cell genome at a random position, the LTR can also induce heightened expressivity in cellular protooncogenes ("promoter insertion hypothesis" or "insertion mutagenicity"), which can lead to the formation of tumors. This is a slow process (e.g., chronic leukemias) in which cocarcinogens can play an important role. The transformed cells produce new viruses.</p>

                            <h4>Retroviruses with an oncogene:</h4>
                            <p>A viral oncogene always represents a changed state compared with the original cellular proto-oncogene (deletion, mutation). It is integrated in the cell genome together with the residual viral genome (parts) after reverse transcription, and then expressed under the influence of the LTR, in most cases over expressed. This leads to rapid development of acute malignancies that produce no new viruses. Over production of oncogene products can be compensated by gene products from antioncogenes. The loss or mutation of such a suppressor gene can therefore result in tumor formation.</p>

                            <h3>DNA Tumor Viruses</h3>
                            <p>Genes have also been found in DNA tumor viruses that induce a malignant transformation of the host cell. In contrast to the oncogenes in oncoviruses, these are genuine viral genes that have presumably developed independently of one another over a much longer evolutionary period. They code for viral regulator proteins, which are among the so-called early proteins. They are produced early in the viral replication cycle and assume essential functions in viral DNA replication. Their oncogenic potential derives among other things from the fact that they bind to the products of tumor suppressor genes such as p53, Rb (antioncogenes, "antitransformation proteins") and can thus inhibit their functions. DNA viruses are more important inducers of human tumors than oncoviruses (example: HHV8, papovaviruses, hepatitis B viruses, Epstein-Barr viruses).</p>

                            <p>The term "pathogenesis" covers the factors that contribute to the origins and development of a disease. In the case of viruses, the infection is by a parenteral or mucosal route. The viruses either replicate at the portal of entry only (local infection) or reach their target organ hematogenously, lympogenously or by neurogenic spread (generalized infection). In both cases, viral replication induces degenerative damage. Its extent is determined by the extent of virus-induced cell destruction and sets the level of disease manifestation. Immunological responses can contribute to elimination of the viruses by destroying the infected cells, but the same response may also exacerbate the course of the disease.</p>

                            <p>There are two forms of infection:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Local infection</strong>
                                        <p>In this form of infection, the viruses spread only from cell to cell. The infection and manifest disease are thus restricted to the tissues in the immediate vicinity of the portal of entry. Example: rhinoviruses that reproduce only in the cells of the upper respiratory tract.</p>
                                    </span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Generalized infection</strong>
                                        <p>In this type, the viruses usually replicate to some extent at the portal of entry and are then disseminated via the lymph ducts or bloodstream and reach their target organ either directly or after infecting a further organ. When the target organ is reached, viral replication and the resulting cell destruction become so widespread that clinical symptoms develop. Examples of such infection courses are seen with enteroviruses that replicate mainly in the intestinal epithelium, but cause no symptoms there. Clinical symptoms in these infections first arise in the target organs such as the CNS (polioviruses, echoviruses) or musculature (coxsackie viruses).</p>
                                        <p>Another mode of viral dissemination in the macroorganism is neurogenic spread along the nerve tracts, from the portal of entry to the CNS (rabies), or in the opposite direction from the ganglions where the viruses persist in a latent state to the target organ (herpes simplex).</p>

                            <h3>Organ Infections, Organotropism</h3>
                            <p>Whether a given cell type can be infected by a given viral species at all depends on the presence of certain receptors on the cell surface. This mechanism explains why organotropism is observed in viruses. However, the tropism is only apparent; it is more accurate to speak of susceptible and resistant cells (and hence organs). Another observation is that cells grown in the laboratory in cell cultures can completely change their sensitivity or resistance to certain viral species compared with their organ of origin.</p>

                            <h3>Course of infection</h3>
                            <p>The organ damage caused by viruses is mainly of a degenerative nature; inflammatory reactions are secondary processes. The severity of the clinical symptoms depends primarily on the extent of virus-induced (or immunological) cell damage. Most of the viral progeny are produced prior to the occurrence of clinical symptoms, with consequences for epidemiology and antiviral therapies. Infections can go unnoticed if cell destruction is insignificant or lacking entirely. The terms inapparent, silent, or subclinical infection are used, in contrast to apparent viral infections with clinical symptoms. Virus replication and release do take place in inapparent infections, as opposed to latent infections in which no viral particles are produced.</p>

                            <h3>Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Viral Infection</h3>
                            <p>Disease process can be worsened when viruses react with subneutralizing amounts or types of antibodies; antibodies exacerbate the infection. Fc fragment of the antibodies bound to the viruses can then react with the Fc receptors on specific cells. This makes possible for cell types to be infected that are primarily resistant to the virus in question because they possess no viral receptors (but in any case Fc receptors). ADE has been experimentally confirmed with a number of virus types to date includes herpes virus, poxvirus, reovirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, coronavirus, bunyavirus, and HIV species.</p>

                            <h3>Virus excretion</h3>
                            <p>Excretion of newly produced viruses depends on the localization of viral replication. For example, viruses that infect the respiratory tract are excreted in expired air (droplet infection). In generalized infections, not only the target organ is involved in excretion; the primary viral replication at the portal of entry also contributes to virus excretion. For example, enteroviruses replicate primarily in the intestinal wall are excreted in feces. Since the symptoms of a viral disease result from cell destruction, production, and excretion of new virus progeny precede the onset of illness. Patients are therefore contagious before they really become ill.</p>

                            <p>The specific immune defenses include the <strong>humoral immune system</strong>, consisting mainly of antibodies, and the cellular immune system, represented mainly by the T lymphocytes. Cellular immunity is more important than humoral immunity. The cellular system is capable of recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells on the surfaces of which viral antigens are expressed. The humoral system can eliminate only extracellular viruses.</p>
