                            <p>The togavirus family (Togaviridae) comprises two genera. Alphavirus infections are transmitted by arthropods and are imported to central Europe mainly by travelers to tropical and subtropical countries. Their clinical pictures are variable, but almost always include joint pain (arthralgias). The most important representative of the genus Rubivirus is the rubella virus, the causative agent in German measles. This harmless childhood disease can cause severe embryopathies during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>

Replication not only produces new 40S genomic RNA, but a subgenomic 26S RNA fragment, which codes for the capsid proteins. Viral progeny are released by "budding" at the cell surface.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>The arthropodborne alphaviruses, zoonoses of the tropical and subtropical regions, frequently cause asymptomatic or benign infections with fever, exanthem, and joint pain. Occasionally, however, persistent arthralgia and polyarthritis (lasting months or even years) do occur, sometimes involving joint destruction. Even rarer, sequelae include encephalitis and meningoencephalitis with high lethality rates. "German measles" is a harmless exanthemous infection in children and youths, caused by rubella virus, and transmitted by direct contact. The infections remain inapparent in nearly half the cases.</p>
                            
                            <p>The virus, at first, replicates in lymphoid organs at the portal of entry and in the nasopharyngeal space, after which a viremia develops before the exanthem manifests.</p>

                                    <p>In pregnant women, the virus takes this route through the placenta to the embryo, where it can cause congenital deformities or embryonic death, especially in the first three months of pregnancy. The organs in the developmental stage in this trimester are most seriously affected by the rubella infection. The most frequent congenital deformities are deafness, cataracts, cardiac defects, microcephaly, and spina bifida. In intrauterine embryo deaths due to rubella infections the immediate cause of death is usually myocardial damage. A measles infection confirmed by IgM detection or a raised antibody count is therefore an indication for a first-trimester abortion.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis and prevention</h3>
                            <p>Serodiagnosis is the method of choice in suspected alphavirus and rubivirus infections. EIA methods are also available for IgM detection. There are vaccines to protect against alphavirus infections and rubella. The main aim of rubella prophylaxis is to prevent rubella-caused embryopathies. Since 10–15% of young adults are still susceptible to rubella infections and a live vaccine with few side effects that confers reliable immunity is available, serial vaccination of children (boys and girls!) is done before puberty. The vaccine is tolerated so well that prior immune status checks are not required.</p>

                            <p>Viruses in the flavivirus family (Flaviviridae) include the genera Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, and Pestivirus. Flaviviruses (the prototype being the yellow fever virus [Latin: flavus, yellow]) are transmitted by arthropods. They cause a biphasic infection that can have serious consequences (hemorrhagic fever with a high lethality rate). In southern and eastern countries, these viruses are significant human pathogens. Only one representative of this family, the tickborne encephalitis pathogen, is encountered in Europe.</p>
                            
                            <p>Hepaciviruses (HCV and HGV) are not arthropodborne. HCV is transmitted mainly in blood (transfusions, blood products, intravenous drug use) and is a frequent cause of chronic disease (70% of cases), including cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. HGV is related to HCV and has not been characterized in detail as yet. Pestiviruses are only important in veterinary medicine.</p>
                            
                            <p>Flaviviruses show morphological uniformity, an icosahedral capsid and closefitting, spiked envelope. The genome of the flaviviruses is a single stranded sense RNA. It codes for three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. The morphogenesis of the virus occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum, into the lumen of which the finished viruses bud. These characteristics have not been directly demonstrated for the hepatitis C virus, which cannot be cultured in vitro. The pestiviruses cause severe animal epidemics (e.g., swine fever). They are not transmitted by arthropods.</p>

                            <h3>Flavivirus (Arthropodborne Yellow Fever Type)</h3>
                            <p>The flavivirus family includes 63 species. Prototypic viruses of the family are the yellow fever virus, and the pathogen that causes European tickborne encephalitis (spring-summer meningoencephalitis, SSME).</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>The arthropodborne flaviviruses cause diseases of different levels of severity. The infections are typically biphasic.</p>
                            
                            <p>An initial phase, not very characteristic phase, includes fever, headache, muscle pain, and in some cases exanthem (Denguelike disease). This phase includes a pronounced viremia. The illness, in this stage often not recognized as a flavivirus infection.</p>
                            
                            <p>Secondary phase: initial phase may then be over or it may progress after one to three days to a second, severe clinical picture: a hemorrhagic fever with a high lethality rate involving hemorrhages and intravasal coagulation. In Dengue fever, this form is becoming more and more frequent and is called Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) depending on the predominant characteristics.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>A flavivirus infection always involves viremia (transmission by bloodsucking arthropods!). The viruses can be isolated from blood by inoculating cell cultures or newborn mice. In autopsies of fatal cases, the virus can be isolated from liver tissue. The viruses are labile by nature and identification can take time, for which reason the diagnostic focus is on serology (titer rise or IgM detection).</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology and prevention</h3>
                            <p>A cycle of infection involving a vertebrate host (mammals, birds) and a transmitting vector (bloodsucking mosquitoes and flies, ticks) has developed for most flavivirus infections. The cycles are efficient for the virus and relatively harmless for the host. The vertebrate host frequently shows few signs of disease and recovers from the infection after a brief viremia. During this period, the bloodsucking vector is infected, which thereafter remains a lifelong salivary secretor and thus infectious.</p>
                            
                            <p>In ticks, transovarian transmission of the virus is also possible. The human host is a dead end for the virus, not a normal component of the cycle. Exceptions to this are Dengue fever and urban yellow fever. Humans are the only known main hosts for the Dengue virus.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are two forms of yellow fever:</p>

                                    <span class="list-content">Rural or jungle ("sylvatic") yellow fever with a monkey-mosquito-monkey (sometimes human) cycle.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Urban yellow fever with humans as the main hosts and Aedes mosquitoes as the transmitting vectors. This form is on the upswing due to increasing numbers of breeding places (e.g., empty tin cans in garbage piles) for the vector.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Another "new" (more accurately: revived) infectious disease is the West Nile viral infection, observed for the first time in the USA (New York) in 1999, apparently introduced into the area by migrating birds. It is still not known why the geographic distribution of the virus or infected birds changed.</p>
                            
                            <p>Vaccines are available against yellow fever (live vaccine) and European tickborne encephalitis (dead vaccine).</p>

                            <p>HCV was discovered by molecular biological in 1988. It is designated as "non-A-non-B (NANB) hepatitis". They belong to a flavivirus with approximately 10 kb sense RNA and several genotypes. HGV, another flavivirus, also causes hepatitis.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis and clinical picture</h3>
                            <p>Hepatitis C resembles hepatitis B in many respects. One major difference is that it much more frequently produces a persistent infection (85%). In 70% of cases, develops into a chronic hepatitis which results in cirrhosis of the liver within 20 years and a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a further 10 years. The reason for the high level of viral persistence is thought to be a pronounced mutability facilitating evasion of the immune defenses - quasispecies of RNA viruses.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>Antibody EIA using genetically engineered viral proteins and western blot to confirm the result. RNA can be detected by RT-PCR. Course of therapy monitored with quantitative PCR.</p>

                            <h3>Epidemiology and prevention</h3>
                            <p>Transmission is by blood and blood products. High-risk persons include dialysis patients, healthcare staff, and needle-sharing drug consumers. Perinatal transmission is possible, but sexual contact does not appear to be a risk factor. The transmission route is not apparent in many cases, giving rise to the expression "community-acquired infection." Feasible protective measures are the same as in hepatitis B; no immunization by vaccine is available. Especially in combination with ribavirin, therapeutic use of interferon can lead to elimination of the virus in persistent infections and thus to prevention of cirrhosis of the liver and HCC.</p>
