                            <p>Virology is a field within microbiology that encompasses the study of viruses. Medical virology deals with the study of medically important viruses and the diseases they cause or their effect on human beings. Viruses are particles consisting of protein and nucleic acid (an RNA or DNA genome). Lack both cellular structure and independent metabolic processes. They replicate solely by exploiting living cells based on the information in the viral genome.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The first written record of a virus infection is from ancient Egypt (3700BC), which shows a temple priest with typical signs of paralytic poliomyelitis. Pharaoh Ramses V, who died in 1196BC and whose well-preserved mummified body is now in a Cairo museum, is believed to have died from smallpox. The comparison between the pustular lesions on the face of this mummy and those of more recent patients is startling, and traces of smallpox epidemic in the family of Ramses V of the Egyptian 20th dynasty proved by electron microscopy and immunology.</p>
                            
                            <p>Smallpox was endemic in China by 1000BC. In response, the practice of variolation was developed. Recognizing that survivors of smallpox outbreaks were protected from subsequent infection, people inhaled the dried crusts from smallpox lesions like snuff or, in later modifications, inoculated the pus from a lesion into a scratch on the forearm. Variolation was practiced for centuries and was shown to be an effective method of disease prevention, although risky because the outcome of the inoculation was never certain.</p>
                            
                            <p>Edward Jenner was nearly killed by variolation at the age of seven! Not surprisingly, this experience encouraged him on to find a safer alternative treatment. On May 14, 1796, he used cowpox-infected material obtained from the hand of Sarah Nemes, a milkmaid from his home village in England, to successfully vaccinate 8-year-old James Phipps. Although initially controversial, vaccination against smallpox was almost universally adopted worldwide during the 19th Century.</p>
                            
                            <p>This early success (vaccine protection) was an achievement of scientific observation and reasoning was not based on any real understanding of the nature of infectious agents. This arose separately from another line of reasoning. Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), a Dutch merchant, constructed the first simple microscopes and with these identified bacteria as the "animalcules" he saw in his specimens. However, it was not until Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur in the 1880s jointly proposed the "germ theory" of disease that the significance of these organisms became apparent.</p>

                            <p>Subsequently, Pasteur worked extensively on rabies, which he identified as being caused by a virus (from the Latin for "poison"), but despite this he did not discriminate between bacteria and other agents of disease.</p>

This resistance was finally dispelled in 1909 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper, who showed that poliomyelitis was caused by a "filterable agent" - the first human disease to be recognized as being caused by a virus.</p>

The further history of virology is the story of the development of experimental tools and systems with which viruses could be examined and that opened up whole new areas of biology, including not only the biology of the viruses themselves but inevitably also the biology of the host cells on which they are dependent.</p>

                                Virus Diversity and Definition

                            <p>There is more biological diversity within viruses than in all the rest of the bacterial, plant &amp; animal kingdoms put together. This results from the success of viruses in parasitizing all known groups of living organisms. Understanding this diversity is the key to comprehending the interactions of viruses with their hosts. At a molecular level, protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, &amp; protein-lipid interactions determine the structure of virus particles, the synthesis &amp; expression of virus genomes &amp; the effects of viruses on the host cell.</p>

                            <h3>Viruses are distinct from living organisms</h3>
                            <p>Viruses are submicroscopic, obligate intracellular parasites; they can only be seen with a special, very powerful microscope called an "electron microscope." However, a few groups of prokaryotic organisms that have specialized intracellular parasitic life-cycles &amp; which puzzle the above definition. The Rickettsiae &amp; Chlamydiae - obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria which have evolved so that they can exist outside the cells of their hosts only for a short period of time before losing viability. Therefore, it is necessary to add further clauses to the definition of what constitutes a virus.</p>

                            <p>Viruses differ from other microorganisms in a number of characteristics:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">They have no metabolic systems of their own, but rather depend on the synthetic mechanism of a living host cell. Viruses exploit normal cellular metabolism by delivering their own genetic information, i.e., nucleic acid, into the host cell. One thus might call viruses “vagabond genes”</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Virus definition</h3>
                            <p>Viruses are particles produced from the assembly of pre-formed components, whereas other agents grow from an increase in the integrated sum of their components &amp; reproduce by division. Virus particles (virions) themselves do not grow or undergo division. Viruses lack the genetic information which encodes apparatus necessary for the generation of metabolic energy or for protein synthesis (ribosomes)</p>

                            <h3>Viruses are energy parasites</h3>
                            <p>No known virus has the biochemical or genetic potential to generate the energy necessary to drive all biological processes (e.g. macromolecular synthesis). They are therefore absolutely dependent on the host cell for this function.</p>

                            <h3>Are viruses alive?</h3>

                            <h4>Various enzymes</h4>
                            <p>Viruses require a number of different enzymes depending on genome type and mode of infection. In several virus species, enzymes are a component of the virus particle, for example the neuraminidase required for invasion and release of myxoviruses.</p>
                            <p>Other examples include nucleic acid polymerases such as: RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in antisense viruses, DNA polymerases in smallpox viruses and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase ("reverse transcriptase") in hepatitis B viruses and retroviruses.</p>

                            <h4>Hemagglutinin</h4>
                            <p>Some viruses (above all myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses) are capable of agglutinating various different human or animal erythrocytes. These viruses bear a certain surface protein (hemagglutinin) in their envelope that enables them to do this. The hemagglutination phenomenon can be used for quantitative viral testing or—in the hemagglutination inhibition test - for virus identification and antibody identification. In biological terms, hemagglutinin plays a decisive role in adsorption and penetration of the virus into the host cell.</p>

                            <h3>Cubic symmetry (rotational symmetry)</h3>
                            <p>Viruses with rotational symmetry are icosahedrons (polyhedrons with 20 equilateral triangular faces and 12 corners e.g. Adenovirus). The number of capsomers per virion varies from 32 to 252 and depends on the number of capsomers (two to six) making up one side of the equilateral triangle. The capsomers in a virion need not all be the same, either in their morphology, antigen make-up or biological properties. Purified icosahedral viruses can be crystallized, so that images of them can be obtained using the methods of radiocrystallography.</p>

                            <h3>Helical symmetry</h3>
                            <p>Helical symmetry is present when one axis of a capsid is longer than the other. The nucleic acid and capsid protein are closely associated in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), in which the protein is tightly arrayed around the nucleic acid strand. This RNA-protein complex is known as the nucleocapsid, which takes the form of a helix inside the viral envelope. e.g. Influenza virus</p>

                            <p>Complex structural patterns are found in phages and the smallpox virus. T-bacteriophages, for example, have an icosahedral head containing the DNA and a tubelike tail through which the DNA is injected into the host cell.</p>
