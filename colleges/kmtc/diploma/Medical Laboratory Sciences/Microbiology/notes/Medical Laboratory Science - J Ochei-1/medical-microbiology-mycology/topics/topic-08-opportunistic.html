                            <p><strong>Causative agents:</strong> Aspergillosis can be caused by several species of <em>Aspergillus</em>. The commonest are <em>Aspergillus niger</em>, <em>A. fumigatus</em> and <em>A. flavus</em>.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Aspergillus species are widespread in the environment, living mainly in soil and living plants. The spores are easily dispersed in the air and the majority of infections are acquired by inhalation of airborne spores.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Aspergillosis</strong> includes various disease conditions such as toxicosis (due to aflatoxin produced by <em>A. flavus</em>); allergic reactions; localized infections of the skin, external ear (otomycosis), nasal sinuses and the orbit of the eye (keratitis); pulmonary infection; and disseminated multi-organ disease. Pulmonary aspergillosis may occur in the form of an allergy, aspergilloma or invasive tissue disease.</p>
                            <p>Aspergilloma is the colonization by the fungus of the pre-existing cavities in the lung due to previous infections such as tuberculosis. In invasive aspergillosis, the mycelia extend into the tissue and subsequently may disseminate to other parts of the body through the blood stream.</p>

                            <p><strong>KOH Mount:</strong> On direct microscopic examination, species of Aspergillus shows dichotomous branching (at 45°) of hyaline, septate hyphae 3–4 μm in width (Fig. 5.10). The walls are parallel and refractile. However, on the basis of morphology, it is not possible to distinguish them from other septate fungi.</p>

                            <h5>(ii) Culture</h5>
                            <p>Inoculate the specimen on Sabouraud's agar without cycloheximide. Aspergillus is sensitive to cycloheximide. A medium enriched with blood may also be inoculated.</p>
                            <p>Aspergillus grows as a mould both at 30°C and 37°C rapidly within two to four days. Identification is based on both gross and microscopic morphology of the isolate, and pigment production. All species of Aspergillus produce erect unbranched conidiophores with swollen apices or vesicles. Depending on the species, a portion or the entire surface of the vesicle is covered by flask shaped phialides or sterigmata. Conidia are formed in chains from the tips of the phialides (Fig. 5.11a). The hyphae are septate.</p>
                            
                            <p>Recently, about 200 species of the genus Aspergillus have been divided into 18 groups. A definitive identification to the species level should be requested from a reference laboratory. The most common groups are described below.</p>

                            <p><strong>Causative agents:</strong> Zygomycosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by several genera within the class Zygomycetes. These moulds are characterized by broad, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae. The spores are produced within a sac-like fruiting structure, a sporangium, which is formed at the tip of a supporting structure, a sporangiophore. Columnella is the protrusion of the sporangiophore into the sporangium. The spores are produced internally within the sporangium and are called sporangiospores. After maturation, the sporangium ruptures to release the spores into the environment. The sporangiophores are connected to each other by hyphae called stolons. The stolons, usually, remain in contact with the substrate by root-like structures, rhizoids. The three most common zygomycetes isolated in a clinical laboratory are species of <em>Rhizopus</em>, <em>Mucor</em> and <em>Abisidia</em>.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Like many other opportunistic pathogens, the zygomycetes are abundant in the environment, and are transient residents of the human body. Throughout the world, the zygomycetes are known to cause infections in patients with predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, malignancies and immunodeficiencies. The disease is acute and rapidly fatal, most often when associated with <em>Rhizopus</em> species. The most common form of the disease is the rhinocerebral form where the nasal mucosa, palate, sinuses, face, orbit and brain are involved. The other common forms are pulmonary and intestinal; and may disseminate to any organ of the body. Zygomycetes have a remarkable capacity to invade blood vessels. Small arteries can be filled with hyphae, which penetrate into the adjacent tissues and cut off the blood supply to the organ, leading to thrombosis and necrosis.</p>
                            <p>Cutaneous and subcutaneous zygomycosis is occasionally seen in burn cases and in post-operative wounds.</p>

                            <p>Zygomycete colonies are visible within 48–72 hours, and show characteristic morphological features. They produce abundant aerial mycelium with fluffy, white, grey or brown hyphal growth that rapidly covers the entire agar surface. It is not possible to distinguish between the genera on the basis of colony morphology. Microscopically, identification to the genus level is adequate. Microscopic features of the three important genera are described as follows.</p>

                            <p><strong>Causative agents:</strong> Cryptococcosis is almost always caused by <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>. However, other species of the genus <em>Cryptococcus</em> are also occasionally associated with the disease.</p>
                            <p>Members of the genus <em>Cryptococcus</em> are true yeasts, which are unicellular fungi that reproduce asexually by budding. <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em> exists as a saprophyte in nature. It is most often found associated with pigeon faeces. A distinctive feature of <em>C. neoformans</em> is that it produces a prominent polysaccharide capsule.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Cryptococcosis is acquired by inhalation of yeast through aerosols from the soil contaminated with bird excreta. The primary focus of infection is the lungs and it is often asymptomatic or may lead to mild pneumonia. As there is no calcification, healed pulmonary lesions may not be seen radiologically. Extra pulmonary disease is frequently observed in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS, Hodgkin's disease or leukaemia. Disseminated cryptococcosis most commonly involves the central nervous system causing meningitis, but can also cause endocarditis, hepatitis, renal infection and pleural effusion.</p>
                            
                            <p>Antigenically, the polysaccharide capsule of <em>C. neoformans</em> can be differentiated into four serotypes, A, B, C, and D; A and D being common in temperate climate, while B and C prevail in tropical areas.</p>

                            <p><strong>India Ink Preparation:</strong> Negative staining with India ink shows a wide, refractile, polysaccharide capsule (Fig. 2.2). However, some strains of <em>C. neoformans</em> may not exhibit a capsule.</p>

                            <p>Inoculate the specimen on Sabouraud's agar without cycloheximide and on blood agar. Incubate at 30°C for one week.

                            <p><strong>Causative agents:</strong> Candidiasis is caused by yeast-like fungi belonging to the genus <em>Candida</em>. <em>C. albicans</em> is the most common causative agent followed by <em>C. tropicalis</em> and <em>Torulopsis glabrata</em>. <em>Candida</em> species form part of the normal flora of the skin, mucous membranes and intestinal tract.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Candidiasis is an opportunistic endogenous infection. Depending on the immunocompetence of the host, candidiasis can range from trivial or mild infection of skin or mucosa to a very severe systemic disease (Table 5.5). The extent of system involvement appears to be directly related to the severity of the underlying disorder such as diabetes mellitus, leukaemia, lymphoma or T-cell deficiencies.</p>
                            
                            <p>Cutaneous candidiasis may involve the skin folds between the fingers (intertriginous) or surrounding the nails (paronychial), groin, perineum, axillae and inframammary folds where the skin is macerated by perspiration. They appear as scaly, moist lesions with sharply demarcated borders.</p>
                            <p>Mucosal candidiasis most commonly observed is in the valvovaginal area characterised by a whitish discharge, especially during pregnancy; and oral thrush, in neonates, the elderly and debilitated patients. Oral thrush appears as creamy white patches on the oral mucosa and the tongue.</p>
                            <p>Systemic candidiasis may involve intestines presenting as a diarrhoea not responding to treatment; pulmonary infection, endocarditis, meningitis, fungaemia and disseminated infection.</p>

                            <p><strong>Wet mount in saline:</strong> <em>Candida</em> appears as oval, budding yeast cells (2–4 μm in diameter) with or without pseudohyphae and hyphae (Fig. 3.2). Appearance of mycelial forms in fresh specimens indicates colonisation and tissue invasion by the yeasts.</p>
                            <p><strong>Gram stain:</strong> The Gram stain of the smear prepared from the specimen shows Gram positive yeast cells, pseudohyphae and hyphae.</p>

                            <h4>(ii) Culture</h4>
                            <p>Inoculate the specimens on Sabouraud's agar and incubate at 30°C for 24–48 hours.</p>
                            <p>Colonies of <em>Candida</em> species appear creamy white, smooth with a yeasty odour.</p>
                            <p><em>Candida albicans</em> can be identified by the germ-tube test (Fig.3.3) and by the formation of chlamydospores on cornmeal agar (Fig. 3.5). The final identification of the species is made by biochemical tests as shown in Table 3.2.</p>
