                                    <p>The study of fungi is called mycology. Medical mycology is a specialised area that deals with the study of disease-causing fungi.</p>

                            <p>Fungi are eukaryotic microorganisms. Like in other eukaryotes, the nucleus is bound by a nuclear membrane, and contains a nucleolus and chromosomes. Fungi do not contain chlorophyll and therefore, cannot use carbon dioxide as a sole source of carbon. They need an external carbon source for their metabolism. They synthesize and release enzymes and break down the substrate on which they are growing. The nutrients thus released are absorbed by the body for its growth and multiplication. Fungi have a rigid cell wall which is chiefly composed of chitin.</p>
                            
                            <p>Morphologically, fungi can be separated into two basic groups, unicellular yeast forms and multicellular filamentous mould forms. Fungi may reproduce sexually, asexually or both, by producing unicellular or multicellular spores.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are more than 60000 known species of fungi. Out of these, less than 200 can cause infections in man. Most of the fungi are saprophytic (saprobes), some are parasitic while some are opportunists. However, they can change their mode of life according to the environmental conditions.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>All fungi have a vegetative or growing phase and reproductive or spore bearing phase. Most fungi exhibit the same morphological characteristics irrespective of the environmental conditions, while a few show great variations in their morphology depending on the environment in which they grow.</p>

                            <h3>Moulds</h3>
                            <p>The term 'mould' is used to describe any fungus whose vegetative growth consists of filaments or hyphae interwoven to form a mat-like mycelium. The hyphae may either be divided by cross walls or septa (septate hyphae) or septa may be absent (non-septate or aseptate hyphae). Septa divide the mycelium into cell-like units. However, these divisions are not complete and the cell-like units bear openings through which cytoplasm, other cellular contents and even nuclei can migrate. Therefore, fungi are functionally unicellular, multinucleate organisms.</p>
                            
                            <p>Vegetative growth of most filamentous fungi is almost the same.</p>
                            
                            <p>The vegetative phase is followed by the reproductive phase which exhibits a great diversity. Reproduction in fungi can be very simple, e.g. formation of spores on a non-specialised hypha, or it can be a very complex developmental process. This diversity in the mechanism of spore formation and the morphology of spores provides the basis for the identification of fungi.</p>

                            <p>The moulds grow radially on culture media because of the continually extending hyphae. Some grow vertically and project above the surface of the medium. These are aerial hyphae and they participate in the process of reproduction by bearing the spores or the fruiting bodies. The colour, texture, form and rate of the growth are all useful in identification of the fungi.</p>
                            
                            <p>For the purpose of identification in the laboratory, the moulds or filamentous fungi can be broadly divided into three categories on the basis of their hyphae.</p>

                            <p>The term 'yeast' refers to a group of fungi which have a unicellular vegetative growth form. It is a fairly homogeneous group with common physiological, biochemical and reproductive characteristics. Growth takes place by the enlargement of a single cell and reproduction occurs through a process called budding. On the other hand, yeast-like fungi constitute a rather heterogeneous group of fungi in which only the vegetative growth form resembles a true yeast. The reproduction in yeast-like fungi may be by budding or by other more complex processes. Some yeast-like fungi produce structures which resemble hyphae (pseudo-hyphae).</p>
                            <p>On culture media, yeasts produce moist, creamy and opaque colonies resembling those of bacteria.</p>

                                    <p>Dimorphism is the ability of some fungi to form both mould-like and yeast-like vegetative forms. These are pathogenic fungi which are yeast-like in the host tissues and mould-like on artificial media at room temperature. However, when grown at 37°C on an enriched medium, a dimorphic fungus may grow in the yeast form. Some dimorphic fungi are pathogenic to man.</p>

                            <h3>Reproduction in Fungi</h3>
                            <p>The life cycle of a fungus may have asexual, sexual or both the phases. All fungi can reproduce asexually. In yeasts, asexual reproduction occurs by budding. In case of mould, the vegetative mycelium later forms asexual spores called conidia. The conidia may be borne on the vegetative mycelium or on specialised hyphae, conidiophores. The conidia are asexual spores, i.e. their nuclei are formed by mitotic divisions and are always haploid. These conidia are capable of producing new, identical colonies. The mycelium with its conidia is an asexual or anamorphic state.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a sexual life cycle, the mycelium produces a physical connection to another mycelium of a compatible mating strain. The mating of two mycelial structures results in the formation of a diploid zygote, known as an ascus or a basidium. Haploid sexual spores are formed within or on the surface of these fruiting bodies through meiosis. The mycelium with its fruiting bodies and sexual spores constitutes the sexual or telemorphic state.</p>
                            
                            <p>In most medically important fungi, the sexual phase is either missing or not yet identified. They are therefore known as deuteromycetes or fungi imperfecti.</p>

                            <h3>Classes of Fungi</h3>
                            <p>Medically important fungi can be divided into four classes depending on the type of spores produced.</p>

                                        <strong>Zygomycetes</strong><br>
                                        These are fungi with broad and non-septate hyphae, capable of growing rapidly on standard nutrient media. The zygomycetes produce sexual spores, called zygospores, by the fusion of the tips of specialised aerial hyphae. Asexual spores are called sporangiospores. These are borne on the specialised hyphae, sporangiophores. Sporangiospores are produced within a sac-like structure, sporangium which is formed at the tip of the sporangiophore.<br>
                                        Zygomycetes are also known as phycomycetes. Several genera in this group can cause opportunistic infections in humans.<br>

                            <p>Clinically, human mycotic infections, mycoses, may be grouped into four categories:</p>

                                        <strong>Superficial mycoses:</strong> Superficial or cutaneous mycoses are fungal infections that involve the hair, skin or nails without invading any living tissue. These infections are chronic and resistant to treatment, but rarely affect the general health of the patient. <em>Dermatophytes</em>, which include species of <em>Trichophyton</em>, <em>Microsporum</em> and <em>Epidermophyton</em>, are the most common causative agents of superficial mycoses called ringworm. Also included in this group are fungi causing tinea nigra, tinea versicolour and piedra.

                                        <strong>Subcutaneous mycoses:</strong> Subcutaneous mycoses are infections confined to the subcutaneous tissue without dissemination to distant sites. For example, infections such as mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis or sporotrichosis are subcutaneous mycoses.

                                        <strong>Systemic or deep-seated mycoses:</strong> Deep or systemic mycoses may produce systemic involvement and sometimes, can be fatal. They are most commonly acquired by inhalation of spores and may spread from the lung to involve any part of the body. The major systemic mycoses are caused by fungi such as <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Coccidioides immitis</em>, <em>Paracoccidioides braziliensis</em>, <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>.

                                        <strong>Opportunistic mycoses:</strong> The number of fungi included in this group appears to be ever-expanding. These fungi cause infections primarily in immunocompromised patients, usually due to underlying disease or due to immunosuppressive agents. Most of these fungi are saprophytic, living freely in soil or on decaying organic material. Most commonly encountered opportunistic infections include those caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> species, <em>Candida</em> species and, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>.
