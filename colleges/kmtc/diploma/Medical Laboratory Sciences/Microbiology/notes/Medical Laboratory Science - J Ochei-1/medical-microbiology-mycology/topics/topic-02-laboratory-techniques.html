                            <p>Sealed, sterile containers should be used for all liquid or moist specimens. As a general rule, the specimens should not be frozen or allowed to dry. They should either be left at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C. In many instances, specimens not only contain the aetiological agent, but also contain contaminating bacteria. Therefore, antibiotics should be added to decontaminate the specimens. About 20 units of penicillin, 0.04 mg of streptomycin or 0.02 mg of chloramphenicol can be added per millilitre of the specimen.</p>

                            <h3>Respiratory Secretions</h3>
                            <p>As most systemic or deep seated fungal infections have a primary focus in the lungs, respiratory secretion is the most common specimen selected for culture. The respiratory secretions include sputum, bronchial washings and tracheal aspirations.</p>
                            <p>The first early morning sample of sputum is collected after rinsing the mouth vigorously with water. Sputum induction with a heated aerosol saline suspension may be necessary if an adequate specimen cannot be obtained.</p>

                            <h3>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and other Body Fluids</h3>
                            <p>CSF is obtained via lumbar puncture when infections of the central nervous system are suspected. At least 3.0 ml of fluid should be collected in a sterile container for adequate mycological studies. Other fluids, such as synovial fluid, should be collected in a sterile container. If it is a bloody specimen, heparin should be used as an anticoagulant.</p>

                                    <p>CSF should not be refrigerated. It can be left at room temperature or placed in an incubator overnight at 37°C.</p>

                            </div>

                            <h3>Urine</h3>
                            <p>The first early morning urine specimens are preferred, but random samples are acceptable. Suprapubic aspirates or catheterized specimens can also be collected. Approximately 25–50 ml of urine should be collected aseptically in a sterile, screw capped container and sent immediately for processing. If a delay of more than 2 hours is anticipated, the urine specimen should be placed at 4°C to inhibit the overgrowth of bacteria.</p>

                            <h3>Prostatic Fluid</h3>
                            <p>Some fungi such as <em>Blastomyces</em> or <em>Coccidioides</em> can be isolated from prostatic fluid. The bladder is first emptied and prostatic fluid is obtained after massage. It is advisable to inoculate it directly on appropriate isolation media.</p>

                            <h3>Exudates</h3>
                            <p>Exudate from an undrained abscess should be aseptically aspirated with a sterile needle and syringe after disinfecting the skin. Pus from miliary abscess is collected by expressing this material after opening the abscess with a sterile scalpel. The exudates should be collected in sterile tubes and sent to the laboratory immediately.</p>

                            <h3>Skin Scrapings (Stratum corneum)</h3>
                            <p><em>Dermatophytes</em> (<em>Trichophyton</em>, <em>Microsporum</em>, <em>Epidermophyton</em> species) typically cause ringworm lesions of the skin with vesicular, erythematous margin. Briskly clean the lesion to include the entire periphery, using 70% ethanol. If the lesion is inflamed or contains fissures, a yeast infection should be suspected and sterile distilled water should be used to clean the lesion instead of 70% ethanol. With a sterile scalpel, scrape material from the periphery of the lesion. If moist or dried exudate is present on the lesion, it must be collected. The lesions caused by <em>Candida</em> species are usually moist, erythematous and painful.</p>
                            <p>Skin scrapings should be transported to the clinical laboratory in petri dishes, in paper envelopes or between two microscope slides.</p>

                            <h3>Nails</h3>
                            <p>Collect the nail scrapings either by scraping the nails or by snipping off the infected portion of the nail using sterile scissors. Before scraping, clean the nail with 70% ethanol. Scrape the nail from the proximal to the distal end of the nail. Discard the first 4-5 scrapings, and collect the later ones. The debris under the nail plate should also be collected. Place the nail scrapings in a sterile petri dish, between two microscope slides or in a clean envelope.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--warning">

                            </div>

                            <h3>Hair</h3>
                            <p>Hair should be collected from areas of scaling or alopecia (loss of hair). Using sterile forceps, collect dull, broken hairs from the margin of the lesion. Infected hairs are typically loose in the follicles.</p>
                            <p>Selection of infected hair is facilitated by exposure to filtered ultraviolet light using Wood's lamp. Collect the hair that fluoresce when examined with Wood's lamp. If removal of hairs is difficult, as it may be in young patients, place a strip of clear tape over the lesion and then remove it.</p>
                            <p>Hairs are transported to the laboratory in the same way as skin and nails.</p>

                            <h3>Tissue Specimens</h3>
                            <p>The tissue specimens must contain both the centre and the edge of the lesion. This is especially important for recovering dimorphic fungi because <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> is usually found in the centre of the lesion while <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em> is found at the periphery.</p>
                            <p>The tissue should not be frozen or allowed to dehydrate before culture. For this reason, freshly collected tissue specimens should be either placed between two sterile moist gauze pads or in a sterile container containing 1-2 ml of sterile saline for immediate transportation the laboratory.</p>

                            <h3>Blood</h3>
                            <p>In fungal septicaemia 8.0 ml of intravenous blood should be collected aseptically in a sterile tube containing 0.05% Liquoid (1.7 ml of 0.35% sodium polyanethol sulphonate).</p>

                            <h3>Bone Marrow</h3>
                            <p>Approximately 0.2-0.3 ml of bone marrow is collected aseptically in a heparinized syringe from the sternum or iliac crest.</p>

                            <p>When the properly labelled clinical specimen has been received, it should be grossly examined for the presence of particles; caseous, purulent or bloody areas; and necrotic material. These materials are selectively examined microscopically depending on the type of specimen; and then inoculated onto appropriate culture media.</p>
                            <p>Direct examination of the specimen is valuable in establishing the provisional diagnosis. For example, isolation of a fungus such as <em>Rhizopus</em> is significant when the hyphae compatible with it have been observed in the direct examination of the specimen. <em>Rhizopus</em> can otherwise be considered as a contaminant.</p>

                            <h3>Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Preparation</h3>
                            <p>The KOH preparation is ideal for determining fungal morphology because even though it readily dissolves the clinical material, fungal elements remain intact for a longer period due to the chitin in their cell walls. The clearing effect can be enhanced by gently warming the preparation over a Bunsen burner or a hot plate. The KOH preparation, besides helping in identification of fungi, facilitates selection of appropriate culture media.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Reagent</h4>
                            <p>Prepare a 10% (w/v) solution of KOH. A few drops of permanent blue-black ink may be added to the solution to highlight fungal walls.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Technique</h4>
                            <p>Place a drop of 10% KOH on a clean glass slide. Place the material to be examined in the KOH. Tease the material apart using two dissecting needles. Place a cover slip over it. Additional KOH may be necessary, and can be added at the edge of the cover slip. If excess, it should be removed by blotting with a filter paper.</p>
                            <p>Allow the preparation to stand at room temperature till it is cleared. Alternatively, pass the slide quickly through a bunsen flame to accelerate clearing and expel air bubbles. Observe microscopically using low intensity of light or phase-contrast microscopy. Figure 2.1 shows dermatophyte hyphae in the KOH mount of skin and nail scraping.</p>

                            <p>Calcofluor white fluorescent stain can detect fungi very easily as they fluoresce under UV light. Methanamine silver stain or Papanicolaou stain (refer to Histopathology section) can also detect fungi, especially in tissues; but need elaborate staining facility and is time consuming.</p>

                                Common Culture Media for Fungi
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are approximately 30 different types of media routinely used in clinical laboratories for the recovery of medically important fungi. The selection of media to be used depends on the knowledge of the fungi that are typically recovered from that particular geographical region. Two general types of culture media are essential for the primary recovery of fungi from clinical specimens.</p>
                            <p>An ideal combination of media for the primary recovery of pathogenic fungi is a non-selective medium, which will permit the growth of virtually all the fungi; and a selective medium, which contains antibiotics such as chloramphenicol and cycloheximide to prevent bacterial and to some extent, fungal contaminants. An enriched medium such as brain heart infusion agar (BHIA) with or without sheep blood is used for the recovery of more fastidious dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum or Blastomyces dermatitidis.</p>
                            <p>The purpose and composition of some commonly used media in mycology are described as follows.</p>

                            <h3>1. Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SAB)</h3>
                            <p>The original Sabouraud's agar contains 4% glucose and the pH of the medium is more acidic (pH 5.6) than the modified formula. This medium is ideal for studying colonial morphology of dermatophytes and other moulds. Various antimicrobial agents, such as chloramphenicol, gentamicin, penicillin or streptomycin have been added by various mycologists to SAB to avoid bacterial contamination from clinical specimens. Addition of cycloheximide inhibits growth of yeasts and some moulds (e.g. Zygomycetes); and increases chances of recovery of dimorphic fungi such as <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em> or <em>dermatophytes</em> such as <em>Trichophyton</em> species.</p>

                                        If the hyphae are less than 1µm in diameter, the causative agent is likely to be Actinomycetes. Perform modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain on the granules using 1% sulphuric acid. This differentiates between Nocardia (acid-fast) and Actinomyces (non-acid fast).<br>
                                        Suspected bacterial granules should be Gram stained.

                                    <p>Medically important fungi can be extremely dangerous. It is necessary to select the containers for fungal cultures very carefully. Petri dishes are not recommended (except for yeast extract phosphatase medium) because the media they contain get rapidly dehydrated. They also create dangerous aerosols when opened. The petri dishes can get easily contaminated. The petri dishes, however, are useful due to their large surface area which makes it easy to reach the fungal growth and observe colonial morphology closely. If used, the petri dishes must be sealed with parafilm or placed in plastic bags to avoid spores being released into the atmosphere and to avoid dehydration. The $25 \times 125 \mathrm{~mm}$ test tube with screw cap is most ideal because it offers adequate surface area. The screw cap should never be tightly closed to allow gaseous exchange for the growth and sporulation of fungi.</p>

                            <h3>Subculturing of isolates</h3>
                            <p>Subculturing is a propagation technique, ensuring that important isolates are maintained in the laboratory. Isolates may be subcultured in several ways. The simplest procedures is to transfer a small portion of growth from the edge of the old colony including a thin layer of the medium using a sterile scalpel, onto a fresh medium in a petri dish or a test tube. It is recommended to select the inoculum from the edge of the colony where the fungus is vegetatively most active.</p>
                            <p>When dangerous fungi such as <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> or <em>Aspergillus</em> species which produce abundant conidia are being subcultured, the colony should be flooded with a few millilitres of sterile distilled water to prevent formation of aerosols. This minimises the danger of infection and contamination of other cultures. A suspension formed with water can then be used to inoculate fresh media. All manipulations must be carried out in the safety cabinet.</p>
