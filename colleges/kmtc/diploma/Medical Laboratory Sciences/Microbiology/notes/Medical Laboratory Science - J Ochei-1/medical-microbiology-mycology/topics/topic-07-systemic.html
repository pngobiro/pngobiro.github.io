                            <p>Systemic mycoses may involve any internal organ or tissue of the body, including the lymph nodes, bone, subcutaneous tissues and skin. Systemic fungal infections are caused by several fungi. Traditionally, systemic mycoses have included the infections caused by a group of fungi which are taxonomically unrelated, but have one characteristic in common: they are all dimorphic fungi. Besides these 'classic' systemic mycoses, 'opportunistic' infections caused by other moulds can also be systemic, but these are discussed separately.</p>
                            <p>The infections caused by yeasts and yeast-like fungi can be subcutaneous or systemic and are also discussed under opportunistic infections.</p>

                            <p>These dimorphic fungi exist in nature as saprophytic filamentous moulds. This form is quite distinct from the parasitic, invasive tissue form. This transformation from mould to tissue form <em>in vivo</em> can also be initiated <em>in vitro</em> in the laboratory when cultured on enriched media and incubated at 35–37°C.</p>
                            <p>Systemic mycoses vary greatly in severity, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal infections. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic diseases are usually self-limiting and may undergo spontaneous healing. Disseminated or progressive and potentially fatal infection is fairly uncommon. A disseminated disease can involve any organ, sometimes with symptoms characteristic of the infecting fungus. Systemic mycoses are more common in individuals with diminished immunological functions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Causative agent:</strong> Blastomycosis is a chronic infection caused by a dimorphic fungus, <em>Blastomyces dermatitidis</em>. It is primarily a pulmonary infection which may disseminate from an initial pulmonary focus to virtually any organ in the body.</p>
                            <p><em>B. dermatitidis</em> grows as budding yeast-like form in the host tissue and on enriched media at 35–37°C; and as a typical mould-like form at 25–30°C. Inhalation of either, the yeast-like forms or the arthroconidia of the mould-like form, can cause disease. The disease is very common in North America and therefore, is also called North American blastomycosis.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Blastomycosis is more common in individuals who work with soil or wood. The infection is acquired by inhalation of the yeast form or arthrospores of the mould form. Primary infection resembles tuberculosis or histoplasmosis. The fungus may spread from the lungs to other parts of the body through the blood stream, and form multiple abscesses.</p>
                            <p>Primary cutaneous blastomycosis may be caused by inoculation of <em>B. dermatitidis</em> directly into the skin. The initial lesion is a papule, around which secondary nodules develop and later undergo ulceration.</p>

                            <h3>Laboratory diagnosis</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Specimens</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">(i) Sputum, collected on three consecutive days or at 2–3 days intervals.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">(ii) Pus from involved organs.</span></li>

                            </ol>

                            <h4>Techniques</h4>
                            <p><strong>(i) Direct KOH mount:</strong> Microscopic examination of the KOH mount of the specimen shows large yeast cells, 8–15 μm in size, with a typical double-contoured, thick, refractile wall. Capsule is absent. Each yeast cell carries only a single bud, attached to the mother cell by a broad base (4–5 μm). They often remain attached till they have reached the size of the mother cell.</p>
                            <p>The tissue sections may be stained either by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain or Gomori’s methanamine silver (GMS) stain.</p>

                            <p><strong>(ii) Culture:</strong> Inoculate the specimen on Sabouraud’s agar and brain heart infusion blood agar (BHIBA). Incubate Sabouraud’s agar at 25–30°C and BHIBA at 37°C, for up to six weeks.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Mould form:</strong> At 30°C on Sabouraud's agar, the growth appears in the form of a mould in one to six weeks. The colonies may be white to tan in colour, glaborous (smooth) or cottony in texture with varying number of aerial hyphae.<br>Microscopically, the hyphae of the mould form are septate and delicate, measuring 1–2 μm in diameter. Round, smooth-walled conidia, 4–10 μm in diameter are produced at the end of slender conidiophores, resembling lollipops.</span>

                            <p>Coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the dry, arid regions of South Western USA, where <em>C. immitis</em> is present in soil and in rodents.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> The infection is acquired by inhalation of the infective arthroconidia of <em>C. immitis</em>. About 60% of those infected remain asymptomatic. The majority of symptomatic primary infections are characterised by cough, fever and chest pain which subside in two to three weeks. The infection, however, may become disseminated, with extension to other organs: meninges, bones, lymph nodes, skin and subcutaneous tissues. Development of disseminated disease is more common among dark-skinned races.</p>

                            <p><strong>KOH Mount:</strong> In the direct microscopic examination of KOH mount of the specimen, <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> occurs in the form of spherules ranging from 5–200 μm in diameter. When mature, the spherules have a thick wall and are filled with numerous round or irregularly shaped spores, called endospores (2–5 μm). A mature spherule may contain several hundred endospores. When the sporulation is complete, the wall of the spherule ruptures and releases the endospores. These liberated endospores develop into mature spherules (Fig.5.7b).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Saline mount:</strong> Sometimes, large mononuclear cells filled with granules resemble spherules of <em>C. immitis</em>. For confirmation, a wet preparation of the specimen is prepared using sterile saline, the edges of the coverglass are sealed with petroleum jelly or DPX and incubated overnight at 30°C. When spherules are present, multiple strands of hyphae protrude from the endospores.</p>

                                    <p>Because of its highly infectious nature, culture of <em>C. immitis</em> represents a biohazard to laboratory workers. Strict safety precautions must be followed when examining cultures. Use of petri dishes is not recommended. Test tube (25 × 150 mm) agar slants should be used. All manipulations should be performed in a safety cabinet.</p>

                            <p><strong>Mould form:</strong> Colonies of <em>C. immitis</em> appear on Sabouraud's agar within three to five days, but may take up to three weeks. Some portions of the colony show aerial hyphae appearing fluffy, while other areas are smooth. The colour of the colonies ranges from pink to yellow in different isolates.</p>
                            <p>Microscopic examination of the colonies with lactophenol cotton blue shows small septate hyphae, which, in older cultures, break down to form rectangular or barrel-shaped darkly staining arthroconidia. The arthroconidia are separated from one another by clear or lighter staining non-viable or empty cells. These are referred to as alternate arthroconidia.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Spherule form:</strong> In vitro conversion to spherule form occurs on modified converse medium when incubated at 40°C. However, it should be done only in reference laboratories to avoid the hazard of infection.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Exoantigen test:</strong> It is highly sensitive and specific test for the identification of <em>C. immitis</em>.</p>

                            <p><strong>Causative agent:</strong> The aetiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis is <em>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</em>. It is a dimorphic fungus which occurs as a yeast in tissues and on enriched media at 37°C; and as a mould at 25-30°C.</p>
                            <p>The infection is most commonly found in South America, especially in Brazil, Venezuela and Columbia, and less frequently in Mexico and Africa.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> Paracoccidioidomycosis is acquired by inhalation of fungal elements from the environment. The exact source of infection is not known. The primary lung infection is generally asymptomatic and self healing. It may progress to symptomatic pulmonary or systemic disease. The most common sites are pulmonary, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneous regions. Ulcerative lesions occur most commonly on the face and in the oral mucosa. Dissemination to other sites, such as the lymphatic system, spleen, intestines, liver, brain, meninges and adrenal glands may occur in some patients.</p>

                            <p><strong>Causative agent:</strong> The primary cause of histoplasmosis world wide, especially in the central and southern states of USA is <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>. Another species, <em>Histoplasma duboisii</em> is recognized as the agent of African histoplasmosis. Both fungi are intracellular parasites of the reticulo-endothelial system, and both are dimorphic. They grow as budding yeast cells in tissue or on specific enriched media at 37°C, while in the soil or on media incubated at room temperature, they exhibit the mould form.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Clinical disease:</strong> The fungus is present in the soil, rotting trees and is abundant in bird faeces. Numerous cases of histoplasmosis have been reported in persons cleaning poultry farms. Infection is acquired by inhalation, but a large majority of cases are asymptomatic. Some of the infected persons develop pulmonary disease which resembles tuberculosis. Macroconidia of the mould form is the most likely infectious particle, which after reaching the lung converts into a yeast form and localises intracellularly in the monocytic phagocytes. Encapsulation, and eventually, calcification of the infected site occurs. Disseminated histoplasmosis develops only in a small minority of infected individuals, involving virtually any organ in the body through haematogenous spread. The reticuloendothelial system is most primarily involved with resultant hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, fever and may lead to death. Granulomatous and ulcerative lesions may develop on the skin and mucosa.</p>

                            <p>Unstained preparation such as a KOH mount is usually unsatisfactory for the detection of <em>Histoplasma</em> yeast form in tissues. Preparations from the peripheral blood, bone marrow, urine deposit, impression smears of the tissue or scrapings from the mucosal lesions should be stained with Giemsa and examined microscopically.</p>
                            <p><em>H. capsulatum</em> appears as intracellular yeasts, 2–4 μm in diameter, as round bodies with a central stained area and a halo-like capsule surrounding it. They are present in monocytes, macrophages and sometimes in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.</p>

                            <h5>Culture</h5>
                            <p><strong>Mould form:</strong> For the mould form inoculate the specimen on Sabouraud's agar and incubate at 30°C for four weeks. Histoplasma grows very slowly as a mould at 30°C and usually requires two to four weeks. The growth begins as a white, cottony colony which turns brown to buff with age.</p>
                            <p>Microscopically, the hyphae are small (1–2 μm) forming rope-like strands. Large round macroconidia (8–14 μm) are seen in young cultures which later become roughened and show tubercle-like projections. These tuberculated macroconidia is the most distinctive feature of the mould form. Microconidia (2–4 μm), round or pyriform in shape, are also produced, which are regarded as the infectious particles.</p>
                            <p><em>H. capsulatum</em> and <em>H. duboisii</em> are indistinguishable in the mould form. The mould form can be converted into the yeast form by inoculating it on enriched media and incubating at 37°C.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Yeast form:</strong> For the yeast form, inoculate the specimen on brain heart infusion blood agar or yeast extract phosphate medium and incubate at 37°C for four weeks. It is recommended that the growth should be successively subcultured at weekly intervals three to four times. Conversion from the mould form to the yeast form is difficult and requires several successive transfers at three to five days intervals.</p>
                            <p>Colonies of yeast are mucoid, membranous, white to tan in colour. Microscopically, a mixture of swollen hyphae and budding yeast cells, similar to those seen intracellularly in macrophages, are visible.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Exoantigen test:</strong> This test should be performed if a definitive identification is not reached on the basis of microscopy and culture.</p>
