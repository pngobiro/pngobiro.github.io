                            <p>The isolation and identification of the aetiological agent from a clinical specimen is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of a fungal infection. Occasionally, however, it may not be possible to isolate the fungus. In such cases, immunological and serological tests can provide an additional information which can lead to a diagnosis.</p>
                            
                            <p>The specific immune response resulting from the exposure to the cell wall, cytoplasmic or extracellular fungal antigens during infections can be used for the diagnosis of mycotic infections. By monitoring this response, the prognosis and the result of therapy can also be assessed. The humoral antibody production or the presence of fungal antigens in the body fluids can be detected by serological methods. In vivo skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation tests are used to detect changes in cell-mediated immunity. The type of immune response depends on the fungus involved, the form of the disease and the immunological competence of the host.</p>

                            <p>Persons who are infected with fungi such as <em>Histoplasma</em> or <em>Coccidioides</em> develop a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction within one to fourteen days of infection. The sensitisation persists for many years and can be demonstrated by a skin test. If a fungal extract or a culture filtrate of the fungus is inoculated intradermally into the patient, the sensitisation of the patient is indicated by the appearance of induration (swelling) and erythema (redness) at the site of injection within 24 to 72 hours.</p>

                                    <p>In areas where a particular fungal infection is endemic, a large proportion of the population may show a positive skin test due to previous exposure to the sensitising fungal antigen. In such cases, the skin test is more useful for epidemiological work than for diagnosis.</p>
                                    <p>Because of the complex nature of the fungal antigens and the sharing of antigens by some fungi, cross-reactions can occur. This can be overcome by testing with several fungal antigens simultaneously so that the relative strength of reaction to each antigen can be compared.</p>
                                    <p>Moreover, a false negative skin test can be obtained if the infection is at an early stage or when the cellular immunity is impaired.</p>

                            <h3>1. Detection of antibodies</h3>
                            <p>The techniques used for the detection of antibodies and antigens are essentially the same as those commonly used for other microorganisms. The tests detect antibodies belonging to IgG, IgM and IgA subclasses of immunoglobulins. The predominant class of antibody produced depends on the host, the fungus and the type and stage of infection.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <div class="callout-header">

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>The use of serological tests for antibody detection is limited only to the diagnosis of systemic and subcutaneous infections because there is minimal or no humoral response in superficial mycoses.</p>
                                    <p>For some diseases, there may be cross-reactions due to the complex and crude nature of antigenic extracts, which may make the interpretation and diagnosis very difficult. Unfortunately, this problem is most acute in opportunistic systemic mycoses which are very difficult to diagnose by other means. Testing of paired sera is useful to detect a rise in titre. At least two to four-fold rise in titre indicates a current infection.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Antibodies of the IgM class can be detected about two weeks after the infection. If detected, their presence indicates a recent infection. Usually these antibodies are not detectable after six months of infection. IgM antibodies can be detected by precipitation, agglutination or immunodiffusion methods. On the other hand IgG antibodies appear shortly after the rise in IgM titre and may remain in high titre from 6-12 weeks to many months after infection. A single high titre of IgG antibodies, therefore, does not necessarily mean a current infection. IgG antibodies can be detected by tests such as complement fixation or immunodiffusion.</p>

                            <h3>2. Detection of Antigens</h3>
                            <p>Tests for the detection of fungal antigens are particularly useful in the early stages of the disease and in patients with impaired immunity when tests for antibody detection are of limited value. For example, the latex agglutination test for the detection of capsular antigen in cerebrospinal fluid is used to establish early diagnosis of cryptococcal infection.</p>
                            <p>Antigen detection tests are available for the detection of antigens of <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida</em> species. The tests need to be very sensitive to be able to detect the low levels of circulating antigens.</p>
                            <p>Commercial kits are also available for serological tests for some fungal diseases.</p>
