                            <p>Bacteria are microscopic unicellular organisms. The unit of measurement of bacteria is the micrometre $(\mu \mathrm{m})$ and it is 1/1000 of a millimetre $(.001\mu \mathrm{m})$. Morphological classification of bacteria is based on the following types of shapes of cells:</p>
                            
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                        <strong>The spheroid or ovoid or coccus.</strong> These groups of bacteria are popularly called cocci (plural of coccus). They measure about $0.5 - 1\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter. Sometimes these cells are flattened or distorted to give a change in shape.
                                        <p>The bacteria multiply by binary fission. During multiplication, the daughter cell is attached to the parent cell but it gets detached before fission occurs again. The pairs of cocci seen are referred to as <strong>diplococci</strong>. If the fission continues while they remain attached, chains of cocci are formed, and are referred to as <strong>streptococci</strong>. If the division is not in one plain and clusters of cocci are formed randomly, they are known as <strong>staphylococci</strong>. <strong>Tetrads</strong> (or tetracoci) are formed when the cocci remain in pairs for two consecutive divisions and form regular aggregates of four cocci. When the terms Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are used as generic names, the first letter is a capital letter.</p>

The bacilli (plural) or rods may remain attached after division and they are called <strong>streptobacilli</strong>; or they may be arranged at varying angles to one another due to incomplete separation after cell division, thus giving the appearance of Chinese lettering. This is characteristic of the genus <em>Corynebacterium</em>.
                                        <p>The morphology of some of these bacilli may be affected as a result of the formation of spores during unfavourable conditions. Some species contain these spores in the centre with or without bulging and others may have them at terminal ends or towards one end.</p>

                                        <strong>Pili</strong> Extruding from the cytoplasmic membrane are shorter and finer filaments than the flagella. These are the pili. Some of them are referred to as <strong>sex pili</strong> because of their role during conjugation when genes are transferred from one cell to another. Majority of them are referred to as <strong>common pili or fimbriae</strong>. These are thought to be the organs of adhesion that help bacteria to attach to the host cells.

                                        <strong>Capsule</strong> This is a layer of loose slimy material which surrounds some bacterial cells. The capsules are composed mainly of polymers of polysaccharides or peptides. They resist phygocytosis and so their presence on a bacterium is associated with virulence. They are identified by negative staining due to their low affinity for simple stains.

                                        <strong>Cell Wall</strong> The cell wall is a prominent distinguishing feature of the bacterial cell with a rigidity and strength that protects the cellular contents. Chemically, the cell wall consists of peptidoglycan, a mucopeptide that is composed of alternating strands of N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues, cross-linked with peptide subunits. The peptidoglycan gives rigidity and shape to the organism. Structurally, the cell wall of a Gram positive bacterium differs from that of a Gram negative bacterium (Fig. 2.4). The Gram positive cell wall is much more sturdy than the Gram negative one due to high content of peptidoglycan. It has neither an outer membrane that contains specific proteins nor a periplasmic space, both of which are present in the Gram negative cell. Teichoic acids are also part of the cell wall of Gram positive bacteria. The Gram negative cell wall has a thin peptidoglycan layer with no teichoic acids. It has an outer membrane which consists of lipopolysaccharides. The lipopolysaccharide is toxic to humans. It is called endotoxin.

                                        <strong>Spores</strong> These are dense structures produced by the bacteria, e.g., the <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>Clostridium</em> groups, that enable them to survive adverse environmental conditions. They develop within and at the expense of the vegetative cell. The spore comprises the chromosomal material surrounded by several layers of walls. The location and shape of the spore in the cell may be of diagnostic assistance, e.g., the spores of <em>Clostridium tetani</em> are terminal, and the diameter is greater than that of the parent cell, so that they are characteristically of drum stick appearance. The positions of spores are described as terminal, subterminal or central. Spores are resistant to heat, stains, desiccation and disinfectants. Each spore germinates to produce a vegetative cell during favourable growth conditions.
