                            <p>Microbiology is the study of microorganisms which are organisms so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. They can be observed only with the aid of a microscope. The ordinary brightfield microscope is mostly employed for routine microbiological work, though others like phase-contrast, darkfield, fluorescence and electron microscopes are also used.</p>
                            
                            <p>Microorganisms are found almost everywhere in nature. They are in constant interaction with human and other life cycles. Some bacteria, for example, are normal constituents of the human intestine. These microorganisms and their host benefit from such co-existence: The organisms derive food materials from the host, and some of the host's essential vitamins for existence are synthesised by the organisms. There are however certain microorganisms that are harmful to their hosts, that is, they can cause diseases. These microorganisms are known as pathogens. Those organisms that do not cause any harm are called commensals. This broad classification of microorganisms is not definitive because some commensals under certain conditions can become harmful to the host. The role of the medical microbiologist is to isolate and identify pathogens and develop effective ways to eliminate or control them.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Before the discovery of microorganisms, all living things were thought to belong to either the animal or the plant kingdom. In 1675, Anthony von Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch draper, described little animals (animalcules) which he saw with the aid of his simple home-made microscope while examining stagnant rain water. He described many kinds of cells which included protozoa, algae, yeasts and bacteria. He was the first on record to observe microorganisms. Many workers in different parts of the world did a lot of pioneering work in the study of microorganisms. But Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, was by far the most outstanding figure in this regard. As a result of his brilliant researches between 1860 and 1869, he was able to show that microorganisms caused diseases. The contributions of numerous other scientists of the time led to an increase in the knowledge of microbiology.</p>
                            
                            <p>This increased knowledge also led to the discovery of many varieties of microorganisms and brought about some confusion as to where to place micro-organisms within the two kingdom of living things. Furthermore, these many varieties of micro-organisms needed to be differentiated from each other. Taxonomy is the process of dividing organisms into ordered groups based on biological relationship between them. Labelling of groups and of individual members within groups is known as nomenclature. The whole process of classifying microorganisms is highly complicated and many workers have chosen to approach the topic from different perspectives. Classification based on evolutionary (ancestry) origins is called phylogenetic classification, and that based on easily recognisable characteristics or features is called 'artificial' classification. Numerical taxonomy is a mathematical approach in which all features are given equal value. This is the original Adansonian concept. The advent of computers has made this approach to taxonomy easier to apply. Another concept that has found favour with many workers is the determination of the DNA base composition: members of the same species will have identical cellular DNA.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 1866, Haeckel proposed the establishment of a third and separate kingdom of living organisms, the Protista, which was defined to include algae, protozoa, fungi, viruses and bacteria. In 1957, Stanier divided the Protista into the eukaryotic (higher) and prokaryotic (lower) groups based on cell types. The eukaryotic cells which are found in protozoa, fungi, and algae, contain a nucleus bound by a nuclear membrane and undergo true mitosis. The prokaryotic organisms possess a nuclear structure of a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ring with no nuclear membrane.</p>

                            <p>Biological classification methods provide the medical microbiologist with relatively simple ways for placing microbes into categories according to their morphological and biochemical properties. The word species is commonly used in this system of classification. It is the basic unit in the hierarchy of microbial world. The basis of this category is that members of the same species are able to reproduce others of their kind.</p>
                            
                            <p>The next higher classification is the genus. The same genus comprises several species which may differ in several aspects. The genus of the microbe is usually abbreviated and the species written in full; it must start with a capital letter while the species starts with a small letter, e.g., <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is written as <em>S. aureus</em>. Further up the ladder of classification, micro-organisms with similar features are placed in successive larger categories. Thus similar genera are grouped into families, similar families are categorised as order; similar order make up class; similar classes make up the phylum (Fig. 1.1).</p>

                            <p>The wide and ever expanding variety of microorganisms has resulted in the break up of Microbiology into separate specialised sections of Bacteriology (the study of bacteria), Virology (the study of viruses), Mycology (the study of fungi), Parasitology (the study of parasites) and lately serology - immunology (the study of antigen/antibody reaction and immunity).</p>
                            
                            <p>This fragmentation has sufficiently lessened the initial confusion in the general classification of microorganisms. The problems faced by the early pioneers in the field of Microbiology with regards to taxonomy and nomenclature are far from being over today. There is constant arranging and re-arranging and renaming of microbes as new information is being discovered. The reader is referred to Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology and the reports and publications of the International subcommittee on Taxonomy and Nomenclature for more and detailed information on this topic.</p>
