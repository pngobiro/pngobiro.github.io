                            <p>The manipulation of bacterial colonies of organisms isolated from clinical specimens and their exact identification depend to a large extent, on the laboratory scientist knowledge of theoretical bacteriology. The scientist should have basic understanding of disease aetiology to guide him in the use of different techniques to help him interpret his findings.</p>
                            
                            <p>The general and specific characteristics of bacteria present valuable information for identification. Some of this information is gained from observation. The action of bacteria on various substrates derives from the possession by the bacteria, of specific enzymes that bring about decomposition and fermentation. The observed change in the identification test may be known but the result cannot be deduced and may lead to further identification tests. Many other facts and data of diagnostic importance are of necessity to be memorised. For example, the Gram's stain reaction and morphology of the most commonly encountered bacteria should be at the finger-tips of the bench scientist.</p>

                            <p>For the bench bacteriologist to function effectively, it is worth trying to remember some important species or strain specific reactions e.g. the oxidase + reaction of <em>Ps. aeruginosa</em>, or the urease + reaction of <em>Proteus</em> species, or the coagulase + reaction of <em>Staph. aureus</em> or the non-motility of <em>Shigella</em> species. A knowledge of majority reactions is very useful in the systematic identification of bacteria. A few discriminative tests may easily help to differentiate between related species.</p>
                            
                            <p>The systemic approach to the identification of an isolated bacterium is referred to as Systemic Bacteriology. The bench bacteriologist combines his general knowledge of bacteria and the clinical information (including the anatomical site of specimen) as contained in the request form to initiate a systematic identification of an isolate.</p>

                            <h3>1. Colonial Morphology</h3>
                            <p>Usually, with careful observation of the colonial morphology of the organism, an experienced bacteriologist may know or have a good idea of the likely identity of the bacterium. Reaction on a differential medium may be helpful e.g. lactose fermenting or non-lactose fermenting colonies; haemolytic action or non-haemolytic action on blood agar. The presence of pigmentation is also taken into account. The practice of sniffing the culture to determine any specific odour is now frowned upon as bad laboratory practice for safety reasons. However, the characteristic odour of some bacteria is a useful diagnostic guide.</p>

                            <h3>2. Gram Stain</h3>
                            <p>Gram stain is a very useful procedure in systematic bacteriology. For a beginner or an inexperienced laboratory scientist the first step in the arduous task of bacterial identification is the Gram stain. The Gram staining technique must be properly mastered. A badly stained smear can be very misleading. For instance, under decolourised gram negative bacilli become gram positive, while over decolourised gram positive cocci will be read as gram negative cocci. If the first step is wrong, the choice of subsequent tests may be wrong. Gram stain, when properly done, is a useful guide in the initiation of tests required for identifying an isolate.</p>
                            
                            <p>Gram stain reaction will usually point to the next set of tests to be done. It is the rule not to name or identify any bacterium by the Gram stain result, especially for a beginner. The morphology of the stained bacteria, in many cases, is not definitive. Even a trained eye sometimes gets confused by the shape and size of the stained bacteria. However, an experienced hand, who, for example, recognises lactose fermenting colonies, may not need to do a Gram stain; he can confidently go on with the other tests.</p>

                            <h3>3. Biochemical Tests</h3>
                            <p>Gram stain result determines the type of biochemical tests to be done. These tests can be in the form of any of the various identification systems such as the API.</p>

                            <h3>4. Serological Tests</h3>
                            <p>From the results of the biochemical reactions, the identity of some bacterial species may need to be confirmed with a serological test. This is true of enteric pathogenes such as <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Shigella</em> species.</p>

                            <h3>5. General Guidelines</h3>
                            <p>The laboratory should keep among its reference books, a reference identification manual. It is most helpful where full identification of a bacterial isolate is carried out on a routine basis. The bench bacteriologist usually has a feeling of satisfaction when he successfully identifies a bacterium, especially if it is one of the rare organisms.</p>
                            
                            <p>Systematic bacteriology is the core of the work of a clinical bacteriology laboratory. It requires patience and perseverance. It keeps the bacteriologist on the alert to always remember some specific remaining of bacteria, the laboratory scientist who is confused than others.</p>
