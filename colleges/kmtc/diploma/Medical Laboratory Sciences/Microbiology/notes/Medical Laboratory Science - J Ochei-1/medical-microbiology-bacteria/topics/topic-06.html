                            <p>Genetics is the study of inheritance and variation. The concept of inheritance refers to those processes responsible for the high degree of similarity between parent and offspring. All inherited characteristics exhibited by the microorganisms are encoded in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). With the typical prokaryotic (bacterial) cell, the DNA (which is the chromosome) lacks the nuclear membrane and because its length is about 1200 times that of the entire cell, it is twisted, coiled, double-stranded and packaged into a highly compact form.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to the chromosome, the bacterial cell has another DNA structure called plasmid. Plasmids are also double stranded DNA molecules which are smaller than the chromosomes and can replicate independently of the chromosomes. The hereditary information (i.e. genetic code) of a cell is the result of ordered arrangement of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.</p>

                                    <p>DNA replication is the process that copies the nucleotide sequence of a double-stranded parent DNA molecule into two double stranded daughter DNA molecules, each of which will end up in a daughter cell. This process is known as <strong>semi-conservative replication</strong>. This is because each strand of DNA is conserved intact during replication and becomes one of the two strands of the new daughter cell while the other strand is synthesised.</p>
                                    <p>The enzyme, <strong>DNA polymerase</strong>, is the major enzyme involved in DNA replication. It promotes complimentary activity between nucleotide base of the new DNA strand and a corresponding nucleotide base on the parental DNA strand. Each strand of DNA functions as a template or pattern that specifies the sequence of bases in the newly formed complementary strand. DNA replication in bacteria starts at a specific site on the DNA strand called the origin.</p>

                            <p>Genetic messages prompt the production of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins, which are essential components of all living cells. A gene is the unit of the DNA that contains the nucleotide sequence for making the RNA and a particular protein. A DNA molecule contains thousands of genes, one for each protein. The DNA controls its own replication, synthesis of RNA and eventual formation of protein.</p>

                            <h3>Transcription</h3>
                            <p>Transcription involves the synthesis of DNA. It is the process whereby the genetic information in DNA is sent to a molecule of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This transcription involves only one of the two DNA strands. The enzyme responsible for the transcribing of this genetic message is the DNA dependent RNA polymerase. Transcription begins at promoter sites and ends at termination sites on the DNA (Fig. 6.1).</p>

                            <h3>Translation</h3>
                            <p>It is the function of the ribosomes which are made up of proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to translate the coded message in the mRNA to produce a particular protein from amino acids. A bacterial ribosome consists of a 50-S subunit and a 30-S subunit which combine during protein synthesis to form a complete 70-S ribosome. The amino acids are first of all energised (activated) with ATP and then linked to the end of special RNA molecules, the transfer RNA (tRNA) which carry the amino acids to the ribosomes. There is a specific tRNA for each of 20 amino acids which, after activation, are carried to the ribosome which links the amino acids together to form a protein. There may be several ribosomes actively involved in translating a single mRNA molecule at the same time. (Fig. 6.2).</p>

                            <p>Genetic variation is a common occurrence in the bacterial world. It is associated with two fundamental properties of an organism—its genotype and phenotype.</p>

This includes the chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA in the bacterial cell. The genotype represents the inheritable total potential of a cell.</span>

                            <p>Phenotypic changes are influenced by the genotype and the environment of the organism. For instance, bacteria of the genus <em>Proteus</em> when grown in the presence of an electrolyte will swarm all over the medium but will not swarm in the absence of an electrolyte. This shows that some phenotypic changes are caused by changes in the environment rather than by the genetic information in the cell.</p>
                            
                            <p>Genotypic changes are the result of changes in the DNA. It can be as a result of:</p>

                            <p>Any gene can undergo chemical alteration in DNA in which one or more bases are changed. This change is called mutation and is heritable. A cell or an organism having a mutated gene is a mutant, and the parent cell with a normal (non-mutated) gene is called the wild type. The gene defect may lead to:</p>

                            <p>Mutation may occur spontaneously without any obvious cause, or as a result of exposure to a mutagen. A mutagen is any agent, physical or chemical, that causes the mutation rate (number of mutation per gene per generation) to exceed the normal spontaneous rate. Mutagens affect the DNA by altering its structure and that of its components. Physical mutagens include ultraviolet (UV) light and X-rays, while well known chemical mutagens include nitrous oxide, acridine orange dye and ethyl methane sulphonate.</p>

                            <p>Recombination is a process in which there is a genetic transfer between two homologous chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have similar genes at corresponding sites. Though the genes may be similar, they are not necessarily identical. Such corresponding genes with differing identity are called <em>alleles</em>. But because the bacterial cell contains a single chromosome, a homologous chromosome (usually a portion of it) must first be transferred from a donor bacterium to the recipient bacterium. Since the chromosomes must be similar, therefore the donor and recipient bacteria are usually of the same species or closely related.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are three ways of gene transfer that can alter DNA gene content and lead to recombination:</p>

                            <p>Transformation is when fragments of exogenous or 'free floating' bacterial DNA molecules are taken up and absorbed into recipient cell. It is the simplest form of gene transfer. Sometimes, the transferring DNA may come from dead cells that lyse and release their DNA into the surrounding medium. It is extracted in the laboratory by chemical methods from a suspension of donor bacteria which is then mixed with the culture of recipient bacteria.</p>
                            
                            <p>Transformation occurs in bacteria which are competent enough to take up the light molecular weight DNA. It occurs in three stages:</p>

                            <h3>Transduction</h3>
                            <p>When a fragment of donor chromosome is transferred to the recipient by a bacteriophage (bacterial virus), the process is known as transduction. The bacteriophage (or simply phage) consists of a nucleic acid (usually DNA), surrounded by a protein coat to form a head, and a tail. The tail is used to attach the phage to the surface of a susceptible bacterium. It takes place in both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. The phage injects its DNA into the host cell and the injected DNA begins to replicate rapidly while the host DNA is degraded. From there on, the phage DNA directs the synthesis of new phage proteins by the host cell (Fig. 6.5). During replication of a bacteriophage, a fragment of bacterial DNA may accidentally become enclosed within a phage particle instead of the normal phage DNA. When this phage particle infects a second bacterial host cell, the DNA from the first bacterium is released and becomes recombined into the chromosome of the second bacterium. This leads to a new combination of genes on the chromosome.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is also possible to transfer plasmid DNA via transduction. The transduced plasmid can then function and replicate independently, that is without having to recombine into the chromosome of the bacterial cell.</p>
                            
                            <p>Transduction can either be generalised, when the phage has roughly equal chance of carrying any segment of the donor's chromosomes; or restricted, when the transducing particles carry only those fragments that are immediately adjacent to the site of phage attachment.</p>

                            <h3>Conjugation</h3>
                            <p>Conjugation is a process of gene transfer involving cell to cell contact. This characteristic distinguishes it from transduction and transformation. In conjugation, DNA may be transferred directly from one bacterium to another, the DNA may be chromosomal or plasmid. The plasmid transfer takes place via a hollow tube formed by a sex pilus (Fig. 6.6). Plasmid <em>tra</em> genes encode the formation of the pilus.</p>

                            <p>Plasmids are small extra chromosomal genetic elements hosted by many bacteria. They are not usually necessary for host survival but they assume some measure of importance when the genes they carry confer new properties on the host. Plasmids are circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Their molecular weights range from $3 \times 10^{6}$ to $1 \times 10^{8}$. They replicate independently. They are generally named according to the functions they perform or the properties they impart to the host.</p>
                            
                            <p>Conjugative plasmids are those transmitted by conjugation from bacteria to bacteria. Such a plasmid is the <em>E. coli</em> F (F for fertility) plasmid described below. Non conjugative plasmids are not transferred by conjugation but by transduction, or by transformation. These plasmids can be transferred to a recipient cell by the co-operation of conjugative plasmids which may be co-existing with them in the same cell.</p>

                            <p>Some specific functions of the plasmids are:</p>

                                        <strong>Sex factors:</strong> The donor cell carries a plasmid called F plasmid which contains about 40 genes that control the plasmid replication. It also controls the synthesis of the sex pilus. The most widely studied is the F sex factor of <em>E. coli</em> K 12.
                                        <p>Cells containing F plasmid (donors cells) are called F⁺ cells, while the cells (recipient cells) that lack the F plasmid are the F⁻ cells. In a mixture of F⁺ and F⁻ cells, the end of the F⁺ sex pilus binds to a nearby F⁻ cell and then retracts, thereby pulling the F⁻ and F⁺ cells into close contact (Fig. 6.7). A bridge, sex pilus, is formed between the two cells through which one DNA strand from the donor cell's F plasmid is transferred to the F⁻ (recipient) cell. Once this is accomplished, the DNA strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a second, complementary DNA strand. The ends of the double-stranded DNA molecule then join to form the typical circular F plasmid, thus the recipient cell now becomes an F⁺ (donor) cell capable of donating DNA. In this way, the process of conjugation (recombination) continues until all the F⁻ cells are converted to F⁺ cells.</p>
                                        <p>Usually, it is only the donor's F plasmid that moves to the F⁻ cell in an F⁺ × F⁻ cross. It is not common for chromosomal genes to be transferred along with F plasmid, it occurs only in about 1 in 10 million recombinations. There are however cells that can transfer chromosomal genes at a much faster rate—about 1000 times greater than those transferred by the usual F⁺ cells. These cells in which these fast rates take place are called high-frequency recombination (Hfr) cells. They are F⁺ cells whose F plasmid has become integrated into the bacterial chromosome (Fig. 6.8). This means that the plasmid is no longer capable of independent replication. In an Hfr and F⁻ mixture, the frequency of gene recombination is high while the transfer of the F plasmid is low.</p>

                                        <strong>Col factors or bacteriocinogenic plasmid:</strong> The genes carried by these plasmids direct the host bacterium to produce certain protein that kills bacteria belonging to the same or closely related species and lacking the plasmid. This protein is called colicin or bacteriocin. The bacterium producing a particular bacteriocin is not killed by the bacteriocin though it can be killed by any other bacteriocin. They are used to type the different subgroups of bacteria such as <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> species. They are thus useful in determining the source of infection during an outbreak.

Such antibiotic resistance genes code for an enzyme that destroys or inactivates a particular antibiotic. For example, most strains of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> isolated in hospitals contain an R plasmid containing a gene that codes for β lactamase which is an enzyme that inactivates penicillin and many of its derivatives. Some of the R plasmids are conjugative plasmids which readily transfer antibiotic resistance genes directly to other bacteria by conjugation. This is of great medical importance because it renders the treatment of infections very difficult.

                            <p>The laboratory procedure called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most significant achievements in molecular biology. With this procedure, it is possible to make several copies of one or more genes from very tiny initial amounts of DNA. Large quantities of DNA can be made from very small amounts present in substances such as water, food, blood, hairs and a host of clinical samples. This phenomenon has a great application in microbiology, e.g., for making clinical diagnosis and for solving medico-legal problems. The PCR is a wonderful tool in the diagnosis of genetic disorder, such as sickle cell diseases, in a foetus. It is particularly useful in detecting infection by the AIDS virus when other methods have failed.</p>
                            
                            <p>The technique is based on the amplification of trace amount of DNA to very large amounts. The first material for a PCR is a part of the double-stranded DNA containing a nucleotide sequence with the target gene. The procedure roughly follows the following stages:</p>
