                            <p>Specific antibody mediated immune response is also referred to as humoral immune response. The cells responsible for the synthesis of antibody molecules are B-lymphocytes. Each immunocompetent B-lymphocyte has an immunoglobulin of appropriately coded specificity on its surface, before its exposure to the antigen. The specificity of the antibody molecule for a particular antigen is determined at the level of the gene.</p>
                            <p>The undifferentiated stem cell has a set of genes capable of coding for 10^6 to 10^8 different types of antibody molecules. These immunoglobulin genes occur on widely separated fragments of DNA. For example, the set of genes for heavy (H) chain coding are separate from those coding for light (L) chains.</p>

                            <h3>Activation of B-lymphocytes</h3>
                            <p>Activation of B-lymphocytes by an antigen can be either dependent or independent of T-cells, which, in turn, depends on the nature of the antigen.</p>

                                    <p>Antigens that are made up of large polymers with repeating identical subunits can directly induce B-lymphocytes to produce specific antibodies. Such antigens have many antigenic determinants or epitopes and are capable of stimulating many clones of B-lymphocytes. These are called polyclonal activators, e.g. lipopolysaccharide.</p>
                                    <p>The subunits of the antigen bind to the binding sites on the specific surface immunoglobulin molecules on B-lymphocytes. This stimulates the B-lymphocytes to proliferate into a clone of identical cells. They subsequently mature into plasma cells which produce and secrete antibody molecules into the body fluids.

When such 'resting' or non-activated Th cells come in contact with the macrophage with the antigen-Ia complex on its surface, these two complexes bind with each other (Fig. 3.1).</span>

                                        (v) At this stage, the resting Th cell is activated by a monokine (Interleukin-1, IL-1) produced by the macrophage. The activated Th undergoes a series of biochemical changes resulting in self stimulatory response by:
                                        <br>(a) production of large quantities of lymphokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2).

                                    <span class="list-content">(vi) Binding of IL-2 to its receptor on the activated Th leads to the proliferation of Th to produce a clone of identical Th cells specific for the inducing antigen. Thus the response is amplified at this stage.</span>

                                        (vii) B-lymphocytes can come in contact with the antigen in three different ways:

                                        <br>(b) Presentation of the antigen by an activated Th cell to B-cell.

                            <h3>Primary Antibody Response</h3>
                            <p>When an individual is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it results in the primary antibody response. Characteristically, in the primary response, there is a lag period before any antibody is produced. This is due to the time required for the activation of B-cells after the first exposure to the antigen. This lag period depends on the type and dose of antigen, its route of entry, as well as host related factors. Generally, the lag period is for three-four days before detectable levels of antibody appear. The first immunoglobulin to be produced is IgM, which rises to a peak in one to ten weeks, then starts dropping below detectable levels over the next few weeks (Fig. 3.2).</p>
                            <p>The production of IgG is slower, and begins about one to two weeks after exposure, reaches a peak within a few weeks and gradually decreases over the next few months. Some IgG antibodies may be present in the body for years.</p>

                                Cell Mediated Immune Response (CMI)
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>CMI is another type of specific immune response and does not involve antibody. This is an important group of responses mediated by T-lymphocytes, in which B-lymphocytes do not play any role. CMI was originally identified by its role in immunity to tuberculosis and viral infections. It was also found to be involved in graft rejection, chronic inflammation, tumour immunity, and in delayed type hypersensitivity.</p>
                            <p>CMI is regulated by many suppressor cells and factors which are able to limit the damaging effect of CMI. However, in some diseases, this regulatory activity can impair the protective aspect of the system.</p>

                            <h3>Cytokines</h3>
                            <p>The process of cell mediated immunity (CMI) is carried out by T-lymphocytes and their products, lymphokines, with the help of monokines secreted by the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, namely, monocytes and macrophages. The lymphokines and monokines are grouped together as cytokines. Some cytokines are produced as an integral part of the immune response and are antigen specific, while others, although induced by the presence of an antigen, are antigen non-specific in function.</p>
                            <p>Depending on the role in the immune response, cytokines are classified into two groups.</p>
                            <p>Afferent cytokines have a role in the induction of primary immune responses. Efferent cytokines play a part in the suppression of immune responses.</p>

                                        <p>IL-2 is also known as T-cell growth factor (TCGF). It is a lymphokine produced by T-helper cells activated by IL-1. Activated T-cells produce IL-2, and at the same time receptors for IL-2 appear on their surface. (Fig. 3.1).</p>
                                        <p><strong>Functions of IL-2</strong></p>
                                        <p>(a) Proliferation of Th cells When IL-2 interacts with the IL-2 receptor on the surface of T-helper (Th) cell, it results in proliferation of Th cells, which in turn, amplify the immune response. The activated T-cells subsequently produce other interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6), which induce activation, proliferation and differentiation of B-cells.</p>
                                        <p>(b) Enhancement of killer cell activities IL-2 rapidly enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity. It increases specific killing ability of cytotoxic lymphocytes in the presence of antigen. It also acts on null (non-T, Non-B) cells which are then capable of lysing NK-resistant tumour cells.</p>

                            <p>Cell mediated immunity (CMI) provides a specific immune response against infectious organisms. It also plays a role in tumour immunity, rejection of foreign grafts and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Cytotoxic killer cells (Tcx) are the principal effectors of CMI, except in delayed hypersensitivity reactions. When activated, they bring about the lysis of target cells such as virus infected cells, tumour cells or graft tissue.</p>
                            <p>The initiation of the immune response is the same as that for T-cell dependent activation of B-lymphocytes for the antibody mediated immune response.</p>
                            <p>Steps (i) to (v) of the mechanism of antibody mediated immunity are common to both AMI and CMI. Other steps in the mechanism of CMI are as follows:</p>

                            <p>The adaptive immune responses must be 'switched on' as a result of an antigenic stimulus and switched off when they are no longer required, so that a balance between help and suppression is achieved. The regulation of the immune system is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, such as:</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>T-helper (Th) and T-suppressor (Ts) cells</strong> These two types of cells act as a check and balance system for each other. Their functions are regulated by a complex network of cellular interactions and soluble mediators.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Cytokines</strong> These soluble products, secreted by cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells, have both positive and negative effects on the immune response. Afferent cytokines such as interleukins, interferons and B-cell stimulating factors help in building up the immune response whereas efferent cytokines, such as macrophages inhibition factor (MIF), leukocyte inhibition factor and lymphotoxins help in the suppression of the immune response.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Anti-idiotypic antibodies</strong> Idiotypes are unique amino acid sequences in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins which contribute directly to the antigen binding specificity of another antibody molecule (anti-idiotypes). Activation of the immune response may also result in the production of antibodies to the idiotype portion of the newly formed antibody molecules. These anti-idiotype antibodies may bind to the surface receptors on B-cells or to TcR on T-cells. Depending on the structure of anti-idiotypes, their attachment may have one of two consequences, namely:</p>

                            <h3>Immunotolerance</h3>
                            <p>Immunotolerance or immunological unresponsiveness is the condition in which contact with an antigen specifically destroys the capacity of the immune system to mount an immune response against that particular antigen. This tolerance is specific for that antigen only, the response to other antigens is unaffected. Immunotolerance is very undesirable in most infections, but is very useful in the case of an organ or tissue transplant.</p>
                            
                            <p>The induction of immunotolerance depends on the following factors:</p>
                            <p><strong>Immunological maturity of the host</strong> Immunological unresponsiveness of the host to the ‘self’ antigens is due to the contact of immature immunological system with these antigens during embryonic life. Similarly, any antigen which comes in contact with the immune system during embryonic life would be identified as the ‘self’ antigen and would not induce any immune response. For this reason, if animals of one strain are injected with the cells from a second strain <em>in utero</em>, the injected animal will accept these cells as self antigens. Another example of this type of immunotolerance is the vertical transmission of some tumour viruses from mother to foetus. The viruses multiply in the foetus and continue to persist after birth, without inducing any immune response as they are recognised as self-antigens.</p>
                            <p><strong>Physical state and dose of the antigen</strong> Tolerance, instead of immune response, can be induced if very low or very high doses of an antigen are administered. Intravenous injection of huge doses may lead to immune paralysis. The immune response may revive when most of the antigen is degraded or excreted.</p>
                            <p>The physical state of the antigen is also significant. Generally, soluble antigens and haptens are more likely to lead to immunotolerance than particulate antigens. Tolerance to an antigen may end spontaneously or by administration of a cross reacting antigen.</p>

                            <p>Hypersensitivity reactions are characterised by an altered state of immune responsiveness. Allergy is a commonly used synonym for hypersensitivity, and the antigen which causes allergy is called allergen. For hypersensitivity to occur, the host must receive an initial or sensitizing dose of the allergen. Subsequent contact with the same or related antigen, the shocking dose, results in the hypersensitivity reaction.</p>
                            <p>Hypersensitivity reactions are basically divided into two groups:</p>

                            <p>The basic mechanisms underlying hyper-sensitivity reactions are designed for host defense. However, direction of these mechanisms towards an inappropriate antigen or chronic activation of the mechanisms can lead to pathological consequences. On the basis of pathogenesis, hypersensitivity reactions have been classified into four major types by Gell and Coombs. Out of these, types I, II and III are antibody mediated. These are manifested within a few minutes to a few hours after exposure to the inducing antigen. Type IV hypersensitivity, on the other hand, is cell mediated. This is observed 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the antigen.</p>

The antigen-antibody complex may precipitate locally in a tissue, in and around small blood vessels or spread systemically via the blood stream.

                            <p>Autoimmunity is a condition in which immune responses are directed toward self-antigens with consequent structural and functional damage to the host. These immune responses may involve both humoral immunity with production of auto-antibodies, and cell-mediated immunity.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Mechanisms of autoimmunity</h3>
                            <p>Autoimmunity may result under various conditions, some of which are listed below:</p>
                            <p><strong>Altered antigen theory</strong> Alteration in the surface antigens of the tissues or cells can occur as a result of physical, chemical or biological influences. Such altered antigens are considered as ‘non-self’ and an immune response is mounted against them. Mutation, infection with viruses and exposure to ultraviolet light are examples of some factors which can alter surface antigens.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cross-reactive antigen theory</strong> Some complex foreign structures may possess structural parts which are similar or related to self-antigens. This results in immunological cross-reactivity. The immune response mounted against the foreign complex antigen may also cross-react with similar self-antigen. For example, antibodies against some strains of Group A streptococci may cross-react with heart muscle, causing rheumatic heart disease.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hidden or sequestered antigen theory</strong> Some self-antigens are 'hidden' in the circulation in normal healthy individuals. Such a self-antigen may come in contact with the immune system only at a later stage in life, when it is treated as non-self. Such antigens are known as hidden or sequestered antigens. The lens tissue of the eye, spermatozoa, central nervous tissue are examples of sequestered antigens. These antigens come in contact with cells of the immune system only after organ damage, such as eye injury.</p>
                            <p><strong>Forbidden clone theory</strong> Breakdown of immunoregulatory mechanism may lead to the loss of 'tolerance'. Under such conditions, antigen presentation by cells which are not normally specialised for this role, may give rise to self reactivity. For example, Class II antigens of the HLA system which are normally only expressed on antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and B-lymphocytes, appear on the thyrocytes in thyroiditis, and on liver cells in biliary cirrhosis. They stimulate autoreactive T-cells to induce cytotoxic T-cells and B-lymphocytes to respond against them.</p>

                            <h3>Examples of autoimmune diseases</h3>
                            <p><strong>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</strong> SLE is a systemic disease which occurs mainly in women and has a strong hereditary tendency. Patients develop a variety of autoantibodies directed against the cell nuclei, intracytoplasmic constituents, immunoglobulins and some organ specific antigens. The LE cell phenomenon is observed in SLE (see Haematology section).</p>
                            <p><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</strong> This is a chronic inflammatory disease, primarily affecting joints and surrounding tissues. The striking feature of the disease is the presence of several abnormal proteins circulating in the blood. These are a group of immunoglobulins which interact specifically with the antigenic determinants on the Fc fragment of the IgG molecules, i.e. they act as anti-antibodies to immunoglobulins. These proteins are collectively known as rheumatoid factor (RA factor).</p>
                            <p>Other examples of autoimmune diseases include myasthenia gravis, Addison's disease and pernicious anaemia</p>

                            <h3>Transplant Immunity</h3>
                            <p>When an organ or a tissue is irreparably damaged, defective or absent, its function can be restored by organ transplant or tissue grafting. Transplants or grafts survive better only when the organ or tissue is taken from the recipient himself or from an identical twin. The grafts from other individuals of the same species or different species would be rejected. The speed and vigour with which these transplants are rejected depends on their mutual degree of foreignness. This is related to the genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are four different types of transplants:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Autograft</strong> An organ or tissue taken from an individual and grafted on himself.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Isograft</strong> An organ or tissue taken from one individual (donor) and grafted on genetically identical individual (recipient) e.g. identical twins or highly inbred strains of animals.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Allograft</strong> Grafts between genetically non-identical members of the same species, e.g. human donor and recipient.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Xenografts</strong> Grafts between members of different species, e.g. mouse donor and guinea-pig recipient.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Generally, autografts and isografts are accepted because the grafts are genetically and antigenically compatible with the host-tissues. Allografts and xenografts are rejected due to genetic and antigenic incompatibility.</p>
                            <p>The main cause of incompatibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of each species, such as HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigen) system in man.</p>

                            <h4>Graft Versus Host (GVH) Reaction</h4>
                            <p>A grafted tissue may be rejected by the host due to the reaction of the host to the grafted tissue i.e. host versus graft response. On the other hand, when the graft tissue mounts an immune response against the antigens of the host, it is called graft versus host (GVH) reaction. GVH reaction can occur when the graft contains immunocompetent T-cells, the host has transplantation antigens which are absent in the graft and the graft is not rejected by the host.</p>

                            <h3>Immunodeficiency Diseases</h3>
                            <p>Deficiency in one or more components of the immune system leads to a condition known as immunodeficiency disease. Basic components involved are</p>
                            <p>(i) T-lymphocytes<br>(ii) B-lymphocytes<br>(iii) Phagocytic cells<br>(iv) Complement system.</p>
                            <p>Immunodeficiency may be primary or secondary.</p>
                            <p>Primary immunodeficiency is congenitally derived due to genetic defects. Many of these are X-linked i.e. inherited by boys from their mothers. The defect may be due to the interruption of differentiation of immunocompetent cells at some stage of development, or due to missing gene products, e.g. individual components of the complement system.</p>
                            <p>Secondary immunodeficiency is acquired as a result of other factors such as</p>
