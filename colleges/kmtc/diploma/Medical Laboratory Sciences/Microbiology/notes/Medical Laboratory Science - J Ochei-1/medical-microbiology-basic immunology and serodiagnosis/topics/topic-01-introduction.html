                            <p><strong>Immunity</strong> Immunity is the defence mechanism or resistance of a host against a foreign body. It involves the recognition and disposal of such ‘foreign’ or ‘non-self’ material that enters the body. This non-self material may be in the form of infectious agents or as life-saving tissue-grafts. Immunity to infection may be natural or acquired through adaptive immune response.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Immunology</strong> Immunology is the study of immunity.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Non-self</strong> This is a very wide term which includes everything which is different from individual’s own constituents. Infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites; cells or other material from another individual of same or different species; and occasionally even drugs and food can be regarded as ‘non-self’ to a particular individual.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Natural resistance</strong> This is a non-specific defence mechanism of the body which is mounted against any non-self material without identifying it. This is due to the innate or natural immunity.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Adaptive Immune Response</strong> The adaptive immune response is directed specifically to a particular non-self or antigenic stimulus which may result in the destruction of this antigen in the body. It usually leaves behind a memory of this antigen, so that it can be immediately recognized and eliminated in future. This is also called acquired immunity.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Vaccination</strong> This is a method of stimulating adaptive immune response and memory against a known infectious agent without suffering from the harmful effects of the disease. In case of a future contact with the same agent, the body can mount an immediate immune response due to acquired immunity.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Grafting</strong> If cells or organs from one individual are used to replace defective ones in another individual, the body of the latter mounts an immune response against them, recognizing them as ‘non-self’. This is known as ‘Graft Versus Host’ (GVH) reaction. To suppress this undesirable effect, an immune mechanism is suppressed by using drugs till the new organ is accepted by the recipient body.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Autoimmunity</strong> The body’s own cells and molecules may undergo some variation and are recognised by the host’s immune system as ‘non-self’. An immune response mounted against such cells may lead to the destruction of body’s own cells and tissues. This is known as autoimmunity or autoimmune disease. This is a harmful side of immunity.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Hypersensitivity</strong> Sometimes specific memory to an antigen may lead to harmful or undesirable effect on the body on subsequent contact with the same antigen. The hypersensitivity reaction varies with the type of antigenic stimulus.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Immunosuppression</strong> Some individuals may possess lower levels of immunity due to some defects in their immune mechanism. Immuno-suppression can be induced by certain drugs to control autoimmunity, hypersensitivity and graft rejection; or it can be acquired as a result of chronic infections.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Antigen</strong> Antigen is a foreign substance that stimulates adaptive immune response in the body. Example of such adaptive immune response is the production of specific antibody.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Antibody</strong> An antibody is a serum immunoglobulin which is produced specifically in response to an antigenic stimulus.</p>

                            <p>Non-specific defences provide the first line of protection against a diverse array of infectious agents. The degree of this protection varies from individual to individual, and may range from complete insusceptibility to complete susceptibility. The non-specific resistance provided by one individual may make him more susceptible or less susceptible than another individual. This non-specific immunity may be natural or innate.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Natural Immunity</strong> Natural immunity is not acquired through previous contact with the antigen, but is largely genetically determined.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Species Immunity</strong> A microorganism pathogenic to one species of animals may not be pathogenic to another species. For example, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> can infect humans and chimpanzees, but not other animals and <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em> can produce disease in humans but not in monkeys.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Racial Immunity</strong> Within one animal species, such as humans, there may be marked differences in susceptibility based on racial and genetic differences. For example, an inherited deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) in some individuals makes their red cells much less susceptible to <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, a malarial parasite. A similar phenomenon is observed in persons with sickle cell anaemia.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Variation in immunity due to age</strong> Some infections are characteristic of certain age groups which can be related to physiological factors. For example, bacterial meningitis during the first month of life is caused by coliform bacteria. The antibodies to these bacteria are IgM which fail to cross the placenta and are not produced by a newborn for the first few months of life. Infections such as rubella or toxoplasma can cause severe disease and/or deformities in the foetus <em>in utero</em> (within the uterus) due to the absence of antibodies where as the mother who is the carrier, suffers from a very mild or asymptomatic infection.</p>

                            <p>As with any biological phenomenon, resistance to infection varies from individual to individual, irrespective of species or race, or age. When exposed to the same infectious agent, one individual may develop a severe disease; another may show signs of mild disease; while a third person may not suffer from the disease at all. This is due to the innate resistance of every individual provided by the physiological and chemical barriers at the portal of entry of the pathogen, and other non-specific mechanisms that do not require previous exposure of the host to the infectious agent. Such resistance or defence mechanisms include:</p>

                            <h3>Types of Acquired Immunity</h3>
                            <p>In general, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses can be acquired in three different ways:</p>

                                        <strong>Active Immunity</strong> This type of immunity is acquired by direct exposure to an antigen which stimulates individual's own immune system. The exposure to the antigen may be natural, e.g. through infection, or artificial as in vaccination. The disadvantage of this type of immunity is that it takes some time after the exposure to develop. However, once produced, it lasts for a long time because of the phenomenon of 'memory'.

                                        <strong>Passive immunity</strong> As the name suggests, passive immunity is transferred passively from an immune individual to a non-immune or susceptible individual. The transfer can be effected without the induction of any immune response in the recipient. It occurs through soluble mediators of immunity such as antibodies and cytokines.
                                        <p>Passive transfer of immunity occurs naturally from mother to foetus in the form of IgG type of immunoglobulins which can pass through the placenta or as IgA type of antibodies through breast milk. It can also be transferred artificially by administration of a known antibody against an infectious agent e.g. anti-tetanus immunoglobulin for treatment of tetanus to neutralize the toxin. The passive immunity provides immediate protection to a non-immune individual, but is short-lived and declines after a few days. There is no ‘memory’ after this immunity.</p>

                            <p>The capacity to respond specifically to immunological stimuli is exhibited primarily by the cells of the lymphoid system. During embryonic life, primitive lymphocytes are derived from haemopoietic stem cells in the yolk sac, liver and bone-marrow, along with the cells of myeloid and erythroid series. The lymphoid stem cells which originate from the bone marrow, differentiate to form two distinct lymphocyte subpopulations. One set of populations, called T-cells, require to be differentiated in the thymus before they start functioning as immunologically competent cells. The cells of the other subpopulation, B-cells, are independent of thymus and are differentiated in the Bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid portion of the hindgut of birds. However, human B-cells are differentiated in the bone marrow. Table 1.1 shows some differences between T- and B-cells.</p>
                            
                            <p>Primary lymphoid organs of the human immune system, are thymus and bone marrow, from where lymphocytes are developed throughout the life span of an individual. Secondary lymphoid organs, on the other hand, are tissues rich in lymphocytes through which mature lymphocytes are constantly migrating and are being activated for a specific immune response. These secondary lymphoid organs include lymph nodes, white pulp of the spleen and Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), e.g. tonsils, Peyer's patches and appendix. T-cells and B-cells occupy areas specific for their development.</p>

                                    <p>Mature lymphocytes in peripheral blood are round in shape, measuring approximately 6–15μm in diameter. The nucleus is large in size giving a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Lymphocytes comprise 20–50% of the white blood cells in a normal adult. When stained with Giemsa or Leishmann stain, the nucleus of a lymphocyte stains intense purple with course masses of chromatin. The cytoplasm appears pale blue without any granules or may contain a few fine azurophilic granules. T- and B-subpopulations of lymphocytes are indistinguishable from each other on the basis of morphology as observed by Giemsa or Leishmann stain.</p>

                            <h3>T-Lymphocytes</h3>
                            <p>T-Lymphocytes constitute approximately 65–80 percent of circulating small lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. They have a long life span extending up to a few months or even years. T-cells require an intact thymus for their functional maturation.</p>
                            <p>Unlike B-cells, T-cells do not have immunoglobulin molecules on their surfaces, and cannot synthesize antibodies when stimulated by an antigen. They can be identified by their ability to bind sheep red cells on their surfaces, to form rossettes. This property is used to count T-cells in peripheral blood.</p>
                            <p>T-cells are found to have many surface receptors which can be identified by the use of monoclonal antibodies raised against these receptors. These are called CD (Cluster of Differentiation) markers because one marker may bind with several monoclonal antibodies forming a cluster. Thus, the sheep red cell receptor marker is CD2, and is present on all T-cells. And, CD4 is expressed primarily by T-helper/inducer cells and thought to interact with Class II HLA molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells.</p>
                            <p>T-lymphocytes are mainly responsible for mounting a cell-mediated immune response (CMI) in response to an antigenic stimulus. During their migration in the body through various tissues, they recognise ‘non-self’ or antigenic substances and become immunologically ‘activated’. Upon activation, they produce a number of secretory products, known as lymphokines, which participate in effector functions or regulate immune responses. Some T-cells also help B-cells to respond to an antigen.</p>
                            
                            <p>On the basis of their functions and surface receptors, T-cells can be divided into various subsets. The main subsets are:</p>

                            <h3>B-Lymphocytes</h3>
                            <p>B-lymphocytes form about 20 to 25 per cent of the small lymphocytes in peripheral blood. They have a short life span, of only a few days or weeks. Although they originally develop in the bone marrow, when activated by the antigenic stimulus, they undergo differentiation in secondary lymphoid organs. Mature B-cells have a large number of immunoglobulin molecules (about $10^5$ molecules per cell) on their surface. B-cells can be counted with the help of fluorescent labelled anti-globulin antibody. Resting B-cells are small cells with a thin rim of cytoplasm around the nucleus.</p>
                            <p>When activated by an antigen, B-cells undergo transformation, enlarge and become lymphoblasts. The lymphoblasts proliferate and quickly increase in number. Some of these lymphoblasts further differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells are oval shaped cells, 7 to $15\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter, with a round, eccentrically placed nucleus showing a 'cart-wheel' appearance. The plasma cells are seen in the secondary lymphoid organs where they synthesise a large number of immunoglobulin molecules identical to those carried by their B-cell precursors. Sometimes B-cell activation and differentiation may require assistance from helper T-cells.</p>
                            <p>Some lymphoblasts, revert to a resting stage and form memory cells specific for the antigen which induced its transformation. When re-exposed to the same or related antigen, these memory cells generate a rapid and more intense secondary response.</p>

                            <p>Thymus is a bilobed capsulated organ located in the upper chest cavity. It grows in size till puberty and then atrophies slowly with age. The main function of thymus is to 'educate' T-cells to differentiate between the 'self' and 'non-self' antigens and interact efficiently with the non-self.</p>
                            <p>T-cell precursors from the bone marrow stem cells (thymocytes) are located in the thymic cortex, the layer of the thymus just below its outer capsule. As they proliferate and mature, these thymocytes pass to the medulla, the inner layer of the thymus. The medulla is much less populated with T-cells than the cortex. The mature educated T-cells from the medulla then migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs.</p>

                            <h3>The Bursa of Fabricius</h3>
                            <p>This is a primary lymphoid organ at the terminal end of the gut in birds. Here precursors of B-lymphocytes develop into mature B-cells. The equivalent of this organ is not yet identified in humans and so bone marrow is considered as the primary organ for B-cell maturation.</p>

                            <p>The main secondary lymphoid tissues in the body are lymph nodes, white pulp of the spleen and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) which includes lymphoid tissues in the gut, respiratory system and mammary glands. Most of the B- and T-lymphocytes are present in these lymphoid tissues from where they actively circulate. Each lymphoid tissue has separate T- and B-cell dependent areas.</p>

                            <h3>Lymph nodes</h3>
                            <p>These are located in several areas of the body, being more numerous in the areas where arms and legs join the trunk of the body. They serve as filters for the tissue fluid, lymph. They also act as stations from where lymphocytes can recirculate between blood and lymph.</p>
                            <p>Each lymph node has an outer area, cortex, lying beneath the capsule. The cortex contains a large number of dense aggregations of lymphocytes called primary follicles. During an active immune response, they enlarge, appearing less dense and are then known as secondary follicles or germinal centres. These are activated proliferating B-lymphocytes undergoing transformation to lymphoblasts and plasma cells.</p>
                            <p>The innermost portion of the lymph node is the medulla. The paracortex, or the area between the cortex and the medulla, contains diffusely spread out T-lymphocytes. The antibody molecules produced by plasma cells are released into circulation through efferent lymphatics (Fig. 1.1).</p>

                            <p>Mucosa associated lymphoid tissues include tonsils, Peyer's patches in the small intestine and appendix in the gut, bronchial and mammary tissue, and salivary and lacrimal glands. Unlike other lymphoid tissues, MALT are not encapsulated, but are scattered diffusely in the mucosa and submucosa. In some sites, follicles of B-cells may be seen.</p>

                            <h3>Spleen</h3>
                            <p>The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ located in the left abdominal cavity. The spleen has two main functional areas, the red pulp, which is rich in red blood cells and macrophages, and white pulp which is rich in lymphocytes. The white pulp contains primary and secondary follicles similar to those in the lymph nodes where B-lymphocytes proliferate. The T-cells predominate in the periarterial sheath. The T- and B-cells enter the blood directly from the spleen through the splenic vein (Fig. 1.2).</p>

                            <p>In the peripheral blood, 10 per cent of lymphocytes lack traditional T- or B-cell markers. Due to the absence of these two surface markers, these lymphocytes are called 'Null' cells. These large granular lymphocytes mediate rapid lysis of virus infected cells, tumour cells and foreign graf T-cells and so are also called Natural Killer (NK) cells. These NK cells do not require previous sensitisation to target T-cell antigens in order to perform this function. They achieve cytolysis by.</p>

                            <p>Mature lymphocytes from the primary lymphoid organs are steadily but constantly circulating between body tissues, lymph, blood and the lymphoid organs. Whenever an antigen is detected, T- and B-cells get activated and eventually mount an immune response against it. The process of activation is generally carried out in the same type of lymphoid tissue where the stimulation has occurred. For example, for the antigenic stimulus in the gut, the activation may take place in Peyer's patches, or other MALT.</p>

                            <p>Phagocytosis is the process by which microorganisms, tissue debris, inorganic particles or malignant cells are ingested by certain body cells, collectively known as phagocytes. Phagocytes also participate in other processes such as wound repair, inflammation and immune responses. Phagocytes belong to a heterogeneous population of cells arising from the pleuripotent haemopoietic stem cell. Phagocytes belonging to the granulocyte series are neutrophils while those from the monocyte series are mononuclear phagocytes or macrophages.</p>

                            <p>Maturation of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil occurs in the bone marrow. It is a multistep sequential process, beginning with stimulation of stem cell. The average time required to produce a mature neutrophil is 6 to 14 days. The mature neutrophils are stored in the bone marrow and are released rapidly into peripheral circulation in response to various stimuli. Under normal conditions, approximately $10^{11}$ mature neutrophils are released into circulation everyday. They form 40 to 75 per cent of the white blood cell population in blood. After a few hours in blood, they migrate to the tissues, where they survive for one to two days.</p>

                                        <strong>1. Chemotaxis</strong> Chemotaxis is a process in which cells tend to move in a certain direction under the influence of chemical substances. These chemical substances are called chemotactic agents. Invasion by bacteria and destruction of tissue stimulates the production of many chemotactic factors. The important chemotactic factors are anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a which are released in the complement pathway, bacterial products and interleukin-8. Antigen-antibody complexes and dead tissue can also act as chemotactic agents.

Particles and cells suspended in body fluids have a negative charge (the zeta potential), due to which they repel each other. The negative charge on the particle can be neutralized by coating it with a positively charged protein. The antibody molecules and the third component of the complement (C3) are examples of such proteins. The particles coated with antibody or C3 have a reduced zeta potential and can adhere to the neutrophils. The molecules that promote phagocytosis by coating the particles in this way are known as opsonins. Antibodies are the most effective opsonins. Adherence between the opsonised particles and neutrophils is enhanced by the presence of specific receptors for antibody and C3 on the surface of neutrophils.

                            <p>Inflammation is a non-specific defense mechanism of the body in response to tissue injury. Blood cells and proteins participate in this process to achieve healing of the injured tissue. The cause of injury can be bacterial infection, exposure to chemicals or radiation, physical changes in the tissue or immunopathological events such as formation of immune complexes. The inflammatory response can occur in any part of the body. Its basic manifestations are the same and are characterised by five classical signs, namely, redness, swelling, heat, pain and loss of function.</p>
                            <p>The course of inflammatory response can be divided into two phases:</p>
                            <p>(i) Vascular phase.<br>(ii) Cellular phase.</p>

                            <h3>Vascular phase</h3>
                            <p>The vascular phase begins immediately after the injury and involves the following processes:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">(a) Release of immediate phase products such as histamine from mast cells and basophils and serotonin from platelets, immediately after the injury.</span>
                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-content">(b) Vasodilatation of small blood vessels in the area due to the above products results in increased blood flow and creates redness and heat.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">(c) Increase in vasopermeability brings about leakage of plasma into the extravascular tissue, creating swelling and pain.</span>

                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">(d) Release of later phase products begins 6 to 12 hours after the injury. These products include components of the complement system such as C3a, C4a, C5a etc. kinins, coagulation products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. These products bring about further increase in vasodilation and vascular permeability. Some products exert a chemotactic effect on phagocytes.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Cellular phase</h3>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content">(a) Migration of neutrophils to the site of injury occurs within 30 to 60 minutes under the influence of chemotactic factors. Vasodilatation and increased vasopermeability allows their passage through the walls of blood vessels. They start active phagocytic activity of ingesting bacteria, cellular debris and immune complexes, if present.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">(b) Migration of macrophages begins four to five hours after the injury. These slow moving phagocytic cells are attracted to the site by chemotaxis. In the same way as the neutrophils, macrophages also start resolving the process by active phagocytosis. The process of healing after this stage depends on other factors such as the virulence of infecting bacteria, their number, and the extent and the cause of injury.</span>

                                Eosinophils, Mast Cells and Basophils
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Eosinophils, basophils and mast cells are functionally related because all have the ability to promote acute inflammatory responses. They serve this function by releasing enzymes which enhance vasodilatation, fluid effusion and tissue damage.</p>

                            <h3>Eosinophils</h3>
                            <p>Eosinophils are polymorphic nuclear leucocytes. They contain large protein granules which have a high affinity for acid dyes such as eosin. They constitute about 2–6 per cent of leucocytes in the peripheral blood. Eosinophils are phagocytic cells whose primary function is to ingest and destroy foreign particles. Once a particle is bound to the receptors on an eosinophil, it triggers a large number of biochemical reactions, such as the respiratory burst. The eosinophils are more suited to extracellular destruction of large parasites such as helminths than to phagocytosis of small particles. They release the contents of their granules into the surroundings to reach the parasitic worms. These granules contain oxidative and lytic enzymes which bring about destruction of the parasites.</p>
                            <p>All these factors lead to an inflammatory response called type I hypersensitivity. The presence of eosinophilia (increased number of eosinophils in blood) is characteristic of individuals with severe allergies. This is because the eosinophils are attracted in large numbers where degranulation of mast cells or basophils occurs. Mast cells and basophils release substances such as eosinophil chemotactic factors and histamine which attract the eosinophils at the site of an allergen.</p>

                            <h3>Mast cells and basophils</h3>
                            <p>Mast cells are large, round cells, distributed in the connective tissues throughout the body. Their cytoplasm is packed with large acidic granules which stain deeply with basic dyes such as toluidine blue. Basophils are similar to mast cells but are present in the peripheral blood. They constitute about 0.5 per cent of blood leucocytes. Chemical composition of the granules of basophils varies slightly from that of the mast cells. Both mast cells and basophils have receptors for IgE and when two adjacent IgE molecules are bound together by an antigen or an allergen, it triggers the release of the contents of the cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain vasoactive amines which cause capillary dilatation and increased vascular permeability. They also contain histamine, heparin, eosinophils, chemotactic factor and proteases which activate complement to generate anaphylatoxins. All these factors lead to an inflammatory response called type I hypersensitivity.</p>
