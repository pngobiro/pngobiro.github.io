                            <p>An antigen is a substance which, when introduced into the body, stimulates the production of an antibody, and specifically reacts with it.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Antigenic determinant</strong> is the smallest unit of antigenicity in a molecule of antigen. An antigen may possess a number of determinant groups or combining sites, each stimulating the production of an antibody that can bind only at that site. The antigenic determinants can be peptide groups in proteins, or hexasaccharides in polysaccharides.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Haptens</strong> are low molecular weight antigens which cannot induce the formation of antibody by themselves, but can react specifically with the antibodies produced against them. Haptens become capable of producing antibodies when they are combined with larger 'carrier' molecules.</p>

                            <h3>Properties of Antigens</h3>
                            <p>The antigenicity of a substance depends on the following factors:</p>

When this mechanism of recognising self antigens is impaired, it may result in autoimmune disease. The degree of foreignness also influences the antigenicity. Antigens from other individuals of the same species (e.g. man to man) are less antigenic than those from other species (e.g. sheep to man).</span>

                            <p>Antibody is an immunoglobulin which is produced in the body as a response to a stimulus by an antigen; and reacts specifically with it. Chemically, immunoglobulins are proteins and constitute 20-25 per cent of total serum proteins. The term 'immunoglobulin' is a chemical and structural concept whereas the term 'antibody' is a biological and functional concept. The body can produce various types of antibodies which can react specifically only with the antigens which caused their production.</p>

                            <h3>Structure of Immunoglobin</h3>
                            <p>All immunoglobulins have a similar basic structure. However, they can show a great diversity in the capacity to produce specific antigen combining sites. Each immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule consists of two unequal pairs of polypeptide chains held together by disulphide (-s-s-) bonds. The two short chains are called light chains (L) whereas the two long chains are called heavy chains (H). Each chain has a constant region called 'carboxy terminal' (C) and a variable region called 'amino terminal' (V) (Fig.2.2).</p>
                            <p>The domains at the amino terminal (V) are variable while those at the carboxy terminal (C) are constant. Each domain has a specific biological activity such as antigen binding, complement activation or monocyte binding (Fig. 2.3).</p>

                            <p><strong>Heavy (H) chains</strong> The long or heavy (H) chains are not identical in all immunoglobulins. Based on structural and antigenic differences in heavy chains, immunoglobulins are divided into five groups or subclasses. These are designated as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. The H-chain specificity of each of the above classes is symbolised as γ (gamma) for IgG, μ (mu) for IgM, α (alpha) for IgA, δ (delta) for IgD and ε (epsilon) for IgE.</p>
                            <p>The portion of the H-chain which is not involved in the antibody combining site i.e. Fc fragment of the constant region (see fragments of immunoglobulin below), carries the sites for various biological activities such as complement fixation, attachment to phagocytic cells, placental transfer, degranulation of mast cells and skin fixation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Light (L) chains</strong> The light chains do not vary according to the immunoglobulin subclass. They always belong to one of the two types, kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Both may occur in all classes of immunoglobulins; but any one molecule contains either kappa or lambda chains, not both. The kappa and lambda chains occur in a ratio of 2:1 in human serum.</p>

                            <p><strong>Combining sites</strong> The antigen combining sites of each antibody molecule are located at the aminoterminal end within the variable regions of both heavy (V_H) and light (V_L) chains (Fig.2.3). This is the main biological activity of an antibody molecule. The specificity of an antibody is determined by the sequence of amino acids and its 3-dimensional configuration of domains achieved by disulphide bonds in this variable region. On the other hand, the constant region at the carboxyterminal has a constant or non-variable sequence of amino acids in the H chain, and, either kappa or lambda sequence on the L chain. In the L chain, the constant and variable regions are of equal length, whereas in the H chain the variable region constitutes about one-fifth of the chain. The constant region on the L-chain is called C_L; and that on the heavy chains is called C_H. The C_H region is further divided into three to four regions (C_H1, C_H2, etc.). Differences in the constant regions of H chains have been used to divide immunoglobulins into classes and sub-classes.</p>

                            <h3>Fragments of Immunoglobulin</h3>
                            <p>Enzymes papain and pepsin are used to digest immunoglobulin molecules into discrete fragments.</p>
                            <p>Papain cleaves the antibody molecule just above the disulphide bonds which hold the two heavy chains together. This creates two identical Fab (fragment antigen binding) fragments, at the aminoterminal (Fig. 2.4). At the carboxy terminal, a fragment Fc (fragment crystallisable), which crystallises spontaneously at 4 °C, is formed. The Fc fragment is responsible for many biological functions of the immunoglobulin molecule, except antigen binding.</p>
                            <p>Pepsin cleaves the molecule just below the disulphide bonds connecting the two heavy chains (Fig. 2.4), which results in the production of one major fragment F(ab')_2, containing two antigen binding sites. The Fc portion is digested by pepsin into minor fragments.</p>

                                        <strong>1. Binding of complement</strong> Complement is a group of proteins present in the blood and other body fluids, which interacts with antigen-antibody complexes in a series of steps (Fig. 2.5A). In an antigen-antibody complex, the Fc portion of the IgG molecule combines with the complement to bring about destruction of the antigen.

                                        <strong>2. Opsonisation</strong> When IgG serves as a bridge between the antigen and the phagocytic cell, the phagocytic activity of the cell is enhanced. This is called opsonisation. This is achieved when the Fab portion of IgG binds to the antigen and Fc portion binds to the Fc receptor on the phagocytic cell (Fig. 2.5B).

                            <h3>Immunoglobulin M (IgM)</h3>
                            <p>IgM is the largest of the immunoglobulins, with a molecular weight of about 900,000 to 1,000,000 (therefore called a 'millionaire molecule'). The sedimentation coefficient is 19S. It constitutes 5-10% of serum immunoglobulins (0.5 to 2 mg/ml).</p>
                            <p>IgM is a pentamer, made up of five basic subunits i.e. five units of two μ-chains bound to two L-chains. These units are linked together by a protein called the 'J' or joining chain (Fig. 2.6a). The heavy chains are called μ (mu) chains, and are longer than the γ (gamma) heavy chains of IgG, because they contain an additional domain, C_H4, located at the carboxyterminal of the H-chain. Since each IgM molecule has ten Fab segments, it can combine with up to ten antigenic sites. However, with antigens of a large size, this valency may fall to five, probably due to stearic hindrance.</p>
                            <p>IgM molecules are the earliest antibodies synthesised in response to antigenic stimulation. It is synthesised by the foetus from about 20 weeks of age. The presence of IgM antibodies in a foetus or a neonate indicates intrauterine infection because IgM cannot cross through the placenta. Congenital infections such as syphilis, rubella or toxoplasmosis can be diagnosed by detection of IgM antibodies in the newborn.</p>
                            <p>IgM antibodies are also the first to be produced in response to any antigenic stimulus, even in adult life. They are shortlived as compared to IgG. Therefore, their detection in the serum indicates a recent or current infection. IgM is selectively destroyed by 2-mercaptoethanol (O.12M), which does not affect IgG. This provides a simple method for estimating IgG and IgM separately.</p>
                            <p>There are two subclasses of IgM; IgM1 and IgM2.</p>

                            <h3>Immunoglobulin A (IgA)</h3>
                            <p>IgA is the second most abundant class of immunoglobulins after IgG. It constitutes about 10% of total serum immunoglobulins (0.6 to 4.2 mg/ml).</p>
                            <p>IgA occurs in two forms. In the serum, it is present as a monomer i.e. one basic unit of two heavy chains bound to two light chains. The molecular weight of the monomer is about 170,000 daltons, with a sedimentation coefficient of 7 S. The heavy chains of IgA are called α (alpha) chains (Fig. 2.6b). Unlike other immunoglobulins, the disulphide bonds in IgA link its light chains together, and not the heavy chains.</p>
                            <p>Besides occurring in the serum, IgA is a predominant immunoglobin in body's secretions such as saliva, tears, sweat and breast milk. The mucous membranes of respiratory, intestinal and genital tracts are also rich in IgA. In the body secretions, IgA occurs mainly as a dimer i.e. it has two basic subunits held together by the J-chain (Fig. 2.6b). The molecular weight of the dimer is about 400,000 daltons and has a sedimentation coefficient of 11 S. In addition, the dimer contains a protein known as the secretory or transport (T) piece. The T-piece is synthesised by the epithelial cells in the mucous membrane. The T-piece protects the IgA from the proteolytic enzymes and helps in its transport through the mucous membranes into the secretions.</p>
                            <p>There are two subclasses of IgA: IgA1 and IgA2.</p>

                            <p>Structurally, IgD resembles IgG. It exists as a monomer, with δ(delta) heavy chains. It is mostly intravascular in distribution (3-5mg/100ml). Its concentration in serum is very low (0.03-0.05mg/ml).</p>
                            <p>Very little is known about the functions of IgD. It is active against antigens such as insulin, milk protein, nuclear and thyroid antigens, and penicillin. It is believed to be associated with lymphocyte activation and suppression.</p>
                            <p>There are two subclasses: IgD1 and IgD2.</p>

                            <p>IgE exists as a monomer with ε (epsilon) heavy chains, has a molecular weight of about 200,000 daltons and sedimentation coefficient of 8S. It is present in very low concentration, about 0.02mg/ml. The ε chain contains an additional C₁₁₄ domain in the constant region, similar to that of IgM. This C₁₁₄ region is capable of binding to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. This interaction stimulates the development of Type I allergic reactions. IgE levels are also elevated in the serum of individuals with parasitic infections and may play a role in defence against parasites.</p>
                            <p>IgE is mostly extravascular in distribution. It does not fix complement or pass through the placenta.</p>

                            <p>Complement is a complex system of proteins and other factors found in body fluids or on cell membranes of vertebrates. These components are capable of specific, sequential interactions leading to a number of physiological effects. Some of them have enzymatic activity, while others are activators or inhibitors of certain processes. Lysis of cells such as microorganisms or immunogenic red cells is the mainstay of this system. In addition, the complement system also plays a major role in the mediation of inflammation, in metabolism of immune complexes and in regulating the phagocytic activity.</p>
                            <p>At least 11 distinct components of human complement have been identified. Complement gets deteriorated very fast in vitro therefore it should either be used fresh or kept frozen. It can also be preserved by chemical methods such as Richardson method. Complement activity is destroyed by heating serum at 56°C for 30 minutes, when it is said to be 'inactivated'.</p>
                            <p>Complement (C) is normally present in the body in an inactive form. When it is activated by antigen-antibody complexes, the components of C react in a specific sequence, which is called the complement cascade. Several biologically active fragments and components are released as byproducts during the reaction cascade. The preceding components act as enzymes on the succeeding components, cleaving them into unequal fragments. Generally, larger fragments join the cascade, smaller ones perform other biological functions.</p>

                            <h3>Activation of Complement</h3>
                            <p>There are two ways in which the complement can be activated; the classical pathway and the alternate pathway. Complement is activated by the classical pathway when an antigen-antibody complex initiate the reaction sequence by binding with the first component of C, namely C1. C1 exists in serum as a calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) dependant complex of three subunits, C1q, C1r and C1s.</p>

                            <h4>Classical pathway</h4>
                            <p>The sequence of the complement cascade by classical pathway can be summarised as follows:</p>

                            <h4>The alternate pathway</h4>
                            <p>While the 'classical' pathway of complement activation starts by attachment of C1q to the antigen-antibody complex, an 'alternate' pathway exists which starts by activation of C3. In the classical pathway, C3 is activated by the C3 convertase (C4b2a). A variety of substances can bring about the formation of C3 activator that cleaves C3 in the similar way to that of C3 convertase in the classical pathway. This 'alternative pathway' then proceeds from C3 to C9, as in the classical pathway.</p>
                            <p>The alternate pathway of complement activation provides a natural defence mechanism against invasion by microorganisms, before the formation of antibodies. Activators of this pathway include</p>

                            <p><strong>Cytolysis</strong> Activation of complement results in cytolysis and bacteriolysis. Lysis of red cells coated with antigen by complement forms the basis of complement fixation test for the detection of either antigen or antibody.</p>
                            <p>Cytolysis may cause injury to normal tissues in allergic reactions or in autoimmune diseases.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Effects of C4a, C3a and C5a</strong> These smaller fragments are released in the environment during the formation of the complement cascade. Collectively, these fragments have effects on phagocytosis, anaphylaxis and inflammation. As anaphylotoxins they cause smooth muscle contraction, enhance mucus secretion, increase vascular permeability and induce release of histamine from basophils and mast cells.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Opsonization and Immune adherence</strong> The fragments C4b, C3b and iC3b (inactive 3b) promote adherence of antigen-antibody complexes to leucocytes or platelets, which can then be easily phagocytosed by macrophages. They also enhance phagocytosis of antibody-coated (opsonised) microorganisms by leucocytes and macrophages.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Hereditary deficiencies of C and Low serum C levels</strong> Deficiency or low level of complement may lead to increased susceptibility to infection and diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or acute glomerulonephritis.</p>
