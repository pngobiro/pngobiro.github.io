                            <p>Viruses are the smallest infectious agents measuring 20 to 300 nm in diameter. They are obligate intracellular parasites and contain no enzymes necessary for energy metabolism. They are entirely dependant on the host cell for biosynthesis of macromolecules. A virus contains only one of the two nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The nucleic acid is encased in a protein shell, which may again be surrounded by a lipid-containing membrane.</p>
                            
                            <p>Viruses might have evolved from free living cells, or they might have been components of host cells which separated and started independent existence. They behave like 'living chemicals' and are the best tools to understand the chemistry of life. Viruses infect unicellular organisms such as bacteria and algae, and all higher plants and animals. The range of hosts an individual virus can attack may be extremely limited, or very large. Major differences between bacteria and viruses are listed in Table 1.1.</p>
                            
                            <p>The medical importance of viruses lies in their capacity to cause a wide variety of human diseases, ranging from minor ailments such as the common cold to highly fatal diseases such as yellow fever.</p>

                            <p>Viruses differ from bacteria by their ability to pass through filters that hold back bacteria. With the exception of some larger viruses, they are usually too small to be seen with the light microscope, and hence are called ‘ultramicroscopic’. The size of a virus can be measured in a number of ways:</p>

                            <p>The size of viruses ranges from 20 nm to 300 nm. The poxviruses are the largest of the viruses (300 nm) which are about the same size as the smallest bacteria. Poxviruses can be seen with the light microscope, but all other viruses are visible only under the electron microscope.</p>

                            <p>The complete virus particle, virion, consists of a nucleic acid core surrounded by an impenetrable protein coat, the capsid. The capsid is composed of a large number of morphological units called capsomers. The capsid and the nucleic acid core together are known as the nucleocapsid. The capsomers are symmetrically arranged around the core. The capsid performs two main functions: it protects the core, and helps it to enter into the host cell.</p>
                            
                            <p>The symmetrical arrangement of the capsid around the core is mainly of two types, icosahedral and helical (Fig. 1.2). A few viruses, for example, poxviruses, have a complex structure.</p>

Thus, unlike the icosahedral symmetry, the helical symmetry involves interaction between the nucleic acid core and the capsid, e.g. tobacco-mosaic virus, orthomyxoviruses.</p>

                                    <p>Some viruses do not exhibit any symmetry, but are complex in structure. For example, poxviruses are brick shaped with ridges on the external surface.</p>

                            <p><strong>Envelope</strong> Some viruses have a covering or an envelope outside the capsid, and are said to be enveloped. The envelope is derived from the host cell membrane when the virus is released from the cell. The envelope is made up of lipids and proteins. The protein subunits may project from the envelope as spikes. A virus may have different types of spikes e.g. influenza virus has two types of spikes on its envelope, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase spikes.</p>

These proteins determine the antigenic characteristics of the virus. Some proteins are in the form of enzymes. These enzymes, though present in very small amounts, are essential for the initiation of the replication cycle of the virus within the host cell. For example, some viruses contain RNA polymerase (e.g. orthomyxoviruses), while retroviruses contain reverse transcriptase, the enzyme which makes complementary DNA copy of the viral RNA.</span>

                                        <p><em>Variola</em> (smallpox) is a severe disease with a high mortality rate in non-immunized persons. The virus causes skin lesions through the blood stream which later pustulate. Pustules break down and discharge the virus into environment. The main route of transmission is respiratory. Smallpox vaccine is prepared from the closely related, but much less virulent, vaccinia virus. In 1980, the World Health Organisation announced that smallpox had been eradicated world wide.</p>

                                        <p><em>Rhinoviruses</em>: There are more than 100 serotypes which cause the common cold.</p>
                                        <p><em>Enteroviruses</em>: <em>Poliovirus</em>, <em>Echovirus</em> and <em>Coxsackievirus</em> belong to this genus. These viruses are ingested and multiply in the alimentary tract. They spread to the tissues and organs to which they have affinity, via the blood stream. The viruses are excreted in the faeces.</p>
                                        <p><em>Poliovirus</em> causes poliomyelitis. It is an acute infectious disease and in its serious form affects the central nervous system. It destroys the motor neurons in the spinal cord resulting in paralysis. However, most poliovirus infections are subclinical. There are three serological types (1,2 and 3) of the virus. An oral vaccine prepared from attenuated strains of the three serotypes provides effective immunization.</p>
                                        <p><em>Coxsackievirus</em> is a large subgroup of the enteroviruses, and is subdivided into two groups, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. They produce a variety of illnesses in humans. Herpangina, hand, foot and mouth disease, and acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis are caused by some group A coxsackieviruses. Group B serotypes are associated with myocarditis, pericarditis and meningoencephalitis. In addition, viruses in both groups can be responsible for aseptic meningitis, respiratory and undifferentiated febrile illnesses, hepatitis and paralysis. The paralysis is usually incomplete and reversible.</p>
                                        <p><em>Echoviruses</em> (enteric cytopathogenic human orphan viruses) have about 30 serotypes. Some of them cause aseptic meningitis, febrile illnesses with or without rash, and common cold.</p>
                                        <p><strong>New enteroviruses:</strong> There are newly recognised enteroviruses which are given numbers instead of names. Enterovirus type 70 is known to cause acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis. Enterovirus type 71 can cause meningitis, encephalitis and a respiratory infection. <em>Hepatitis A virus</em> is now renamed as Enterovirus type 72.</p>

                                                <p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV has a cylindrical core with nucleic acid cloned and sequenced. It is a retrovirus, but differs from other retroviruses such as human T lymphotrophic viruses (HTLV) 1 and 2. Cells bearing CD4 antigen (a major component of the viral receptor required for cell entry) are susceptible to HIV infection, but HIV has a particular affinity for the T4 helper lymphocytes. An envelope glycoprotein of the virus, gp 120, specifically binds to the CD4 molecule receptor site on the surface of the T4 lymphocytes. Once the virus is bound to the cell receptor, it can enter the cell. The viral reverse transcriptase enzyme, on entering into the infected cell, makes a DNA copy of the RNA genome (pro-viral DNA). The Pro-viral DNA can thereby bring about the destruction of the cell. The T4 lymphocyte has a central role in many immunological functions, and an infected cell can cause severe damage to the cellular immune system. Reduced immunity results in infections with many opportunistic pathogens and development of certain tumours such as Kaposi's sarcoma.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>HIV is transmitted sexually, in blood or blood products and pre-natally. Those most at risk of acquiring HIV infection are homosexuals, injecting drug misusers and those with bisexual orientation. Others include individuals receiving unscreened blood or blood products and infants born of infected women. AIDS is an illness characterised by one or more indicator diseases. Certain diseases, when definitively diagnosed in immunocompromised individuals without the symptoms of any other cause of immune deficiency, are indicative of AIDS. Irrespective of the presence of any other cause of immune deficiency, if there is a laboratory evidence of HIV infection, certain indicator diseases that require presumptive and definitive diagnosis, are diagnostic of AIDS.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>Acute HIV infection is usually accompanied by transient non-specific illness characterised by fever, malaise, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and rash. Most of these conditions are, however, subclinical. In two to six weeks, antibodies to the core and surface proteins are usually detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and confirmed by immunofluorescence or Western-blot technique. A chronic infection of AIDS that follows is asymptomatic in early stages. In some patients, a persistent generalised lymphadenopathy in the form of nodes of 1 cm or more in diameter in two or more non-contiguous extra-inguinal sites, commonly in the cervical and the axillary lymph nodes, usually develops. In the later stages of the illness, there may develop symptoms such as fever, night sweats, diarrhoea and weight loss. Patients may also suffer from 'minor' opportunistic infections such as oral candidiasis, oral hairy leucoplakia, herpes zoster, recurrent oral or anogenital herpes simplex, folliculitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, impetigo and tinea infections. These conditions which may be signs of major opportunistic infections to come, are now collectively known as symptomatic non-AIDS; they were previously referred to as AIDS-related complex (ARC). The incubation period of HIV infection is long, lasting up to 10 years before the symptoms develop. Classical complications of AIDS are very severe.</p>
                                                
                                                <p>Three main organs systems usually affected by AIDS are—the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Most of these conditions are due to the reactivation of latent organisms in the patient or exposure to the numerous microbial flora in the environment. The overall management of AIDS involves the continuous monitoring, and treatment of these conditions with drugs that may cause some serious side effect.</p>

                                Replication of Viruses
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Viruses need living cells to multiply. The host cell must provide the synthetic machinery, the precursors and the energy for the synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids. The genetic information necessary for this activity is coded in the viral nucleic acid.</p>
                            <p>The mode of replication of viruses was first studied with bacterial viruses called bacteriophages. Although viruses have evolved a variety of different strategies for their multiplication in the parasitized host cells, the general outline of the replication cycle is similar. It can be divided into four sequential phases, though it is a continuous process and the phases may sometimes overlap.</p>

                            <h3 id="phase-i-adsorption">Phase I: Adsorption</h3>
                            <p>Adsorption is the first phase of interaction between the virus and the host cells. Viruses may come in contact with the cells by random collision. Adsorption can then take place only if the host cell has specific receptors to which the virus can attach itself. Receptor molecules differ for different viruses, e.g. the picornaviruses need protein receptors while orthomyxo- and paramyxoviruses need oligosaccharide receptors. Specificity of interaction between viruses and the host cell receptor may vary. For example, the lipoprotein receptors for poliovirus are present on the cells of the central nervous system of primates only, and therefore they can infect only primates. On the other hand, togaviruses can adsorb to a wide range of hosts such as birds, mosquitoes, horses and humans.</p>

                            <h3 id="phase-ii-penetration-and-uncoating">Phase II: Penetration and Uncoating</h3>
                            <p>The process of penetration begins almost immediately after the adsorption of the virus to the cell surface. During penetration, the virus particle is taken up in the host cell. This is also known as <em>viropexis</em>. The process of penetration is intimately associated with the removal of the virion capsid or viral envelope from the nucleic acid or nucleoprotein core. This is known as <em>uncoating</em>.</p>
                            <p>The penetration and uncoating can occur in at least two different ways:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Virus particles appear to fuse with or become engulfed by the cytoplasmic membrane and are transported directly into the cytoplasm as naked particles.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Some viruses may be phagocytosed and appear internally in the cell in vacuoles, which eventually break down, releasing the virus into the cytoplasm.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>After uncoating, infectivity of the virus particle is lost till it completes its replicative cycle. This part of the growth cycle is called the eclipse period.</p>
                            <p>The duration of this period varies depending on individual viruses and the host. It ends with the formation of the first infectious progeny of the virus particles. Viruses are the only infectious agents which require the dissolution of the infecting agent in the process of replication.</p>

                            <h3 id="phase-iii-biosynthesis-of-virus-components">Phase III: Biosynthesis of Virus Components</h3>
                            <p>This phase includes the synthesis of viral nucleic acid, capsid proteins, and the enzymes necessary in the various stages of virus synthesis. The proteins and regulatory enzymes which are required to shut down the normal cellular metabolism of the host cell and direct the sequential production of viral products are also synthesized during this phase. The biosynthesis may be summarised as:</p>

                            <p>The mechanisms for transcription and nucleic acid synthesis differ in various viruses. The viral nucleic acids replicate by Watson-Crick base pairing. Some examples of mechanism of viral nucleic acid replication are:</p>
                            <p><strong>Viruses with double stranded DNA</strong> The double stranded DNA acts as a template for its own replication and also for transcribing into mRNA the genetic information for the synthesis of capsid proteins and enzymes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Viruses with single stranded DNA</strong> The DNA strand acts as a template for its complementary strand, thus forming a double stranded DNA.</p>
                            <p><strong>Single stranded RNA viruses</strong> In viruses such as poliovirus, the RNA can act directly as mRNA for the synthesis of viral proteins and enzymes. This RNA strand can also act as a template for the production of a complementary RNA strand. This strand in turn acts as a template for the viral RNA of new virus particles. In some other RNA viruses, e.g. <em>Influenza virus</em>, the complementary strand acts both as mRNA and as a template for RNA of new virus particles.</p>
                            <p><strong>Retroviruses:</strong> These viruses have a very special way of replication. The single stranded RNA is converted into an RNA:DNA hybrid by the special enzyme, reverse transcriptase. A double stranded DNA is synthesized from the RNA:DNA hybrid, which then gets integrated into the host cell genome. The double stranded DNA then transcribes synthesis of viral proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
                            <p>As a general rule, DNA viruses synthesize their nucleic acid in the nucleus, whereas RNA viruses produce their nucleic acid in the cytoplasm.</p>

                            <h3 id="phase-iv-maturation-and-release">Phase IV: Maturation and Release</h3>
                            <p>Newly synthesized viral genomes and capsid proteins assemble together to form progeny viruses. Icosahedral capsids can condense in the absence of nucleic acid, while viruses with helical symmetry need viral RNA for the formation of the capsid.</p>
                            <p>At this stage, the progeny of nonenveloped viruses is completely developed. There is no special mechanism for the release of nonenveloped viruses. The infected host cell eventually lyses and releases the newly formed virus particles.</p>
                            <p>Enveloped viruses are released by the process of budding through the cell membrane. Virus specific envelope glycoproteins are inserted into the cellular membranes. Viral nucleocapsids then bud through these modified sites, acquiring an envelope in the process. Some viruses, such as herpes simplex, bud through the nuclear membrane.</p>
                            <p>Enveloped viruses are not infectious until they have acquired their envelopes. Therefore, infectious progeny virions do not accumulate within the infected cell.</p>

                            <p>To cause disease, the virus must enter the host, come in contact with susceptible cells, replicate, and produce cell injury. While doing so, it must overcome the defence mechanisms of the host.</p>
                            <p><strong>Entry and primary replication</strong> Viruses enter the host by various portals such as the respiratory or alimentary tract, through skin or by sexual contact. Some viruses replicate and produce disease at the site of entry.</p>
                            <p><strong>Spread of virus in the body</strong> Many viruses migrate from the site of entry via the blood stream, lymphatics or nervous tissue to reach the organ or tissue for which they have affinity. In these tissues they find susceptible cells with specific receptors on the surfaces.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cell damage and disease</strong> After entering the host cell, the virus may remain latent without multiplication or cause widespread tissue damage. When the damage results in the death of the cell, it is called cytocidal; when it causes cell lysis, it is called cytolytic. The damage can also manifest as cellular proliferation (e.g. <em>Molluscum contagiosum</em> which causes nodular lesions) or malignant transformation (e.g. oncogenic viruses causing malignancies).</p>

                            <p>Inclusion bodies have characteristic size, shape, location and staining properties, and can be seen under the light microscope. They may be present in the cytoplasm, as in poxviruses, in the nucleus as in herpesviruses, or in both as in measles virus. They are generally acidophilic and therefore stain pink with Giemsa or Leishman stain. Inclusion bodies, called Negri bodies are seen in the cytoplasm of brain cells of animals infected with rabies virus. Molluscum contagiosum virus produces inclusion bodies as large as 20-30 µm and can be readily seen under the light microscope.</p>
