                            <p>In the beginning of this century, inoculation of human volunteers was the only known method of cultivation of viruses and understanding viral disease. In the past few decades, however, animal inoculation has been employed for virus isolation. The laboratory animals used include monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats, hamsters and mice. The choice of animals and route of inoculation (intracerebral, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intradermal or intraocular) depends on the type of virus to be isolated. Handling of animals and inoculation into various routes requires special experience. In addition to virus isolation, animal inoculation can also be used to observe pathogenesis, immune response, epidemiology and oncogenesis. Growth of a virus in the inoculated animal may be indicated by visible lesions, disease or death. Sometimes serial passage into animals may be required to obtain visible evidence of viral growth.</p>
                            <p>Methods of animal inoculation are described in the section 'Small Laboratory Animals'.</p>

                            <p>For inoculation, an 8–11 days old hen’s egg, preferably with a white shell, is used. Duck eggs can be used in some cases. After inoculation, virus replication takes 2–7 days. The contents of the egg are harvested and inspected for evidence of virus growth. Most viruses either produce morphological changes at the site of inoculation or kill the embryo; or produce haemagglutinins as evidence of growth. Egg inoculation is also useful for cultivation of chlamydiae and rickettsiae.</p>

                                        <p>Mark a small triangle at a site where there are no major blood vessels. This can be located by candling. Cut the shell along the triangle to expose the CAM. Prepare a new air space at the site of inoculation by reducing the original air sac. Cut a small hole at the blunt end above the air sac. Place the egg horizontally. Apply a gentle suction with a rubber teat. A new air space develops at the top of the horizontal egg at the site of the triangular cut. Fill a pipette with about 1 ml inoculum and inoculate through the gap in the CAM and the shell. Rock the egg gently to disperse the inoculum evenly over the membrane. Seal both the openings by replacing the cut triangles with the sealing mixture.</p>

                            <p>To harvest the virus infected fluids and other structures, the shell must be opened with great care to avoid unwanted dissemination of the virus. Use of safety cabinets is recommended. Never use a drill to open infected eggs because it will create aerosols.</p>
                            <p>After the desired incubation period, open the air sac portion at the blunt end which is already marked during candling. Use forceps or a pair of scissors for cutting. Collect the contents of the egg in a sterile petri-dish. Aspirate the fluid from the inoculated area with a syringe. For harvesting CAM, after removing the contents of the egg, pull out the CAM gently with tweezers. Wash in saline 2–3 times. Inspect it for the presence of lesions or pocks. Figure 2.2 shows the pocks produced by a pox virus. Test the harvested fluids by direct method or other methods for the detection and identification of the virus. These methods are discussed later in the 'Diagnosis of viral infections'.</p>

                            <p>The first application of tissue culture in virology was by Steinhardt et al., in 1913. They used it for the maintenance of vaccinia virus in the fragments of rabbit cornea. The major obstacle in the development of tissue culture was contamination by bacteria. It was overcome when antibiotics became available. After this, major progress was achieved by Enders and others in 1949 by growing polio virus in the tissues of non-neural origin. The virus was till then considered to be a strictly neurotropic virus. Since then, a large number of human viruses have been grown and maintained in tissue cultures.</p>

                            <p>There are three types of tissue cultures:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>(i) Organ culture</strong> Organ cultures are essentially cultured tissue pieces in which the architecture and physiology of the tissue is retained. Such small bits of organs can be maintained in vitro for a few days. Organ cultures are necessary for the growth of some fastidious viruses, e.g. ferret trachea can be used for the isolation of some rhinoviruses and coronaviruses.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>(ii) Explant culture</strong> This technique is particularly important for the isolation of viruses in the latent stage. The fragments of the tissue are placed in a test tube or a petri dish in a drop of plasma or fibrin clot. These 'explants' are then covered with growth medium. Adenoid tissue explant cultures were used for the isolation of adenoviruses.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>(iii) Cell culture</strong> This is the most widely used technique for growing viruses. By the action of proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, a tissue is dissociated into its component cells. After washing, cells are suspended in growth medium containing essential amino acids, vitamins, salts, glucose and a buffer. Serum such as foetal calf or newborn bovine serum is added as supplement. Antibiotics are also added to prevent bacterial contamination. A change in pH is indicated by phenol red incorporated in the medium. The cell suspension in this growth medium is dispensed in flasks or tubes. The cells adhere to the surface of the flasks. When incubated under appropriate conditions, they divide and redivide to form a confluent sheet of cells in a single layer. This is known as monolayer. It is achieved by a mechanism known as contact inhibition. This occurs when cells come in contact with surrounding cells which inhibits further multiplication. Formation of a monolayer to cover the surface of the culture vessel usually takes three to seven days depending on the type of cells used.</span>

                            <h3 id="types-of-cell-culture">Types of Cell Culture</h3>
                            <p>Three types of cell cultures are used in virology depending on their origin, chromosomal characters and the number of generations they can be maintained.</p>

                            <h4>Primary cell cultures</h4>
                            <p>These are prepared from an organ which is minced into small pieces, treated with an enzyme and then used for the preparation of a monolayer. They are capable of only limited growth in culture. Only a few serial passages can be made from such primary cell cultures (Fig. 2.3).</p>
                            <p>The advantage of using a primary cell culture is that, if sufficient animal organs are available, a large number of cultures can be prepared. The disadvantage is that primary cell cultures can contain latent viruses in the donor animal. The commonly used primary cell cultures are monkey kidney, human embryonic kidney, human aninion and chick embryo cell cultures. Primary cell cultures are useful for isolation of viruses such as enteroviruses, myxo- and paramyxoviruses. They are used for large scale production of vaccines.</p>

                            <h4>Diploid cell cultures (semicontinuous cell cultures or cell strains)</h4>
                            <p>These cultures mostly consist of a single type of cells which may undergo 30–50 passages before ‘senescence’ or death of the culture. The human embryonic lung or kidney fibroblasts make excellent diploid cell strains, e.g. MRC5, W138 are fibroblast strains.</p>
                            <p>Diploid cultures are maintained by creating a pool of frozen cells stored in liquid nitrogen. Serial passages of primary cell culture are made and large portions of the initial 8–10 passages are stored in liquid nitrogen. Routine cultures may be started later, for example, from the fifteenth passage and the same line can be used up to about the thirtieth passage. When the diploid cell strains start dying, the subcultures can be restarted from the frozen portions (Fig. 2.4). In this way, the cells from the same source can be used for many years giving constant results.</p>
                            <p>Diploid cell strains are used for selective isolation of some viruses, and for preparation of vaccines. These include herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, varicellazoster and rhinovirus.</p>

                            <h4>Continuous cell-lines</h4>
                            <p>As the name suggests, these cells may be serially subcultured indefinitely (Fig. 2.5). The continuous cell lines have a malignant character, and the number of chromosomes is different from that of the original host. The cells are described as heteroploid. These cells have a very fast growth rate and contact inhibition is absent.</p>
                            <p>The continuous cell lines commonly used in the laboratory are HeLa (human cervical cancer), HEp2 (human epithelial), BHK21 (baby hamster kidney), RK13 (rabbit kidney) and Vero (African green monkey kidney). HeLa, HEp2 and Vero cells are used for the cultivation of poliovirus, coxsackie virus, adenovirus and herpes simplex virus. RK13 and BHK21 can be valuable for the isolation and propagation of rubella virus. However, the continuous cell lines cannot be used for the preparation of vaccines because vaccines grown in cancer cells are not considered to be safe.</p>

                            <p>Cells need culture media for their growth. A large number of tissue culture media have been devised for the growth of cells in culture. Some of them are made for special purposes. Others are made for general use. These media contain various concentrations of amino acids, vitamins, growth factors and inorganic salts. Carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose or galactose are added with glutamine as a source of carbon for metabolism of cells. Such media are also available commercially. For example, MEM (minimum essential medium) by Eagle.</p>

                            <h3 id="conditions-for-growth">Conditions for Growth and Maintenance of Cell Cultures</h3>
                            <p>Conditions required for cell cultures vary depending upon the type of cells used. Essential vitamins and amino acids are required by all the cell lines. Most components are well preserved at 4°C except for L-glutamine, which should be added freshly at the time of use.</p>
                            <p>MEM is supplemented with about 10% serum to enhance initial growth. After the monolayer reaches confluence, the serum concentration may be reduced to 0.5% for maintenance of the monolayer. The serum used must be free from infectious agents such as mycoplasma and from antibodies to viruses. Foetal calf serum is most commonly used. Some cell lines need higher concentration of nutrients than others. MEM is the commonest culture medium for cell lines. It contains the following:</p>

                            <p>Nuclei of the cells in the monolayer exhibit fluorescence under the microscope. Mycoplasma, if present appear as tiny fluorescent dots around the nucleus either singly or in groups. They have a uniform size ranging from 0.1–0.3 µm in diameter and may be pleomorphic, ranging from spherical to filamentous forms.</p>
