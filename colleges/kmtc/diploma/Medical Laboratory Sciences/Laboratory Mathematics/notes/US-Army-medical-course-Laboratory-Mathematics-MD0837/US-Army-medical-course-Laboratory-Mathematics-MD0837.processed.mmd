\section*{LESSON 1}

\section*{GENERAL MATHEMATICS REVIEW}

\section*{Section I. PROPERTIES OF REAL NUMBERS}

\section*{1-1. DISCUSSION}

Real numbers can be described as being the set of all x , such that x is the coordinate of a point on a number line. The real numbers include the rational and irrational numbers. Rational numbers include integers and quotients of integers. Integers are whole numbers. Positive integers, such as $1,2,3$, and so forth, are also called natural numbers. An operation is a method of combining two elements of the set of real numbers to form a third element (not exclusive). The properties of real numbers depend upon two basic operations, addition and multiplication. This section is designed to give you the concepts and skills necessary for the content and course work to follow.

\section*{1-2. SOME FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF REAL NUMBERS}

For any real numbers $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}$, and d , the additive and multiplicative properties are as follows:

\section*{a. Commutative Properties.}
$$a+b=b+a \quad a b=b a$$

Examples:
$$3+5=5+3$$
$$2 \times 4=4 \times 2$$
b. Associative Properties.
$$(a+b)+c=a+(b+c) \quad(a b) c=a(b c)$$

Examples:
$$(2+1)+4=2+(1+4) \quad(4 \times 3) \times 2=4 \times(3 \times 2)$$
c. Identity Properties.
$$a+0=a \quad a \times 1=a$$

Examples:
$$3+0=3$$
$$7 \times 1=7$$
d. Inverse Properties.
$$a+(-a)=0$$

For each nonzero real number a, there is a unique real number 1/a such that:
$$a \times \frac{1}{a}=1$$

Examples:
$$3+(-3)=0$$
$$12 \times \frac{1}{12}=1$$

\section*{e. Distributive Property.}
$\mathrm{a}(\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{c})=\mathrm{ab}+\mathrm{ac}$
Example: $2(3+2)=(2 \times 3)+(2 \times 2)$

\section*{1-3. DEFINITIONS OF SUBTRACTION AND DIVISION}
a. Subtraction is a special case of addition.
$\mathrm{a}-\mathrm{b}=\mathrm{a}+(-\mathrm{b})$
Example: $5-2=5+(-2)$
b. Division is a special case of multiplication.
$$\frac{\mathrm{a}}{\mathrm{~b}}=\mathrm{a} \times \frac{1}{\mathrm{~b}} \text { provided that } \mathrm{b} \text { is not equal to } 0$$

Example: $\frac{6}{3}=6 \times \frac{1}{3}$.
NOTE: Division by 0 is undefined, because any real number divided by 0 has no solution.

\section*{1-4. PROPERTIES OF ZERO (0)}
a. $a \times 0=0$

Example: $5 \times 0=0$
b. If $\frac{a}{b}=0$, then $a=0$

Example: 0
$$\frac{}{3}=0$$

\section*{1-5. PROPERTIES OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS}
a. (-a) (-b) = ab

Example: $(-3)(-4)=12$
NOTE: When no arithmetic operator $(+,-, \div)$ is present between two real numbers, one or both being placed in parentheses, multiplication is implied.
b. (-a) b = - (ab)

Example: $(-2) 3=-6$
C. $-\mathrm{a}=(-1) \mathrm{a}$

Example: $-13=(-1) 13$

\section*{1-6. PROPERTIES OF FRACTIONS}
a. $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c .}{d}$ if and only if $a d=b c$

Example: $\frac{4}{2}=\frac{8}{4} \quad$ since $(4)(4)=(2)(8)$
b. $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{b}=\frac{a+c}{b}$

Example: $\frac{6}{2}+\frac{4}{2}=\frac{6+4}{2}=\frac{10}{2}=5$
c. $\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{a d+b c}{b d}$

Example: $\frac{4}{3}+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{(4)(2)+(3)(1)}{(3)(2)}=\frac{8+3}{6}=\frac{11}{6}$
d. $\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d}=\frac{a c}{b d}$

Example: $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{5}=\frac{12}{15}$
e. $\frac{a}{b} \cdot \div \frac{c}{d}=\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c}$

Example: $\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{4}{5}=\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{4}=\frac{10}{12}$
f. $-\frac{a}{b}=\frac{-a}{b}=\frac{a}{-b}$

Example: $-\frac{6}{3}=\frac{-6}{3}=\frac{6}{-3}=-2$

\section*{1-7. ORDER OF OPERATIONS}
a. If parentheses or brackets are present, evaluate the expressions within first, starting with the innermost set of parentheses using the rules that follow.
b. Evaluate any exponential expressions.
c. Evaluate any multiplications or divisions from left to right.
d. Evaluate any additions or subtractions from left to right.
e. If an expression is in fractional form, perform stated operations in the numerator and denominator, then simplify if possible.

Examples:
$$\frac{3+10}{2-4}=\frac{13}{-2} \quad \frac{15}{9-6}=\frac{15}{3}=5$$

NOTE: A good way to remember the order of operations is to use the memory aid, "Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally." The order for solving algebra equations is: parenthesis, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction.

\section*{1-8. EXERCISES, SECTION I}

After you have completed these exercises, turn to the end of the lesson and check your answers with the solutions.

r. $150 \times 0$
s. $\frac{2}{9}+\frac{5}{9}$
t. $\frac{2}{8}-\frac{4}{8}$

\section*{Section II. PROPERTIES OF EQUALITY}

\section*{1-9. DISCUSSION}

An equation is a statement that two expressions or quantities are equal in value. The statement of equality $2 x+3=11$ is an equation. It is algebraic shorthand for "the sum of two times some number plus three is equal to eleven." Of course this algebraic shorthand makes problem solving much easier. Solving an equation is determining the values of the unknown numbers in that equation that makes the equation true. Various techniques may be employed in the solving of equations. The form of the equation and the degree (highest power a variable is raised in the equation) will determine the method utilized in problem solving. Most of the problem solving in the following course work will involve first-degree equations; that is equations whose variables are raised to a power of one, so the following methods will develop techniques to solve equations of this type.

NOTE: Some second-degree equations will be encountered in the pH and buffers problems. However, methods taught here will be sufficient for any problem solving.

\section*{1-10. PROPERTIES OF EQUALITY}

For any real number $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$, or c , the properties are as follows.
a. Reflexive Property.
$\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{a}$
Example: $8=8$
b. Symmetric Property.

If $\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{b}$, then $\mathrm{b}=\mathrm{a}$
Example: If $\mathrm{x}+5=\mathrm{y}$, then $\mathrm{y}=\mathrm{x}+5$
c. Transitive Property.

If $\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{b}$ and $\mathrm{b}=\mathrm{c}$, then $\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{c}$
Example: If $\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}=\mathrm{c}$, and $\mathrm{c}=3 \mathrm{a}$, then $\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}=3 \mathrm{a}$
d. Substitution Property.

If $\mathrm{k}=\mathrm{x}$, then k may replace x in any equation without changing the truth of the equation.

Example: If $2 \mathrm{k}-4=\mathrm{x}$, and $\mathrm{x}+\mathrm{k}=9$, then $2 k-4+k=9$

\section*{1-11. RULES OF EQUALITY}
a. Adding or subtracting the same quantity on both sides of an equation produces an equivalent equation.
b. Multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by the same nonzero quantity produces an equivalent equation.
c. Simplifying an expression on either side of an equation produces an equivalent equation.

\section*{1-12. SOLVING FIRST DEGREE EQUATIONS}
a. Eliminate any fractions by multiplication.
b. Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible by combining like terms.
c. Use the addition property to simplify the equation so that all terms with the desired variable are on one side of the equation and all numbers and variables other than the one being solved for are on the other side.
d. Use multiplication or division to get an equation with just the desired variable on one side.
e. Check your answer by substituting the solution back into the original equation and evaluating it for truth when practical.

\section*{1-13. PROBLEM-SOLVING TECHNIQUES}
a. Solve for x :
$$\begin{array}{ll}
3[1-2(x+1)]=2-x & \\
3[1-2 x-2]=2-x & \text { simplify } \\
3(-1-2 x)=2-x & \\
-3-6 x=2-x & \\
-3-5 x=2 & \text { add } x \text { to both sides } \\
-5 x=5 & \text { add } 3 \text { to both sides } \\
x=-1 & \text { divide both sides by }-5
\end{array}$$

Check the Solution.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
3[1-2(-1+1)]=2-(-1) & \text { substitute }-1 \text { for all } x \\
3[1-2(0)]=2-(-1) & \text { evaluate } \\
3(1)=2+1 & \text { true } \\
3=3 &
\end{array}$$
b. Solve for x :
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x}{2}-\frac{3 x}{4}=1 \\
& 4\left|\frac{x}{2}-\frac{3 x}{4}\right|=(4) 1
\end{aligned}$$

Check the Solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{(-4)}{2}-\frac{3(-4)}{4}=1 \\
& -2+3=1 \\
& 1=1
\end{aligned}$$
c. Solve for $y$ :
$$\begin{aligned}
& 9 x+a b c=y z-m n o \\
& 9 x+a b c+m n o=y z \\
& \frac{9 x+a b c+m n o}{z}=y
\end{aligned}$$
multiply both sides by the least common denominator
simplify
multiply both sides by -1
true
adding mno to both sides
dividing both sides by z

NOTE: With problems that contain more than one variable, it may not be practical to check for truth. However, double-check your work for accuracy.

\section*{1-14. EXERCISES, SECTION II}

After you have completed these exercises, turn to the end of the lesson and check your answers with the solutions.
a $1-(4 c+7)=-5 c$
b. $8+6 b=3 b-4$
c. $r-(5-[r-(4+r)])=8$
d. $8 z-2 z+6=z-6$
e. $-\frac{5 \mathrm{k}}{9}=2$
f. $4(v-1)-4(2 v+2)=8$
g. $\frac{7 r}{2}-\frac{9 r}{2}=16$
h. $\frac{y-8}{5}+\frac{y}{3}=\frac{-8}{5}$
i. Solve for $y$ :
$$4 x+6 y=12$$
j. $\quad-7-5 k=10 k-7$
k. $p+9=0$
I. $-7 \mathrm{x}+1=50$

q. Solve for c:
rst $=$ abc - ghi
r. Solve for x :
$$\frac{a b c}{d e f}=\frac{r s t}{x y z}$$
s. Solve for b:
$$b+c=0$$

\section*{Section III. ROUNDING OFF NUMBERS}

\section*{1-15. DISCUSSION}

Rounding off of numbers is the dropping of one or more digits of a number to obtain the desired number of significant figures.

\section*{1-16. RULES}
a. When the digit dropped is less than five, the last digit retained remains unchanged; e.g., 6.582 becomes 6.58 .
b. When the digit dropped is greater than five, the last digit retained is increased by one (1); e.g., 6.586 becomes 6.59.
c. When the digit dropped is five alone or a five followed by only a zero or only zeros, the digit remaining is rounded to the nearest even number; e.g., 2.585 becomes 2.58. Since the remaining digit was already an even number it was not changed. However, the number 2.575 when rounded off becomes 2.58 , since the remaining digit was seven.

NOTE: Although we will follow the above rule concerning the dropping of the number five, be aware that it is not always observed. It is quite common to round up if the digit dropped is five or greater and to leave the last digit unchanged if the digit dropped is four or less.

\section*{1-17. EXERCISES, SECTION III}

\section*{Section IV. SCIENTIFIC NOTATION}

\section*{1-18. DISCUSSION}

In the clinical laboratory, elementary mathematics are frequently used by the laboratory specialist to calculate the amount of a specific chemical needed to prepare a reagent or to determine the concentration of a chemical constituent in a clinical sample. To enable the laboratory specialist to perform calculations with greater efficiency, the use of scientific notation must be mastered.

\section*{1-19. EXPONENTS}

An exponent is a superscript number written to the right of a base number. An exponent indicates the number of times the base number is to be used as a multiplicative factor to produce a product equal to the exponential expression.

\section*{a. General Examples.}
(1) $32=3 \times 3=9$

In the above example, the exponent is the number two and indicates that the number three, referred to as the base number, is to be used as a multiplicative factor twice.
(2) $23=2 \times 2 \times 2=8$

In the above example, the exponent is the number three and indicates that the base number two is to be used as a multiplicative factor three times.
b. Examples Using Powers of Ten (10).
(1) $102=10 \times 10=100$
(2) $103=10 \times 10 \times 10=1000$

\section*{1-20. RULES OF EXPONENTIATION}

The following rules apply to exponential expressions that have the same base with the exception of addition and subtraction.
a. Addition and Subtraction. The expressions must first be evaluated. Then, addition or subtraction is performed in the usual manner.

Example.
$$102+101=100+10=110$$
b. Multiplication.
xaxb = xa+b

Example.
$$2322=23+2=25=2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2=32$$
c. Division.
$$\frac{x a}{x b}=x a-b$$

Example.
$$\frac{24}{22}=24-2=22=2 \times 2=4$$
d. Exponential Expressions Raised to a Power.
$$(x a) b=x a b$$

Example.
$$(22) 3=2(2)(3)=26=2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2=64$$

\section*{1-21. EXPRESSING NUMBERS IN TERMS OF SCIENTIFIC NOTATION}
a. Division. Scientific notation uses the exponential method of expressing very large and very small numbers in terms of an exponential expression. Utilizing this method, numbers are expressed as a product of two numbers. The first number is called the digit term and is a number greater than or equal to one but less than ten. The second number of the product is called the exponential term and is written as a power of ten.
b. Examples.
(1) $100=1 \times 10 \times 10=1 \times 102$

In the above example, the digit term is the number one and the exponential term is ten squared (102).
(2) $200=2 \times 10 \times 10=2 \times 102$

In this example, the digit term is the number two and the exponential term is ten squared (102).
(3) $745=7.45 \times 10 \times 10=7.45 \times 102$
(4) $0.00486=4.86 \times 10-1 \times 10-1 \times 10-1=4.86 \times 10-3$
c. Decimal Movement. In examining the above examples, it is easily seen that the exponent of the number ten is determined by movement of the decimal point. The exponent of the number ten is positive when the decimal is moved to the left and negative when moved to the right. Standard scientific notation refers to the placement of the decimal to the right of the first nonzero integer.
(1) Positive exponents. When the decimal point is moved to the left, the exponent of the number ten is always positive.
(2) Negative exponents. When the decimal point is moved to the right, the exponent of the number ten is always negative.
(3) Examples.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 214=2.14 \times 102 \\
& 0.102=1.02 \times 10-1
\end{aligned}$$

In the first example using the number 214 , the decimal was moved two places to the left and thus the exponent of the number ten is two. In the second example using the number 0.102 , the decimal was moved one place to the right and thus the exponent of the number ten is minus one (-1).
d. Powers of Ten (10) Expressed in Scientific Notation.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 1,000,000=1 \times 106 \\
& 100,000=1 \times 105 \\
& 10,000=1 \times 104 \\
& 1,000=1 \times 103 \\
& 100=1 \times 102 \\
& 10=1 \times 101 \\
& 1=1 \times 100 \\
& 0.1=1 \times 10-1 \\
& 0.01=1 \times 10-2 \\
& 0.001=1 \times 10-3 \\
& 0.0001=1 \times 10-4 \\
& 0.00001=1 \times 10-5 \\
& 0.000001=1 \times 10-6
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{1-22. CHANGING THE SIGN OF THE EXPONENT}
a. To change the sign of the exponent, move the exponential term to the denominator or numerator as appropriate with a concurrent change in sign. This procedure yields an equivalent expression.

Example.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Numerator } \quad \frac{10-6}{104}=\frac{10-4}{106}=10-10 \\
& \text { Denominator } \quad
\end{aligned}$$
b. When an exponential term is moved from one side of the division line to the other, the exponent changes signs.

Example. Write and equivalent expression of 102, changing the sign of the exponent.

Solution.

Numerator $\quad \frac{102}{1}=\frac{1}{10-2}$
Denominator
c. Write an expression that changes the sign of the exponential term in 1/106 without changing the value.

Solution.
$$\frac{1}{106}=\frac{10-6}{1}=10-6$$
d. Write an expression that changes the signs of the exponential without changing the value.
$$\frac{4.8 \times 10-7}{1.3 \times 104}$$

Solution.
$$\frac{4.8 \times 10-7}{1.3 \times 104}=\frac{4.8 \times 10-4}{1.3 \times 107}=3.7 \times 10-11$$

\section*{1-23. MULTIPLICATION OF NUMBERS EXPRESSED IN SCIENTIFIC NOTATION}

To multiply numbers expressed in scientific notation, multiply the digit terms in the usual way and add the exponents of the exponential terms.
a. Example. Multiply 102 by 103

Solution. In multiplying exponential terms, the exponents of the base ten (10) are added (the base numbers must be the same), therefore:
$$102 \times 103=102+3=105$$
b. Example. Multiply $3.2 \times 102$ by $2.0 \times 103$

Solution. Remember that when multiplying exponential expressions, the digit terms are multiplied in the usual manner and the exponents of the exponential terms are added, therefore:
$(3.2 \times 102) \times(2.0 \times 103)=3.2 \times 2.0 \times 102 \times 103=$
$3.2 \times 2.0 \times 102+3=6.4 \times 105$
c. Example. Multiply $3.2 \times 10-2$ by $2.0 \times 103$

Solution.
$(3.2 \times 10-2) \times(2.0 \times 103)=3.2 \times 2.0 \times 10-2 \times 103=$
$6.4 \times 10-2+3=6.4 \times 101$

Equivalently:
$3.2 \times 10-2$
$2.0 \times 103$
$\overline{6.4 \times 101}$

Multiply the digit terms
and add the exponents of the
exponential terms.
d. Example. Multiply 0.00056 by 0.013 using scientific notation.

Solution. Before you multiply, the above numbers must be converted to scientific notation. Multiply the digit terms and add the exponentential terms.

Thus, $0.00056=5.6 \times 10-4$ and $0.013=1.3 \times 10-2$
$5.6 \times 10-4$
$1.3 \times 10-2$
$7.28 \times 10-6$ → $7.3 \times 10-6$

\section*{1-24. DIVISION OF NUMBERS EXPRESSED IN SCIENTIFIC NOTATION}
a. Method One. To divide exponential expressions, the digit term of the numerator is divided by the digit term of the denominator in the usual way, and the exponent of the denominator is subtracted from the exponent of the numerator.
(1) Example. Divide 103 by 102

Solution. In division, the exponent of the denominator is subtracted from the exponent of the numerator. Therefore:
$$103 \text { divided by } 102 \text { = 103-2 = } 101 \text { = } 10$$
(2) Example. Divide $5.0 \times 103$ by $2.5 \times 102$

Solution. By using method one, the laboratory specialist divides 5.0 by 2.5 and then subtracts the exponents of the exponential terms. Therefore:
$$\frac{5.0}{2.5}=2.0 \text { and } 103-2=101$$

Thus, $5.0 \times 103$ divided by $2.5 \times 102=2.0 \times 101$
b. Method Two. In this method of dividing exponential expressions, the digit term is treated in exactly the same manner as in method one. The exponential term in the denominator is moved to the numerator, with the appropriate sign change, and the exponents of the exponential terms in the numerator are added.
(1) Example. Divide $5.0 \times 103$ by $2.5 \times 102$

Solution.
$$\frac{5.0 \times 103}{2.5 \times 102}=\frac{5.0 \times 103 \times 10-2}{2.5}=\frac{5.0 \times 103-2}{2.5}=2.0 \times 101$$
(2) Example. Divide 0.000005 by 250

Solution. Before the above numbers can be divided using the methods previously demonstrated, they must be converted to scientific notation.

Thus, $0.0000050=5.0 \times 10-6$ and $250=2.5 \times 102$
$$\frac{5.0 \times 10-6}{2.5 \times 102}=\frac{5.0 \times 10-6 \times 10-2}{2.5}=2.0 \times 10-8$$

\section*{Section V. SIGNIFICANT FIGURES}

\section*{1-26. DISCUSSION}

The validity of a number depends upon the precision to which the number was determined.
a. For example, an individual counted the number of ants that were in an anthill and reported that there were 246,337 ants. This number is obviously inaccurate since during the period of the count, ants died and others hatched. A more realistic number of ants would have been 246,000 , or $2.46 \times 105$.
b. A common pitfall is the manner in which laboratory values are reported. The specialist can use a calculator to determine the value of an unknown specimen and report a value to the physician that is inaccurate. For example, in using the photometric equation, the value for glucose in a clinical specimen was determined to be 99.1825734 using the calculator. It would be absurd to report this value since the limits of accuracy of the measuring device used to obtain the calculation data (accuracy of the test) allows, at best, only a value of 99 .
c. In most cases, the number of significant figures in your least accurate piece of data used in your calculations determines the accuracy of reported results.

\section*{1-27. DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES IN A NUMBER}
a. Nonzero Integers. All nonzero integers are significant figures.
b. Use of Zero. A zero in a number may or may not be significant, depending upon the manner in which it is used.
(1) Zeros used to locate decimal points. If one or more zeros are used to locate a decimal point (place holder) they are not significant. For example, the numbers $0.025,0.0025$, and 0.00025 each have only two significant figures, the two and the five.
(2) Zeros appearing between numbers. When a zero appears between
numbers it is significant. For example, 1.095 has four significant figures.
(3) Zeros appearing at the end of a number.
(a) If a number contains a decimal point and the last number (digit) is a zero, the zero is a significant figure. For example, 15.60 has four significant figures.
(b) If the last digit in the number is a zero and the number does not contain a decimal point, the zero may or may not be significant. For example, the number 1670 has four significant figures if the accuracy of the measurement included the zero as a significant digit. If the digit seven was estimated, then the zero is not significant and hence the number contains only three significant figures.

NOTE: For all course work that follows, any trailing zeros will be considered significant. For example, the number 1000 has four significant figures.
c. Examples.

\section*{1-28. IMPLIED LIMITS}

If a laboratory result is reported as 3.6 , it indicates that this value is accurate to the nearest tenth and that the exact value lies between 3.55 and 3.65 .

\section*{1-29. LABORATORY APPLICATION}

The real importance of significant figures lies in their application to fundamental laboratory calculations.
a. Addition and Subtraction. When adding or subtracting, the last digit retained in the sum or difference should correspond to the first doubtful decimal place of the addends (least accurate number).

Example. Add 5.683 plus 0.0052 .
Solution. In the number 5.683, the three is the doubtful decimal place; i.e., the value of this measurement could vary from 5.6825 to 5.6835 . Since the fourth digit after the decimal point is unknown, the answer is limited to four digits. Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 5.683 \\
+ & 0.0052 \\
\hline 5.6882 & --->5.688
\end{aligned}$$
b. Multiplication and Division. When multiplying or dividing, the product or
quotient can contain no more significant digits than the least number of significant figures in the numbers involved in the calculation.

Example. Multiply 0.5823 by 8.2 .
Solution. The number 0.5823 contains four significant figures whereas the number 8.2 contains only two significant figures. Thus, the product can contain only two significant figures.

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Therefore & 0.5823 \\
& $\times 8.2$ \\
& \cline { 2 - 2 } $4.77486 \ldots-\cdots 4.8$
\end{tabular}

\section*{1-31. DISCUSSION}
The "common" logarithm (log) or the logarithm to the base ten (log10) of a number is the exponent (power) to which the number ten must be raised to equal that number. For example, the logarithm of 100 is equal to two, since the exponent (power) to which the number ten (10) must be raised to equal 100 is two or $100=102$. Since logarithms are exponents, they follow the "Rules of Exponentiation" previously discussed. The laboratory specialist can utilize logarithms to perform multiplication, division, find roots, and raise a number to a power. A second use of logarithms is in the solving of a number of equations used in the clinical laboratory; e.g., $\mathrm{pH}=-\log [\mathrm{H}+]$ and absorbance $=2-\log$ \%T

NOTE: The work with logarithms in this subcourse will consist of traditional manual methods with tables (see Appendix B) rather than the use of a calculator to find logarithms and related values. Please remember this when you do the exercises and the examination items. Logarithms are approximate values. Comparable operations using a calculator will yield slightly different results in most instances.

\section*{1-32. EXAMPLES}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Number & Number expressed exponentially & Logarithm (log) \\
\hline 10000 & 104 & 4 \\
\hline 1000 & 103 & 3 \\
\hline 100 & 102 & 2 \\
\hline 10 & 101 & 1 \\
\hline 1 & 100 & 0 \\
\hline 0.1 & 10-1 & -1 \\
\hline 0.001 & 10-3 & -3 \\
\hline 0.0001 & 10-4 & -4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It is easily seen that the exponent (power) to which the number ten has been raised is the same as the logarithm.

\section*{1-33. PARTS OF A LOGARITHM}

A logarithm is composed of two parts.
a. The characteristic is the portion of the logarithm that lies to the left of the decimal point. It is a whole number that may be negative or positive, depending upon the original number.
b. The mantissa is the portion of the logarithm that lies to the right of the decimal point. The mantissa is a decimal fraction of one (1) and it is always positive.
c. For example, the logarithm of 20 is equal to 1.3010 , where the number one is the characteristic and the number .3010 is the mantissa.

\section*{1-34. DETERMINATION OF THE CHARACTERISTIC}

In order to find the logarithm of a number, the characteristic must first be determined. The characteristic is always determined by inspection of the original number or by applying a simple rule.

\section*{a. By Inspection.}
(1) If we take the number 20 , we see that it lies between 10 and 100 , which have logarithms of one and two, respectively. Therefore, the logarithm of the number 20 must be between one and two. The logarithm of 20 is 1.3010 and hence the characteristic (remembering that the characteristic is the number to the left of the decimal point) of the logarithm is one.
(2) An alternate method is to express the original number in scientific notation. The power of ten in the expression is the characteristic of the original number. The number 20 when expressed in scientific notation is $2.0 \times 101$. Hence, the characteristic of the original number is one.

NOTE: Both methods for determining the characteristic may be used for numbers less than or greater than one.

\section*{b. By Rule.}
(1) Original numbers greater than one. If the number whose logarithm is being determined is greater than one, the characteristic for the logarithm of that number will be positive and one less than the number of digits found to the left of the decimal point in the original number. For example:

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\begin{tabular}{c} 
Original \\
Number
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Number of digits \\
to left of decimal
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Characteristic \\
(digits - one)
\end{tabular} \\
2.0 & 1 & 0 \\
20.0 & 2 & 1 \\
200.0 & 3 & 2 \\
2000.0 & 4 & 3 \\
20000.0 & 5 & 4
\end{tabular}
(2) Original numbers that are less than one. If the number whose logarithm is being determined is less than one, the characteristic for the logarithm of that number will be negative and is a number one more than the number of zeros to the right of the decimal point that precede the first nonzero integer. For example:

\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\begin{tabular}{c} 
Original \\
Number
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Number of zeros \\
to right of decimal
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Characteristic \\
(num. of 0 + 1)
\end{tabular} \\
\cline { 1 - 1 } 0.2 & 0 & -1 \\
0.02 & 1 & -2 \\
0.002 & 2 & -3 \\
0.0002 & 3 & -4
\end{tabular}
(3) A negative characteristic may be distinguished from a positive characteristic by placing a negative sign above the characteristic. This is necessary since the mantissa is always positive. For example:
$$\log 0.2=\overline{1} .3010$$
(4) Equivalently, the negative logarithm of 0.2 could be expressed as the difference between the characteristic and mantissa. This is done to facilitate certain methods of calculation, pH in particular. In this case, the negative sign is placed in front of the difference. For example:
$$\log 0.2=\overline{1} .3010=0.3010-1=-0.6990$$

This method is considered by most authors to be an incorrect method to express the logarithm of a number less than one because the mantissa may never be negative. However, this method is commonly used by electronic calculators and certain other methods of calculation. You should be able to use either method without error in the laboratory, as long as you consistently use either approach.
(5) A logarithm with a negative characteristic may also be changed to a positive form by adding ten to the characteristic and adding minus ( - ) ten after the mantissa. Since ten is both added and subtracted to the logarithm the operation does not change the value of the logarithm. For example:
$$\log 0.2=\overline{1} .3010$$

Add ten to the characteristic
$$10+(-1)=9--->9.3010$$

Add minus ten (-10) after the mantissa
$$9.3010-10=\overline{1} .3010$$

\section*{1-35. DETERMINATION OF THE MANTISSA}

The mantissa of the logarithm is found in the table of "common" logarithms (see Appendix B) and is independent of the position of the decimal point in the original number. Thus, the numbers $0.02,0.2,2,20,200,2,000$, and 20,000 all have the same mantissa; i.e., 0.3010.
a. In determining the number to obtain the mantissa, do not consider preceding zeros.
b. The number for which a mantissa is desired, commonly referred to as the natural number, must contain at least three digits, the last two of which may be zeros.
c. For numbers that contain less than three digits, add enough zeros to yield a three digit number.
d. Numbers that contain more than three nonzero digits should be rounded to three significant figures.
e. Consider the following examples:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\begin{tabular}{l} 
Original \\
Number
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Base \\
Number
\end{tabular} \\
0.312 & 312 \\
1.031 & 103 \\
55.357 & 554 \\
4 & 400 \\
0.9 & 900
\end{tabular}
f. Examine the Appendix B, Table of Four-Place Logarithms. The table consists of a series of columns and rows of four-digit numbers bordered left by a column of two-digit numbers and uppermost by a row of single-digit numbers.
g. The first two digits of the natural number can be found in the first column.
h. The third digit of the number can be found in the uppermost row.
i. To determine the mantissa of a number, find the first two digits of the number in the left column. Move across this row to the column headed by the third digit of the number.
j. The four - digit number at the intersection is the mantissa of the given natural number.

\section*{1-36. DETERMINATION OF THE LOGARITHM OF A NUMBER}

To determine the logarithm of a number, both the characteristic and the mantissa must be found. The characteristic must be determined by inspection (or rule), and the mantissa must be looked up in a table of "common" logarithms (a calculator may also be used). By close examination of the following table, the determination of the logarithm of a number should become clear.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Original Number & Characteristic & Mantissa & Logarithm \\
\hline 0.2 & -1 & 3010 & 1.3010 \\
\hline 20 & 1 & 3010 & 1.3010 \\
\hline 200 & 2 & 3010 & 2.3010 \\
\hline 2000 & 3 & 3010 & 3.3010 \\
\hline 20000 & 4 & 3010 & 4.3010 \\
\hline 0.030 & -2 & 4771 & $\overline{2} .4771$ \\
\hline 412 & 2 & 6149 & 2.6149 \\
\hline 5490 & 3 & 7396 & 3.7396 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{1-37. LOGARITHMS OF NUMBERS EXPRESSED AS EXPONENTIALS}

The determination of the logarithm becomes quite simple when the original number is written in scientific notation; i.e., as an exponential expression. This form of expressing the original number also should help you understand the meaning of the characteristic and the mantissa.
a. Example 1. Find the logarithm of the number 4120.

Solution. First write 4120 in exponential form.
4120 becomes $4.12 \times 103$
Take the logarithm of the exponential expression.
$$\log (4.12 \times 103)$$

When determining the logarithm of two numbers being multiplied together ( $4.12 \times 103$ ), the logarithm of each number is determined and the logarithms are then added.
$$\log (4.12 \times 103)=\log 4.12+\text { the } \log 103$$

The logarithm of 4.12 is 0.6149 (mantissa) and the logarithm of 103 is three (characteristic). Thus, the logarithm of $4120=0.6149+3$ or 3.6149.
b. Example 2. Find the logarithm of 0.000412 .

Solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 0.000412=4.12 \times 10-4 \\
& \log (4.12 \times 10-4)= \\
& \log 4.12+\log 10-4= \\
& 0.6149+(-4)=
\end{aligned}$$
$\overline{4} .6149$ or equivalently, with a calculator, -3.3851

\section*{1-38. DETERMINATION OF ANTILOGARITHMS}

The antilogarithm (antilog) is the number corresponding to a logarithm. For example, the antilogarithm of three is the number whose logarithm equals three. The number whose logarithm equals three is 1000 ; thus, the antilogarithm of three is 1000 .
a. Mantissa. The mantissa of the logarithm can be found in the table of "common" logarithms, and the three digits corresponding to the mantissa is written down. In the event that the exact mantissa value is not in the table, find the closest mantissa in the columns without exceeding the value of the mantissa being worked with. Remember the mantissa is the number to the right of the decimal point.

Examples.

\begin{tabular}{lc} 
Mantissa & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Corresponding \\
Digits
\end{tabular} \\
0.8451 & 700 \\
0.3010 & 200 \\
0.2945 & 197 \\
0.6981 & 499 \\
0.9996 & 999
\end{tabular}
b. Characteristic. The characteristic of the logarithm determines where the decimal point will be placed in the number corresponding to the mantissa when determining the antilogarithm.

\begin{tabular}{lc} 
Examples. & \begin{tabular}{c} 
Number of digits to the \\
left of the decimal
\end{tabular} \\
Characteristic & 1 \\
0 & 2 \\
1 & 3 \\
2 & 4
\end{tabular}
c. Example 1. Find the antilogarithm of 2.000.

Solution. Determine the digits that correspond to the mantissa. The mantissa is . 000 and the digits corresponding to this mantissa in the table of "common" logarithms are 100. The characteristic of two indicates that there are three digits or places to the left of the decimal point. Thus, antilog $2.000=100$. To check your answer, take the logarithm of 100:
$$\log 100=2$$
d. Example 2. Find the antilogarithm of 3.2989.

Solution. The digits corresponding to the mantissa ( 0.2989 ) are 199. The characteristic indicates that there are four digits to the left of the decimal point. Therefore, antilog 3.2989 = 1990.
e. Example 3. Find the antilogarithm of $\overline{3} .2989$.

Solution. Rewrite $\overline{3.2989}$ as 0.2989-3. This puts the logarithm in the form of an exponential expression. Take the antilogarithm of both numbers.

Antilog 0.2989 X antilog -3.
NOTE: The two antilog expressions are multiplied together since they represent numbers, not logs (refer to the Rules of Exponentiation in paragraph 1--20).

The antilogarithm of $0.2989=1.99$
The antilogarithm of minus three ( -3 ) is 10-3
Thus, the antilogarithm of $\overline{3} .2989=1.99 \times 10-3$
f. Example 4. Use the logarithm table to find the antilogarithm of -2.5017 , a logarithm from an electronic calculator.

Solution. In the calculator, the negative characteristic and positive mantissa were combined by algebraic addition to form the single negative number. To change a negative logarithm to the correct form, add the next highest positive whole number above the characteristic's (absolute value) to the negative log. This operation will yield the positive mantissa.
$$3-2.5017=0.4983$$

Use the additive inverse (negative form in this instance) of the whole number that was added as the characteristic of the corrected logarithm, and indicate its sign with a bar over the number.
$$\overline{3} .4983$$

Rewrite $\overline{3} .4983$ as 0.4983-3. This puts the logarithm in the form of an exponential expression. Take the antilog of both numbers.

Antilog 0.4983 X antilog (-3)
NOTE: The two antilog expressions are multiplied together since they represent numbers, not logs (refer to the Rules of Exponentiation in paragraph 1-20).

The antilog of $0.4983=3.15$
The antilog of $-3=10-3$
Therefore, the antilog of $-2.5017=3.15 \times 10-3$

\section*{1-39. USE OF LOGARITHMS IN MULTIPLICATION}

To multiply two or more numbers together, the logarithm of each number is found and the logarithms of each are added together. The antilogarithm of the sum of the logarithms is then taken to give the product of the multiplication.

Example. Multiply 152 by 63 using logarithms.
Solution.
$\log 152=2.1818$
$\log 63=\frac{+1.7993}{3.9811}$
Sum
antilog $3.9811=9.57 \times 103$
Thus, $152 \times 63=9.6 \times 103$, with 2 significant figures

NOTE: If you were to multiply these two numbers together by the usual method you would have obtained 9576 instead of 9570 as was determined by the use of logarithms due to the accuracy of the logarithm tables. Logarithms are approximate values.

\section*{1-40. USE OF LOGARITHMS IN DIVISION}

To divide two numbers, the logarithms of the numbers are subtracted; i.e., the logarithm of the divisor (denominator) is subtracted from the logarithm of the dividend (numerator). The antilogarithm of the difference of logarithms is then taken to give the quotient.

Example. Divide 152 by 63 using logarithms.
Solution.
$\log 152=2.1818$
$\log 63=\underline{-1.7993}$
Difference 0.3825
antilogarithm of $0.3825=2.41$
Thus, 152 divided by $63=2.4$, with 2 significant figures

\section*{1-41. USE OF LOGARITHMS TO FIND ROOTS OF NUMBERS}

To find the root of a number, the logarithm of the number is determined; the logarithm of the number is next divided by the root desired; e.g., if the square root of a number is wanted, the logarithm of the number is divided by two; if the cube root is required, divide by three, etc. The antilogarithm of the quotient is taken; the resulting number is the root of the number.
a. Example 1. Find the square root of 625.

Solution.
Square root $625=(625) 1 / 2$
$\log (625) 1 / 2=1 / 2 \log 625=1 / 2 \times 2.7959=1.3980$
antilogarithm 1.3980 = 25.0
Thus, the square root of $625=25.0$
b. Example 2. Find the fourth root of 625.

Solution.
Fourth root $625=(625) 1 / 4$
$\log (625) 1 / 4=1 / 4 \log 625=1 / 4 \times 2.7959=0.6990$
antilog $0.6990=5.00$
Thus, the fourth root of $625=5.00$

\section*{1-42. USE OF LOGARITHMS TO FIND THE PRODUCT OF NUMBERS WITH EXPONENTS}

To find the product of a number that has an exponent, determine the logarithm of the number and multiply by the exponent. The antilogarithm of the product is taken. For example, if a number has been squared, find the logarithm of the number and multiply by two, then find the antilog.
a. Example 1. Find the product of (625)2 using logarithms.

Solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \log 6252=2 \log 625=2 \times 2.7959=5.5918 \\
& \text { antilog } 5.5918=391,000=3.91 \times 105
\end{aligned}$$

NOTE: If 625 is squared with a calculator, the resulting number is 390,625 .
b. Example 2. Find the product of 62510 using logarithms.

Solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \log 62510=10 \log 625=10 \times 2.7959=27.959 \\
& \text { antilog } 27.959=9.10 \times 1027
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{LESSON 2}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO SOLUTION MATHEMATICS}

\section*{Section I. GRADES OF LABORATORY CHEMICALS}

\section*{2-1. DISCUSSION}

Chemicals available from various manufacturers are usually assigned one of several common grades. The particular grade assigned to a chemical depends upon the purity. However, the differentiation between the various grades is unofficial. There seems to be no agreement between chemical manufacturing companies concerning the various degrees of purity.

\section*{2-2. STANDARDS}

A standard is a solution that contains a known amount of analytically pure (weighed or titrated) substance in a specific volume of solvent.
a. Primary Standards. Primary standards are highly purified chemicals which assay to be at least 99.95 from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), U.S. Department of Commerce. A primary standard must fulfill the following criterion: (1) it can be accurately weighed or measured, (2) it must be stable, (3) it must be extremely pure, and (4) it must be nonhygroscopic (not absorb water readily).
b. Secondary Standards. If a standard is prepared from a substance whose concentration cannot be determined accurately either by weighing or measuring, it is called a secondary standard. The normality (concentration) of the secondary standard must be determined by titration (or other means) using a primary standard. $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and NaOH are laboratory reagents that fall into the category of secondary standards. If an exact concentration is desired, these reagents must be standardized prior to use.

\section*{2-3. REAGENT GRADE OR ANALYTICAL REAGENT GRADE}

The chemicals, reagent grade or analytical reagent grade (ACS), that are assigned this grade are manufactured to meet specifications needed in both quantitative and qualitative analysis and are generally the purest form of laboratory chemicals available. This grade of chemical appears in two different forms: (1) lot analyzed, in which each lot is individually analyzed and the amount of impurities noted on the bottle, and (2) maximum impurities, which lists the maximum allowed impurities on the bottle. This grade of chemical also contains certain types of chemicals and solvents which are designed for specific laboratory determinations. These specialized reagents are:
a. High Performance Liquid Chromatography Solvents. This grade of solvent is designed to be used in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
b. Nanogram Solvents. These solvents are highly purified for electron capture gas liquid chromatography (GLC) techniques such as pesticide residue analysis and steroid determinations.
c. Liquid Scintillation Chemicals. These are specifically formulated to meet the needs of scintillometric radioisotope counting techniques.
d. Spectrophotometric Solvents. These solvents contain low levels of contaminants and give reproducible absorption curves throughout the entire spectrum.

\section*{2-4. ORGANIC GRADE}

Organic laboratory chemicals are of suitable purity for most research work and for general laboratory purposes such as standard and reagent prepa- ration. Specifications are usually determined by melting or boiling point.

\section*{2-5. CHEMICALLY PURE GRADE}

Chemicals that are chemically pure grade (CP) cannot be used as standards in either the clinical laboratory or in research without first being analyzed. There are no set specifications for this grade of chemical and the quality varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. This grade of chemical is usually satisfactory for most reagents used in the chemical laboratory.

\section*{2-6. UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA AND NATIONAL FORMULARY GRADES}

The United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) or the National Formulary (N.F.) sets forth the specifications for the chemicals that are assigned the above listed grades. The specifications for this grade of chemical state that the impurities present may not be of such concentration as to be harmful to one's health. This grade of chemical is usually unsatisfactory for use in preparing standards or reagents. It should only be used in emergency situations.

\section*{2-7. PURIFIED, PRACTICAL, OR PURE GRADES}

There are no definite specifications for these grades of chemicals; they should not be used in the preparation of standards or reagents.

\section*{2-8. TECHNICAL OR COMMERCIAL GRADES}

The purity of this grade of chemical is dependent upon the ease with which a certain impurity is removed. This grade of chemical is only suited for industrial use.

\section*{Section II. GRADES OF LABORATORY WATER}

\section*{2-9. DISCUSSION}

Tap water contains various impurities, both organic and inorganic. These impurities may interfere with many of the chemical tests that are routinely performed and consequently contributed to invalid test results. For example, calcium is a commonly performed laboratory test, and some tap water contains considerable amounts of calcium. To eliminate the possibility of interfering substances in water, either deionized or distilled water must be used in the preparation of all standards and reagents. Water for use in the laboratory is broken down into three basic types: Type I, Type II, and Type III.

\section*{2-10. TYPE I WATER}

This is the purest type of water and is used for laboratory tests where the greatest accuracy is desired. This type of water is designed for use with atomic absorption, flame photometry, pH determinations, and fluorometry.

\section*{2-11. TYPE II WATER}

This type of water is for general laboratory use and can be used for any type of laboratory determination that does not specify Type I water. Of the type of procedures listed under Type I water, only atomic absorption and fluorometry require the use of Type I water.

\section*{2-12. TYPE III WATER}

Type III water is used for rinsing glassware and is suitable for most qualitative determinations.

\section*{2-13. MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE THREE TYPES OF WATER}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Specifications & $\underline{1}$ & II & III \\
\hline Specific conductance microhms, maximum & 0.1 & 2.0 & 5.0 \\
\hline Specific resistance megohms, minimum & 10.0 & 0.5 & 0.2 \\
\hline Silicate, mg/dL, maximum & 0.01 & 0.01 & 0.01 \\
\hline Heavy metals, mg/dL, maximum, & 0.01 & 0.01 & 0.01 \\
\hline Permanganate reduction & pass test & pass test & pass test \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{2-14. REQUIREMENTS FOR STANDARDS AND REAGENTS}

The following are recommended requirements for all water used in the laboratory for the preparation of standards and reagents.

\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Requirement & & Level \\
Ammonia & & Less than $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
Dissolved carbon dioxide & & Less than $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
PH & & 6.0 to 7.0 \\
Sodium & & Less than $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$
\end{tabular}

\section*{2-15. CARBON-DIOXIDE-FREE WATER}
a. Carbon-dioxide-free water can be prepared by boiling Type II water for 20 minutes in an acid washed chemically resistant glass flask (such as Pyrex or Kimax brand borosilicate glass).
b. Remove the heat source and immediately close securely with a stopper fitted with a soda lime drying tube or a NaOH air trap and allow to cool.
c. Prevent atmospheric exposure and contamination.
d. Carbon-dioxide-free water should be used for prothrombin times, certain reference buffers, and National Bureau of Standards (NBS) standards. It is also recommended that lyophilized material be reconstituted with carbon-dioxide-free water.

\section*{2-16. FREQUENCY OF WATER TESTING}

The specifications described by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) on water quality should be applied in performing a water quality check. These specifications should be checked weekly on both flowing and stored water. The check site of the test should be identified and the results compared to established limits and logged on an appropriate chart. If results exceed established limits, corrective measures must be taken according to CAP guidelines and a record of action taken placed in the log.

\section*{Section III. PARTS OF A SOLUTION}

\section*{2-17. INTRODUCTION}

In order to discuss a solution, one first needs a definition of the term. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of gases, solids, or liquids in which the individual molecules
of two or more substances are evenly dispersed throughout the medium (solution). For example, if one dissolves sucrose in water, the sugar granules will break down into individual molecules. This is to say, if one were to sample any two sections of the solution, the same number of sugar molecules would be found per unit volume. Solutions are not always liquids; that is, if liquid mercury is rubbed on solid gold, the solid gold will dissolve the liquid mercury resulting in a solid solution.

\section*{2-18. SOLVENT}

A solution consists of two parts. The first part is the solvent, which is defined as that portion of the solution that is either in greatest concentration or the portion of the solution that is doing the dissolving. Water is usually considered to be the universal solvent, no matter what proportion of the solution it is.

\section*{2-19. SOLUTE}

The solute is the second part of a solution. One can define the solute as the substance that is being dissolved or the substance that is in lower concentration.

\section*{2-20. EXAMPLES}

If one were to take 5 grams of sodium hydroxide and dissolve it in 100 milliliters of deionized water, what would be the solvent and what would be the solute? If you selected sodium hydroxide as the solute and water as the solvent, you were correct. The reason the sodium hydroxide is the solute is because it is present in the lower concentration and it is also the substance being dissolved. Water is the solvent because it is (1) the universal solvent; (2) present in the greatest concentration; and (3) the substance that is doing the dissolving.

\section*{Section IV. TYPES OF SOLUTIONS}

\section*{2-21. INTRODUCTION}

As stated, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of gases, liquids, or solids in which the molecules of two or more substances are evenly dispersed throughout the medium. This can be more specifically defined as a true solution because the substances are mixed on a molecular basis. There are two other types of solutions with which one should be familiar--the colloidal solution and the emulsion.

\section*{2-22. COLLOIDAL SOLUTION}

A colloidal solution is not a true solution since the individual molecules are not mixed on a molecular basis; hence, the solution is not homogeneous throughout. This type of solution contains aggregates of molecules with each individual aggregate being denoted as a colloid or as a colloidal particle. The number of molecules in each aggregate may be from several hundred to a few thousand. The size of each colloidal
particle is usually in the range of from 1 to 200 nanometers $(\mathrm{nm})$ in diameter. This range has been arbitrarily set since particles with a diameter of less than 1 nm do not scatter light and particles greater than 200 nm can be seen with the light microscope. As was mentioned above, there is no homogeneity of particles in this type of solution. The particles are actually suspended in the solvent. A colloidal solution is broken down into two parts: (1) the dispersed phase (analogous to the solute of a true solution) and (2) the dispersion medium (analogous to the solvent of a true solution). The most important colloidal systems are those involving a solid dispersed in a liquid and are commonly denoted as colloidal suspensions. In some determinations of amylase, the starch substrate is a colloidal suspension.

\section*{2-23. EMULSIONS}

Emulsions are colloidal solutions in which the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium are immiscible. If one mixes water and oil together and then shakes the container, the oil will break into very small particles that will disperse within the water. Upon standing, the oil droplets (dispersed phase) will tend to coalesce, forming larger and larger droplets. These droplets eventually become too large to remain within the dispersion medium (water) and the two liquids will separate. If one wishes to stabilize an emulsion, an emulsifying agent such as a bile salt must be added.

\section*{2-24. SATURATED SOLUTIONS}

The laboratory specialist may on occasion be required to prepare a saturated solution. This type of solution is defined as a solution in which the dissolved solute is in equilibrium with undissolved solute. At a given temperature, most solutions can dissolve (hold) only a given number of solute particles. Once this solution contains all the solute particles that it can "hold," any additional solute will settle to the bottom of the container. Once this point has been reached, the solution is said to be saturated. As stated, there is an equilibrium between dissolved and undissolved solute. More clearly, this is to say that dissolved solute is continuously leaving the solution and entering into the crystal lattice of the undissolved solute. At the same time, undissolved solute is leaving the crystalline state and entering into solution.

\section*{2-25. UNSATURATED SOLUTIONS}

An unsaturated solution is one that does not contain all the solute molecules that the solution could possibly "hold."

\section*{Section V. PERCENT CONCENTRATION}

\section*{2-26. DISCUSSION}

The simplest solution to prepare in the laboratory is the percent solution. The main reason that this type of solution is commonly used is the ease in calculating the amount of solute needed in its preparation. The term percent is a shortened form of
percentage, which means parts per 100 total parts. This method is used with all three of the basic comparisons of percent concentration statements, that is, weight/weight, weight/volume, and volume/volume. The percent weight/weight is not commonly used in the clinical laboratory.

\section*{2-27. WEIGHT/VOLUME PERCENT SOLUTIONS}
a. The weight per unit volume system of percent concentration is the most frequently used method in the clinical laboratory. This method is used when a solid solute is mixed with a liquid solvent. Since percent is parts per 100 parts of total solution, then a weight/volume percent solutions (w/v) unit would be grams of solute per 100 milliliters of total solution $(\mathrm{g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL})$. In the clinical laboratory and related situations, any time a w/v solution is described by a number followed by a percent symbol (grams per $100 \mathrm{~mL}(\mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~mL})$. Since 100 milliliters is equal to one deciliter, then a percent $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}$ concentration can be expressed as grams per deciliter ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).
b. Another expression of $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}$ percent concentration used in the laboratory involves the use of fractional parts of the gram while retaining the unit of volume of solution. Examples of this kind would be milligram per deciliter or milligram percent. These may be expressed as $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}, \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}$, or mg
c. The following problems may be solved using dimensional analysis (see Appendix A); however, simple ratio and proportion will suffice in some instances. Both methods of problem solving will yield comparable results.
d. Example. If a $5.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ solution of NaCl is to be prepared with a volume of 50 mL , how much NaCl would be required?

Solution. Based on definition the same problem could be solved using appropriate factors.

By dimensional analysis, we would solve as follows:
After reading the problem carefully it should be quite evident that the desired quantity is the amount of solute expressed in grams.

Express the volume in dL
$50.0 \mathrm{mLX}=\frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.500 \mathrm{dL}$
Multiply the volume expressed in deciliters times the percent concentration to determine the amount of solute contained in the specified amount of total solution.
$0.500 \mathrm{dLX}=\frac{5.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}}=\underline{2.5 \mathrm{~g}}$
e. Examining the solution reveals that the given volume in milliters is first converted to deciliters, using the appropriate conversion factor. The volume of solution expressed in deciliters is then multiplied by the weight per volume concentration to yield the desired quantity, mass of solute expressed in grams per given volume. Notice that if the correct factor is used the unwanted units cancel out.

\section*{2-28. SOLVING WEIGHT/VOLUME PROBLEMS}

The first step in solving any solution problem is to carefully read the problem. Remember that a unit of concentration consists of two components-- a weight (or volume) and a volume, thus $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}$ or $\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}$. Also notice that in reading the problem, the wording will suggest that a solution is to be prepared. Words such as "prepare" or "make" will be used in this type of problem. When making a percent solution, three things are necessary, that is, mass of solute needed, concentration of the solution to be prepared, and total volume of solution. Consider and see that all three of these requirements are met. Mass of solute is usually expressed in grams or milligrams. Concentration of the solution in $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}, \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, or ( $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Total volume of solution is expressed in deciliters. Use the information given in the problem or calculated from information given in the problem as appropriate factors.
a. Example 1. How much NaCl is needed to make 2.0 liters of a $3.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{NaCl}$ solution?

Solution. The first step of any problem is to read the problem carefully. Determine what the problem is asking for.

Grams of solute (NaCl).
Express the volume in deciliters.
$$2.0 \mathrm{LX} \frac{10 \mathrm{dL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=20 \mathrm{dL}$$

Multiply the volume expressed in deciliters times the percent concentration to determine the grams of NaCl contained in 2.0 liters of a $3.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ solution.
$$20 \mathrm{dL} X \frac{3.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}}=60 \mathrm{~g}$$
b. Example 2. How many milliliters of solution can be prepared from 62.5 mg of $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ if the desired concentration is $12.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine what the problem is asking for.

Total volume of solution expressed in milliliters.
Ratio and proportion is well suited for solving this type of problem. Set the problem up with respect to the considerations discussed in Appendix A concerning ratio and proportion.
$$\frac{12.5 \mathrm{mg}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=\frac{62.5 \mathrm{mg}}{x \mathrm{dL}}$$

Solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& (12.5 \mathrm{mg})(x \mathrm{dL})=(62.5 \mathrm{mg})(1 \mathrm{dL}) \\
& \frac{(62.5 \mathrm{mg})(1 \mathrm{dL})}{12.5 \mathrm{mg}}=x \mathrm{dL}=5.00 \mathrm{dL}
\end{aligned}$$

To completely satisfy the problem, convert deciliters to milliliters.
$$5.00 \mathrm{dL} \times \frac{100 \mathrm{~mL}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{500 \mathrm{~mL}}$$
c. Example 3. What is the prepared by adding $50.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ to a 250.0 mL flask and adjusting the volume to the mark?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine what the problem is asking for.

Percent (Solving this type of problem involves expressing the mass of solute per unit volume.

Since the unit volume is deciliters the first step in problem solving would be to convert the given volume in milliliters to deciliters.
$$250.0 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=2.50 \mathrm{dL}$$

The most direct approach to conclude solving the problem would be to simply express the given information as weight per volume and to evaluate the numerical data as follows.
$$\frac{50.0 \mathrm{~g}}{2.50 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{20.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}} \text { or equivalently, } \underline{20.0}$$

Ratio and proportion could also be used to determine the concentration of the solution obtaining the same results.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{50.0 \mathrm{~g}}{2.50 \mathrm{dL}}=\frac{x \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{dL}} \\
& (50.0 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{dL})=(2.50 \mathrm{dL})(x \mathrm{~g}) \\
& x \mathrm{~g}=\frac{(50.0 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{dL})}{2.50 \mathrm{dL}}=20.0 \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting for x in the original expression yields the desired results.
$$\frac{x \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=\frac{20.0 \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{20.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}}$$

\section*{2-29. HYDRATES}

Some salts come in several forms, such as the anhydrous form (no water) and in the form of one or more hydrates. In a hydrate, a number of water molecules are attached to each molecule of salt. The water that is attached to the salt contributes to the molecular weight. Thus, if we were to weigh out equal amounts of a desired chemical and one of its hydrates, the hydrate would not yield as much of the desired chemical, per unit weight, as the anhydrous form, since some of the weight is attributable to the water molecules. In some cases, the prescribed form of a salt may not be available for the preparation of a solution. One must be able to determine how much of the available form is equivalent to the quantity of the form prescribed. To do this, we must first determine the amount of the prescribed form that is needed. Then, using the molecular weights of both substances involved, use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of available form needed.
a. Example 1. A procedure requires that 100 mL of a 10.0 solution be prepared. Only $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} . \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is available. How much of the hydrate is needed to prepare this solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
Calculate the amount of the anhydrous form needed.
$100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{10.0 \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=10.0 \mathrm{~g}$
Calculate the gram molecular weight of each substance. (NOTE: You will learn more about gram molecular weights and moles in Lesson 3.)
(1) List each element in a column.
(2) Write the atomic weight of each element. (See Appendix C.)
(3) Multiply the weight of each element by the number of that element in the chemical formula. For example, if there are 2 atoms of hydrogen present in the formula, multiply the weight of hydrogen by two.
(4) Sum the weights to obtain the total weight, and express the total weight in grams/mole.
$\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ (anhydrous)
Cu 63.5 X $1=63.5$
S $32.1 \times 1=32.1$
O $6.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{159.6} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mole}$
$\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (hydrate)
Cu 63.5 X $1=63.5$
S $32.1 \times 1=32.1$
O $6.0 \times 4=64.0$
H $1.0 \times 2=2.0$
O $6.0 \times 1=\frac{+16.0}{177.6} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
If the amount of anhydrous salt needed is now multiplied by the ratio of the molecular weights of the hydrate to anhydrate the desired results will be obtained.
$10.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \times \frac{177.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}{159.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}}=11.1 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CuSO4.H2O}$

Ratio and proportion could also be used to solve this type of problem.

$\frac{159.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }}{177.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate }}=\frac{10.0 \mathrm{~g} \text { anhydrous }}{\mathrm{x} \mathrm{g} \text { hydrate }}$
$\frac{(177.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate })(10.0 \mathrm{~g} \text { anhydrous })}{159.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }}=\underline{11.1 \mathrm{~g}}$

NOTE: Notice in this example that you needed a larger weight of the hydrated form to prepare a solution of equal strength. This is because a hydrated molecule weighs more than its anhydrous counterpart. The key is that the solution using a hydrate instead of the prescribed form will still react in the same manner in solution if it is prepared properly. Therefore, care must be taken when performing the calculation to ensure the proper amount of hydrate is used.
b. Example 2. How much $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3} \cdot 4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is needed to prepare 500.0 mL of a $200.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3} \cdot 4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
Calculate the amount of the anhydrous form needed.
$500.0 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{200.0 \mathrm{mg}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=1000 \mathrm{mg}$
Calculate the gram molecular weight of each substance. (See Appendix C.)
$\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}$
Fe $55.8 \times 2=111.6$
S $32.1 \times 3=96.3$
O $16.0 \times 12=\frac{+192.0}{399.9} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
$\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3} \cdot 4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
Fe $55.8 \times 2=111.6$
S $32.1 \times 3=96.3$
O $16.0 \times 12=192.0$
H $1.0 \times 8=8.0$
O $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{471.9} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of hydrate needed.
$\frac{399.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }}{471.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate }}=\frac{1000 \mathrm{mg} \text { anhydrous }}{x \mathrm{mg} \text { hydrate }}$
$x \mathrm{mg}$ hydrate $=\frac{(1000 \mathrm{mg} \text { anhydrous })(471.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate })}{399.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }}$
× mg hydrate $=1180 \mathrm{mg}$
c. Example 3. How many grams of $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ are needed to make 1.00 liter of a $20.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and select the unknown quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
Calculate the amount of the anhydrous form needed.
Calculate the amount of the anhydrous form needed
$1.00 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{10 \mathrm{dL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{20.0 \mathrm{mg}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=200 \mathrm{mg}$
Calculate the gram molecular weight of each substance. (See Appendix C.)
$\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$
Ca $40.1 \times 1=40.1$
Cl $35.5 \times 2=\frac{+71.0}{111.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}$
$\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
Ca $40.1 \times 1=40.1$
Cl $35.5 \times 2=71.0$
H $1.0 \times 4=4.0$
O $16.0 \times 2=\frac{+32.0}{147.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}$

Use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of hydrate needed.
$\frac{111.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }}{147.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate }}=\frac{0.200 \mathrm{~g} \text { anhydrous }}{\mathrm{x} \mathrm{g} \text { hydrate }}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& x \mathrm{~g} \text { hydrate }=\frac{(147.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { hydrate })(0.200 \mathrm{~g} \text { anhydrous })}{111.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \text { anhydrous }} \\
& x \mathrm{~g} \text { hydrate }=\underline{0.265 \mathrm{~g}}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{2-30. VOLUME/VOLUME PERCENT SOLUTION PROBLEMS}

When a solution has a liquid solute in a liquid solvent, percent concentration is expressed as volume per unit volume (v/v). When a number expressing a liquid solute in a liquid solvent is followed by a percent symbol (\%) then the concentration is a $\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}$ concentration.
a. Problem Solving. Methods developed earlier for solving weight per volume solutions may be applied to volume per volume solutions.
b. Example 1. How much alcohol is required to make 100 mL of a $20.0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ alcohol solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.
Milliters of alcohol.
Express the volume in deciliters.
$$100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=1.00 \mathrm{dL}$$

Multiply the volume expressed in deciliters times the percent concentration to determine the volume of solute needed to prepare the solution.
$$1.00 \mathrm{dL} \times \frac{20.0 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{dL}}=\underline{20.0 \mathrm{~mL}}$$
c. Example 2. What is the concentration of a solution that was prepared by adding 75 mL of alcohol to 175 mL of water?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.
Percent concentration.
Solving this type of problem involves expressing the volume of solute per unit volume.

Determine the total volume of solution.
175 mL water
$\underline{\mathbf{7 5 ~ m L}}$ alcohol
250 mL total volume

Since the unit volume is deciliters, convert the given volume in milliliters to deciliters.
$250.0 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}}=2.50 \mathrm{dL}$

To conclude solving the problem express the volume of solute per unit volume and evaluate the numerical data as follows.
$\frac{75 \mathrm{~mL}}{2.50 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}}$ or equivalently, $\underline{30}$

\section*{2-31. WEIGHT/WEIGHT PERCENT SOLUTIONS}

This type, weight/weight percent solutions (w/w), of percent solution is usually expressed as (w/w), where "w" denotes weight (usually grams) in both cases. An example of a correct designation for this type of solution is as follows: $10 \mathrm{~g} / 100 \mathrm{~g}(\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w})$, which indicates to the technician that there are 10 grams of solute for every 100 grams total solution. The ( $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}$ ) denotes that the solution is a "weight in weight" percent solution. This type of solution is rarely if ever prepared in the clinical laboratory since it is easier to measure volumes of liquids rather than weigh the liquid on an analytical balance. One must be familiar with $\mathrm{w} / \mathrm{w}$ solutions because the common laboratory acids and bases are manufactured on a weight-in-weight basis. For more discussion on this, please refer to Lesson 8, Concentrated Acids and Bases.

\section*{2-32. PERCENT COMPOSITION PROBLEMS}

At times it may be necessary to prepare a percent solution that requires only part of the entire molecule to be considered in the preparation of the solution. For example, you may wish to prepare a $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$solution from NaCl . Since the entire molecule is used in the preparation of the solution, ratio and proportion will have to be used, based on the molecular weight of the entire molecule versus the molecular weight of the portion of the molecule being considered.
a. Example 1. How much NaCl is required to prepare 500 mL of a $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ sodium solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of NaCl.

Calculate the amount of sodium needed.
$500 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{2.5 \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=12.5 \mathrm{~g}$

Calculate the gram molecular weight of each substance. (See Appendix C.)
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Na & 23.0 \\
Cl & +35.5 \\
\cline { 2 - 2 } $58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$ & $\mathrm{Na} 23.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
\end{tabular}
Use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of available form needed.
$\frac{23.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}}{58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{NaCl}}=\frac{12.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}}{x \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{NaCl}}$
$x \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{NaCl}=\frac{(12.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na})(58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{NaCl})}{23.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}}$
$x \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{NaCl}=\underline{31.8 \mathrm{~g}}$
b. Example 2. How many milligrams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ are needed to prepare 100 mL of a $10.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ sodium standard?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.
Milligrams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$.
Calculate the amount of the sodium needed.
$100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{10.0 \mathrm{mg}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=10.0 \mathrm{mg}$
Calculate the gram molecular weight of each substance.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Na & $23.0 \times 2=46.0$ \\
C & $12.0 \times 1=12.0$ \\
O & $16.0 \times 3=\frac{+48.0}{106.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
\end{tabular}$\quad \mathrm{Na} 23.0 \times 2=\frac{46.0}{46.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of available form needed.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{46.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}}{106.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}}=\frac{10.0 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Na}}{x \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}} \\
& x \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=\frac{(106.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{NaCl})(10.0 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Na})}{46.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}} \\
& x \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=\underline{23.0 \mathrm{mg}}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{2-33. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF PERCENT SOLUTIONS}

The main advantage of percent solutions is the ease in calculations. There are, however, two distinct disadvantages associated with percent solutions: (1) the technician does not know the number of molecules or ions that are present in the solution, and (2) the technician has no idea of the reacting strength of the solution.

\section*{LESSON 3}

\section*{MOLAR SOLUTIONS}

\section*{Section I. MOLE CONCEPT}

\section*{3-1. DISCUSSION}

In a chemical reaction, atoms and molecules are either combined or separated during the reaction. In other words, chemical reactions take place at the level of the atoms and molecules of the reactants.
a. A method that would allow the medical laboratory specialist to know the relative number of reactant particles involved in a chemical reaction would be useful. The concept of the mole and molarity provides such a method.
b. One mole of any substance will contain approximately $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles (Avogadro's number). A mole of a particular substance indicates the number of grams proportional to the atomic or molecular weight of the substance. This weight is often referred to as its gram molecular weight.
c. The importance of the mole concept stems from the fact that a mole of any given element or compound will yield Avogadro's number of particles. If the masses of samples of two elements or compounds have the same ratio as the ratio of their atomic weights, the samples contain identical numbers of atoms or molecules.

\section*{3-2. CALCULATING GRAM MOLECULAR WEIGHT}

The gram molecular weight (GMW) is the mass in grams of one mole of substance. The first step in solving for GMW is to list each element of the compound as represented by the chemical formula separately. Next, we must take into account the atomic weight of each individual atom along with the total number of each individual atom or element present. (See Appendix C for atomic weights and symbols of elements.) Finally, add all the weights of the atoms making up the formula and express the answer in grams/mole.
a. Example 1. What is the GMW of NaCl?

Solution.
NaCl
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Na & 23.0 \\
Cl & +35.5 \\
\cline { 2 - 2 } & $58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
\end{tabular}
b. Example 2. What is the GMW of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ ?

Solution. Notice in this problem that the subscripts apply to the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. In this problem, we must multiply these elements by their corresponding subscript to obtain the correct GMW for this molecule.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \\
& \mathrm{H} \quad 1.0 \times 2=2.0 \\
& \mathrm{~S} \quad 32.1 \times 1=32.1 \\
& \mathrm{O} \quad 16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{98.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}
\end{aligned}$$
c. Example 3. What is the GMW of $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} .3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ?

Solution. In this problem, the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}$ radical is enclosed by parentheses and a subscript of two is assigned. In this situation, all elements contained within the parentheses are multiplied by two. Also, the hydrogen atom of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}$ radical has a subscript of four. Therefore, the total number of hydrogens present are eight. The attached water of hydration has a coefficient of three. This must be considered, and each individual atom within the water molecule must be multiplied by a coefficient of three in addition to any subscripts.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} .3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\
\\
\mathrm{~N} & 14.0 \times 2= \\
\mathrm{H} & 1.0 \times 8= \\
\mathrm{C} & 12.0 \times 1= \\
\mathrm{O} & 16.0 \times 3= \\
\mathrm{H} & 1.0 \times 6= \\
\mathrm{O} & 16.0 \times 3= \\
&
\end{array}$$

\section*{3-3. MOLES AND GRAM MOLECULAR WEIGHT}

Remember from the discussion on moles that a mole of any substance is the number of grams proportional to the atomic or molecular weight of the substance. If this is true, then one mole of NaCl weighs 58.5 grams. One mole of any substance has a mass equal to one gram molecular weight of that substance.
a. Example 1. How many moles are contained in 117.0 grams of NaCl ?

Solution. Determine the mass of one gram molecular weight of the substance.
$\begin{array}{cc}\mathrm{Na} & 23.0 \\ \mathrm{Cl} & +35.5 \\ & 58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\end{array}$
Now use ratio and proportion to determine the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{58.5 \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{~mol}}=\frac{117.0 \mathrm{~g}}{x \mathrm{~mol}} \\
& (58.5 \mathrm{~g})(x \mathrm{~mol})=(117.0 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{~mol}) \\
& x \mathrm{~mol}=\frac{(117.0 \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{~mol})}{58.5 \mathrm{~g}}
\end{aligned}$$
$x$ mol $=\underline{2.00 \mathrm{~mol}}$ There are 2.00 moles contained in 117.0 g of NaCl.
Equivalently:
$$\text { moles }=\frac{\text { the number of grams given }}{\mathrm{GMW}}$$
b. Example 2. How many moles are contained in 71.0 grams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ ?

Solution. Calculate the GMW of the compound.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Na & $23.0 \times 2=46.0$ \\
S & $32.1 \times 1=32.1$ \\
O & $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{142.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Use ratio and proportion to determine the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}

$x \mathrm{~mol}=0.500 \mathrm{~mol}$. There are 0.500 moles contained in 71.0 grams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$

NOTE: Keep in mind that moles are not an expression of concentration. The unit mole is an expression of mass indicating the number of gram molecular weights. Take caution not to confuse mole with molarity (mol/L). When reporting moles, write the word moles, DO NOT abbreviate by using an M!!

\section*{Section II. MOLARITY AND MOLAR SOLUTIONS}

\section*{3-4. DEFINITION}

Molarity (mol/L) is defined as the number of moles of a substance per liter of solution.

\section*{3-5. SOLVING MOLARITY PROBLEMS}
a. Example 1. How much $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ is needed to make 300 mL of a $2.00 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution?

Solution. Notice in this problem that the wording suggests that a solution is to be prepared. If you examine the problem, you should find that the type of solution to be prepared is a molar solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.

Regardless of the type, most molarity problems require the gram molecular weight, so calculating the gram molecular weight is a good starting point.

Express the desired volume in liters.
$300 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.300 \mathrm{~L}$
Multiply the volume expressed in liters times the molar concentration times the gram molecular weight to determine the amount of salt, in grams, needed to prepare the solution.
$$0.300 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{2.00 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{142.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=\underline{85.3 \mathrm{~g}}$$
b. Example 2. What volume of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ solution can be prepared from 25.0 g of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ if a $0.50 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ is desired?

Use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of solution that can be prepared.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{0.50 \mathrm{~mol}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=\frac{0.250 \mathrm{~mol}}{x \mathrm{~L}} \\
& (0.50 \mathrm{~mol})(x \mathrm{~L})=(0.250 \mathrm{~mol})(1 \mathrm{~L}) \\
& x \mathrm{~L}=\frac{(0.250 \mathrm{~mol})(1 \mathrm{~L})}{0.50 \mathrm{~mol}}=\underline{0.50 \mathrm{~L}}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Section III. MILLIMOLES PER LITER}

\section*{3-6. INTRODUCTION}

Another expression with which one should be familiar is millimoles per liter $(\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$. It is a variation of the mole/liter concentration unit.

\section*{3-7. DISCUSSION}
a. A millimole $=0.001$ mole and 1 mole $=1000$ millimoles.
b. A millimole has the same numerical value as one gram molecular weight, however, it is expressed in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol}$.
c. To convert $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ to $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and vice versa, multiply the concentration by the conversion factor $1000 \mathrm{mmol} / 1 \mathrm{~mol}$ as appropriate.

Example: $(0.25 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(1000 \mathrm{mmol} / 1 \mathrm{~mol})=250 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
d. To convert $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ to $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$, multiply $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ by $(1 \mathrm{~mol} / 1000 \mathrm{mmol})$.

Example: $(2000 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})(1 \mathrm{~mol} / 1000 \mathrm{mmol})=2.000 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
e. Use the following formula to solve millimole/liter problems:
(1) Formula. $\mathrm{mg}=(\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol})(\mathrm{L})$
(2) Example. How much NaCl is needed to make 250 mL of a $300 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and select the formula that generates the desired quantity.
$$\mathrm{mg}=(\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol})(\mathrm{L})$$

NaCl
$\begin{array}{lc}\mathrm{Na} & 23.0 \\ \mathrm{Cl} & +35.5 \\ & 58.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol}\end{array}$
Substitute the given information.
$$\mathrm{mg}=(300 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})(58.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol})(250 \mathrm{~mL})$$

Make any necessary conversions.
$$\mathrm{mg}=(300 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})(58.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol})(0.250 \mathrm{~L})$$

Evaluate the expression to determine the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{mg}=4390 \mathrm{mg}$$

\section*{3-8. SOLVING MILLIMOLE PER LITER PROBLEMS}

Calculations involving millimole per liter solution are very similar to the calculations involving simple mole per liter solutions.

$250 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.250 \mathrm{~L}$

Multiply the desired volume in liters times the millimolar concentration times the millimolar weight to determine the amount of salt needed to prepare the solution.
$$0.250 \mathrm{LX} \frac{300 \mathrm{mmol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{58.5 \mathrm{mg}}{\mathrm{mmol}}=\underline{4390 \mathrm{mg}}$$

\section*{Section IV. VARIATIONS OF MOLARITY PROBLEMS}

\section*{3-9. PROBLEMS INVOLVING HYDRATES}

Since molarity is based on the number of moles (Avogadro's number) per liter of solution, then one mole per liter of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ will contain the same number particles as one mole per liter of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} 5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. When calculating molarity problems involving hydrates, use the gram molecular weight of the substance being used (weighed) in the preparation of the solution.

Example. How much $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} 5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is required to prepare 250 mL of a $2.00 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.

\end{tabular}

Express the desired volume in liters.
$$250 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.250 \mathrm{~L}$$

Multiply the volume expressed in liters times the molar concentration times the gram molecular weight to determine the amount of hydrate salt, in grams, needed to prepare the solution.
$$0.250 \mathrm{LX} \frac{2.00 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}}=\frac{249.6 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=\underline{125 \mathrm{~g}}$$

\section*{3-10. PROBLEMS INVOLVING ONLY PART OF THE MOLECULE}

When preparing solutions using compounds formed by ionic bonding, realize that these molecules will ionize when in solution. For example, one mole of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ will ionize to two moles of sodium and one mole of sulfate radical. If we were to prepare a one $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ sodium solution using $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, then only 0.5 moles of sodium sulfate would be needed for every liter of solution since two moles of sodium are contained in one mole of sodium sulfate. When solving this type of problem use an appropriate factor to account for the moles of desired substance per mole of compound.

Example. How much $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is needed to prepare 2.00 liters of $1.50 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ sodium solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$.
Calculate the GMW of the compound.
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Na & $23.0 \times 2=46.0$ \\
S & $32.1 \times 1=32.1$ \\
O & $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{142.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}$
\end{tabular}

Multiply the volume expressed in liters times the molar concentration times the gram molecular weight times the ratio of ionized sodium per mole of compound to determine the amount of salt, in grams, needed to prepare the solution.
$$2.00 \mathrm{LX} \frac{1.50 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Na}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{142.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Na}}=\underline{213 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}$$

\section*{EQUIVALENT SOLUTIONS}

\section*{Section I. EQUIVALENT WEIGHT}

\section*{4-1. INTRODUCTION}
a. A gram equivalent weight by definition is the mass of substance that will combine with or displace one mole of hydrogen.
b. In solutions of ionic compounds, the compound dissociates into positive or negative ions to react with other ions. An example is KOH , which separates into one $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ion and one $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ion. One mole of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$will replace one mole of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in a chemical reaction; hence, one equivalent weight of KOH is equal to one mole of KOH . Consider now the combining ability of the $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{-2}$ ion in sulfuric acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$. One mole of the $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{\ddot{A} 2}$ ion will combine with two moles of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Since one gram equivalent weight of a compound or element is the mass that will combine with one mole of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, then one gram equivalent weight of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{44}$ equals 0.5 moles ( $1 / 2$ the gram molecular weight) of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ because two $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions will combine with one $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{-2}$ ion. Total positive ionic valence (TPIV) expresses the number of equivalents per mole of substance.

NOTE: This is true for metathesis reactions only, where ionic valence does not change.

\section*{4-2. DETERMINING THE GRAM EQUIVALENT WEIGHT}

In solving for gram equivalent weight (GEW), the first step is to find the GMW of the compound and then divide by the total positive ionic valence (TPIV). The TPIV is normally determined by finding the valence of the first ion in the chemical compound. (See Appendix C for the valences of common ions.) The valence of that ion is then multiplied by any subscripts pertaining to that ion. If two or more valences are possible for the ion, simply find the valence of the negative ion. Multiply the valence by any subscripts that pertain to that ion giving a total negative ionic valence. Since the sum of the positive valence and negative valence is zero, the TPIV is numerically equal to the total negative valence.
a. Example 1. Find the GEW of KOH .

Solution. Determine the GMW of the compound
KOH
K 39.1
O 16.0
H $\quad \frac{+1.0}{56.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Multiply the GMW, expressed in grams per mole, times 1/TPIV, expressed in moles per equivalent, used as an appropriate factor.
$$\frac{56.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{1 \mathrm{Eq}}=\underline{56.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}}$$
b. Example 2. Find the GEW of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} .2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

Solution. Determine the GMW of the compound.
NOTE: Water, being a relatively neutral substance, is not considered when determining the TPIV of a hydrate. However, its weight must be considered when determining the GMW.
$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} .2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
Ca $40.1 \times 1=40.1$
C $12.0 \times 1=12.0$
O $16.0 \times 3=48.0$
H $1.0 \times 4=4.0$
O $16.0 \times 2=\frac{+32.0}{136.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
Multiply the GMW, expressed in grams per mole, times the 1/TPIV, expressed in moles per equivalent, used as an appropriate factor.
$$\frac{136.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=\underline{68.05 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}}$$
c. Example. Calculate the GEW of $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}$.

Solution. Determine the GMW of the compound.
NOTE: The iron in ferric sulfate is ambivalent. The term ambivalent refers to the iron's ability to have more than one valence. In order to determine the TPIV of this and like compounds it is necessary to examine the charge of the anion (negative ion). The TPIV will be equal to the absolute value (integer value, excluding the sign) of the negative charge of the anion.

$\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}$
$\mathrm{Fe} \quad 55.8 \times 2=\quad 111.6$
$\mathrm{~S} \quad 32.1 \times 3=\quad 96.3$
$\mathrm{O} \quad 16.0 \times 12=\frac{+192.0}{399.9} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Multiply the GMW, expressed in grams per mole, times the $1 / \mathrm{TPIV}$, expressed in moles per equivalent, used as an appropriate factor.
$$\frac{399.9 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{6 \mathrm{Eq}}=66.65 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$$

\section*{4-3. EXCEPTIONS IN CALCULATING GRAM EQUIVALENT WEIGHT}

The only exact method of calculating the GEW is to examine the complete reaction that the molecule will undergo. For example:
$$\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+\mathrm{NaOH}<=======>\mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+\mathrm{HOH}$$

In this reaction, only one of the hydrogen ions on the phosphoric acid molecule reacted with the sodium hydroxide. The TPIV for the acid in this example is one.
$$\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{NaOH}<=======>\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{HOH}$$

In this example, two moles of sodium hydroxide were reacted with one mole of phosphoric acid and the TPIV is two since two of the hydrogen ions from the acid reacted.
$$\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+3 \mathrm{NaOH}<=======>\mathrm{Na}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}+3 \mathrm{HOH}$$

The TPIV in this reaction is three since three hydrogen ions from the acid reacted with the three moles of sodium hydroxide. A general rule to follow is to examine the reaction that is to occur. If the products of the reaction cannot be determined by inspecting the given material, then assume complete ionization unless other information is given. In the case of phosphoric acid, if no guidance is given as to the type of reaction that the molecule will undergo, or if the degree of ionization is not given, then assume the TPIV to be three.

\section*{4-4. EQUIVALENTS}

An equivalent indicates the number of grams equal to the equivalent weight of the substance. One equivalent has the mass of one gram equivalent weight. The mechanism of solving for the number of equivalents is similar to that of solving for the number of moles except GEW is used instead of GMW.

\section*{Section II. NORMAL SOLUTIONS}

\section*{4-5. DEFINITION}

A normal solution is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution. Normality is used to account for different degrees of reactivity of chemicals. One gram equivalent weight of a substance will react exactly with one gram equivalent weight of another substance. A one normal solution contains one GEW of solute in one liter of total solution. Use the following information in solving normality problems.

\section*{4-6. SOLVING NORMALITY PROBLEMS}
a. Method. Based on the definition given above, it follows that:
(1) Normality (Eq/L) = number of equivalents per liter of solution
(2) GEW = grams per equivalent
(3) Liter = total volume of solution
b. Example. How much NaOH is needed to prepare 400 mL of a $10.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$ NaOH solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of NaOH .
Regardless of the type, most normality problems require the gram equivalent weight, so calculating the gram equivalent weight is a good starting point.

NaOH
Na 23.0
O 16.0
H $\quad \frac{+1.0}{40.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
$\frac{40.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{1 \mathrm{Eq}}=40.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$

Express the desired volume in liters.
$$400 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.400 \mathrm{~L}$$

Multiply the normal concentration times the gram equivalent weight times the volume expressed in liters to determine the amount of solute needed to prepare the solution.
$$\frac{10 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{40.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{Eq}} \times 0.400 \mathrm{~L}=160 \mathrm{~g}$$
c. Example. What is the Eq/L concentration of an $\mathrm{AlPO}_{4}$ solution that was prepared by adding 120.0 grams of $\mathrm{AlPO}_{4}$ to a 250 mL flask and adjusting the volume to the mark?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Eq/L concentration.
Determine the GEW of the compound.
$\mathrm{AlPO}_{4}$
Al $27.0 \times 1=27.0$
P $\quad 31.0 \times 1=31.0$
O $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{122.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
$$\frac{122.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{3 \mathrm{Eq}}=40.67 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$$

Express the grams of solute as equivalents using the appropriate conversion factor.
$$120.0 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{\mathrm{Eq}}{40.67 \mathrm{~g}}=2.951 \mathrm{Eq}$$

Express the desired volume in liters.
$$250 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.250 \mathrm{~L}$$

Concentration is an expression of the relative amounts of solute and solvent present, a ratio. Express the equivalents per liter and simplify the expression.
$$\frac{2.951 \mathrm{Eq}}{0.250 \mathrm{~L}}=\underline{11.8 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}}$$
d. Example. What is the maximum volume of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution that can be prepared from 106.0 grams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ if the desired concentration of solution is 0.500 Eq/L?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Volume in liters.
Determine the GEW of the compound.
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$
Na $23.0 \times 2=46.0$
C $12.0 \times 1=12.0$
O $16.0 \times 3=\underline{+48.0}$
$106.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
$\frac{106.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=53.00 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$
Calculate the grams per liter by multiplying the equivalent per liter concentration times the grams per equivalent.
$\frac{0.500 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{L}} \times \frac{53.00 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{Eq}}=26.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$

The calculated value of $26.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ is now used as a factor to determine the volume of solution that can be prepared. However, the reciprocal of the value must be used as a factor. If there are 26.5 grams per liter then for every liter there are 26.5 grams of solute. This relationship is true of all factors we have used.
$$106.0 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{\mathrm{L}}{26.5 \mathrm{~g}}=\underline{4.00 \mathrm{~L}}$$

\section*{Section III. MILLIEQUIVALENT PER LITER (mEq/L) SOLUTIONS}

\section*{4-7. INTRODUCTION}

Milliequivalent per liter problems are based on the same principle as normality. If we examine the definition of normality, we will find that a normal solution contains one gram equivalent weight per liter of solution. Equivalently, we can say that a normal solution is one equivalent per liter of solution (Eq/L). A milliequivalent per liter solution would, therefore, contain one milliequivalent weight per liter of solution.

\section*{4-8. DISCUSSION}
a. A milliequivalent $=0.001$ equivalent and 1 equivalent $=1000$ milliequivalents.
b. A milliequivalent has the numerical value of one equivalent weight expressed in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mEq}$.
c. To convert Eq/L to mEq/L and vice versa multiply the concentration by the conversion factor $1000 \mathrm{mEq} / 1 \mathrm{Eq}$ as appropriate.

$\frac{25.0 \mathrm{mEq}}{\mathrm{L}} \times \frac{58.5 \mathrm{mg}}{\mathrm{mEq}} \times 0.500 \mathrm{~L}=\underline{731 \mathrm{mg}}$
b. Example 2. How much $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$ is needed to make 100 mL of a $50.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Milligrams of $\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$.
Determine the milliequivalent weight of the compound.
$\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}$
$\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{Mg} & 24.3 \times 1=24.3 \\ \mathrm{~S} & 32.1 \times 1=32.1 \\ \mathrm{O} & 16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{120.4} \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mmol}\end{array}$
$\frac{120.4 \mathrm{mg}}{\mathrm{mmo}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mmol}}{2 \mathrm{mEq}}=60.20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mEq}$
Express the desired volume in liters.
$100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.100 \mathrm{~L}$

Calculate the amount of salt needed using the appropriate factors.
$$\frac{50.0 \mathrm{mEq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{60.20 \mathrm{mg}}{\mathrm{mEq}} \times 0.100 \mathrm{~L}=\underline{301 \mathrm{mg}}$$

\section*{Section IV. VARIATIONS OF NORMALITY PROBLEMS}

\section*{4-10. PROBLEMS INVOLVING HYDRATES}

Like molar solutions, normal solutions contain a known number of particles per liter of solution. An one equivalent per liter ( $\mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$ ) solution of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ will have the same concentration as a one equivalent per liter $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \cdot 5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ solution. When solving normal problems involving hydrates, use the gram equivalent weight of the substance being weighed in the preparation of the solution.

Example.
How much $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} .5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is required to prepare 500 mL of a $1.50 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ solution?
Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \cdot 5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
Determine the GEW of the compound that is available (actually being weighed out).
$\mathrm{CuSO}_{4} .5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Cu & $63.5 \times 1=63.5$ \\
S & $32.1 \times 1=32.1$ \\
O & $16.0 \times 4=64.0$ \\
HOH & $18.0 \times 5=\frac{+90.0}{249.6} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
\end{tabular}

NOTE: When determining the TPIV of hydrates, the water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ molecules are not considered. Water has a low degree of reactivity. Also, note that copper is ambivalent, and we must consider the charge of the anion (-) in order to correctly determine the TPIV.
$\frac{249.6 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=124.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$

Now determine the grams of hydrate needed using the appropriate factors.
$$\frac{1.50 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{24.8 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{Eq}} \times 0.500 \mathrm{~L}=\underline{93.6 \mathrm{~g}}$$

\section*{4-11. PROBLEMS THAT CONSIDER ONLY PART OF THE MOLECULE}

When preparing solutions using compounds where only part of the molecule will be involved in the reaction, a factor must be used to account for the reactivity of the ion of interest per mole of compound.

NOTE: TPIV expresses the number of equivalents per mole of substance.
Example. How much $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$ is required to prepare 2.00 liters of a $1.00 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$ sodium standard?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Grams of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$.
Calculate the GEW of the compound using the TPIV of the ion of interest.
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$
Na $23.0 \times 2=46.0$
H $1.0 \times 1=1.0$
P $31.0 \times 1=31.0$
O $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{142.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$
$$\frac{142.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}}{2 \mathrm{Eq} \mathrm{Na}}=71.00 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4} / \mathrm{Eq} \mathrm{Na}$$

Determine the amount of salt (hydrate) needed in the usual manner using the appropriate factors.
$$\frac{1.00 \mathrm{Eq} \mathrm{Na}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{71.00 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}}{\mathrm{Eq} \mathrm{Na}} \times 2.00 \mathrm{~L}=\underline{142 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}}$$

\section*{LESSON 5}

\section*{CONVERSION OF CONCENTRATION UNITS}

\section*{5-1. DISCUSSION}

At times, units of concentration will be given, but another unit of concentration will be required to perform calculations. In this lesson, we will discuss methods for conversion from one unit of concentration to another.

\section*{5-2. CONVERSION FROM mol/L TO g/dL AND FROM g/dL TO mol/L}

Before discussing the methods for converting the above units, let's review the definition for each unit.

\section*{EQUIVALENT WAYS OF EXPRESSING CONCENTRATION (NO NUMERICAL CONVERSION NECESSARY)}
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}=\text { parts of solute per } 100 \text { parts } \\
& \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}=\text { parts of solute per } 1000 \text { parts } \\
& \text { molarity = moles per liter }
\end{aligned}$$

The $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration is defined as parts of solute per 100 parts total solution. The morlarity of a solution is defined as the number of moles per liter of solution (mol/L).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{CONVERSIONS} \\
\hline & CONCENTRATION EXPRESSED IN & BY & IN UNITS & TO GET CONCENTRATION EXPRESSED IN \\
\hline Multiply & mol/L & GMW & g/mol & g/L or parts solute per 1000 parts \\
\hline Multiply & g/dL & 10 & d/L/L & g/L or parts solute per 1000 parts \\
\hline Multiply & g/dL & \begin{tabular}{l}
10 \\
GMW
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
dL mol \\
- - - \\
L g
\end{tabular} & mol/L \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

First, let us consider the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration. Note that $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ times the gram molecular weight $(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol})$ yields $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{X} \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol}=\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L})$. Thus, $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$ can also be referred to as parts solute per 1000 total solution. And the $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration times 10 $\mathrm{dL} / 1 \mathrm{~L}$ yields parts per 1000. Equivalently, the $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration times 10 equals the molar concentration times the gram molecular weight.
a. Example 1. What is the molarity of a $4.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{NaCl}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Molarity (mol/L).
Comparable to problems encountered before that involved molarity, calculating the gram molecular weight is a good place to start.

NaCl
$\begin{array}{cc}\mathrm{Na} & 23.0 \\ \mathrm{Cl} & +35.5 \\ & 58.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\end{array}$
Now that the number of grams per mole has been determined, use it as an appropriate factor along with the conversion factor that will convert deciliters to liters.
$$\frac{4.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{58.5 \mathrm{~g}} \times \frac{10 \mathrm{dL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=\underline{0.68 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$
b. Example 2. You are directed to prepare 500 mL of a $5.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{FeSO} \mathrm{Fe}_{4}$ solution. What is the percent concentration of the solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Percent concentration (\%).
Calculate the GMW of the compound.
$\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}$
Fe $55.8 \times 1=55.8$
S $32.1 \times 1=32.1$
O $16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{151.9} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

The given volume is a distracter. It is not needed to solve this problem.
Use the GMW and an appropriate volume conversion factor to express the concentration in g/dL.
$$\frac{5.0 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{151.9 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{10 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{76 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}}$$

\section*{5-3. CONVERSION FROM Eq/L TO g/dL AND FROM g/dL TO Eq/L}

In solving this type of conversion problem, the method is similar to the one used to solve for $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ to $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$. The $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration is, as previously stated, defined as parts of solute per 100 parts of total solution. The normality of a solution is defined as the number of equivalents per liter of solution (Eq/L).
a. Example 1. What is the $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration of a $1.5 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Percent concentration (g/dL).
Comparable to problems encountered before that involved normality, calculating the gram equivalent weight is a good place to start.

NaOH
$\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{Na} & 23.0 \\ \mathrm{O} & 16.0 \\ \mathrm{H} & \underline{+1.0} \\ & \underline{40.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\end{array}$
$\frac{40.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{1 \mathrm{Eq}}=40.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$
Use the GEW and the appropriate volume conversion factor to express the concentration as $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$.
$$\frac{1.5 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{40.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{Eq}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{10 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{6.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}}$$
b. Example 2. What is the Eq/L concentration of a $5.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Normality (Eq/L).
Determine the GEW of the compound.
$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$
Ca $40.1 \times 1=40.1$
C $12.0 \times 1=12.0$
O $16.0 \times 3=\frac{+48.0}{100.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
$\frac{100.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=50.05 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$
Use the GEW and the appropriate volume conversion factor to express the Eq/L concentration.
$$\frac{5.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{Eq}}{50.05 \mathrm{~g}} \times \frac{10 \mathrm{dL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=\underline{1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}}$$

\section*{5-4. CONVERTING FROM mol/L TO Eq/L AND FROM Eq/L TO mol/L}

The conversion is based on the use of TPIV expressed as Eq/mol and used as an appropriate factor.
a. Example 1. What is the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of a $4 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Molarity (mol/L).
Determine the number of equivalents per mole of compound and use it as an appropriate conversion factor to express the solution in the desired units.
$$\frac{4.0 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=\underline{2.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$
b. Example 2. What is the Eq/L concentration of a $1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{AlPO} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired unit of concentration.

Normality (Eq/L)
Determine the number of equivalents per mole of compound and use the appropriate conversion factor to express the solution in the desired units.
$$\frac{1 \mathrm{mo}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{3 \mathrm{Eq}}{1 \mathrm{~mol}}=\underline{3 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}}$$

LESSON OBJECTIVE

SUGGESTION

Dilutions.
Paragraphs 6-1 through 6-5.
After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
Calculate simple dilutions, serial dilutions, working solutions made from stock solutions, and new standards by mixing known standard concentrations.

After completing the assignment, complete the exercises of this lesson. These exercises will help you to achieve the lesson objective.

\section*{LESSON 6}

\section*{DILUTIONS}

\section*{6-1. DISCUSSION}

A dilution is a laboratory procedure in which the concentration of a sample or solution is reduced by the addition of solvent (diluent). In the laboratory, a dilution is commonly performed when the concentration of an unknown is greater than the limits of linearity of a given quantitative procedure or when a working solution must be prepared from a stock.

\section*{6-2. SIMPLE DILUTIONS}

Dilutions are expressed as a ratio between the volume of the original solution to the volume of final solution. The conventional form is to express the dilution as the ratio of one unit of the original volume to the final volume. Thus, when 2 mL of sample is added to 8 mL of diluent, the result is a 2:10 dilution, but this is preferably expressed as a $1: 5$ dilution. The reciprocal of the dilution is the dilution factor. This is the factor by which quantitative results are multiplied to give the final concentration for the original, undiluted sample. For a serum sample diluted 1:10 for a glucose determination, the test result must be multiplied by the dilution factor, 10 , to determine the actual concentration of the undiluted serum sample. To calculate the concentration of a dilute solution, multiply the concentration of the original solution by the dilution, expressed as a fraction.

NOTE: A one to ten dilution may be expressed as 1:10 or equivalently as 1/10. This, of course, applies to all dilutions.
a. Example 1. A specimen is diluted by combining 3 mL of serum with 21 mL of saline. What is the dilution of the serum?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and calculate the dilution.
NOTE: Volume units must be the same when calculating dilutions.
```
    3 mL (parts serum)
+ 21 mL (parts saline)
    24 mL (total parts)
Dilution = 3 mL \div 24 mL
```


Put the ratio in standard form by dividing each side of the ratio by the sample volume (3).
$$\frac{3 \mathrm{~mL}}{3 \mathrm{~mL}} \div \frac{24 \mathrm{~mL}}{3 \mathrm{~mL}}=\underline{1: 8}$$

The dilution of this specimen is $1: 8$ and if this information were to be used in calculating the concentration of the specimen, the concentration of the diluted sample would be multiplied by 8 in order to determine the concentration of the original, undiluted sample.

NOTE: Dilutions and dilution factors have no unit of report, because the units divide out.
b. Example 2. A $5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ standard solution has been diluted $1: 5$, what is the concentration of the dilute solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully, and determine the unknown quantity. The unknown quantity is the concentration of the dilute solution. In order to solve this type of problem you must express the dilution as a fraction. If you have a fraction of a number, as is the case with this problem, you are in effect multiplying the fraction times the original number.
$$5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \times \frac{1}{5}=\underline{1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$
c. Example 3. A glucose determination was performed on a serum specimen that was diluted $1: 10$. The concentration of the diluted specimen was determined to be $73 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. What is the concentration of the undiluted serum?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity. In this particular instance you need to determine the concentration of a serum specimen, based upon a glucose determination that was performed on a diluted sample.

The dilution factor is the reciprocal of the dilution. This is the factor by which the quantitative results are multiplied to determine the concentration of the undiluted serum sample.
$$(73 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})(10)=730 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$$
d. Example 4. Determine the amount of serum in 40 mL of a $1: 5$ dilution of serum with saline.

Solution. Read the problem carefully and use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of serum in the given volume of solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1 \text { part serum }}{5 \text { total parts }} \div \frac{x \mathrm{~mL} \text { serum }}{40 \mathrm{~mL} \text { total }} \\
& (5 \text { total parts })(x \mathrm{~mL} \text { serum })=(40 \mathrm{~mL} \text { total })(1 \text { part serum }) \\
& \frac{40 \mathrm{~mL} \text { total })(1 \text { part serum })}{5 \text { total parts }}=x \mathrm{~mL} \text { serum } \\
& x \mathrm{~mL} \text { serum }=\underline{8 \mathrm{~mL} \text { serum }}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{6-3. SERIAL DILUTIONS}

Serial dilution techniques are used when it is necessary to test several successive dilutions on the same sample. The procedure involves the preparation of an initial dilution and subsequent redilution of aliquots (portions) to give progressively more dilute solutions. In order to calculate the final or intermediate dilutions, use each dilution of interest as a multiplicative factor, of which the resulting product is the dilution.
a. Example 1. A serum specimen was successively diluted $1: 2,1: 2$, and $1: 2$ with saline. What is the final dilution of the specimen?

Solution. When determining the final dilution of a series of dilutions use each dilution as a multiplicative factor. The resulting product is the final dilution.
$$\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{8} \text { or equivalently, } \frac{1: 8}{2}$$
b. Example 2. A $1: 10$ dilution of a substance is rediluted $3: 5,2: 15$, and $1: 2$. What is the final dilution?

Solution. When determining the final dilution of a series of dilutions, use each dilution as a multiplicative factor. The resulting product is the final dilution.
$$\frac{1}{10} \times \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{2}{15} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{6}{1500}$$

Express the dilution in lowest terms.
$$1: 250$$
c. Example 3. A $5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ solution of HCl is diluted 1:5. The resulting solution is diluted $1: 10$. Determine the concentration of the final dilution.

Solution. When determining the final dilution of a series of dilutions use each dilution as a multiplicative factor. The resulting product is the final dilution.
$$\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{50}$$

Once the final dilution has been determined, the original concentration is multiplied by the dilution to yield the concentration of the dilute HCl solution.
$$\frac{1}{50} \times 5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}=\frac{5}{50} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \text { or, eqivalently, } 0.1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$$

\section*{6-4. PREPARATION OF A WORKING SOLUTION FROM A STOCK SOLUTION}

In some instances, a laboratory may utilize a stock solution that will be diluted in order to be used as a working solution. In changing the concentration of the solution, a basic relationship is employed. This relationship is based on the fact that the amount of solute remains constant in both solutions and can be expressed as follows: The volume of the given solution times the concentration of that solution equals the volume of the resulting solution times the concentration of the second solution. An expression that describes this relationship is as follows:
$\mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}$
Where:
$\mathrm{C}_{1}=$ Concentration of the stock solution
$\mathrm{V}_{1}=$ Volume of the stock solution
$\mathrm{C}_{2}=$ Concentration of the working solution
$\mathrm{V}_{2}=$ Volume of the working solution
NOTE: The relationship between the volumes and concentrations involved is that of an inverse proportion; that is, when the volume of one solution is greater, the concentration of the solution of greater volume is less.
a. Basic Rules for Solving $\mathbf{C}_{1} \mathbf{V}_{1}=\mathbf{C}_{2} \mathbf{V}_{2}$ Problems.
(1) Three of the 4 values must be known.
(2) The units of volume and concentration must be the same respectively.
(3) It is crucial that the volume and concentration that relate to one another are identified.
(4) Any unit of volume or concentration may be used.
b. Example 1. How much 30.03.0

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the relationship that will allow you to determine the unknown quantity.
$\mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}$
Ensure that the concentration and volume units are the same respectively. Using the appropriate expression, substitute the given values.
$\mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}$
(30.0

Solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{V}_{1}=\frac{(3.0 \%)(100 \mathrm{~mL}}{30.0}=10 \mathrm{~mL}$$

10 mL of $30.0 \%$ alcohol must be added to a 100 mL volumetric flask and q.s. to the mark with water in order to attain a concentration of $3.0 \%$.

Solution via dimensional analysis:
Calculate the amount of solute in the final (diluted) solution.
$$100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{3.0 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{dL}}=3.0 \mathrm{~mL} \text { alcohol }$$

Multiply the amount of solute needed in the final solution times the percent concentration of the original solution, used appropriately as a factor.
$$3.0 \mathrm{~mL} \text { alcohol } X \frac{\mathrm{dL}}{30.0 \mathrm{~mL} \text { alcohol }}=0.10 \mathrm{dL}$$

Expressing the volume of original solution in milliliters yields the same results as before.
$$0.10 \mathrm{dL} \times \frac{100 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{dL}}=\underline{10 \mathrm{~mL}}$$

NOTE: A key for this particular type of problem is that in most instances the problem refers to the preparation of a dilute solution from a concentrated stock. Another key is in the fact that this type of problem will have either two concentrations and one volume or two volumes and one concentration.
c. Example 2. How much $0.100 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ can be prepared from 10.0 mL of $6.00 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ ?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the relationship that will allow you to solve the problem for the unknown quantity.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}$$

Initial inspection of the problem reveals that the concentration units are different. Either concentration may be converted, the requirement is that both units must be the same.

Express $0.100 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ in terms of mol/L
$$\frac{0.100 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=0.0500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$$

Using the appropriate expression substitute the values.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}$$
$$(6.00 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(10.0 \mathrm{~mL})=(0.0500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}) \mathrm{V}_{2}$$

Solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{V}_{2}=\frac{6.00 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(10.0 \mathrm{~mL})}{0.0500 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}=1200 \mathrm{~mL}$$

\section*{6-5. PREPARATION OF STANDARDS BY MIXING}

When preparing a new standard by mixing two or more standards of known concentration, the concentration of the new standard times its volume is equal to the sum of the concentration of the first standard times its volume plus the concentration of the second standard times its volume and so on depending on the number of standards being mixed. Keep in mind that the concentration of the new standard will never be greater than the highest standard nor less than the lowest standard. All concentrations and volumes must be in the same units respectively. An expression that describes the relationship between the standards being mixed is as follows:
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}+C_{3} V_{3} \ldots+C_{n} V_{n}$$

Where:
$$\begin{aligned}
& C_{1}=\text { Concentration of the new standard } \\
& V_{1}=\text { Volume of the new standard (total volume) } \\
& C_{2}, C_{3}, C_{n}=\text { Concentration of the standards used in preparation } \\
& V_{2}, V_{3}, V_{n}=\text { Volume of the standards used in preparation }
\end{aligned}$$
a. Example 1. You are preparing a series of standards for an automated glucose procedure. You already have a $50.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and a $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ standard made, and are making intermediate concentrations by mixing various quantities of the two. If you mix 3.00 mL of the $50.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ standard with 2.00 mL of the $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ standard, what is the concentration of the new standard?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and select the formula that will allow you to solve the problem for the unknown quantity.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}+C_{3} V_{3} \ldots+C_{n} V_{n}$$

Ensure that all concentrations and volumes are expressed in the same units, respectively. (This problem does not require any concentration or volume unit conversion.)

To determine $\mathrm{V}_{1}$, add the volumes of each of the standards being mixed. In this problem, $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ equals 5.00 mL since 3.00 mL of the $50.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ standard and 2.00 mL of the $300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{standard}$ are being mixed.

Substitute the given information and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{1}(5.00 \mathrm{~mL})=(50.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})(3.00 \mathrm{~mL})+(300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})(2.00 \mathrm{~mL}) \\
& \mathrm{C}_{1}=\frac{(50.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})(3.00 \mathrm{~mL})+(300 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})(2.00 \mathrm{~mL})}{5.00 \mathrm{~mL}} \\
& \mathrm{C}_{1}=150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}
\end{aligned}$$
b. Example 2. What is the concentration of a standard solution that was prepared by mixing 5.0 mL of a $6.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ standard, 8.0 mL of a $2.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ standard, and 3.0 mL of a $31 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{Ca}{ }_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ standard?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the relationship that will allow you to solve the problem for the unknown quantity.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}+C_{3} V_{3} \ldots+C_{n} V_{n}$$

Ensure that all concentrations and volumes are expressed in the same units, respectively.

NOTE: In this example, convert the concentrations to $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$. Consistency of the units is the only requirement. One unit is not preferred over another in this type of calculation.

Convert 6.0 Eq/L Ca $\mathrm{a}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ to $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$.
$\frac{6.0 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{L}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{6 \mathrm{Eq}}=1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
Convert $31 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{a}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ to $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$.
Calculate the GMW of $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$.
$\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$
Ca $40.1 \times 3=120.3$
P $31.0 \times 2=62.0$
O $16.0 \times 8=\frac{+128.0}{310.3} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
Use the appropriate factors to determine the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration.
$\frac{31 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{310.3 \mathrm{~g}} \times \frac{10 \mathrm{dL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
Determine the total volume.

$1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
$2.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
$1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
$\frac{5.0 \mathrm{~mL}}{16.0 \mathrm{~mL}}+3.0 \mathrm{~mL}$

Substitute the given information and solve for the unknown quantity.
$\mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}+\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{~V}_{3} \ldots+\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{n}}$
$\left(\mathrm{C}_{1}\right)(16.0 \mathrm{~mL})=(1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(5.0 \mathrm{~mL})+(2.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(8.0 \mathrm{~mL})+(1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(3.0 \mathrm{~mL}) \mathrm{C}_{1}=\frac{(1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(5.0 \mathrm{~mL})+(2.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(8.0 \mathrm{~mL})+(1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(3.0 \mathrm{~mL})}{6 \mathrm{~mL}}$
$\mathrm{C}_{1}=1.5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$

\section*{LESSON 7}

\section*{TITRATION}

\section*{7-1. DISCUSSION}

One of the basic methods of analytical chemistry is titration. Titration is the incremental addition of a titrant into a known volume of titrating fluid in the presence of an indicator that identifies the neutralization point. Titration is based on the following principle: "One equivalent weight of a substance will react exactly with one equivalent weight of another substance." Equivalent weight refers to the reacting ability of a substance. When performing a titration, the concentration of the solutions involved MUST be expressed in terms of the concentration units that indicate reacting strength, Eq/L or mEq/L.
a. The number of equivalents or milliequivalents present in a given volume of solution indicates the reacting strength of a solution. Since titration is based on the reacting strength of one solution versus the reacting strength of another solution (usually an acid versus a base), the Eq/L concentration of the acid times the volume of the acid is equal to the Eq/L concentration of the base times the volume of the base. A familiar formula that states these facts is:
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}$$

Where:
$$\begin{aligned}
& C_{1}=E q / L \text { or } m E q / L \text { concentration of the acid } \\
& V_{1}=V \text { olume of the acid } \\
& C_{2}=E q / L \text { or } m E q / L \text { concentration of the base } \\
& V_{2}=V \text { olume of the base }
\end{aligned}$$

NOTE: It is not crucial that the variables follow the above format. However, it is crucial that the appropriate concentration and volume be multiplied.
b. Associated Terms Follow:
(1) Acidimetry. Acidimetry is defined as the determination of the concentration of an unknown acid by using a standard base (a base in which the exact concentration is known).
(2) Alkalimetry. Alkalimetry is defined as the determination of the concentration of an unknown base by using a standard acid.
(3) Endpoint. The endpoint is defined as the point where equivalent amounts of two reactants have been brought together, the point of neutralization.
(4) Indicator. An indicator is a dye that changes color at the endpoint.

\section*{7-2. INDICATORS AND GENERAL RULES OF USE}
a. Shown below are some of the indicators that may be used in acid-base titrations. These indicators vary in sensitivity and pH range and are chosen according to the equivalence point or stoichiometric endpoint of the reactants used in the titration.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Color In:}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Indicator & pH Range & Acid & Base \\
\hline Methyl violet 6B & 1.5-3.2 & Blue & Violet \\
\hline Methyl orange & 3.1-4.4 & Red & Yellow \\
\hline Ethyl orange & 3.4-4.8 & Red & Yellow \\
\hline Bromcresol green & 3.8-5.4 & Yellow & Green \\
\hline Methyl red & 4.2-6.2 & Red & Yellow \\
\hline Bromthymol blue & 6.0-7.6 & Yellow & Blue \\
\hline Phenol red & 6.8-8.4 & Yellow & Red \\
\hline Phenolphthalein & 8.2-10.0 & Colorless & Red \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
b. The following general rules apply in choosing the proper indicator for titrations unless a special indicator is specified: (1) when titrating a strong acid with a strong base, use phenolphthalein, (2) When titrating a weak acid with a strong base, use phenolphthalein, (3) when titrating a weak base with a strong acid use methyl red, (4) never titrate a weak base with a weak acid because indicators will not give a sharp color change (when the endpoint is reached) in this combination. When using phenolphthalein and other colorless indicators, arrange the titration for the observation of the appearance of color and NOT the disappearance of color.

\section*{7-3. PERFORMING AN ACID-BASE TITRATION}

The general method that is normally used in performing acid-base titrations is outlined as follows:
a. Place a specific volume of unknown into an Erlenmeyer flask and record the volume.
b. Place two to three drops of indicator into the solution to be titrated. The amount of indicator to be used may be stated in a specific procedure.
c. Fill a buret or serological pipet with the titrating solution of known concentration (Eq/L) and adjust the solution level until the bottom of the meniscus is at zero.
d. Add the titrant from the buret or pipet dropwise to the solution being titrated. It is extremely important to continuously swirl the titration reaction flask as the titrant is added; this allows the specialist to observe the endpoint. If you have sufficient unknown to perform the titration several times, it is recommended that you add the titrant quite rapidly the first time to obtain a rough approximation of the endpoint. This will save a considerable amount of time if several titrations have to be performed.
e. When the endpoint is reached (indicator changes color), record the volume of titrant used by reading the bottom of the meniscus in the buret or pipet.

\section*{7-4. SOLVING TITRATION PROBLEMS}
a. Basic Rules for Solving Titration Problems.
(1) Three of the four values must be known.
(2) The units of concentration MUST be Eq/L or mEq/L.
(3) The units of volume and concentration must be the same respectively.
(4) It is crucial that the volume and concentration that relate to one another are identified.
b. Example 1. It took 5.2 mL of a $0.10 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ to tirate 5.0 mL of a HCl solution. What is the $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the acid?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and select the expression that will allow you to solve the problem for the unknown quantity.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}$$

Ensure that the concentration of the solutions are expressed in terms of their normality and the units of volume are the same.

Substitute the given information into the appropriate expression.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2} \\
& (0.10 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})(5.2 \mathrm{~mL})=\left(\mathrm{C}_{2}\right)(5.0 \mathrm{~mL})
\end{aligned}$$

Solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{C}_{2}=\frac{(0.10 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})(5.2 \mathrm{~mL})}{5.0 \mathrm{~mL}}=0.10 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$$

Convert the concentration to $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ to satisfy the problem using the appropriate conversion factor.
$$\frac{0.10 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{mEq}}{1 \mathrm{Eq}}=\underline{100 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}}$$

Solution. Solving the problem with dimensional analysis yields the same results.

Determine the equivalents of base used in the titration.
$$5.2 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{0.10 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}}=0.00052 \mathrm{Eq}$$

According to the "Rule of Equivalence," an equal amount of acid is needed to neutralize the solution.

The desired number of equivalents of acid per given volume of acid used in the titration times the appropriate conversion factors yield the desired results.
$$\frac{0.00052 \mathrm{Eq}}{5.0 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}{1 \mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{mEq}}{1 \mathrm{Eq}}=100 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$$
c. Example 2. A $0.25 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution was used to tirate 4.0 mL of a 1.0 $\mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution. What volume of acid was required to perform the titration?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and select the expression that will allow you to solve the problem for the unknown quantity.
$$C_{1} V_{1}=C_{2} V_{2}$$

The concentration of the sulfuric acid in this problem is in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ and must be converted to Eq/L. Convert $0.25 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ to Eq/L.

Initial inspection reveals an inconsistent unit (mol/L). Convert the mol/L concentration of the acid to Eq/L.
$$\frac{0.25 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{2 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=0.50 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$$

Substitute the information into the problem solving expression.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2} \\
& (0.50 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})\left(\mathrm{V}_{2}\right)=(1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})(4.0 \mathrm{~mL})
\end{aligned}$$

Solve for the unknown quantity.
$$V_{2}=\frac{(1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L})(4.0 \mathrm{~mL})}{0.50 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}}=8.0 \mathrm{~mL}$$

\section*{7-5. CALCULATING THE REACTING STRENGTH OF A SOLUTION}

At times it may be necessary to calculate the reacting strength of a solution in order to adjust its concentration. For example, potassium acid phthalate (a primary standard) is often used to prepare secondary standards such as sodium hydroxide. In order to adjust a dilute NaOH solution to a higher concentration, it is necessary to determine the reacting strength of the dilute solution so that the proper adjustment can be made.

Example. You are preparing 100 mL of a $1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ standard solution. After titrating this solution against $\mathrm{KHC}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{4}$, you discover that the concentration of the NaOH solution is actually $0.90 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$. The flask containing the NaOH has 90 mL of solution remaining.
a. How many mEq are left in the flask? Read the problem carefully and determine the unknown quantity.

Milliequivalents of compound that remain in the flask.
The remaining volume, expressed in liters, times the actual Eq/L concentration times an appropriate factor for conversion of Eq/L to mEq/L will yield the desired result.
$$90 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{\mathrm{L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{0.90 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{mEq}}{\mathrm{Eq}}=81 \mathrm{mEq}$$
b. How many mEq of NaOH must be added in order to adjust the volume and concentration to 100 mL of $1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution? In order to determine how many mEq of NaOH must be added you must first ascertain the number of mEq present in the desired volume and concentration of solution. You desire 100 mL of a $1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$. With this information the number of mEq desired can be calculated.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 100 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{\mathrm{L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{1.0 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{mEq}}{\mathrm{Eq}}=100 \mathrm{mEq} \text { of NaOH desired } \\
& \mathrm{mEq} \text { needed }=\mathrm{mEq} \text { desired }-\mathrm{mEq} \text { in flask } \\
& 100 \mathrm{mEq}-81 \mathrm{mEq}=19 \mathrm{mEq} \text { needed }
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, 19 mEq of NaOH needs to be added to the flask and sufficient quantity (q.s.) volume to 100 mL in order to obtain a $1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution.
c. How much stock $10 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ must be added to the flask in order to adjust the concentration to $1.0 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$ ? Multiply the number of mEq needed times the concentration of the stock along with appropriate conversion factors for the volume and concentration to obtain the desired results.
$$19 \mathrm{mEq} \times \frac{\mathrm{Eq}}{1000 \mathrm{mEq}} \times \frac{\mathrm{L}}{10 \mathrm{Eq}} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~L}}=\underline{1.9 \mathrm{~mL}}$$
1.9 mL of the stock solution must be added and the solution Q.S. to 100 mL to yield the desired solution.

\section*{LESSON 8}

\section*{CONCENTRATED ACIDS AND BASES}

\section*{8-1. DISCUSSION}

As discussed in paragraph 2-31, concentrated liquids are manufactured as weight-per-weight solutions. An example of this type of solution is concentrated hydrochloric acid that contains 37 grams of HCl per 100 grams of total solution (w/w). These figures indicate that concentrated HCl has a percent purity of 37 percent or that 37 percent of the weight of 100 grams of solution is HCl . Since it is impractical to weigh concentrated acids and/or bases, one needs another method to determine how much concentrated liquid to use. The method used includes use of the specific gravity of the solution, which is an expression of density ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), and the percent purity or assay value (\%A) that indicates the proportion of the solution by weight that is the desired substance. The specific gravity and percent purity values are found on the label of most reagent-grade acids and bases. Using these values, one can determine the actual amount of the substance in a given volume of the concentrated solution.

\section*{8-2. EXAMPLE}

The values listed on the label of a bottle of nitric acid are specific gravity (S.G.) 1.42 and assay 70 percent. What so these values mean?
a. These values mean that 1 milliliter of the solution has a mass of 1.42 grams and that 70 percent of this mass is nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$.
b. When preparing a solution using this concentrated liquid, we are concerned only with how much $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ is present. To determine this, multiply the density times the percent assay. The answer is the number of grams of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ per milliliter of solution.
> $1.42 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$
> X 0.70 percent $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$
> 0.994 grams of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ per mL of solution
c. Therefore, density times \% A is an expression that yields the number of grams of desired substance per milliliter of concentrated substance.

NOTE: The $\%$ A value is equal to the assay value divided by 100 . If the assay value is 70 percent then the $\% \mathrm{~A}$ is $0.70(70 / 100)$. The latter value or it's equivalent is to be used in all calculations.
$(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL})(\% \mathrm{~A})=$ grams of desired substance per unit volume

\section*{8-3. SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND DENSITY}
a. Specific gravity is a method of measuring density. Density is the amount of matter in a given volume, that is, $\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$. Specific gravity is a ratio between the mass of a given volume of any substance and the mass of an equal volume of pure water at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
$$\text { S.G. }=\frac{\text { density of solid or liquid }}{\text { density of water at } 4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}$$

NOTE: When determining specific gravity, the units divide out. Hence, specific gravity has no unit of report.
b. Since 1 milliliter of pure water at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has a mass of 1 gram, specific gravity is equal to the numerical value of the mass in grams of one milliliter of any substance. Materials less dense than water have a specific gravity of less than one, whereas materials more dense than water have a specific gravity greater than one.
c. Example. The density of 200 mL of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution is $1.42 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$. What is the weight of that solution?

Solution. Restating the problem, one milliliter of this solution weighs 1.42 grams; how much would 200 mL of the same solution weigh? This problem can be solved by ratio and proportion.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1.42 \mathrm{~g}}{x \mathrm{~g}}=\frac{1 \mathrm{~mL}}{200 \mathrm{~mL}} \\
& (x \mathrm{~g})(1 \mathrm{~mL})=(1.42 \mathrm{~g})(200 \mathrm{~mL}) \\
& x \mathrm{~g}=\frac{(1.42 \mathrm{~g})(200 \mathrm{~mL})}{1 \mathrm{~mL}} \\
& x \mathrm{~g}=\underline{284 \mathrm{~g}}
\end{aligned}$$

NOTE: The 284 grams represents the total weight of the solution and not just the weight of the $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ present in the solution.

\section*{8-4. PREPARING SOLUTIONS FROM CONCENTRATED LIQUIDS}

When preparing a solution in the laboratory, one would normally think of taking a chemical in powder or crystal form (such as NaCl ) and calculate the amount to be weighed. When preparing such a solution, one would ask, "How many grams of this substance do I need to make the desired concentration?" Using appropriate factors, you caculate the desired weight required. With concentrated liquids, this cannot be done since it is impractical and too dangerous to try to weigh these liquids. We do know, however, that each concentrated liquid contains a certain mass of solute per milliliter of solution and that this can be determined using the information found on the label of the bottle.

Example. A bottle of nitric acid ( $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ ) has a S.G. of 1.42 and an assay of 70.0 percent. How many grams of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ are contained within 1.0 mL of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ ?

Solution. The given volume times the density of the concentrated liquid times the $\%$ A yields the desired results.
$$1.0 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1.42 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{70}{100}=\underline{0.994 \mathrm{~g}}$$

\section*{8-5. PROBLEM SOLVING}

You have seen in earlier lessons that the mass of a solute needed to prepare a solution of a certain concentration may be determined by the use of various expressions, dependent upon the desired concentration unit. These various problemsolving expressions all yielded the mass in grams needed to prepare a solution of known concentration and volume. Similar problem solving techniques may be used to determine the amount of concentrated liquid needed to yield a desired amount of solute. The examples that follow will illustrate several methods needed to solve problems involving concentrated liquids.
a. Example 1. How much concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ with a S.G. of 1.42 and an assay of $70 \%$ would you need to prepare 1.0 liter of a $1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution?

Solution. As before, with problems that involve molarity, calculating the gram molecular weight of the compound involved is a good starting point.

Calculate the GMW of the compound.
$\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$
H 1.0 X $1=1.0$
N $14.0 \times 1=14.0$
O $16.0 \times 3=\frac{+48.0}{63.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$
Determine the amount of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ needed to prepare the solution.
$$1.0 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{1.0 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{63.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=63 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$$

Calculate the grams of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ per milliliter of concentrated liquid.
$$\frac{1.42 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{70}{100}=0.994 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{HNO}_{3} / \mathrm{mL} \text { concentrated liquid }$$

Use the grams per milliliter of solute as an appropriate factor times the number of grams of solute needed to determine the required volume of concentrated liquid.
$$63 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{\mathrm{mL}}{0.994 \mathrm{~g}}=\underline{63 \mathrm{~mL}}$$
b. Example 2. How much $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ with a S.G. of 1.84 and an assay of $95 \%$ is required to make 500 mL of a $4.00 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution?

Solution. As before, with problems that involve normality, calculating the gram equivalent weight of the compound involved is a good starting point.

Calculate the GEW of the compound.
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$
$\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{H} & 1.0 \times 2=2.0 \\ \mathrm{~S} & 32.1 \times 1=32.1 \\ \mathrm{O} & 16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{98.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\end{array}$
$\frac{98.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=49.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$
Determine the amount of solute needed in the desired solution.
$500 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~L}}{1000 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{4.00 \mathrm{Eq}}{\mathrm{L}} \times \frac{49.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{Eq}}=98.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$

Calculate the grams of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ per milliliter of concentrated liquid.
$$\frac{1.84 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{95.0}{100}=1.75 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} / \mathrm{mL} \text { concentrated liquid }$$

Use the grams of solute per milliliter of concentrated liquid as an appropriate factor times the number of grams of solute needed to determine the required volume of concentrated liquid.
$$98.1 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{\mathrm{mL}}{1.75 \mathrm{~g}}=\underline{56.1 \mathrm{~mL}}$$
c. Example 3. How much concentrated HCl with an S.G. of 1.19 and an assay of $38.0 \%$ is required to make 250 mL of a $20.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL} \mathrm{HCL}$ solution?

Solution. Read the problem carefully and determine the desired quantity.
Milliliters of concentrated HCl .
Calculate the amount in grams of solute needed to prepare the solution.
$$250 \mathrm{~mL} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{dL}}{100 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{20.0 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{dL}}=50.0 \mathrm{~g} \text { of HCl needed }$$

Determine the grams of HCl per milliliter of concentrated liquid.
$$\frac{1.19 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{38.0}{100}=0.452 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{HCl} / \mathrm{mL} \text { of concentrated liquid }$$

Use the grams of solute per milliliter of concentrated liquid as an appropriate factor times the number of grams of solute needed to determine the required volume of concentrated liquid.
$$50.0 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{\mathrm{mL}}{0.452 \mathrm{~g}}=111 \mathrm{~mL}$$

\section*{8-6. DETERMINING THE CONCENTRATION OF CONCENTRATED LIQUIDS}

At times, it may be necessary to determine the concentration of a commercial liquid such as the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}$, or $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration. To do this consider the definition of each unit of concentration, then multiply the density ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), given on the bottle times
the percent assay (\%A) times an appropriate conversion factor to yield the desired unit of concentration. Concentrated commercial liquids are based on $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$ of solution.
a. Conversion from $\mathbf{g} / \mathbf{m L}$ to $\mathbf{g} / \mathbf{d L}$. Percent concentration is based on grams of solute per 100 mL of solution.

Example. What is the $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration of a $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution that has a specific gravity of 1.42 and an assay of 70.0 percent

Solution. Express the desired unit of concentration ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) using the information given as appropriate factors.

Calculate the grams of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ per milliter of concentrated liquid.
$$\frac{1.42 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{70.0}{100}=0.994 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{HNO}_{3} / \mathrm{mL} \text { concentrated liquid }$$

Calculate the $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dL}$ concentration by multiplying the grams of solute per milliliter of concentrated liquid times an appropriate unit volume conversion factor.
$$\frac{0.994 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{100 \mathrm{~mL}}{1 \mathrm{dL}}=\underline{99.4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}}$$
b. Conversion from $\mathbf{g} / \mathbf{m L}$ to $\mathbf{m o l} / \mathbf{L}$. Molarity is based on moles of solute per liter of solution.

Example. What is the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of a $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution with a S.G. of 1.42 and an assay of 70.0 percent.

Solution. Express the desired unit of concentration ( $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) using the information given as appropriate factors.

Calculate the GMW of the compound.
$\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$
H $\quad 1.0 \times 1=\quad 1.0$
N $14.0 \times 1=14.0$
O $16.0 \times 3=\frac{+48.0}{63.0} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$

Determine the grams per liter of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$.
$$\frac{1.42 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{70.0}{100} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~L}}=994 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$$

Multiply the gram per liter concentration of the acid times the grams per mole, using the factors appropriately.
$$\frac{994 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{63.0 \mathrm{~g}}=\underline{15.8 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$
c. Conversion From g/mL to Eq/L. Normality is based on equivalents of solute per liter of solution.

Example. What is the Eq/L concentration of a $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution with an S.G. of 1.84 and an assay of $95.0 \%$ ?

Solution. Express the desired unit of concentration (Eq/L) using the information given as appropriate factors.

Calculate the GEW of the compound.
$$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$$
$\begin{array}{ll}\mathrm{H} & 1.0 \times 2=2.0 \\ \mathrm{~S} & 32.1 \times 1=32.1 \\ \mathrm{O} & 16.0 \times 4=\frac{+64.0}{98.1} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}\end{array}$
$$\frac{98.1 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}} \times \frac{\mathrm{mol}}{2 \mathrm{Eq}}=49.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{Eq}$$

Determine the grams per liter of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$.
$$\frac{1.84 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{95.0}{100} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~L}}=1748 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$$

Multiply the gram per liter concentration of the acid times the grams per equivalent, using the factors appropriately.
$$\frac{1748 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{\mathrm{Eq}}{49.0 \mathrm{~g}}=\underline{35.7 \mathrm{Eq} / \mathrm{L}}$$

\section*{LESSON 9}

\section*{pH and BUFFERS}

\section*{Section I. INTRODUCTION}

\section*{9-1. DISCUSSION}
a. The interaction of charged particles in which the total number of protons do not equal the number of electrons is responsible for many chemical reactions. These charged particles are called ions. A cation is an ion in which the protons are more numerous than the electrons ( + charge), and anions are ions in which the electrons outnumber the protons (- charge). These oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other and form bonds called ionic bonds. When ionically bound compounds are dissolved in a solvent, the ions separate. This separation is known as dissociation or ionization. The only way in which most ions can undergo chemical reaction is to be in this dissociated state.
b. Three general types of ionic compounds exist: acids, bases, and salts. Simply and incompletely stated, acids are compounds that contribute hydrogen ions to a solution, bases are compounds that contribute hydroxide ions to the solution, and salts yield neither hydrogen nor hydroxide ions to the solution. The concentration of the hydrogen and hydroxide ions will determine the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution, and thus have an effect on the kinds of reactions and the speed of the reactions that will occur. It is important, therefore, to know the relative concentrations of the hydrogen and hydroxide ions in a solution.
c. Before discussing hydrogen and hydroxide ion concentration further, it will be important to consider in greater detail the definition of an acid and a base. There are several definitions of the terms acid and base. We will examine two of the definitions that will aid you in further course work.

\section*{9-2. ARRHENIUS CONCEPT}

An acid is a substance that will produce hydrogen ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$in an aqueous solution, and a base is a substance that will produce hydroxide ion $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$in an aqueous solution. It is important to note that hydrogen ions do not exist as such in an aqueous solution. Each hydrogen ion is associated with one molecule of water to produce a hydronium ion, $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$.
$$\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}<====\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$$

When hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$, which exists in its pure state as a gas, is dissolved in water, the following reaction takes place:
$$\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}<====>\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$$

The hydronium ion can easily react with other groups as a proton donor. The hydrogen ion itself is made up of one proton.

NOTE: The terms hydronium ion, hydrogen ion, and proton donor may be used interchangeably. However, we will simply refer to the hydrogen ion in future course work, but you should understand that this actually implies the presence of the hydronium ion.

One of the primary drawbacks of the Arrhenius concept is that it defines only aqueous solutions as acids and bases. Other theories allow for nonaqueous solutions.
a. Examples of Arrhenius Acids.
(1) HCl -- hydrochloric acid.
(2) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$-- sulfuric acid.
(3) $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$-- phosphoric acid.
b. Examples of Arrhenius Bases.
(1) NaOH -- sodium hydroxide.
(2) $\quad \mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$-- calcium hydroxide.
(3) $\mathrm{KOH}--$ potassium hydroxide.

\section*{9-3. BRONSTED-LOWRY THEORY}

The Bronsted-Lowry theory presents a broader definition of the terms acid and base. An acid is a proton donor and a base is a proton acceptor. Hydrochloric acid in solution is a Bronsted-Lowry use it forms hydrogen ions but because it is able to give up that hydrogen ion to another substance, such as to a molecule of water to form hydronium ions. For HCl , the difference between the two definitions seems minor. However, it becomes important when the solvent is not water. For example, when HCl reacts with $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia), the proton is given up by the HCl and accepted by the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, making the HCl an acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ a base.
$$\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{NH}_{3}<====>\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$$
acid base acid base
a. Examples of Bronsted-Lowry Acids.
(1) $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$-- ammonium ion.
(2) $\quad \mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$-- acetic acid.
(3) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$-- carbonic acid.
b. Examples of Bronsted-Lowry Bases.
(1) $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-- chloride ion.
(2) $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$-- ammonia.
(3) $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$-- iron (II) hydroxide.

\section*{9-4. WEAK ACIDS/BASES VERSUS STRONG ACIDS/BASES}

As discussed previously, we stated that acids, bases, and salts are ionic compounds. Substances that break up into ions in solution are termed electrolytes because the solution has the ability to conduct electrical current. A strong electrolyte (acid or base) is a substance that exhibits a high degree of ionization, and a weak electrolyte is a substance that only partially ionizes.
a. Hydrochloric $(\mathrm{HCl})$, sulfuric $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$, and nitric $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$ acids are strong acids because they exhibit a high degree of ionization in aqueous solutions. Hydrobromic $(\mathrm{HBr})$, hydroiodic $(\mathrm{HI})$, and perchloric $\left(\mathrm{HCIO}_{4}\right)$ acids are also considered strong acids. All others are weak.
b. The alkaline metal (Group IA, i.e., lithium, sodium, potassium) hydroxides and the alkaline earth (Group IIA, that is, magnesium, calcium, strontium,...) hydroxides are strong bases. Other bases are weak ones.
c. Hydrogen and hydroxide only affect pH or pOH when in the ionized form.

\section*{Section II. DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM}

\section*{9-5. DISCUSSION}

When an acid ionizes, an equilibrium is established between the unionized acid and its ions. This is indicated by double arrows or a doubled-headed arrow in an equation, showing that the two reactions occur simultaneously. HA is used to represent any acid made up of hydrogen and some anion.
$$\mathrm{HA}<====>\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-}$$

At the same time, the acid molecule is dissociating, a certain percentage of the ions are reassociating to reform the acid. When the acid is first placed in water, a high degree of dissociation occurs, and the rate of the forward reaction is greater. Gradually, as more ions are formed, the rate of the reverse reaction increases. Eventually, a state of equilibrium is reached in which molecules are being ionized and reassociated at a given rate. Equilibrium exists when the rates, not the number of molecules or concentrations, of the opposing reactions are equal. This is a dynamic, constant process and continues until a force is added to change this equilibrium. For example, if the temperature is increased, the rates of the reaction are increased, and a new equilibrium state is reached. Removing one of the ions or tying them up with another reaction will also shift the equilibrium.

\section*{9-6. LAW OF MASS ACTION}
a. Law. The law of mass action states that the rate of reaction is proportional to the product of the molar concentrations of the reactants.
$$A+B<=====>C+D$$

For this reaction, A and B are the reactants, and C and D are the products. The rate at which C and D are formed is proportional to the concentration of A and B .
```
rate $=\mathrm{K}_{1}[\mathrm{~A}][\mathrm{B}]$
```

where $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ is a proportionality constant, and the brackets denote $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the enclosed substance.

The rate for the reverse reaction is:
$$\text { rate }=\mathrm{K}_{2}[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]$$
b. Equilibrium Constant $\left(\mathbf{K}_{\text {eq }}\right)$.

The constants $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{K}_{2}$ are different. The ratio of the constants is known as the equilibrium constant $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\text {eq }}\right)$, dissociation constant, or ionization constant.
$$\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{\mathrm{K}_{1}}{\mathrm{~K}_{2}}$$
(1) At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.
```
rate $_{\mathrm{f}}=$ rate $_{\mathrm{r}}$
rate $_{\mathrm{f}}=\mathrm{K}_{1}[\mathrm{~A}][\mathrm{B}]$
rate $_{\mathrm{r}}=\mathrm{K}_{2}[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]$
$\mathrm{K}_{1}[\mathrm{~A}][\mathrm{B}]=\mathrm{K}_{2}[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]$
$\frac{\mathrm{K}_{1}}{\mathrm{~K}_{2}}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}$
$\frac{\mathrm{K}_{1}}{\mathrm{~K}_{2}}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{eg}}$
```

(2) Simply, the ionization (equilibrium) constant is equal to the product of the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentrations of the products formed in the reaction divided by the product of the concentrations of the reactants.
(3) The equilibrium constant for an acid is called the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and for a base the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{b}}$.
(4) $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{b}}$ are determined for weak acids and bases only. If the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ or $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{b}}$ of a strong acid or base, respectively, were determined it would be an infinitely large number.
(5) Values of equilibrium constants are interpreted as follows:
(a) The constant indicates the strength of a weak electrolyte.
(b) The smaller the value of the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ or $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{b}}$, the weaker the acid or base respectively.

\section*{9-7. EXAMPLE}

What is the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$of a $0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ solution of acetic acid if the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ for $\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ is $1.75 \times 10^{-5} ?$

Solution. Determine the equation for the dissociation of the weak acid.
$$\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}<====>\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$$

Write the equilibrium expression.
$$\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$1.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$

NOTE: Although the actual concentration of the acetic acid is less than $0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ after ionization, it is a negligible amount (less than 5 your future course work, the amount of ionized acid or base in this type of problem should be considered to be a negligible amount.

Substitute the variable x for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$since for every dissociated molecule of $\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, one hydrogen ion and one acetate radical are produced.
$$\begin{aligned}
& x^{2}=\left(1.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\right)(0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})=1.75 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~mol}^{2} / \mathrm{L}^{2} \\
& x=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.32 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}
\end{aligned}$$

NOTE: By convention, the equilibrium constants of weak electrolytes are written without units. However, they do have units.

\section*{Section III. DISSOCIATION OF WATER}

\section*{9-8. DISCUSSION}

Although water is not an electrolyte, its molecules do have a limited tendency to dissociate into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions.
$$\mathrm{HOH}<====>\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$$

It can be shown that the tendency of water to dissociate is given by:
$$K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HOH}]}$$

At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the value of K is $1.8 \times 10^{-16}$.

\section*{9-9. ION PRODUCT OF WATER}
a. Since undissociated water is present in great excess, its concentration is virtually constant at $55.6 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$.

NOTE: The gram molecular weight of water is 18.0 ; therefore, in 1.00 L (approximately 1000 grams), there are:
$$\frac{\frac{(1000 \mathrm{~g})}{(18.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol})}}{1 \mathrm{~L}}=55.6 \mathrm{MOL} / \mathrm{L}$$
b. This constant value for the concentration of water can be incorporated into the dissociation constant to give a new constant, the ion product of water, or $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{w}}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 1.8 \times 10^{-16}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{[55.6]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-14}}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, in pure water,
$$\begin{aligned}
& {\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{HO}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}} \\
& \mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{w}}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{HO}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-14}
\end{aligned}$$
c. It is important to realize that the ion product of water, $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$, is constant for all aqueous solutions, even those that contain dissolved acids or bases.
(1) If a large number of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions are added to pure water, the concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions must decrease in order that the product of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$remains the same.
(2) Conversely, if a large number of hydroxyl ions are added, the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$will have to decrease.

\section*{Section IV. pH and pOH}

\section*{9-10. CONCEPT OF pH}

Pure water contains an equal concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ion. Thus, it is a neutral substance, neither acidic nor basic. If a solution has an excess of hydrogen ions, the solution will be acidic. If a solution has an excess of hydroxide ions, the solution will be alkaline. It is customary to use the hydrogen ion concentration (pH) as a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. pH is a unit of concentration that allows the technician to work with very dilute concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ion in a convenient form. This scale permits the representation of the enormous range of the possible $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$concentrations from a $1.0 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$to a $1.0 \times 10^{-14} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$.

\section*{9-11. APPLICATION OF CONCEPT OF pH}

The notation p denotes "negative log of." Logarithms are discussed in lesson 1, and there is a four-place logarithm table in Appendix B. pH is mathematically defined as:
$$-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \text {or } \log 1 /\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$$
a. Example 1. What is the pH of a $0.133 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HCl}$ solution?

Solution. Select the expression that allows you to solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log 0.133=-\log \left[1.33 \times 10^{-1}\right]=-(0.1239-1) \\
& \mathrm{pH}=-(-0.876) \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\underline{0.876}
\end{aligned}$$
b. Example 2. What is the pH of a $0.020 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ acid solution that is ionized 1.8 percent?

Solution. From previous discussion, hydrogen or hydroxide does not contribute to the acidity or alkalinity of a solution unless ionized. So in this problem consider only that hydrogen ion that is ionized.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \\
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log [(0.020 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})(0.018)]=-\log \left[3.6 \times 10^{-4}\right]=-(.5563-4) \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\underline{3.4}
\end{aligned}$$
c. Example 3. Determine the pH of a $0.0100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ solution. The $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of the acid is $1.75 \times 10^{-5}$.

Solution. In determining the pH of a solution of weak electrolyte, you must first calculate the hydrogen ion concentration. Acetic acid ionizes as follows:
$$\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}<====>\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$$

Write the equilibrium expression:
$$\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the hydrogen ion concentration.
$$1.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right]}{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$$

Substitute the variable x for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$, since one hydrogen ion and one acetate ion are produced for every dissociated molecule of $\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& {\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right]=\left(1.75 \times 10^{-5}\right)(0.0100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})} \\
& x^{2}=\left(1.75 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\right)(0.0100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}) \\
& x^{2}=1.75 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol}^{2} / \mathrm{L}^{2} \\
& x=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=4.18 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}
\end{aligned}$$

Using the calculated value for the hydrogen ion concentration, determine the pH of the solution.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \\
& \mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[4.18 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\right]=-(.6212-4) \\
& \mathrm{pH}=-(-3.38) \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\underline{3.38}
\end{aligned}$$

9-12. pOH
pOH is mathematically defined as:
$-\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$or $\log 1 /\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$
NOTE: $\quad \mathrm{pH}$ and pOH have no unit of report.

\section*{9-13. pH SCALE}
a. pH range: $0-14$

\end{tabular}

In examining the definition of pH , we find that there is an inverse relationship between hydrogen ion concentration and pH . As $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$increases, pH decreases and vice versa. Also, notice that each increase of one unit on the pH scale corresponds to a tenfold decrease in [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$], and each decrease of one unit on the pH scale corresponds to a tenfold increase in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. If this is true, then as the [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] increases, $\left[\mathrm{HO}^{-}\right]$decreases, and as $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$decreases, $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$increases.

a. Example 1. What is the pOH of a $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution that has a pH of 4.3?

Solution. Select the expression that allows you to solve for the unknown quantity.
$$14 \text { = pH + pOH }$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 14=4.3+\mathrm{pOH} \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=14-4.3 \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=\underline{9.7}
\end{aligned}$$
b. Example 2. What is the pH of a $0.010 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution?

Solution. In solving this problem, it is necessary to first determine the pOH of the solution before solving for the pH .
$$\mathrm{pOH}=\log \frac{1}{0.010}=2.00$$

Now, utilize the expression that relates pH to pOH by substituting the given information and solving for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 14=\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH} \\
& 14=\mathrm{pH}+2.00 \\
& \mathrm{pH}=14-2.00 \\

\section*{Section V. HYDROLYSIS OF SALTS}

\section*{9-16. DISCUSSION}

If you were to place a salt in water and then perform a pH determination, you would be surprised to find that some salts would have an acidic pH , some would be basic, and others would be neutral. Most salts are formed by the reaction of acids with bases. The anion (-) of the acid and the cation (+) of the base are the component parts of a salt molecule. The term hydrolysis refers to a reaction with water. A salt when placed in water will ionize and depending on the type of salt, will undergo hydrolysis (remember water itself ionizes to a small degree). There are three types of salts we will consider: salts that are composed of the ions of a weak acid and a strong base, salts of a strong acid and a weak base, and salts of a weak acid and a weak base. Anions that form a strong acid ( $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{C10}_{4}^{-}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}$and $\mathrm{I}^{-}$) and cations that form strong bases (Group IA and IIA) do not undergo hydrolysis but simply dissociate into ions: (i.e., NaCl does not hydrolyze in water). This information will help in understanding the action of buffers.

\section*{9-17. HYDROLYSIS OF THE SALT OF A WEAK ACID AND A STRONG BASE}

This salt will hydrolyze to form a basic solution. The salt sodium acetate will ionize into sodium ions and acetate ions. The sodium ion does not undergo hydrolysis but the acetate ion will react with free hydrogen ions forming acetic acid.
$$\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}+\mathrm{HOH} \Leftrightarrow====\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$$

This reaction causes a shift in the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$by removing $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. This salt is classified as a basic salt because the acetate ion, by definition, is a weak Bronsted-Lowry base (proton acceptor).

\section*{9-18. HYDROLYSIS OF THE SALT OF A STRONG ACID AND A WEAK BASE}

The ions of this type of salt will hydrolyze to form an acidic solution. The salt ammonium chloride reacts as follows:
$$\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{HOH} \Leftrightarrow===>\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$$

In this case, the ammonium cation is a Bronsted-Lowry acid (proton donor). This salt is classified as an acidic salt.

\section*{9-19. HYDROLYSIS OF THE SALT OF A WEAK ACID AND A WEAK BASE}

The ions of this type of salt will hydrolyze to form a solution that may be acidic, basic, or neutral, depending on the strength (ionization constant) of the weak acid and weak base that formed the salt. If the ionization constant of the weak acid is greater
than the ionization constant of the weak base, the solution will be acidic. If the constant is greater for the weak base, the solution will be basic. If the constants are equal, the resulting solution will be neutral.

\section*{Section VI. BUFFERS}

\section*{9-20. DISCUSSION}

Buffer systems are commonly used in the laboratory to help maintain a constant pH in a reaction mixture. A buffer solution acts to resist a change in pH . A buffer is composed of either a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt. Buffers made up of a weak acid and it's salt are called acidic buffers and function from pH 0 to 7. Basic buffers consist of a weak base and its salt and function from pH 7 to 14.

\section*{9-21. MECHANISM OF ACTION}
a. Addition of a Strong Acid. A common buffer used in the laboratory is the acetic acid/acetate buffer. As acid is added [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] into the solution, it will react with the acetate anion from the salt (proton acceptor) forming acetic acid. Since acid is added, a shift in the equilibrium of the solution will occur, but the amount of free hydrogen ions in solution will be controlled by the ionization constant of the acetic acid formed and only a slight change in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$takes place.

Buffer system:
$\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{NaC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Acetic acid/sodium acetate)
Buffer system with HCl added:
$\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}<===>\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
b. Addition of a Strong Base. As base is added to this buffer, acetic acid reacts with the base to form salt (acetate ions) and water. Once again a shift in the equilibrium of the solution occurs but with a minimal change in pH .

NaOH added:
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}<===>\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
c. Notes.
(1) A buffer's ability to resist changes in pH is limited to the concentration of either the weak acid of base and its salt. The addition of an excessive amount of either acid or base will "exhaust" the buffering capacity of the buffer.
(2) The closer the pH of the buffer to the $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ or $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}$ of the weak acid or base respectively the greater the buffering capacity.

\section*{9-22. THE HENDERSON-HASSELBALCH EQUATION}

The preparation of laboratory buffers can be accomplished by using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is derived from the ionization constant of weak acids and bases.
$$K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}$$

The hydrogen ion concentration can be calculated by rearranging the equation.
$$\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=\frac{\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \mathrm{X}[\mathrm{HA}]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}$$

Because $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is usually expressed as pH , it is usually more convenient to express all concentration in this equation in logarithmic form.
$$\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=\log \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{[\mathrm{HA}]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}$$

Since $\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$multiply both sides of the equation by -1 .
$$-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=-\log \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}-\log \frac{[\mathrm{HA}]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}$$

Restated:
$$\begin{aligned}
& -\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=-\log \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]} \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]}
\end{aligned}$$

The expression relating pOH to the components of a buffer may be developed similarly.
$$\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]}$$

\section*{9-23 SOLVING BUFFER PROBLEMS}

The most important consideration when preparing a buffer is determining whether an acidic or basic buffer is being prepared. Examine the components of the buffer. If a weak acid and its salt are the components, use the expression for acidic buffers. If a weak base and its salt are used, select the expression for basic buffers.
a. Example 1. Calculate the pH of a buffer solution that contains $0.010 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ acetic acid and $0.020 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ sodium acetate. The $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}}$ for acetic acid is $1.75 \times 10^{-5}$.

Solution. Read the problem carefully, and select the expression that allows you to solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]}$$

Make any necessary conversions.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}=-\log \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{a}} \\
& \mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}=-\log \left(1.75 \times 10^{-5}\right) \\
& \mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}=4.76
\end{aligned}$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pH}=4.76+\log \frac{0.020 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}{0.010 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}} \\
& \mathrm{pH}=4.76+0.301 \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\underline{5.06}
\end{aligned}$$
b. Example 2. What is the pH of a buffer solution that contains $1.50 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NH} 4 \mathrm{Cl}$ and $2.00 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NH} 4 \mathrm{OH}$ ? The $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}$ for ammonium hydroxide is 4.75.

Solution Read the problem carefully, and select the expression that allows you to solve for the unknown quantity. Note that you are dealing with a basic buffer from which you must determine pH .
$$\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]}$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{pOH}=4.75+\log \frac{1.50 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}{2.00 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}} \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=4.75+0.8751 \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=5.63
\end{aligned}$$

Now that you have determined the pOH , using the appropriate expression, determine the pH of the buffer.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 14=\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH} \\
& \mathrm{pH}=14-\mathrm{pOH} \\
& \mathrm{pH}=14-5.63 \\
& \mathrm{pH}=\underline{8.37}
\end{aligned}$$
c. Example 3. What amount of salt/acid is required to prepare a $0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ acetate buffer at a pH of 5.50 ? The $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}$ of acetic acid is 4.76 .

Solution. At times, the pK of the acid/base of a buffer and the total concentration of the buffer is known, and the amount of salt and acid/base required to prepare a buffer must be calculated.

After reading the problem carefully, select the expression that allows you to solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]}$$

Substitute the given information, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 5.50=4.76+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]} \\
& 5.50-4.76=\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]} \\
& 0.74=\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{\text { acid }]} \\
& \text { antilog } 0.74=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]} \\
& 5.5=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]}=\frac{5.5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}
\end{aligned}$$

You have now established the proper ratio of salt and acid that will yield the desired pH . However, the problem states that a molar concentration of $0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ for the buffer is desired. This $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration is the sum of the $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentrations of the salt and the acid. The $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the buffer, based on your calculations so far, is $6.5 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. The following method is one of several that you may employ to determine the concentrations necessary to yield the proper $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the buffer while maintaining the proper ratio.

Express the desired $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the buffer as an equality.
$$\text { [salt] + [acid] = } 0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$$

Solve the equality for either [salt] or [acid].
$$\text { [salt] = } 0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \text { - [acid] }$$

Now based on the substitution property, you are able to express the [salt] in terms of [acid], and in effect, derive an equation in one variable instead of the two, in the original expression.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 5.5=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { acid }]} \\
& 5.5=\frac{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-[\text { acid }]}{[\text { acid }]}
\end{aligned}$$

Simplify the expression by clearing the fraction.
5.5 [acid] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ - [acid]

Solve the expression for [acid].
5.5 [acid] + [acid] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
6.5 [acid] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
[acid] $=\frac{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}{6.5}$
[acid] $=0.0154 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
or equivalently, $1.54 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
To determine the amount of salt required, substitute the calculated value of the acid concentration in the expression relating the salt and acid concentration to the desired $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the buffer.
$$\begin{aligned}
& {[\text { salt }]=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-[\text { acid }]} \\
& {[\text { salt }]=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-0.0154 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}} \\
& {[\text { salt }]=0.0846 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}
\end{aligned}$$
or equivalently, $8.46 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
d. Example 4. What amount of salt/base is required to prepare a $0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ ammonia buffer at a pH of 9.8 ? The $\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}$ for ammonium hydroxide is 4.75 .

Solution. After reading the problem carefully, note that you are to prepare a basic buffer of a certain pH . Select an expression that will allow you to solve for the unknown quantity.
[salt]
$\mathrm{pOH}=\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{b}}+\log { }_{[\text {base }]}$
Convert pH to pOH .
$$\begin{aligned}
& 14=\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH} \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=14-\mathrm{pH} \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=14-9.8 \\
& \mathrm{pOH}=4.2
\end{aligned}$$

Substitute the given values, and solve for the unknown quantity.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 4.2=4.75+\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]} \\
& 4.2-4.75=\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]} \\
& \quad-0.6=\log \frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]} \\
& \text { antilog }(-0.6)=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]} \\
& 0.3=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]}
\end{aligned}$$

Express the desired mol/L concentration of the buffer as an equality.
[salt] + [base] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
Solve the equality for either [salt] or [base].
$$\text { [salt] = } 0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \text { - [base] }$$

Now, based on the substitution property, you are able to express the [salt] in terms of [base], and in effect derive an equation in one variable instead of the two in the original expression.
$$\begin{aligned}
& 0.3=\frac{[\text { salt }]}{[\text { base }]} \\
& 0.3=\frac{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-[\text { base }]}{[\text { base }]}
\end{aligned}$$

Simplify the expression by clearing the fraction.
$$0.3 \text { [base] = } 0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \text { - [base] }$$

Solve the expression for [base].
0.3 [base] + [base] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
1.3 [base] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
[base] $=\frac{0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}{1.3}$
[base] $=0.077 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
or equivalently, $7.7 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
To determine the amount of salt required, substitute the calculated value of the base concentration in the expression relating the salt and base concentration to the desired $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ concentration of the buffer.
[salt] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-$ [base]
[salt] $=0.100 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}-0.077 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
[salt] $=\underline{0.023 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}}$
or equivalently, $2.3 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$

\section*{REVIEW OF DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS}
1. Read the problem carefully. What is the problem asking for? Be sure the entire problem has been read and understood. This may require you to read the problem two or three times. YOU CANNOT ANSWER THE PROBLEM IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS ASKING!!!!

2 Determine exactly what results are to be produced by the calculations.
3. Determine what principles and relationships are involved.
4. Think about possible methods to use in solving the problem.

5 Use the sample problems to help you set up and solve the problem.
6. Based on definition, determine the appropriate factors that allow you to solve for the unknown quantity.
7. Once you have selected the appropriate factors for that specific problem type, write them down on your paper.
8. Units are treated the same as numbers in any mathematical calculations.
9. Write the intermediate stages of the calculations clearly. Avoid writing one number on top of another as a method of correction. Make each digit legible. This will allow you to go back and check your work later.
10. Mentally estimate an answer before working the problem.
11. Do the mathematics involved and check your work. Do not round off any intermediate calculations. Be extremely careful in positioning the decimal point and make certain the final answer has the appropriate number of significant figures.
12. Cancel units. The units you have left should be an appropriate unit for what the problem asked. Example: If the problem asked for "How many grams," your final answer should be in grams. If it is not, go back and check your work. Often, all that is required is a simple metric conversion.
13. Compare the calculated result with your estimated answer. If the two figures disagree drastically, determine which result is wrong.
14. Finally, go back and read the problem again. Did you answer the question correctly and does your answer make sense?
