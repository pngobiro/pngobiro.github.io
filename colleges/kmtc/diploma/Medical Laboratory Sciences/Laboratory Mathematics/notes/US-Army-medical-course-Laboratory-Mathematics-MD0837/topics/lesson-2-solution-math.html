                            <p>Chemicals available from various manufacturers are usually assigned one of several common grades. The particular grade assigned to a chemical depends upon the purity. However, the differentiation between the various grades is unofficial. There seems to be no agreement between chemical manufacturing companies concerning the various degrees of purity.</p>

                            <p>A standard is a solution that contains a known amount of analytically pure (weighed or titrated) substance in a specific volume of solvent.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="primary-standards">a. Primary Standards.</h4>
                            <p>Primary standards are highly purified chemicals which assay to be at least 99.95% from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), U.S. Department of Commerce. A primary standard must fulfill the following criterion: (1) it can be accurately weighed or measured, (2) it must be stable, (3) it must be extremely pure, and (4) it must be nonhygroscopic (not absorb water readily).</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="secondary-standards">b. Secondary Standards.</h4>
                            <p>If a standard is prepared from a substance whose concentration cannot be determined accurately either by weighing or measuring, it is called a secondary standard. The normality (concentration) of the secondary standard must be determined by titration (or other means) using a primary standard. HCl, $\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4$, and NaOH are laboratory reagents that fall into the category of secondary standards. If an exact concentration is desired, these reagents must be standardized prior to use.</p>

This grade of chemical appears in two different forms: (1) lot analyzed, in which each lot is individually analyzed and the amount of impurities noted on the bottle, and (2) maximum impurities, which lists the maximum allowed impurities on the bottle. This grade of chemical also contains certain types of chemicals and solvents which are designed for specific laboratory determinations. These specialized reagents are:</p>

The specifications for this grade of chemical state that the impurities present may not be of such concentration as to be harmful to one's health. This grade of chemical is usually unsatisfactory for use in preparing standards or reagents. It should only be used in emergency situations.</p>

                            <p>Tap water contains various impurities, both organic and inorganic. These impurities may interfere with many of the chemical tests that are routinely performed and consequently contributed to invalid test results. For example, calcium is a commonly performed laboratory test, and some tap water contains considerable amounts of calcium. To eliminate the possibility of interfering substances in water, either deionized or distilled water must be used in the preparation of all standards and reagents. Water for use in the laboratory is broken down into three basic types: Type I, Type II, and Type III.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-10">2-10. Type I Water</h3>
                            <p>This is the purest type of water and is used for laboratory tests where the greatest accuracy is desired. This type of water is designed for use with atomic absorption, flame photometry, pH determinations, and fluorometry.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-11">2-11. Type II Water</h3>
                            <p>This type of water is for general laboratory use and can be used for any type of laboratory determination that does not specify Type I water. Of the type of procedures listed under Type I water, only atomic absorption and fluorometry require the use of Type I water.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-12">2-12. Type III Water</h3>
                            <p>Type III water is used for rinsing glassware and is suitable for most qualitative determinations.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-17">2-17. Introduction</h3>
                            <p>In order to discuss a solution, one first needs a definition of the term. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of gases, solids, or liquids in which the individual molecules of two or more substances are evenly dispersed throughout the medium (solution). For example, if one dissolves sucrose in water, the sugar granules will break down into individual molecules. This is to say, if one were to sample any two sections of the solution, the same number of sugar molecules would be found per unit volume. Solutions are not always liquids; that is, if liquid mercury is rubbed on solid gold, the solid gold will dissolve the liquid mercury resulting in a solid solution.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-18">2-18. Solvent</h3>
                            <p>A solution consists of two parts. The first part is the <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="The portion of the solution that is either in greatest concentration or the portion of the solution that is doing the dissolving.">solvent</dfn>, which is defined as that portion of the solution that is either in greatest concentration or the portion of the solution that is doing the dissolving. Water is usually considered to be the universal solvent, no matter what proportion of the solution it is.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-19">2-19. Solute</h3>
                            <p>The <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="The substance that is being dissolved or the substance that is in lower concentration.">solute</dfn> is the second part of a solution. One can define the solute as the substance that is being dissolved or the substance that is in lower concentration.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-20">2-20. Examples</h3>
                            <p>If one were to take 5 grams of sodium hydroxide and dissolve it in 100 milliliters of deionized water, what would be the solvent and what would be the solute? If you selected sodium hydroxide as the solute and water as the solvent, you were correct. The reason the sodium hydroxide is the solute is because it is present in the lower concentration and it is also the substance being dissolved. Water is the solvent because it is (1) the universal solvent; (2) present in the greatest concentration; and (3) the substance that is doing the dissolving.</p>

                        </div>

                        <!-- 2-21 to 2-25 -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 id="2-21">2-21. Introduction</h3>
                            <p>As stated, a solution is a homogeneous mixture of gases, liquids, or solids in which the molecules of two or more substances are evenly dispersed throughout the medium. This can be more specifically defined as a true solution because the substances are mixed on a molecular basis. There are two other types of solutions with which one should be familiar--the colloidal solution and the emulsion.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-22">2-22. Colloidal Solution</h3>
                            <p>A colloidal solution is not a true solution since the individual molecules are not mixed on a molecular basis; hence, the solution is not homogeneous throughout. This type of solution contains aggregates of molecules with each individual aggregate being denoted as a colloid or as a colloidal particle. The number of molecules in each aggregate may be from several hundred to a few thousand. The size of each colloidal particle is usually in the range of from 1 to 200 nanometers (nm) in diameter. This range has been arbitrarily set since particles with a diameter of less than 1 nm do not scatter light and particles greater than 200 nm can be seen with the light microscope. As was mentioned above, there is no homogeneity of particles in this type of solution. The particles are actually suspended in the solvent. A colloidal solution is broken down into two parts: (1) the dispersed phase (analogous to the solute of a true solution) and (2) the dispersion medium (analogous to the solvent of a true solution). The most important colloidal systems are those involving a solid dispersed in a liquid and are commonly denoted as colloidal suspensions. In some determinations of amylase, the starch substrate is a colloidal suspension.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-23">2-23. Emulsions</h3>
                            <p>Emulsions are colloidal solutions in which the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium are immiscible. If one mixes water and oil together and then shakes the container, the oil will break into very small particles that will disperse within the water. Upon standing, the oil droplets (dispersed phase) will tend to coalesce, forming larger and larger droplets. These droplets eventually become too large to remain within the dispersion medium (water) and the two liquids will separate. If one wishes to stabilize an emulsion, an emulsifying agent such as a bile salt must be added.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-24">2-24. Saturated Solutions</h3>
                            <p>The laboratory specialist may on occasion be required to prepare a saturated solution. This type of solution is defined as a solution in which the dissolved solute is in equilibrium with undissolved solute. At a given temperature, most solutions can dissolve (hold) only a given number of solute particles. Once this solution contains all the solute particles that it can "hold," any additional solute will settle to the bottom of the container. Once this point has been reached, the solution is said to be saturated. As stated, there is an equilibrium between dissolved and undissolved solute. More clearly, this is to say that dissolved solute is continuously leaving the solution and entering into the crystal lattice of the undissolved solute. At the same time, undissolved solute is leaving the crystalline state and entering into solution.</p>

                            <h3 id="2-25">2-25. Unsaturated Solutions</h3>
                            <p>An unsaturated solution is one that does not contain all the solute molecules that the solution could possibly "hold."</p>

                            <p>The simplest solution to prepare in the laboratory is the percent solution. The main reason that this type of solution is commonly used is the ease in calculating the amount of solute needed in its preparation. The term percent is a shortened form of percentage, which means parts per 100 total parts. This method is used with all three of the basic comparisons of percent concentration statements, that is, weight/weight, weight/volume, and volume/volume. The percent weight/weight is not commonly used in the clinical laboratory.</p>

                            <p><strong>a.</strong> The weight per unit volume system of percent concentration is the most frequently used method in the clinical laboratory. This method is used when a solid solute is mixed with a liquid solvent. Since percent is parts per 100 parts of total solution, then a weight/volume percent solutions (w/v) unit would be grams of solute per 100 milliliters of total solution (g/100 mL). In the clinical laboratory and related situations, any time a w/v solution is described by a number followed by a percent symbol (grams per 100 mL (g/100 mL). Since 100 milliliters is equal to one deciliter, then a percent w/v concentration can be expressed as grams per deciliter (g/dL).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>b.</strong> Another expression of w/v percent concentration used in the laboratory involves the use of fractional parts of the gram while retaining the unit of volume of solution. Examples of this kind would be milligram per deciliter or milligram percent. These may be expressed as mg/dL, mg/100 mL, or mg%.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>c.</strong> The following problems may be solved using dimensional analysis (see Appendix A); however, simple ratio and proportion will suffice in some instances. Both methods of problem solving will yield comparable results.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>d. Example.</strong> If a 5.0 g/dL solution of NaCl is to be prepared with a volume of 50 mL, how much NaCl would be required?</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution.</strong> Based on definition the same problem could be solved using appropriate factors.</p>
                            <p>By dimensional analysis, we would solve as follows:</p>
                            <p>After reading the problem carefully it should be quite evident that the desired quantity is the amount of solute expressed in grams.</p>
                            <p>Express the volume in dL</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$50.0 \text{ mL} \times \frac{1 \text{ dL}}{100 \text{ mL}} = 0.500 \text{ dL}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>Multiply the volume expressed in deciliters times the percent concentration to determine the amount of solute contained in the specified amount of total solution.</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$0.500 \text{ dL} \times \frac{5.0 \text{ g}}{\text{dL}} = \underline{2.5 \text{ g}}$$
                            </div>
                            
                            <p><strong>e.</strong> Examining the solution reveals that the given volume in milliters is first converted to deciliters, using the appropriate conversion factor. The volume of solution expressed in deciliters is then multiplied by the weight per volume concentration to yield the desired quantity, mass of solute expressed in grams per given volume. Notice that if the correct factor is used the unwanted units cancel out.</p>

                            <p>The first step in solving any solution problem is to carefully read the problem. Remember that a unit of concentration consists of two components-- a weight (or volume) and a volume, thus w/v or v/v. Also notice that in reading the problem, the wording will suggest that a solution is to be prepared. Words such as "prepare" or "make" will be used in this type of problem. When making a percent solution, three things are necessary, that is, mass of solute needed, concentration of the solution to be prepared, and total volume of solution. Consider and see that all three of these requirements are met. Mass of solute is usually expressed in grams or milligrams. Concentration of the solution in g/dL, mg/dL, or (mL/dL). Total volume of solution is expressed in deciliters. Use the information given in the problem or calculated from information given in the problem as appropriate factors.</p>

                            <p>Some salts come in several forms, such as the anhydrous form (no water) and in the form of one or more hydrates. In a hydrate, a number of water molecules are attached to each molecule of salt. The water that is attached to the salt contributes to the molecular weight. Thus, if we were to weigh out equal amounts of a desired chemical and one of its hydrates, the hydrate would not yield as much of the desired chemical, per unit weight, as the anhydrous form, since some of the weight is attributable to the water molecules. In some cases, the prescribed form of a salt may not be available for the preparation of a solution. One must be able to determine how much of the available form is equivalent to the quantity of the form prescribed. To do this, we must first determine the amount of the prescribed form that is needed. Then, using the molecular weights of both substances involved, use ratio and proportion to determine the amount of available form needed.</p>

                            <p>This type, weight/weight percent solutions (w/w), of percent solution is usually expressed as % (w/w), where "w" denotes weight (usually grams) in both cases. An example of a correct designation for this type of solution is as follows: 10 g/100 g (w/w), which indicates to the technician that there are 10 grams of solute for every 100 grams total solution. The (w/w) denotes that the solution is a "weight in weight" percent solution. This type of solution is rarely if ever prepared in the clinical laboratory since it is easier to measure volumes of liquids rather than weigh the liquid on an analytical balance. One must be familiar with w/w solutions because the common laboratory acids and bases are manufactured on a weight-in-weight basis. For more discussion on this, please refer to Lesson 8, Concentrated Acids and Bases.</p>

Wait, usually "How much solute". 30% of 300 is 90mL. If answer is 390mL, the question might have been "how much solution can be made from...". Let's stick to verbatim MMD content: "f. 300 mL of 30.0%". The solution says "390.0 mL". This implies the question in MMD "f. 300 mL of 30.0%" might have meant "How much solution from 117g?" or similar. OR, if the question is "How much solute", then answer should be 90mL. However, adhering to verbatim, I will keep the text. <em>Note: The question in 12 asks "How much solute would you need". If the answer is 390.0 mL, that is a volume. Maybe 12f corresponds to something else? In MMD: "f. 300 mL of 30.0%". Solution: "f. 390.0 mL". There might be a typo in the original PDF source where the question was different. I will transcribe verbatim.</em>)
