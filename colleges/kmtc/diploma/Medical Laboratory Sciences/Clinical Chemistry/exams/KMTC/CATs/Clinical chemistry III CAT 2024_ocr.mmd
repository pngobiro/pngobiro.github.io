\section*{Short Answer Questions}
1. What is the Importance of HDL Cholesterol in Cardiovascular Health? (5 marks)
- Reverse Cholesterol Transport: HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) helps transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for excretion, reducing the risk of plaque formation in arteries.
- Anti-inflammatory Properties: HDL has anti-inflammatory effects, which can protect blood vessels from damage.
- Antioxidant Effects: HDL prevents the oxidation of LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein), which is a key step in the development of atherosclerosis.
- Vasodilatory Effects: HDL promotes the production of nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow.
- Cardioprotective Role: High levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes.
2. Describe the Process and Importance of Measuring Blood Gases in Critically Ill Patients (5 marks)
- Process:
- Sample Collection: Blood gas samples are typically collected from an arterial puncture (e.g., radial artery) or from an arterial line.
- Measurement: Blood gas analyzers measure parameters such as pH , $\mathrm{PaCO} 2, \mathrm{PaO} 2, \mathrm{HCO} 3-$, and SaO 2 .
- Importance:
- Assessing Oxygenation: Determines the adequacy of oxygen delivery to tissues.
- Monitoring Ventilation: Evaluates the effectiveness of respiratory function and ventilation.
- Acid-Base Balance: Helps diagnose and manage acid-base imbalances (e.g., acidosis, alkalosis).
- Guide Treatment: Assists in making decisions regarding oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and other critical interventions.
- Prognostic Indicator: Provides valuable information about the patient's clinical status and prognosis.
3. Discuss the Clinical Significance of Lipid Profile Tests ( $\mathbf{5}$ marks)
- Cholesterol Levels: Assess total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides to evaluate cardiovascular risk.
- Risk Assessment: Identifies individuals at high risk for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and stroke.
- Treatment Monitoring: Helps monitor the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins).
- Preventive Measures: Guides lifestyle modifications and preventive strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.
- Diagnostic Tool: Assists in diagnosing lipid metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidemia and familial hypercholesterolemia.
4. Using the Friedewald Equation, Calculate the Patient's Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) (5 marks)
- Given Values: Total cholesterol (TC) $=250 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}, \mathrm{HDL}-\mathrm{C}=50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, Triglycerides (TG) $=150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.
- Friedewald Equation: LDL-C $=\mathrm{TC}-\mathrm{HDL}-\mathrm{C}-(\mathrm{TG} / 5)$.
- Calculation:
- $\mathrm{LDL}-\mathrm{C}=250-50-(150 / 5)$
- LDL-C $=250$ - 50-30
- $\mathrm{LDL}-\mathrm{C}=170 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.
- Answer: The patient's LDL-C is $170 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

\section*{Long Essay Questions}
1. Explain the Significance of the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation in Acid-Base Physiology (20 marks)
- Significance:
- pH Calculation: The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is used to calculate the pH of blood based on the concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PaCO 2 ).
- Equation: $\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{pKa}+\log$ ([HCO3-] / [ $\mathrm{PaCO} 2 \times 0.03]$ ).
- Interpretation of Imbalances: Helps in understanding and interpreting acid-base imbalances such as metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis.
- Clinical Application: Guides the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders in clinical practice.
- Buffer Systems: Explains the role of bicarbonate and carbon dioxide in maintaining acid-base balance.
- Calculation and Interpretation:
- Example Calculation: Given $\mathrm{HCO} 3-=24 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{PaCO} 2=40 \mathrm{mmHg}$, pKa for bicarbonate buffer system $=6.1$.
- pH Calculation: $\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log (24 /(40 \times 0.03))$
- $\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log (24 / 1.2)$
- $\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log 20$
- $\mathrm{pH}=6.1+1.3$
- $\mathrm{pH}=7.4$.
- Clinical Significance: pH of 7.4 indicates normal acid-base balance. Deviations from this value indicate acid-base disturbances that require clinical attention.
2. Discuss the Physiological Mechanisms Involved in Maintaining Acid-Base Balance in the Human Body (20 marks)
- Buffer Systems:
- Bicarbonate Buffer System: Primary extracellular buffer that neutralizes acids and bases.
- Phosphate Buffer System: Important in the intracellular and renal buffering of hydrogen ions.
- Protein Buffers: Hemoglobin and plasma proteins act as buffers by binding to hydrogen ions.
- Respiratory System:
- CO2 Regulation: The respiratory system maintains acid-base balance by regulating the exhalation of CO 2 .
- Hyperventilation: Decreases $\mathrm{PaCO2}$, leading to respiratory alkalosis.
- Hypoventilation: Increases PaCO 2 , leading to respiratory acidosis.
- Renal System:
- Bicarbonate Reabsorption: The kidneys reabsorb bicarbonate to maintain buffer capacity.
- Hydrogen Ion Excretion: Excretes hydrogen ions and generates new bicarbonate.
- Ammonium Excretion: Ammonium ions are excreted to remove excess hydrogen ions.
- Integrated Regulation: The respiratory and renal systems work together to compensate for acid-base imbalances, maintaining pH within the normal range.
3. Discuss the Metabolic Functions of the Liver ( $\mathbf{2 0}$ marks)
- Carbohydrate Metabolism:
- Gluconeogenesis: Synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.
- Glycogenesis: Conversion of glucose to glycogen for storage.
- Glycogenolysis: Breakdown of glycogen to release glucose.
