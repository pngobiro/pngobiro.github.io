                            <p>Lipids are insoluble (does not dissolve in water but are soluble (dissolves) in alcohol and other solvents. When diatary fats are digested and absorbed into the small intestine, they eventually re-form into triglycerides, which are then packaged into lipoproteins.</p>
                            <p>Dietary fats, including cholesterol are absorbed from the small intestine and transported into the liver by lipoproteins called <strong>CHYLOMICRONS</strong>. Chylomicrons are large droplets of lipids with a thin shell of phospholipids, cholesterol, and protein . Once chylomicrons enter the bloodstream , an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase breaks down the tryglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol.After 12-14 hours fast, chylomicrons are absent from the bloodstream. Thus, individuals who are having a lipid profile done should fast overnight to ensure that chylomicrons have been cleared.</p>

Most LDL-C particles are absorbed from the bloodstream by receptor cells in the liver. Cholesterol is then transported throughout the cells. Diets high in saturated fats decrease the uptake of LDL particles by the liver. LDL particles are also removed from the blood stream by scavenger cells or macrophages, which are white blood cells that bury themselves in the blood vessels such as arteries. Scavanger cells prevent cholesterol from re-entering the bloodstream, but they deposits the cholesterol in the inner walls of the blood vessels, eventually leading to the development of plaque.</span></li>

                            <p>HDL-C and LDL-C are the major types of lipids that circulate in the bloodstream. Therefore, a person"s total cholesterol is mostly determined by the amount of the HDL-C and LDL-C in a measured sample of blood.( For example a total cholesterol level of 5.6 mmol/l could be represented by an HDL-C of 3 mmol/l and an LDL-C of 2.6 mmol/l or HDL-C of 2.6 mmol/l and an LDL-C of 3 mmol/l..</p>
                            <p>From a clinical laboratory perspective, the levels of lipids is measured by carrying out a lipid profile estimation which takes into account total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, the triglycerides and the ratio of TC/HDL-C. a health provider may order a lipid profile as part of annual exam or if there is specific concern about cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary artery disease (CAD) also referred to as coronary heart disease(CHD)</p>

                            <p>The lipids disorders forms part of the cardiovascular diseases which are coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, congenital heart disease and rheumatic heart disease. A person may have one of these diseases or combination of forms at the same time. Each form exists in varying degrees of severity. All forms are capable of causing secondary damage to other body organs and body systems. Among the above mentioned major CVD, coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease is the one directly related to the lipids disorder.</p>

                            <h4>Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h4>
                            <p>This form CVD involves damage to the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscles. The bulk of this blood is supplied by the coronary arteries. Any damage to these important vessels can cause a reduction of blood (and its vital oxygen and nutrients) to specific areas of heart muscles. The ultimate result of inadequate blood supply is a heart attack.</p>

                            <h4>Atherosclerosis</h4>
                            <p>The principal cause for the development of coronary heart disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis produces a narrowing of the coronary arteries. This narrowing stems from the long term buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, on the inner walls of the arteries. This buildup reduces the blood supply to specific portions of the heart. Some arteries of the heart can become so blocked (occluded) that all blood supply is stopped. Heart muscle begins to die when deprived of oxygen and nutrients. This damage is known as myocardial infarction (in lay terms, this event is called a heart attack).</p>

                                <h4 class="callout-title">Lipids and Atherosclerosis</h4>
                                <p>After much scientific studies, it has been determined that high levels of LDL-C, are a significant cause of atherosclerosis. This makes sense because LDL-C carry the greatest percentage of cholesterol in the bloodstream. LDL-C are more likely to deposit excess cholesterol into the artery walls. This contribute to plaque formation.For this reason, LDL-C, is often referred to as -<strong>THE BAD CHOLESTEROL</strong>---. High levels of LDL-C are partially related to inheritance, but they are clearly associated with smoking, poor dietary patterns, obesity and lack of exercise.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, high levels of HDL-C are related to decrease in the development of atherosclerosis. HDL-Care thought to transport cholesterol out of the bloodstream . Thus HDL-C, have been called the----<strong>GOOD CHOLESTEROL</strong>---. Certain lifestyle alteration such as quitting smoking, reducing obesity, increase physical activities, and decreasing dietary fats, help in increasing the levels of HDL-C.</p>
                                <p>Reducing serum total cholesterol levels is a significant step in reducing the risk of death from coronary heart desease.</p>

                            <h4>Angina Pectoris</h4>
                            <p>When coronary arteries becomes narrowed, chest pain, or angina pectoris is often felt. This pain results from a reduction supply of oxygen to heart muscles . Usually angina pectoris is felt when the patient becomes stressed or exercises too strenuously. Angina pectoris reportedly can range from a feeling of mild indigestion to a severe viselike pressure in the chest. The pain may extend from the centre of the chest to the arm and even up to the jaw. Generally the more severe the blockage , the more pain is felt.</p>

                            <p>Over the past thirty years, the ability to diagnose heart disease has improved dramatically, largely because of the evolution of new, increasingly sophisticatedcardiac-testing techniques that include electrocardiography, exercise stress testing, radioisotope studies, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization.Despite these technological advances, the initialdiagnosis of heart disease is still supported by twolow-technology, low-cost cornerstones: the medical history and physical examination. When carefullyperformed and properly interpreted, the history andthe physical will yield an accurate diagnosis in many, if not the majority of cases. Signs and symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and an abnormal pulse, coupled with detailed cardiopulmonary examinationand a careful history that may reveal major risk factors, have proved over and over their value in establishing a diagnosis.</p>
                            <p>After an initial presumptive diagnosis is made based on the findings of the history and physical, cardiac testing can be used to establish the diagnosis and determine the functional capability of the patient, the severity of the disease, and the category of risk into which the individual falls. With varying levels of detail and precision, diagnostic tests can establish or confirm the presence of blockages in the coronary arteries, the degree of blockages, damage to the heart muscle, enlargement of the heart chambers, congenital heart defects, abnormalities of the heart valves, and electrical disturbances that interfere with the rhythm of the heartbeat.</p>
                            <p>Thus, a major value of cardiac testing is its ability to increase the precision of the diagnosis, enabling today's physician to prescribe the treatment with the greatest likelihood of success for each individual patient. In many situations, judiciously ordered tests may also be used to uncover a cardiac abnormality even when there are no signs or symptoms. The choice of tests and the order in which they are used is guided by the findings of the history and physical and by the physician's clinical judgment.</p>
                            <p>In general, the diagnosis of heart disease progresses in a stepwise fashion from the simplest, least invasive, least expensive, and least risky method. As more information about a patient's condition is accumulated, appropriate decisions can be made regarding the use of more sophisticated and more invasive diagnostic procedures.</p>

                            <p>Myoglobin is a heme protein which reversibly binds oxygen, thus favouring its distribution in the muscle cells. Myoglobin is stored in the cytoplasm and this accounts for its rapid release from damaged muscle cells. The rapid increase of myoglobin concentration in blood makes it a useful, early maker of acute myocardial infarction. Since myoglobin is present in both cardiac and skeletal muscles, serum levels may increase in conditions relating not only to the heart (infarctus, heart surgery) but to the muscles (strenuous exercise, muscular dystrophy)</p>

                            <p>The troponins are a family of regulartory proteins found in skeletal and heart muscle (cardiac) fibers. There are three different types: troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). Together, these three proteins regulate muscular contraction. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion binding sites, whereas (TnT), and (TnI) in cardiac muscle have only three calcium binding sites.</p>
                            <p>The other difference is that, TnC is predominantly found in the skeletal muscles where it exacts its regulatory function whereas Cardiac-specific troponins I and T (cTnI and cTnT) are troponins that are found only in the heart. Cardiac-specific troponins differ in their molecular weights in that cTnI has a molecular weight of 23.9 kD whereas cTnT has a molecular weight of 39.7 kD .</p>
                            <p>All these types of troponin are normally present in very small to undetectable quantities in the blood.</p>

                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Troponin tests (I and T) are primarily ordered to evaluate people who have chest pain to see if they have had a heart attack or other damage to their heart. Either a cardiac-specific troponin I or troponin T test can be performed; usually a laboratory will offer one test or the other. Troponin tests are sometimes ordered along with other cardiac biomarkers, such as AST,LDH,CPK, CK-MB, CK-MM or myoglobin. However, troponins are the preferred tests for a suspected heart attack because they are more specific for heart injury than other tests (which may become elevated in skeletal muscle injury) and remain elevated for a longer period of time.</p>
                            <p>TnT and Tnl circulation levels are not affected by damage to other muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect cardiac troponin levels. Troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance..Increased cardiac troponin concentrations should not be used by themselves to diagnose or rule out a heart attack. A physical exam, clinical history, and ECG are also important as is whether the troponin levels from a series of tests are stably elevated or show a rise and/or fall over several hours. Very rarely, people who have a heart attack will have normal troponin concentrations, and some people with increased troponin concentrations have no apparent heart injury.</p>
                            <p>Troponin (TnC, Tnl and TnT) levels may also be elevated with acute or chronic conditions such as myocarditis (heart inflammation), congestive heart failure, severe infections, kidney disease, and certain chronic inflammatory conditions of muscles and skin.</p>
