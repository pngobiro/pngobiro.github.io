                            <p>Endocrinology is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its specific secretions called hormones, the integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation (including histogenesis and organogenesis) and the coordination of metabolism, respiration, excretion, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception depend on chemical cues, substances synthesized and secreted by specialized cells.</p>
                            <p>Endocrinology is concerned with study of the biosynthesis, storage, chemistry, biochemical and physiological function of hormones and with the cells of the endocrine glands and tissues that secrete them.</p>
                            <p>The endocrine system consists of several glands, all in different parts of the body, that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action; one hormone may have several effects on different target organs, and, conversely, one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone.</p>

                            <p>Hormones act by binding to specific receptors in the target organ. As Baulieu notes, a receptor has at least two basic constituents:</p>

                            <h4>Amines</h4>
                            <p>Amines, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, are derived from single amino acids, in this case tyrosine. Thyroid hormones such as 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T4) make up a subset of this class because they derive from the combination of two iodinated tyrosine amino acid residues.</p>

                            <h4>Peptide and protein</h4>
                            <p>Peptide hormones and protein hormones consist of three (in the case of thyrotropin-releasing hormone) to more than 200 (in the case of follicle-stimulating hormone) amino acid residues and can have a molecular mass as large as <strong>30,000 grams per mole</strong>. All hormones secreted by the pituitary gland are peptide hormones, as are leptin from adipocytes, ghrelin from the stomach, and insulin from the pancreas.</p>

                            <h4>Steroid</h4>
                            <p>Steroid hormones are converted from their parent compound, cholesterol. Mammalian steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups by the receptors to which they bind: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. Some forms of vitamin D, such as calcitriol, are steroid-like and bind to homologous receptors, but lack the characteristic fused ring structure of true steroids.</p>

                            <p>The pituitary gland is often portrayed as the "master gland" of the body. Such praise is justified in the sense that the anterior and posterior pituitary secrete a battery of hormones that collectively influence all cells and affect virtually all physiologic processes.</p>
                            <p>The pituitary gland may be king, but the power behind the throne is clearly the hypothalamus. As alluded to in the last section, some of the neurons within the hypothalamus - neurosecretory neurons - secrete hormones that strictly control secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamic hormones are referred to as releasing hormones and inhibiting hormones, reflecting their influence on anterior pituitary hormones.</p>
                            <p>Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are carried directly to the anterior pituitary gland via hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal veins. Specific hypothalamic hormones bind to receptors on specific anterior pituitary cells, modulating the release of the hormone they produce.</p>

                            <p>As an example, thyroid-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus binds to receptors on anterior pituitary cells called thyrotrophs, stimulating them to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH. The anterior pituitary hormones enter the systemic circulation and bind to their receptors on other target organs. In the case of TSH, the target organ is the thyroid gland.</p>
                            <p>Clearly, robust control systems must be in place to prevent over or under-secretion of hypothalamic and anterior pituitary hormones. A prominent mechanism for control of the releasing and inhibiting hormones is negative feedback.. Keep in mind that summaries are just that, and ongoing research continues to delineate additional, sometimes very important effects.</p>

                            <h3 id="gh-somatomedins">Growth Hormone and Somatomedins</h3>
                            <p>Growth hormone (GH)or somatotropin (STH), is the most abundant hormone in the anterior pituitary. Plasma levels of GH in adult remain stable and relatively low with four or five sharp spikes occurring 3-4 hrs after meals and a marked rise an hour after the onset of sleep.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Regulation of Secretion</h4>
                            <p>The release of GH appears to be under the control of two hypothalamic factors. One is GH-releasing hormone (GRH) and the other is somatostatin or GHIH which inhibits GH release. The release of these two factors is in turn controlled by the higher centres of the brain. Thus various stimuli such as exercise, physical and emotional stress, hypoglycaemia, increased amino acid levels and hormones such as testosterone, estrogens and thyroxine stimulate GH secretion.</p>

                            <h4>Physiological Action</h4>
                            <p>The overall action of GH is to promote growth of cartilage, bone and many soft tissues by stimulating protein synthesisMost GH effects are delayed rather than immediate.</p>

                            <h4>Somatomedins</h4>
                            <p>GH stimulates secretion by the liver of peptides called somatomedins. Their effects include enhanced incorporatin of sulfate into cartilage and stimulation of synthesis of DNA and RNA for collagen formation. Unlike most other peptide hormones, somatomedins circulate in the blood complexed with a plasma - binding protein.</p>

                                <h4 class="callout-title">Clinical Significance</h4>
                                <p>Clinically important states of growth hormone excess or deficiency are rare. When present, <strong>GROWTH HORMONE EXCESS</strong> results in over growth of the skeleton and soft tissues. The most commonly occurs in adult and is known as <strong>ACROMEGALY</strong>. When GH excess occurs before long-bone growth is complete, there is a striking acceleration of linear growth a condition termed as pituitary gigantism.</p>
                                <p>GH deficiency leads to growth retardation. Children who lack sufficient GH production or action will not grow normally. Somatomedin levels are low in patients with GH deficiency and growth failure.</p>

                            <p>This is part of a neurosecretory system consisting of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus, the tracts of nerve fibres from the cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei, and the posterior lobe of the pituitary.The two hormones secreted by this part of the pituitary are the ADH(VASOPRESSIN or ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE), and OXYTOCIN</p>

                            <h3 id="adh">ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone)</h3>
                            <p>The principal stimulus for ADH secretion is an increase in plasma osmolality. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus and probably in the posterior pituitary respond to changes in plasma osmolality. Other important stimuli for ADH release include a reduction in plasma volume or arterial pressure, pain, stress, sleep exercise and drugs such as nicotine, morphine and barbiturates. Hyposmolality, volume expansion,hypertension, exposure to cold, alcohol and some drugs eg phenytoin, glucocorticoids-inhibits the release of ADH.</p>
                            <p>The prinicipal physiological action of ADH is stimulation of water reabsorption from the renal tubular fluid. The blood levels of ADH regulates water balance, which indirectly regulates the concentration of osmotically active solutes in the ECF.ADH increases the volume of water reabsorbed by the renal tubules; consequently, urine becomes concentrated and its volume decreases. ADH is believed to play an important role in maintaining arterial blood pressure during acute blood loss.</p>

                            <h4>Clinical Significance of ADH</h4>
                            <p><strong>POLYURIC STATES</strong>---deficient production or action of ADH results in polyuria due to failure of the renal tubule to reabsorbed solute -free-water. POLYURIC STATES can be divided into three general categories:-</p>

                            <h3 id="oxytocin">Oxytocin</h3>
                            <p>The primary stimulus for oxytocin release is suckling. Stretch receptors in the uterus and in the vaginal mucosa may also stimulate release of oxytocin.Emotional stress inhibits lactation, possibly by inhibiting oxytocin release.</p>
                            <p>oxytocin is present in both male and female but its physiological effects are only in females. Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the estrogen - primed uterus. It is useful therapeutic agent in inducing labor. Oxytocin also stimulates lactation by the mammary gland. Progestins are belleived to inhibit the action of oxytocin.</p>

                            <p>The major thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland is thyroxine, also called <strong>T4</strong> because it contains four iodine atoms. To exert its effects, T4 is converted to triiodothyronine (<strong>T3</strong>) by the removal of an iodine atom. This occurs mainly in the liver and in certain tissues where T3 acts, such as in the brain. The amount of T4 produced by the thyroid gland is controlled by another hormone, which is made in the pituitary gland located at the base of the brain, called thyroid stimulating hormone (abbreviated <strong>TSH</strong>).</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--tip">
                                <h4 class="callout-title">The Thermostat Analogy</h4>
                                <p>The amount of TSH that the pituitary sends into the blood stream depends on the amount of <strong>T4</strong> that the pituitary senses. If the pituitary senses very little T4, then it produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more T4. Once the T4 in the blood stream goes above a certain level, the pituitary's production of TSH is shut off. The thyroid and pituitary act in many ways like a heater and a thermostat. When the heater is off and it becomes cold, the thermostat reads the temperature and turns on the heater. When the heat rises to an appropriate level, the thermostat senses this and turns off the heater. Thus, the thyroid and the pituitary, like a heater and thermostat, turn on and off .

                            <h4>Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)</h4>
                            <p>The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism). The opposite situation, in which the TSH level is low, usually indicates that the person has an overactive thyroid that is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). Occasionally, a low TSH may result from an abnormality in the pituitary gland, which prevents it from making enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid (secondary hypothyroidism). In most healthy individuals, a normal TSH value means that the thyroid is functioning normall.</p>

                            <h4>Thyroxine or tetraiodothyronine (T4)</h4>
                            <p>Thyroxine circulates in the blood in two forms: 1) T4 bound to proteins that prevent the T4 from entering the various tissues that need thyroid hormone and 2) free T4, which does enter the various target tissues to exert its effects. The free T4 fraction is the most important to determine how the thyroid is functioning, and tests to measure this are called the Free T4 (FT4). Individuals who have hyperthyroidism will have an elevated FT4, whereas patients with hypothyroidism will have a low level of FT4. Combining the TSH test with the FT4 accurately determines how the thyroid gland is functioning. The finding of an elevated TSH and low FT4 indicates primary hypothyroidism due to disease in the thyroid gland. A low TSH and low FT4 indicate hypothyroidism due to a problem involving the pituitary gland. A low TSH with an elevated FT4 is found in individuals who have hyperthyroidism.</p>

                            <h4>Triiodothyronine (T3)</h4>
                            <p>Triiodothyronine tests are often useful to diagnosis hyperthyroidism or to determine the severity of the hyperthyroidism. Patients who are hyperthyroid will have an elevated T3 level. In some individuals with a low TSH, only the T3 is elevated and the FT4 is normal. T3 testing rarely is helpful in the hypothyroid patient, since it is the last test to become abnormal. Patients can be severely hypothyroid with a high TSH and low FT4, but have a normal T3</p>

The disease can result in the formation of a toxic goiter as a result of thyroid growth in response to a lack of negative feedback mechanisms. It presents with symptoms such as a thyroid goiter, protruding eyes (exopthalmos), palpitations, excess sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, muscle weakness and unusual sensitivity to heat.</p>

                            <p>Functionally, corticosteroids may be subdivided into glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids .Glucocorticoids tend to elevate blood glucose through promotion of gluconeogenesis and decrease carbohydrate utilization. Large circulating amounts of glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory, immunosupprsive and antiallergic properties. Of the naturally occurring corticosteroids, only cotisol and corticosterone have glucocorticoid activity. Of the two cortisol is more active.</p>
                            <p>The term mineralocorticoids refers to those steroids that regulate salt metabolism (sodium conservation and loss of potassium) and water metabolism (control of extracellular fluid volume). The most potent naturally occurring mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.</p>

                            <h4>Biosynthesis of Adrenal Corticosteroids</h4>
                            <p>The adrenal cortex consists of three layers of cells(zones) each having different secretory products:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>(a) the zona glomerulosa</strong> produces aldosterone</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>(b) the zona fasciculate</strong> procuduces cortisol (the principal product) and to a lesser extent corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>(c) the zona reticularis</strong> is the principal site for the secretion of androgens such as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and to a very limited extent estrogens.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The ACTH (ADRENAL CORTICOTROPIC HORMONE) produced by the pituitary glands stimulates the adrenal glands for the secretion of the above mention hormones. All the above mentioned steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol.</p>

                            <h4>Regulation and Cortisol Secretion</h4>
                            <p>About 90% of circulating cortisol is bound to plasma proteins primarily to an alpha globulin known as corticosteroid-binding globulin(CBG) OR transcortin.</p>
                            <p>There is diurnal variation in the secretion of cortisol and ACTH .In the early morning hours, blood levels ofACTH and cortisol start to rise, reaching a maximum between 6 am and 8 am ( 6-8 am ), after which there is a gradual decline to the lowest level between early evening_ and mid-night ( 3pm-12 mid night). The levels at 8 pm are normally 2/3 the levels at 8 am .</p>

                                <p><strong>(1) GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY (ADDISON"S DISEASE)</strong>---This may be due to either destructive processes that involves both adrenal glands(such as autoimmunity, infection, or neoplasm) or to deficient pituitary production of acth secondary to disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus.</p>
                                <p><strong>(2) GLUCOCORTICOID EXCESS ( CUSHING"S SYNDROME)</strong>--excesive cortisol production results in the clinical picture known as CUSHING"S SYNDROME ( obesity, hypertension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, CHO intolerance disturbance in reproductive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms).</p>

                            <h3 id="catecholamines">(B) Catecholamines</h3>
                            <p>The most important endogenously produced compounds of this group are:- (1)epinephrine (adrenalin), (2)norepinephrine (noradrenalin) and (3)dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine).</p>
                            <p>The main site of production of catecholamines are the brain, chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, and sympathetic neurons. Epinephrine is quantitatively the most important substance produced by the adrenal medulla. Norepinephrine is the major substance liberated by the postganglionic sympatheyic nerves.</p>

                            <h4>Biosynthesis, Storage and Release</h4>
                            <p>L-amino acid tyrosine is the precursor of the catecholamines.<br>
                            Tyrosine is coverted to dihydroxyphenyalanine (DOPA) through some enzymatic action in the mitochondria. DOPA is converted to dopamine in the cytoplasm through the action aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase.. Dopamine is the transported by an energy -dependent mechanism into storage granules (vesicles) that are present both in the sympathetic nerve endings and in the adrenal medulla..These granules contain dopamine-ß-oxidase, an enzyme that is responsible for the final conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine which is then stored in the granules.<br>
                            The principal end product of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) metabolim is vanillymandelic acid (VMA) and to a lesser extent methoxyhydroxyphenylglyco l(MHPG). To this reason, urinary measurement of VMA reflect the total production of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the body.</p>

                                <h4 class="callout-title">Clinical Significance of Catecholamines</h4>
                                <p>Laboratory measurement of norepinephrine, epinephrine or the metabolites are primarily useful for the diagnosis of catecholamine-secreting neurochromaffin tumors (ie pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas or neuroblastomas). Benign or malignant neoplasms may arise in the autonomic nervous systemor the adrenal medulla. These tumors may produce excessive amounts of catecholamines or catecholamine metabolites.</p>
                                <p>In adults, 90% of these rare tumours occur in the adrenal medulla where they are called pheochromocytomas. The 10% that occur in extra-adrenal sites are known as paragangliomas.</p>
