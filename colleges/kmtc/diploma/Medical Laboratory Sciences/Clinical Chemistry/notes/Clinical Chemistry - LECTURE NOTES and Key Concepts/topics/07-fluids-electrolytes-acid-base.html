                            <p>The main fluid in the body is water. Total body water is <strong>60%</strong> of body weight whilst the other <strong>40%</strong> is made up of fats, protein, carbohydrates and minerals.</p>
                            <p>The distribution of the body water is as follows:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>Water moves from one compartment to another due to osmosis. Osmosis is chiefly influenced by dissolved solutes in fluids. Selectively permeable membranes separate body fluids into distinct compartments. Plasma membranes of individual cells separate ICF from ECF and blood vessel walls separate blood plasma from interstitial fluid.</p>
                            <p>The major components of these fluids include water and solutes. The solute is mostly comprised of electrolytes: inorganic compounds that dissociate into ions. Electrolytes include cations (positively charged atoms - sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, carbonate) and anions (negatively charged atoms - chloride, sulphide, phosphate, bicarbonate).</p>

                            <p>Fluid Balance - When each compartment of the body contains the appropriate concentration of water and electrolytes, the body is said to be in fluid balance. Normally, there is a balance achieved between our total daily intake and output of water.</p>

                            <h3 id="regulation-fluid-gain">Regulation of Fluid Gain</h3>
                            <p>The body regulates water intake via the thirst reflex which stimulates us to drink. When water loss is greater than water gain the body reaches a state of dehydration, and dehydration stimulates the thirst reflex in three ways:</p>

                            <p>All three mechanisms stimulate the thirst centre in the hypothalamus resulting in the sensation of thirst and causing us to drink to increase fluid volume. Drinking inhibits the thirst centre by stretching the stomach and intestines and reducing the osmotic pressure of the blood.</p>

                            <h3 id="regulation-fluid-loss">Regulation of Fluid Loss</h3>
                            <p>If fluid loss regulation is considered as the maintenance of the volume of fluid already present in the body, then three hormones play a key role: Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), Aldosterone, and Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP).</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>ADH:</strong> A drop in body fluid results in an increase in blood tonicity and a decrease in blood volume which in turn causes the release of renin in the kidneys and stimulation of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus causes ADH to be released from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH targets the kidneys, and sudoriferous glands reducing fluid loss through each, and it also causes arterioles to constrict.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Renin/Angiotensin/Aldosterone:</strong> Renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, it acts on angiotensinogen a plasma protein produced in the liver to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted in the lungs to the active hormone angiotensin II by the imaginatively named angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II causes: vasoconstriction of the arterioles; stimulation of the release of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex; stimulation of the thirst centre in the hypothalamus; and stimulation of the release of more ADH. Aldosterone increases the retention of sodium and chloride ions as well as water by the kidneys.</span></li>

                            <h4>(1) Fluid Volume Deficit (FVD)</h4>
                            <p>Deficiency in both the amount of water and electrolytes in the ECF where water and electrolyte proportions remain near normal (commonly known as hypovolemia). Occurs as a result of: -(A) abnormal losses through the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney (B) decreased intake of fluid (C) bleeding (D)a shift of fluid into a third space ie the shift of fluid from the intravascular space into an area where it is not readily accessible as ECF, e.g.: sequestered in the bowel, in the interstitial spaces as edema, in inflamed tissue, in potential spaces such as the peritoneal or pleural cavities . Nb/ the patient with a shift of fluid into a third space may not manifest signs/symptoms of fluid volume deficit</p>

                            <h4>(2) Fluid Volume Excess (FVE)</h4>
                            <p>Excessive retention of water and sodium in similar proportions to normal ECF (commonly known as hypervolemia). Occurs as a result of: (A) excessive intake of sodium chloride (B) administering sodium-containing infusions too rapidly, particularly to patients with impaired regulatory mechanisms (C) disease processes that alter regulatory mechanisms, such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and Cushing's syndrome.</p>

                            <h4>(3) Dehydration</h4>
                            <p>Dehydration is a deficit of body water that results when the output of water exceeds intake. Dehydration stimulates the thirst mechanism, instigating water consumption. Sweating and the output of urine both decrease. If water intake continues to fall short of water loss, dehydration worsens.</p>
                            <p><strong>Causes of dehydration may include:</strong> vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics, excessive heat, excessive sweating, fever, decreased water intake.</p>

                            <h4>Overhydration</h4>
                            <p>Overhydration is an excess of body water that results when water intake exceeds output. Drinking large amounts of water does not typically lead to overhydration if the kidneys, heart, and pituitary gland are functioning properly. Excessive body water causes electrolytes in the blood, including sodium, to become overly diluted.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Fluid and Electrolyte Movement</h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are four ways in which fluid and electrolytes move in the body:-osmosis,diffusion, active transport and filtration.</p>
                            
                            <h4>(1) OSMOSIS</h4>
                            <p>This is the movement of a solvent across a selectively permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established. Water is the primary solvent that holds solutes (substances) in solution in the body. The concentration of these solutes in the body fluids is osmolality, whichis determined by the total solute concentrationwithin a a fluid compartment. Osmolality is measured as parts of solute per kilogram of water and is reported as milliosmols per lkg (mOsmol/L). The osmolality of plasma is 275-295 mOsmol/L. The greatest determinant of osmolality within a fluid compartment is sodium concentration.</p>

                            <h4>(2) DIFFUSION</h4>
                            <p>This is the movement of solutes across a selectively permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established . "Coasting downhill"--- diffusion is affected by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">(A) the size of the solutes:-. Larger solutes move less quickly and, consequently, have a lower rate of diffusion WHILST smaller solutes move more quickly and, consequently, have a higher rate of diffusion</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">(B) the concentration of the solutes :-solutes move from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">(C) the temperature of the solutes:- increases in temperature increase the rate of motion of solutes and, consequently, leads to a higher rate of diffusion WHILST decreases in temperature decrease the rate of motion of solutes and, consequently, leads to a lower rate of diffusion</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>(3) ACTIVE TRANSPORT</h4>
                            <p>Movement of solutes across a selectively permeable cell membrane, usually against a pressure gradient and with the expenditure of metabolic energy(ATP), from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established . "Pumping uphill"</p>

                            <h4>(4) FILTRATION</h4>
                            <p>Movement of solutes and solvent across a permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established. This is influenced by two pressures ie colloid osmotic, (or oncotic pressure) and the hydrostatic pressure. Oncotic pressure is that pressure that prevents water from moving out from the intravascular to extravascular compartments to maintain vascular volume whilst hydrostatic pressure is that pressure that moves water outward from the intravascular to extravascular compartments</p>

                            <p>Metabolic processes of the body results with the production of large amounts of carbonic acids ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$), sulfuric, phosphoric and other acids. These products of metabolism are transported to the excretory organs (lungs and kidney) via the ECF and the blood with minimal change in the plasma PH. This is accomplished by the combined functions of the buffer systems of the blood and the mechanisms of respiratory and renal systems.</p>
                            <p>The gases commonly measured are $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{CO}_2$. Although small amounts of these gases exist as dissolved gases in the blood , they are for the most part , chemically combined with other substances. $\text{CO}_2$ exist chiefly as $\mathbf{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ while most of $\mathbf{O}_2$ is bound to haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. The PH of blood is dependent on the relative amounts of $\mathbf{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and carbonic acid ($\mathbf{H}_2\mathbf{CO}_{3}$) which are present in the blood.</p>

                            <p>Acid / base balances disorders can be classified into four groups ie METABOLIC ACIDOSIS and ALKALOSIS and RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS and ALKALOSIS.</p>

                            <h4>Metabolic Acidosis (Primary Bicarbonate Deficit)</h4>
                            <p>Caused by -: (a) production of organic acids that exceeds the rate of elimination, (b) reduced excretion of acids in renal failure, (c) excessive loss of bicarbonates (base) due to excessive loss of duodenal fluids as in diarrhaea.<br>
                            Laboratory finding-----plasma bicarbonate, total carbondioxide and partial pressure of carbondioxide and PH are all low.</p>

                            <h4>Metabolic Alkalosis (Primary Bicarbonate Excess)</h4>
                            <p>Caused by :- (a) excess administration of alkali eg $\text{NaHCO}_3$, Citrate (as in transfused blood) or some anti acids. (b) excess loss of HCL from the stomach after prolonged vomiting and after gastric suction. (c) renal bicarbonate retention.<br>
                            Laboratory finding------plasma bicarbonate, dissolved carbon dioxide and partial pressure of carbondioxide , and PH are all high.</p>

                            <h4>Respiratory Acidosis (Primary Dissolved Carbonic Dioxide Excess)</h4>
                            <p>Any condition that decreases elimination of carbondioxide through the lungs results in an increase of partial pressure of carbondioxide( hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis.<br>
                            Laboratory findings:- low PH, High $[\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3]$</p>

                            <h4>Respiratory Alkalosis (Primary Dissolved Carbonic Dioxide Deficit)</h4>
                            <p>A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( hypocapnia) caused by an increase in the rate of or depth of respiration or both. Excess elimination of carbon dioxide which causes an increase in $[\text{HCO}_3^-]$ ratio and an increase in PH.<br>
                            Lab findings- PH high, $[\text{HCO}_3^-]$ is high,</p>

                            <p>An arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood test that is performed using blood from an artery. The test is used to determine the pH of the blood, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and the bicarbonate level.</p>
                            <p><strong>TEST PRINCIPLES:</strong> $\text{pH}$, $\text{pCO}_2$, and $\text{pO}_2$ are measured directly from the specimen by using electrodes. The bicarbonate ($\text{cHCO}_3^-(\text{P})_\text{c}$), total $\text{CO}_2$ ($\text{ctCO}_2(\text{P})_\text{c}$) and arterial base excess ($\text{ABE}_\text{c}$) are calculated.</p>
                            <p><strong>SPECIMEN TYPE:</strong> Heparinized Arterial blood is the specimen of choice. Capillary blood collected in heparinized tubes can also be used especially when dealing with neonates. Specimens must be placed on wet ice analyzed within 10 minutes of collection if held at room temperature or within one hour if kept at 4-8°C.</p>
