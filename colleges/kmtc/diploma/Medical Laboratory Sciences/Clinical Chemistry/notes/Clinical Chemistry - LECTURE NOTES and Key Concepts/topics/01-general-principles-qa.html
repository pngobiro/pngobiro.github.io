                            <p>This is a major discipline in the field of laboratory medicine. Clinical chemistry (also known as clinical biochemistry, chemical pathology, medical biochemistry or pure blood chemistry) is the area of pathology that is generally concerned with analysis of body fluids.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="historical-development">Historical Development</h3>
                            <p>The discipline originated in the late 19th century with the use of simple chemical tests for various components of blood and urine. Subsequently other techniques were applied including the use and measurement of enzyme activities, spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay. Most current laboratories are now highly automated and use assays that are closely monitored and quality controlled. All biochemical tests come under chemical pathology. These are performed on any kind of body fluid, but mostly on serum or plasma. Serum is the yellow watery part of blood that is left after blood has been allowed to clot and all blood cells have been removed. This is most easily done by centrifugation which packs the denser blood cells and platelets to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, leaving the liquid serum fraction resting above the packed cells. Plasma is essentially the same as serum, but is obtained by centrifuging the blood without clotting. Plasma therefore contains all of the clotting factors, including fibrinogen. A large medical laboratory will accept samples for up to about 700 different kinds of tests. Even the largest of laboratories rarely do all these tests themselves and some need to be referred to other labs.</p>
                            
                            <p>This large array of tests can be further sub-categorised into sub-specialities of:</p>

                            <p>The function of the clinical chemistry laboratory in the delivery of quality health care services is to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis on body fluids such as blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid as well as faces, tissues, calculi and other materials.</p>
                            <p>If the results have to be useful to the health provider in the diagnosis and management of various pathological disorders, the tests must be performed as accurately as possible. To achieve this goal, the instruments, reagents, analytical methods must be of good state. Qualified personnel and good infrastructure also plays an important role in achieving this goal of provision of quality laboratory results</p>
                            
                            <p>There are two important techniques used in clinical chemistry laboratory. These techniques are:</p>

                            <p>Blood for analysis may be collected from veins, arteries and capillaries. Veinuos blood is the most commonly and usually the specimen of choice and is collected by a method referred to as venipunture. In young children, skin puncture is frequently used to obtain what is predominantly capillary blood. Arterial blood is collected for blood gases analysis.</p>
                            <p>An evacuated blood tube, needle and a syringe are usually used for collection of blood specimens. Before bleeding , the phlebotomist should verify the patients identity, the patient should be seated or supine if seating is not feasible and should be in that position 20 min before the specimen is drawn. Standardization of the patients position minimizes differences in [ ] of blood constituents caused by postural variations in blood volume( hemoconcentrations).</p>
                            <p>The skin is cleaned with 70% isopropanol and allowed to dry, a tourniquet is applied (10-15) cm above the intended site of puncture so as to obstruct the return of blood to the heart band in the process distend the vein.</p>
                            <p>Items for the collection of blood are-(1) vacuatainer tube (2) tube holder (3) a needle for use with multiple tubes intended for same patient..</p>
                            <p>There are two classes of vacuatainer tubes ie those with a serum separating material and those without. Various anticoagulants and preservatives may be added to these tubes. The stopper colour denotes the type of the additives eg</p>

                            <p>Serum separator tubes contain an inert, thixotropic polymer polymer gel material with a spgr of approx. 1.04. Silica or glass particles that accelerate clotting may be associated with it. Aspiration of blood into the tube and subsequent centrifugation displaces the gel which settles like a disk between the cells and the plasma when the separation is done. RCF( relative centrifugal force) of at least 1,100 x g for gel release and barrier formation. The release of intracellular components into the serum is prevented by the barrier for several hours or some cases for several days.</p>
                            <p>Before venipunture the phlebotomist selects the appropriate tubes and needles (gauges 19-22) and they must be sterile and sharp.</p>
                            <p><strong>VENOUS OCCLUTION</strong> ----- It is rarely necessary to leave the tourniquet in place for more than 1 min . When the flow of blood in the large vein is obstructed by a tourniquet, the filtration pressure across the capillary wall is increased. This increase causes fluids and compounds with molecular weight less than 5000 mwt to pass through the capillary wall. Slight changes might occur if left for 1 min but marked changes have been observed after 3 min . EG protein will increase by 4.9 g/l, ast(9.3), total choleterol(5.1), bili(8.4), iron(6.7) and potassium (< 6.2). The composition of blood drawn first will be the most representative of the circulating blood.</p>
                            <p>Stress associated with blood collection can have affects in patients at any age. Cortisol and growth hormone concentration in plasma may increase. Particularly in young children who are frightened , struggling and held in physical restraint, collection may cause adrenal stimulation leading to an increase in plasma glucose concentration increase or increase in activities of enzymes that originate in the skeletal muscles.</p>
                            <p>Vigorous sunction on a syringe during collection or forceful transfer from the syringe to the receiving vessel may cause haemolysis of blood.</p>

                            <h4 id="skin-puncture">(B) Skin Puncture</h4>
                            <p>This is done when only a small amount of blood is required. However this procedure is time consuming and the risk of infection is higher than that of venipunture since the finger tip is more difficult to sterilize than the anticubital fossa. . Care should be taken when prick to avoid reaching the bone. The depth should be less than <strong>2.5 cm</strong>. . The finger should be held in such way that gravity assists the collection of blood on the finger tip . Massage of the finger to stimulate blood flow should be avoided. .For an infant less than 1 hear old , the lateral and medial plantar surface of the foot should be used for skin puncture. For the collection of blood on filter paper for neonatal screening, the skin is cleaned and punctured. Then the filter paper is gently touched against a very large drop of blood and allowed to soak and fill the marked area.</p>

                            <h4 id="arterial-puncture">(C) Arterial Puncture</h4>
                            <p>This procedure requires considerable skills and it is usually performed by the clinician, or specially trained nurse technician. The preferred site puncture are:- radial artery at at the wrist, brachial artery in the elbow, and femoral artery in the groin.</p>

Glucose in blood specimen without antiglycolytic agent will decrease as much as 10 mg/dl (0.56 mmol/l) per hour at 25 °C. The decrease is even more in infants due to their increased metabolic activities of rbcs and in leukemia pts due to their high metabolic activity of the leucocytes. Sodium iodoacetate at a concentration of 2 mg/ ml of blood is an effective antiglycolytic agent and a substitute for sodium fluoride . It has no effect on urease and can be used when urea and glucose are requested in the same specimen.. It inhibits only creatine kinase and has no significant effect on the other parameters.</span></li>

                            <p>Reference ranges can be constructed using two methods ie direct and indirect. Direct method involves the use of data obtained from a healthy population accessible to hospital, such as blood donors. A lot of work has been done in the production of reference ranges using direct methods. The indirect method involves the use of data obtained from patients' records. This data is used with the assumption that the majority of values come from subjects whose values are compatible with those of healthy subjects (in the sense that their values have not been altered by disease)). eg a client admitted for elective surgery.</p>

                                    <p>People live in different geographical localities of the world. These locations have many features which are different including the climatic conditions. Studies have shown that these conditions affect reference ranges. Presently, only a few clinical laboratories have established their own reference ranges, while great majority use reference ranges reported in literature eg reagent kits insert or medical books. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommends that each clinical chemistry laboratory OR laboratories within the same locality establish own reference ranges for the biochemical parameters derived from the population they serve.</p>

                                    <p>Above table demonstrates that if one region reference range is used to interpret results for another region leads to mis-interpretation=mis-diagnosis of pathological disorders.</p>

                                    <h4>INSTRUMENTS</h4>
                                    <p>Different laboratories use different types of analytical instruments. The most commonly used are based on automation and manual technique. Studies have shown that these two analytical instruments produce different results for the same individual.</p>
                                    <p>The results produced by the automated method are higher than those produced by manual methods in all parameters studied. This suggests that automation is more superior to manual methods in terms of accuracy and precision.</p>
                                    <p>Analytical methods differences are shown by the ion selective electrode methods (direct and indirect) and calorimetric methods for the analysis of potassium and sodium</p>

                                    <h4>SAMPLE TYPE</h4>
                                    <p>A parameter can be found in different concentrations depending on the sample type eg Potassium is more concentrated in whole blood than in the serum . This is due to the fact that ICF contains more potassium than the ECF. In an event that blood is allowed to stand for some time, there will be a movement of this ion from the ICF to the ECF, therefore rising the levels in ECF.</p>

                                    <h4>DIET</h4>
                                    <p>If a diet consumed has a higher concentration of eg ions, this will be reflected by individuals who constantly consume that food stuff. Bananas are known to contain a high concentrationof potassium therefore potassium of individuals who take this food stuff will have a higher level of potassium.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The vast amount of medical information, with its varying quality and ready availability, has to date made it laborious to take drug-laboratory effects into account in everyday patient care.</p>
                            <p>The prevalence of DLEs is not negligible: as many as 12% of patients have had laboratory results potentially affected by drugs in a general medical ward .</p>
                            <p>The effects of drugs on laboratory tests have been published in extensive catalogs, from which data have to be sought manually with active effort.</p>
                            <p>A modern solution for bringing this knowledge to clinical routine is computerization and automatic reminders.</p>
                            <p>Because physicians are already flooded with information, it is important to remind them only of the effects relevant for the patient in question.</p>
                            <p>This requires storing individual medications in a structured way and coding the data on DLEs in a logical way as well as building a reminder system that can be integrated into the laboratory information system (LIS) and hospital information system . Until now, there have been very few computer applications offering automatic monitoring of DLEs.</p>

On the other hand the known qc is similar to the internal QC but the results have to be sent back to the external agent for statistical analysis and interpretation .</span></li>
