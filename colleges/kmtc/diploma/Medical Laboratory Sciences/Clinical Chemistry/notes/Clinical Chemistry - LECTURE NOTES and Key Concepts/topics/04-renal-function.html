                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The functions of the kidney may be characterized as EXCRETORY, REGULATORY and ENDOCRINE.</p>

                            <h3 id="excretory-function">1) Excretory Function</h3>
                            <p>Serves to rid the body of most of the undesirable end products of metabolism as well as any excess of inorganic substances ingested in the diet. The metabolic waste products include the non-protein nitrogenous compounds (NPN) eg urea, creatinine, and uric acid, a number of other organic acids including amino acids are excreted in small quantities.</p>
                            <p>Diet contains a variable and usually excessive supply of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sulphate and bicarbonates. The dramatic efficiency of the excretory function is illustrated by sodium ie body sodium content is maintained essentially constant regardless of whether daily sodium intake is 1 or 150 mmol or more.</p>
                            <p>In order to achieve the excretion of the waste metabolic products and the ingested surpluses without disrupting homoestasis (this is the maintenance of the optimal chemical composition of the intra- and extra-cellular fluids through out the body), the kidney must exercise both its excretory and regulatory function.</p>

                            <h3 id="regulatory-function">2) Regulatory Function</h3>
                            <p>The regulatory function of the kidney plays a major role in homoestasis (this is the maintenance of the optimal chemical composition of the intra- and extra-cellular fluids through out the body). The mechanism of differential re-absorption and secretion located in the tubules of the nephron are effectors of regulation.</p>

                            <h3 id="endocrine-function">3) Endocrine Function</h3>
                            <p>The endocrine function of the kidney can be regarded as either primary or secondary. Primary because the kidney is an endocrine organ producing hormones eg Renin, Prostagladins and Erythropoeitin.</p>

The primary stimuli for rennin release are a decrease in perfusion pressure to the juxtaglomerular apparatus and negative sodium balance. Following stimulation,rennin is released in the blood where it hydrolysis its substrate called angiotensinogen (this is a globulin synthesized in the liver) to produce angiotensin I, which is then rapidly converted to angiotensin ii by the circulating angiotensin- converting enzymes that is abundant in the lung. Angiotensin ii (which is a potent vasoconstrictor) stimulates the cells of the zone glomerulosa to produce aldosterone hormone. The rennin - angiotensin system is an important regulator of blood pressure, it is also responsive to sodium and potassium concentration and regulates the aldosterone effect on sodium-potassium exchange in the distal tubule</span>

Prostaglandins are thought to play a great role in reproduction, blood pressure control and to act as mediators of inflammation. They have been reported to have many pharmacologic actions and have been used therapeutically to induce abortion via uterine smooth muscle contraction. In the kidney they have an effect on sodium concentration and increased free water clearance.</span>

                            <p>This is the functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney has approximately <strong>1 million nephrons</strong>. The nephron consists structurally of -: 1) the glomerulus ( which is a spherical epitherial space invaginated by a capillary network that connects the afferent and efferent arterioles and 2) a tubule of epithelial cells continuous with the glomerular epithelial space and ultimately leading to collecting ducts that empty into the renal pelvis</p>
                            
                            <h4>Three distinct processes take place in each nephron:-</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The blood flowing through the capillaries of the glomerulus is filtered , the filtrate passing into the tubules through the glomerular membrane =this process is called <strong>GLOMERULAR FILTRATION</strong>.

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">As the glomerular filtrate passes through the walls of the tubule, more solutes are added by secretion through the walls of the tubules from the adjoining blood vessels= This process is called <strong>TUBULAR SECRETION</strong>.</span></li>

                            <p>The end product of these three processes passes through larger collecting tubules into the ureters which carry it into the bladder , from where it is excreted through the urethra as urine. The constituent of urine are the products of glomerular filtration plus the products of tubular secretion minus constituents returned into the blood through tubular reaabsorption.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 id="formation-urine">Formation of Urine</h3>
                            <p>The FORMATION OF THE KIDNEY IS THE KEY ROLE OF THE KIDNEY. The urine formed by the kidney constitutes most of the undesirable end products of metabolism as well as any excess of inorganic substances ingested in the diet.</p>
                            
                            <h4>1) Filtration Process</h4>
                            <p>The first step in urine formation is filtration at the glomerulus of plasma water driven by a net filtration pressure of about 15 mmhg . The filtrate is referred to as ULTRAFILTRATE because its composition is essentially the same as that of that plasma, with notable absence of molecules of mwt above approximately 15,000 daltons. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons and about 170-200 litres of ultraflitrate pass through the glomeruli in 24 hours.nb/ In the passage of the glomeruli filtrate through the tubules, re-absorption of solutes and water in various regions of the tubules reduces the total volume to 0.4-2 litres per day.</p>
                            <p>The filtration of blood at the bowmans capsule is a passive process, whereby the flow of fluid from the blood depends on the fact that hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries is greater than that in the tubules lumen. Any factor that reduces the pressure gradient will lower the filtration rate.</p>

                            <h4>2) Re-absorption and Secretion (Tubular Function)</h4>
                            <p>In the tubules the solute composition of the ultrafiltrate is altered by the processes of reabsorption and secretion so that the urine excreted may have a completely different composition from that of the original filtered fluid. Different regions of the tubule have been shown to specialize in certain functions.</p>

                            <h4>Anti Diuretic Hormone (ADH) Mode of Action</h4>
                            <p>ADH determines the [ ] of urine produced. It is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary. The amount of ADH produced depends on the osmoreceptors present in the hypothalamus which are stimulated by the high plasma osmolality or low plasma volume (hypovolumea). ADH causes the pores in the collecting duct to increase in diameter permitting an increase amount of water to be osmoticaly reabsorbed into the renal medulla. The resulting urine osmolality becomes x 5 that of the plasma. - In the absence of ADH, eg in diabetic inspidus or a non response of the collecting tubules to ADH, large volumes of dilute urine results.- However, at the distal collecting ducts ADH, not only increases the permeability of the cells to water but also to urea. . This is the main reason fro the rise in urinary osmolality.</p>

                            <h3 id="clinical-syndromes">Clinical Syndromes</h3>
                            
                            <h4>End Stage Renal Failure (ESRF/ESRD)</h4>
                            <p>This is the stage where the kidney has lost entirely (>90%) its noble functions that is has failed to maintain adequate excretory, regulatory and endocrine function. This stage is characterized by the constellation of symptoms, physical signs and abnormal diagnostic studies. These characters can also be referred to as uremic syndrome. The classic signs of uremia includes:- progressive weakness and easy fatigability, hypertension, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, muscle wasting, tremors, abnormal mental function, frequent but shallow respiration and metabolic acidosis.. This syndrome progress to produce stupor, coma, and ultimately death unless support is provided by haemodialysis or successive renal transplantation..</p>

                            <h4>Acute Renal Failure (ARF)</h4>
                            <p>This clinical syndrome occurs when there has been a rapid and severe reduction of GFR OF &lt;10 ML/MIN. Patients with ARF are oliguric (reduced urine output) for example will produce &lt;400 mls of urine after fluid challage. During this oliguric state the patient is unable to excrete water and sodium, leading to expansion of ECF which results to oedema, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Another feature of ARF is that water is retained in excess of salt producing hyponatreamia (low levels of sodium in the blood). Other features seen in ARF are: retention of phosphate leading to hyperphosphotaemia and hypocalcaemia (inadequate mineralization). Accumulation of urea and creatinine is evident. When ARF is due to under perfusion (lesser blood supply to the kidney) of the kidney, BUN will accumulate in excess of creatinine ( high bun/creat ratio). Patients with ARF are at risk of getting gastrointestinal haemorrhage and systemic infection which are the major cause of death.</p>

                            <h4>Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)</h4>
                            <p>Pts who do not recover from ARF may develop CRF if early death does not occur.- CRF is the end result of a variety of many conditions such as: chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic obstructive uropathy, polycystic kidney disease, renal artery blockage and any other condition that causes tubular dysfucntion. As ARF progresses without any kind of treatment, more nephrons get damaged and the oliguric nature of the patient changes into anuric nature (total suppression of urine output) due to the fact that all the nephrons have been damaged resulting to no more urine output. All the symptoms of uremia syndrome are very prominent in patients having CRF. Inability to excrete potassium resulting with hyperkalaemia is very evident as in the case of ARF. Hypernatreamia, hperphosphotaemia and hypocalcaemia are also evident.</p>

                            <p>These are pathological factors that cause direct injury to the renal glomerulus while preserving tubular functions and may resemble pre-renal factors.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Acute Glomerulonephritis</h4>
                            <p>This pathological process is related to recent group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal infection. Other causes includes :- reactions to drugs, acute infection of the kidney, systemic disease with immune complexes deposition in the kidney such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), bacterial endocarditis and recent viral infection. This condition is characterized by the rapid onset of haematuria, proteinuria, reduced GFR, sodium and water retention resulting to oedema, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Oliguria may also be evident.</p>

                            <h4>Nephrotic Syndrome</h4>
                            <p>This pathological process is related any interference with the normal glomerular filtration processes. An established case of nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria (massive proteinuria of >3.5 g/dl), hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hyperlipidaemia. GFR is usually depressed. The loss of albumin in urine overwhelmes hepatic synthesis capacity and hypoalbuminaemia results ( &lt;3 g/dl ). Loss of intravascular onchotic pressure results in oedema which is enhanced by sodium and water retention.</p>
                            <p><strong>CAUSE OF N/S:</strong> (i) primary renal disease---most types of glomerulonephritis usually due to deposition of immune complexes (SLE) on the glomeruli. This accounts to 80% of all n/s cases. (ii) secondary renal diseases eg diabetic mellitus, amyloidosis(bilateral destruction of adrenal glands by an autoimmune disease), SLE, malaria and renal vein thrombosis. (iii) other causes are drugs and toxins.</p>

                            <p>In haemodialysis, blood is passed through an artificial kidney(DIALYZER) . This dialyzer contains a fliud (dialyzing fluid or dialysate) which consists mainly of water . The water that make this dialysate is highly purified .

                            <p>Urea is the major nitrogen containing metabolic product of protein metabolism in human. Over 90% of urea excretion is through the kidney and 10% is through the skin and gastrointestinal tract.. Urea is filtered freely by the glomerulus. A wide variety of renal diseases can cause an increase in plasma urea concentration. Unfortunately , the usefulness of urea as an independent indicator of renal function is limited by the variability of its blood levels as a result of non renal factors. The principal clinical utility of of plasma urea determination lies in its measurement conjunction with plasma creatinine.. Clinicians calculate a convenient relationship ie BUN/CREAT ratio. Normal individual on a normal diet has a ratio of 12-20.</p>
                            <p><strong>METHODS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF UREA:</strong> (1) Berthelot Reaction, (2) Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GLUDH)</p>
                            <p><strong>SPECIMEN:</strong> serum or urine is suitable for assay. plasma is also suitable provided that the anticoagulant used contains neither ammmonium nor flouride salts.</p>
                            <p><strong>REFERENCE RANGES:</strong> (2.7-8.3) mmol/L</p>

                            <h3 id="creatinine">Creatinine</h3>
                            <p>This is the spontaneous degradation product of creatine in the muscles. The formation of creatinine is reasonably constant and has a direct relationship to the body muscle mass. Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomerulus but it is not reabsorded to any appreciable extent if at all under normal circumstance. The formation and excretion of creatinine which is usually constant, makes it one of the best renal fuction test. By virtual of its relative independence of such factors as diet ,hydration and protein metabolism, plasma creatinine is significantly a more reliable screening test for renal function than blood urea nitrogen.</p>

                            <h3 id="creatinine-clearance">Creatinine Clearance (CrCL)</h3>
                            <p>This is so far one of the best clearance test to determine the clearance capability of the kidney. In essence it estimates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Creatinine is released into the circulation at a relatively constant rate and has a stable plasma concentration. Creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized by the kidney. In the management of renal diseases and monitoring of chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients, creatinine clearance is the first choice test.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Laboratory Diagnosis of CrCL</h4>
                            <p>Urine is collected over a period of 24 hrs and preserved in a container with 10 mls conc hcl, thymol or toluene. Blood specimen is collected within this 24 hrs due to its constant nature in the plasma. The following formula reffered to as standard formula is used for the calculation of CrCL for a an average adult:</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ \text{CrCL} = \frac{\text{24 hrs Urine volume(mls)} \times \text{urine creatinine (umol/l)}}{\text{Serum creatinie (umol/l)} \times 1440 \text{ min}} $$
                            </div>

                            <h4>Estimated Creatinine Clearance (Ecrcl)</h4>
                            <p>This is achieved by the use of COCKCROFT AND GAULT formula which use the following characters (factors): (a) age(yrs), (b) weight(kgs), (c) serum creatinine, (d) constants ie male(1.23, female( 1.04).</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ \text{Ecrcl} = \frac{(140-\text{AGE}) \times \text{WEIGHT(KG)} \times \text{CONSTANT}}{\text{SERUM CREATININE(UMOL/L)}} $$

                            <p><strong>(1) SODIUM -</strong> This is the major cation of the extracellular fliud, representing approximately 90% of the 154 mmol/l of inorganic cations per liter of plasma water.. Thus sodium ions are responsible for almost half the osmolality of the plasma and play a central role in maintaining the normal distribution of water and osmotic pressure in the extracellular fluid compartment. HYPONATREMIA (decreased plasma sodium cocentration) is a predictable consequence of decreased intake of sodium , particularly when low intake is complicated by unusual losses. HYPERNATREMIA( increased plasma sodium concentration) is often attributable to excessive loss of sodium poor body fluids ie to water loss disproportionate to sodium loss as may occur in profuse sweating ,vomiting and diarrhea or polyuria.</p>
