                            <p>Each month or so the inner wall of the uterus prepares for a possible pregnancy. Incase a pregnancy does not occur (as in the case throughout most months of a woman's fertile years ),the linning of the uterus must be released and a new one prepared. The breakdown of the endometrial wall and the resultant discharge of blood and endometrial tissue are known as menstruation (or menses)</p>
                            <p>The Cyclic timing of menstruation is governed by the hormones released from the pituitary and the ovaries. Girls generally have their first menstrual cycle, the onset of which is called menarche sometimes between 12-14 years of age. Body weight, nutrition, heredity, and overall health are factors related to menarche.</p>
                            <p>This cycle activity continuous until about age <strong>45-55</strong> years. The normal MC lasts for 28 days but very few women perfects 28 - day cycle. Most women fluctuates by a few days to a week around this 28 day pattern and some are extremely from this cycle. Day 1 of the cycle starts with the first day of bleeding or menstrual flow.</p>

                            <h4>(2) Menopause</h4>
                            <p>This is a condition whereby the ovulation and menstrual cycle stops. This occurs in women at the age of 45-55 years and above. If it occurs at the age less than 40 years it is regarded as immature. Menopause is a normal physiological process and not a disease condition. Other signs associated with menopause are:- hot flashes (temporary feeling of warmth caused by blood vessel dilation), vaginal wall dryness and breast changes. Ovarian function and hormonal production diminishes.</p>

                            <h4>(3) Hirsutism</h4>
                            <p>This is excess of facial and body hair in a woman. Could be caused by:- excess testosterone production which could be due to some medication or from a neoplasm in the ovaries or the adrenal glands.</p>

                            <p>This is the enlargement of the clitoris that resembles a penis (clitomegaly). Caused by excessive testosterone production. It is characterized by hair growth of male distribution, deepening of the voice and breast atrophy (no female breasts). Other causes are ovarian tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p>

                            <p>Fertility hormonal profile analysis plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of various pathological disorders that contribute to infertility in an individual. Infertility is defined as the absence of pregnancy following 12 months of unprotected intercourse. Infertility may be caused by ovulatory dysfunction, blocked fallopian tubes, male factor infertility or unexplained causes.</p>
                            <p>To investigate primary and secondary infertility that affect both male and female the following diagnostic parameters are carried out: testosterone (TESTO), prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol 2 (EII) and progesterone (PRG)</p>

                                    <p>Prolactin is a protein hormone produced in the anterior pituitary by the pituitary mammotropic cells.Its secretion is controlled by an inhibitory influence from the hypothalamus that is thought to be dopamine. It stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation). Increased serum concentrations of prolactin during pregnancy cause enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and prepare the production of milk.</p>
                                    <p>Prolactin provides the body with sexual gratification after sexual acts: The hormone counteracts the effect of dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal. This is thought to cause the sexual refractory period. Unusually high amounts are suspected to be responsible for impotence and loss of libido. Hyperprolactinemia is the most frequent abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors. Clinical signs include inappropriate lactation, lack of menses, infertility in females, and impotence in males.</p>

                                    <p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone found in humans and other animals. It is synthesized and secreted by gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland. FSH regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. FSH and Luteinizing hormone (LH) act synergistically in reproduction.</p>
                                    <p>In males, FSH stimulates maturation of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis. In females, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the concomitant rise in inhibin B, FSH levels then decline in the late follicular phase. This seems to be critical in selecting only the most advanced follicle to proceed to ovulation.</p>
                                    <p>The most common reason for high serum FSH concentration is in a female who is undergoing or has recently undergone menopause. If high FSH levels occur during the reproductive years, it is abnormal. Conditions with high FSH levels include: premature menopause, poor ovarian reserve, gonadal dysgenesis (in female) castration and testicular failure (in male).</p>

                                    <p>Luteinizing hormone is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. The release of LH at the pituitary gland is controlled by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. In females, an acute rise of LH called the LH surge triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.</p>
                                    <p>Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of both LH and FSH. While this is typical in the menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years.</p>

                                    <p>Estradiol is the predominant sex hormone present in females. It is also present in males, being produced as an active metabolic product of testosterone. It represents the major estrogen in humans. In the female, estradiol acts as a growth hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting the lining of the vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. The development of secondary sex characteristics in women is driven by estrogens, to be specific, estradiol.</p>
                                    <p>The effect of estradiol (and estrogens) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol is produced in the Sertoli cells of the testes. There is evidence that estradiol functions to prevent apoptosis of male sperm cells.</p>

                            <p>The current analytical technique employed in the analysis of all the hormones use the principle of immunochemical reaction based on an antiboby/antigen reaction. The set up of the reagent could either have the the antigen to the hormone being determined and this will react with the specific antibody (being the hormone in the specimen) in the specimen.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Analytical Principle:</h4>
                            <p>The assay principle combined an enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA))</p>

                            <h4>Analytical method:</h4>
                            <p>The SPR served as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay were ready for use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All the assay steps were performed automatically by the machine. The reaction medium was cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The sample was taken and transferred into the well containing alkaline - phosphatase labeled anti- (T4, T3, FT4, FT3, TSH, LH, PRG, FSH, PRL,, EST, TESTO) immunoglobulins (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture was cycled in and out of SPR several times to increase reaction speed. The antigens binds with the antibodies coated on the SPR and to the conjugate forming a "sandwich". Unbound components were eliminated during the washing steps of the assay.</p>
                            <p>In the final detection step, the substrate (4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) was cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product (4-methylumbelliferone). The intensity of the fluorescence was directly proportional to the antigen present in the sample.At the end of the assay, results were automatically calculated by the machine in relation to the calibration curve stored in memory and then printed out.</p>
