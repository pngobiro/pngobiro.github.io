                            <p>The liver is the largest organ inside the body and the most metabolically active. In an adult, it is about the size of a football and weighs close to three pounds. It is located behind the ribs in the upper right-hand portion of the abdomen. Shaped like a triangle, the liver is dark reddish-brown and consists of two main lobes. There are over 300 billion specialized cells in the liver that are connected by a well organized system of bile ducts and blood vessels called the biliary system.</p>

                            <p>The liver is subject to damage by a wide variety of diseases. Viruses, bacterial infections, toxins, and several forms of cancer are a few of the possible causes of liver disease. Some diseases cause very sudden and severe liver damage and others are slow and insidious. If the disease progresses slowly, symptoms of disease may not appear for many months, but the liver may be slowly destroyed. A normal liver has a lot of excess capacity. By the time signs appear in some slow moving diseases, 3/4 of the liver may already have been destroyed. On the other hand, many liver problems are mild or short lived, and the liver is very good at healing and regenerating itself once the cause of the disease is under control.</p>
                            <p>Liver disease (also called hepatic disease) is a broad term describing any single number of diseases affecting the liver. Many are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile. Some of the liver diseases includes; hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, cystic Fibrosis, cancer, wilson's disease, gilbert's disease and glycogen storage disease type II</p>

                            <p>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. The condition can be self-limiting (healing on its own) or can progress to fibrosis (scarring) and cirrhosis. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persists longer. A group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A, B, C and E) cause most cases of hepatitis worldwide, but it can also be due to toxins (notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvent and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases.</p>

                            <p>Research established a firm connection between heavy alcohol consumption and liver disease. Studies show that the amount of alcohol consumed and the duration of that consumption are closely associated with cirrhosis. The most prevalent types of alcoholic liver disease are fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Often, as people continue to drink heavily, they progress from fatty liver to hepatitis to cirrhosis. The disorders can also occur together, however, and liver biopsies can show signs of all three in some people. About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with alcoholism develop cirrhosis, but many survive it. Many are unaware that they have it, and about 30 percent to 40 percent of cirrhosis cases are discovered at autopsy.</p>

                            <p>NAFLD refers to a group of conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol. This is a chronic liver disease that affects a high proportion of the world's population. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress play a critical role in the pathogenesis. The clinical implications of NAFLD are derived mostly from its common occurence in the general population as well as its potential to progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. NAFLD affects 10-24% of the general population from different countries. The prevalence of NAFLD, however, increases significantly to 57.5-74% in obese individuals. NAFLD affects 2.6% of children 10 and this figure increases to 22.5-52.8% in the obese child population. NAFLD is the cause of asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferases in 42-90% of cases once other causes of liver disease are excluded and represents a common explanation for abnormal liver tests in blood donors. Clinical, biochemical and imaging studies are of value in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with NAFLD, but liver biopsy remains the most sensitive and specific means of providing important diagnostic and prognostic information.</p>

                            <p>Cirrhosis is a potentially life-threatening condition of the liver that refers to scarring of the liver which results in abnormal liver function as a consequence of chronic (long-term) liver injury.</p>
                            <p>This scarring replaces healthy tissue and prevents the liver from working normally. Cirrhosis usually develops after years of liver inflammation. When chronic diseases cause the liver to become permanently injured and scarred, the condition is called Cirrhosis. Cirrhosis harms the structure of the liver and blocks the flow of blood. The loss of normal liver tissue slows the processing of nutrients, hormones, drugs, and toxins by the liver. Also, the production of proteins and other substances made by the liver is suppressed.</p>
                            <p>Cirrhosis affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. In the United States, approximately 5.5 million people (2% of the U.S. population) are affected by cirrhosis. Cirrhosis causes 26,000 deaths each year and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States among adults between the ages of 25 and 64. There also is a great toll in terms of human suffering, hospital costs, and the loss of work by people with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States, chronic alcoholism is the most common cause. Cirrhosis also may result from chronic viral hepatitis (types B, C, and D and autoimmune hepatitis). Other causes of Cirrhosis include blocked bile ducts, fats in the liver (Steatohepatitis), and many inherited diseases. Prolonged exposure to environmental toxins can also lead to Cirrhosis .</p>

                            <p>Evidence of chronic liver disease is found in 25% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is the cause of liver decompensation in 2-3%. Studies suggest that approximately 20-25% of CF patients will develop liver disease but only 6-8% of these will have established cirrhosis, majority of which will present in the first 20 years of life. The marked variation in the presence and severity of disease may be due to modifier genes. Most cases are detected on routine screening and only a small proportion present with variceal bleeding, ascites or persistent jaundice. Abnormalities of liver function tests have a low sensitivity and specificity and the presence of established cirrhosis will be diagnosed on imaging</p>

                            <p>Liver cancer can refer to a variety of malignant diseases that are either primary or secondary to the liver. Primary liver cancers, which originate in the liver, include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and several other rarer forms. The liver is also a frequent site for secondary tumors that have metastasized, most frequently from colorectal, breast, or gastric cancers.</p>
                            <p>HCC comprises more than 80 percent of primary liver cancers in most countries. Concern about HCC has been growing recently due to the recognition of the magnitude of the problem in many developing countries and because of the striking increase in its incidence in the United States and other developed, western countries in recent years. The incidence of HCC has doubled over the last two decades in the United States.</p>

                            <p>Wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene, with resultant impairment of biliary excretion of copper. Subsequent copper accumulation, first in the liver but ultimately in the brain and other tissues, produces classical clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other derangements. A prevalence rate of 30 cases per million (or one per 30,000 ) and a birth incidence rate of one per 30,000 to 40,000 are often quoted. It has been estimated that there are approximately 600 cases of Wilson's disease in the United States and that approximately 1% of the population are carriers.</p>
