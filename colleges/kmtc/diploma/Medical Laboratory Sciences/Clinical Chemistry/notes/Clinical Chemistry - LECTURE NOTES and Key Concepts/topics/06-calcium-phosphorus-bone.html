                            <p>Calcium is a mineral that helps build strong bones and teeth. Calcium and phosphorus in the mineral phase of the hard tissue i.e. bone and teeth co-exist in a relatively fixed proportions. The three main regulators of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis are parathyroid hormone,vitamin D and calcitonin each exert independent effects on both ions. Intracellularly, calcium is the prime inorganic messenger for regulation of cell functions. Calcium is needed throughout an individual's life and the amount required changes over time. A lot of calcium is required during childhood years to build strong bone, a bit less during the middle years to keep bones strong, and much later in life to prevent bone loss.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Disorders of Calcium Levels</h3>
                            <p>Pathological conditions associated with calcium levels in blood are hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia. These are determined in relation to the reference ranges of calcium in a particular population.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Hypercalcemia</h4>
                            <p>Hypercalcemia is a condition of elevated levels of calcium in plasma and it is a common metabolic abnormality frequently related to primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Hypercalcaemia affects 8 in 100,000 individuals and it common between the ages 40-50 years. In relation to gender, females are more affected than males. Studies have identified hypercalcaemia as a complication in critically ill patient with adrenal insufficiency. Hypercalcemia has been reported to occur not only with primary hypoadrenalism but also with secondary hypoadrenalism .</p>
                            
                            <h4>Hypocalcemia</h4>
                            <p>Hypocalcaemia is a condition of low calcium levels in plasma. It manifests as a symptom of. Hypocalcemia is a common condition characterized by a net loss of calcium from extracellular fluid in greater quantities than can be replaced by the intestine or bone. Hypocalcemia is caused by a number of clinical entities eg a parathyroid hormone [PTH] deficiency/malfunction, a Vitamin D deficiency, or unusually high magnesium levels hypermagnesaemia, or low magnesium levels hypomagnesaemia and often presents with signs of generalized neuromuscular irritability including paresthesia, muscle cramps, laryngospasm, tetany, and seizures. Osteomalacia (adults) and rickets (children) are disease conditions encountered in hypocalcaemia and similar to hypophosphotaemia.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Phosphorus is also an abundant element in the body. At least 85% is found in the bone whilst the other 15% is found mostly combined with lipids proteins, carbohydrates and other organic substances. Most phosphorus in the extracellular fluid is inorganic. Major organs involved in phosphorus homeostasis are small intestines, kidneys and the skeleton, which acts as a storage reservoir. Phosphorus is present virtually in all foods. Consequently dietary deficiencies do not occur. Dietary intake is between 800-1000 mg for adults and is mostly from milk and other dairy product.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Disorders of Phosphorus Levels</h3>
                            <p>Pathological conditions related to phosphorus are hypophosphotaemia (reduced phosphorus levels) and hyperphosphotaemia (elevated phosphorus levels).</p>
                            
                            <h4>Hypophosphotaemia</h4>
                            <p>Hypophosphotaemia is a common condition is critically ill patient and its aetiology multifactorial. Phosphate plays an important role in the glycolysis and the production of high energy compounds such as Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Evidence of its depletion in critically ill patients may manifest itself as impairment in respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular and haematological function.</p>
                            <p>Osteomalacia (adults) and rickets (children) are caused by an inadequate supply of vitamin D leading to inadequate mineralisation of bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency is most often caused by nutritional deficiency but can be secondary to a wide range of other underlying causes, such as disorders of the gut, pancreas, liver and kidney. Vitamin D deficiency causes a low calcium and phosphate, which lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Normal bone mineralisation depends on adequate calcium and phosphate and this is maintained by vitamin D. Vitamin D is supplied either in the diet or produced from a precursor in the skin following exposure to ultraviolet light. 90% of our daily vitamin D requirement is usually obtained by the action of sunlight on the skin and 10% is obtained from the diet. It has been estimated that 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency. One study found the prevalence of rickets in non-Caucasian children to be 1.6%. In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in all adults is about 14.5% and possibly more than 30% in those over 65 years old.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Hyperphosphatemia</h4>
                            <p>Hyperphosphatemia is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an abnormally elevated level of phosphate in the blood. Often, calcium levels are lowered (hypocalcemia) due to precipitation of phosphate with the calcium in tissues. Chronic renal failure is a cause of hyperphosphotaemia whereby kidneys aren't working well, there is increased phosphate retention. Drugs can also cause hyperphosphatemia e.g taking oral sodium phosphate solutions prescribed for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children. Studies have shown the association of hyperphosphotaemia with increased mortality in patient with end stage renal disease undergoing hamodialysis. In these patients, hyperphosphotaemia causes cardiovascular calcification CVC has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and valvular heart disease.</p>

The latter is transported to the kidney by vit d binding proteins, where it undergoes further hydroxylation to either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) or 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(24,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D.</p>
                                    <p>FUNCTION: - Vit D----(1,25-(OH)2---1,25-(dihydroxyvitamin D)-is the most potent of the known metabolite of vit D . It has a rapid and powerful stimulatory action on membrane transport of calcium. When calcium mobilization is required, 1-OHase activity is stimulated and synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2 D takes place. When calcium mobilization is unnecessary or would be detrimental to the individual, 1 -hydroxylation ceases and 25-(OH)D is converted to inactive 24,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D.</p>
                                    <p>1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D has the following biological actions:</p>

                            <p>The concentration of calcium and phosphorus in plasma are determined by the balance between absorption and excretion in the kidneys, the intestine and to a small extent the skin, and by exchanges between plasma, ECF and tissues including bone.</p>
                            <p>These dynamic processes are determined by many factors , principally parathyroid hormone (PTH),calcitonin (CT) and vitamin D. The actions of these three hormones results in a remarkably precise control of the plasma calcium concentration in healthy individuals.</p>
                            <p>In the case of plasma phosphorus concentration regulation, PTH exerts a particularly important effect by inhibiting phosphate reabsorption by the kidney tubules. Therefore PTH lowers the plasma phosphorus concentration.</p>

                            <p>Is a softening of bones in children due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin D, phosphorus or calcium, potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries. The predominant cause is a vitamin D deficiency, but lack of adequate calcium in the diet may also lead to rickets (cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency). Although it can occur in adults, the majority of cases occur in children suffering from severe malnutrition, usually resulting from famine or starvation during the early stages of childhood.Osteomalacia is a similar condition occurring in adults, generally due to a deficiency of vitamin D.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Further Notes on Rickets</h4>
                            <p>Young babies with rickets can be fussy and have soft skulls. Infants and toddlers may not develop, walk, or grow well. Older children may have bone pain and bowed legs, or their wrists and knees may get wider.</p>
                            <p>The most common cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D or calcium in a child's diet. Both are essential for children to develop strong and healthy bones. Sources of vitamin D are: sunlight your skin produces vitamin D when it's exposed to the sun, and we get most of our vitamin D this way.<br>
                            To prevent rickets, make sure your child eats foods that contain vitamin D naturally - fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, fish oil and egg yolks - or that have been fortified with vitamin D, such as: Infant formula. Cereal.<br>
                            Vitamin D deficiency rickets among breastfed infants is rare, but it can occur if an infant does not receive additional vitamin D from foods, a vitamin D supplement, or adequate exposure to sunlight.<br>
                            Symptoms of hypocalcemia depend on how low the baby's calcium is and how fast the drop happened.</p>

Increased levels of magnesium (hypermagnesaemia) have been observed in dehydration, severe diabetic acidosis and Addison's disease. Conditions that interfere with glomerular filtration .e.g., renal failure, result in retention of magnesium and hence elevation of plasma levels.</p>
