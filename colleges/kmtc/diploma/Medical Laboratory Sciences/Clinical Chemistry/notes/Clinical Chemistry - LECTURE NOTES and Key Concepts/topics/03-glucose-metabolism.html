                            <p>Glucose is the end product of carbohydrate metabolism. It is a simple sugar that provides energy to all cells in human body (some cells, like brain cells and red blood cells, rely solely on glucose for fuel). Human body tries to keep a constant supply of glucose for the cells by maintaining a constant concentration otherwise the cells would have more than enough glucose supply right after meal and starve in between meals and overnight. The body responds to oversupply of glucose by storing the excess in the liver and the muscles in form of glycogen. When glucose is in short supply, the body mobilizes glucose from stored glycogen and this is the key to maintain a constant blood-glucose level. To maintain a constant blood-glucose level, the body relies on two hormones produced in the pancreas that have opposite actions: insulin and glucagon.</p>

                            <p>Insulin is made and secreted by the beta cells of the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans), small islands of endocrine cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a protein hormone that contains 51 amino acids. It is required by almost all of the body's cells, since it enhances glucose entry into these cells. Liver cells, fat cells and muscle cells are considered as the major target cells for insulin where it does the following:</p>

                            <p>As such, insulin stores nutrients right after a meal by reducing the concentrations of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids in the bloodstream</p>

                            <h3 id="glucagon">Glucagon</h3>
                            <p>Glucagon is another protein hormone that is made and secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans). Glucagon acts on the same cells as insulin, but has the opposite effects:</p>

                            <p>Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose concentration) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels</p>
                            <p>Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="diabetes-prevalence">Prevalence and Statistics</h3>
                            <p>The incidence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly growing in the world. In 2000, an estimated 177 million people suffered from this chronic disease, which, by the end of 2006, had increased to 230 million, representing 6% of the world population. Of this number, 80% is found in the developing world It is estimated that, during the next 35 years, diabetic world-wide prevalence will reach 25%, with India being the hardest hit. Approximately, 7.1 million Africans were said to be suffering from diabetes at the end of 2000, a figure that is expected to rise to 18.6 million by 2030 Data from the Ministry of Health in Kenya indicated that, of all humans living in Africa, an estimated 1.2 million Kenyans live with diabetes, and if the trend continues, by 2025 that number is expected to rise to 1.5 million</p>

                            <h3 id="classification-dm">Classification of Diabetes Mellitus</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Juvenile Diabetes or Insulin-Dependent Diabetes)</h4>
                            <p>Diabetes is classified into three types: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Type 1 (juvenile diabetes or insulindependent diabetes) is caused by a lack of insulin. This type is found in five percent to 10 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in children or adolescents. Type 1 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and little or no insulin in their blood. In Type 1 diabetics, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are destroyed, possibly by the person's own immune system, genetic or environmental factors. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is relatively rare in sub-Saharan Africans, especially in young children - the peak age of onset is about a decade older than in white Europeans Although data are limited, available information indicates that the prognosis in T1DM is poor in Africa, as a result of both acute and long-term complications.</p>

                            <h4>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adult-Onset Diabetes or Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes)</h4>
                            <p>Type 2 (adult-onset diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the body does not respond or can't use its own insulin (insulin resistance). Type 2 occurs in 90 percent to 95 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in adults over the age of 40 years, most often between the ages of 50 years and 60 years. Traditionally considered a disease of adults, type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel to rising obesity rates due to alterations in dietary patterns as well as in life styles during childhood There is also a strong inheritable genetic connection in type 2diabetes: having relatives (especially first degree) with type 2 increases risks of developing type 2diabetes very substantially.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Genetics and Environmental Factors:</strong><br>
                            Genes significantly associated with developing type 2 diabetes, include TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX, KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), encodes the islet ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir6.2, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) regulates proglucagon gene expression and thus the production of glucagon-like peptide-1.</p>
                            <p>Type 2 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and higher than normal levels of insulin in their blood. In Type 2 diabetics, the insulin resistance is linked to obesity, but it is not know exactly how this occurs. Some studies suggest that the number of insulin receptors on liver, fat and muscle cells is reduced, while others suggest that the intracellular pathways activated by insulin in these cells are altered</p>

                            <h4>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)</h4>
                            <p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can occur in some pregnant women and is similar to Type 2 diabetes mellitus.GDM has also been defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, to differentiate it from pre-diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in women that get pregnant. Pregnancy is a diabetogenic condition characterized by insulin resistance with a compensatory increase in beta-cell response and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin resistance usually begins in the second trimester and progresses throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. Insulin sensitivity is reduced by as much as 80%</p>

                            <h4>Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)</h4>
                            <p>Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. Patients with IFG and/or IGT are now referred to as having "pre-diabetes" indicating the relatively high risk for development of diabetes in these patients. IFG and IGT are associated with the metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia of the high-triglyceride and/or low-HDL type, and hypertension.</p>

                            <h4>Previous Abnormality of Glucose Tolerance</h4>
                            <p>Previous abnormality of glucose tolerance is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals known to have had an abnormality of glucose tolerance at one time but have been shown to have normal results on repeat testing. Someone who had Type 2 diabetes mellitus, was obese, not treated with insulin, and after weight reduction had a normal glucose tolerance test falls under this category</p>

                            <h4>Potential Abnormality of Glucose Tolerance</h4>
                            <p>Potential abnormality of glucose tolerance is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals who are at greater than average theoretical risk for later development of diabetes mellitus. Identical twin of a patient with type 2 diabetes or a child of parents who each had type 2 diabetes falls under this category</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Hypoglycæmia is the medical term for a state produced by a lower than normal level of blood glucose. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects but the principal problems arise from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, resulting in impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from vaguely "feeling bad" to seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage or death.</p>
                            <p>The most common forms of hypoglycemia occur as a complication of treatment of diabetes mellitus with insulin or oral medications. Hypoglycemia is less common in non-diabetic persons, but can occur at any age, from many causes. Among the causes are excessive insulin produced in the body (hyperinsulinemia), inborn errors of metabolism, medications and poisons, alcohol, hormone deficiencies, prolonged starvation, alterations of metabolism associated with infection, and organ failure.</p>
                            <p>Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below the lower reference value in many people. Hormonal defense mechanisms (adrenaline and glucagon) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about (3.0 mmol/l) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and dysphoria. Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below (2.2 mmol/l), and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 3 mmol/l in the morning without apparent effects.</p>

                            <p>Clinical laboratory investigation plays a great role in the diagnosis of either hyperglycaemic or hypoglycaemic status of an individual. Laboratory diagnostic profile tools that forms part of ones glucose status diagnosis are:-fasting blood glucose (FBG), random blood glucose (RBG), oral glucose screening test (OGST) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</p>

                            <h3 id="fbg">Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG)</h3>
                            <p>The success of FBG requires that an individual abstains or refrains from food of any kind overnight or any other period except water; and for purposes of confirming, fasting should take a minimum of 8 hours overnight. It is a reliable simple test preferred by many health workers. Fasting as a matter of principle triggers the pancreas to release glucagon that will control the liver to start digesting its stored product glycogen into glucose for use in energy production during the night. The sequence of events is dynamic; the same pancreas will respond on short notice, by releasing insulin to manage any excesses of glucose and level it up</p>

                            <h3 id="rbg">Random Blood Glucose (RBG)</h3>
                            <p>Measurement of random blood glucose has the advantage that it can be undertaken at any time of the day, does not require a veni-puncture. In the early detection of diabetes type 2, RBG has been found to have a higher sensitivity (75%) than either FBG (50%) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (16.7%). However, RBG has a lower specificity (88%) in the detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus than either either FBG (95%) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (98.9%)</p>

                            <h3 id="sgct">Screening Glucose Challenge Test (SGCT)</h3>
                            <p>SGCT (sometimes called the O'Sullivan test) is a test performed under the two approaches recommended for the screening of GDM. Universal screening involves giving a drinking a solution containing 50 grams of glucose to non-fasting pregnant woman and blood glucose levels determined 1 hour later. Women with a 1 -hour glucose level >7.8 mmol/L are referred for a diagnostic OGTT.</p>

                            <h3 id="ogtt">Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</h3>
                            <p>This is the gold standard for the diagnosis diabetes, insulin resistance, and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism according to WHO and ADA. Usually the OGTT is performed in the morning as glucose tolerance can exhibit a diurnal rhythm with a significant decrease in the afternoon. The patient is instructed to fast (water is allowed) for 8-12 hours prior to the tests. During the three previous days the subject must have an unrestricted diet and unlimited physical activity. The subject should remain seated during the test and should not smoke throughout the test. Fasting blood glucose level of the subject is tested and should be within the laboratory FBG reference range. The test involves drinking a solution containing a certain amount of glucose (pregnant women (100 gm), adults (75 gm) and children (1 gm/1 kg body weight) within five minutes and drawing blood to measure glucose levels at the start and on set time intervals thereafter. Current studies have established that a single OGTT can over estimate the diagnosis of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore it is important to carryout at least two OGTT to make proper diagnosis</p>

                            <h3 id="ppgt">Postprandial Glucose Test (PPGT)</h3>
                            <p>Two hours postprandial blood sugar measures blood glucose exactly 2 hours after eating a meal which acts as a glucose challenge to the body's metabolism. By this point blood sugar has usually gone back down in healthy people, but it may still be elevated in people with diabetes. Thus, it serves as a test of whether a person may have diabetes, or of whether a person who has diabetes is successfully controlling their blood sugar. A fasting blood sugar (FBS) is done before the 2 hr PPG. It is an easily performed screening test for diabetes mellitus.</p>

                            <p>Instructions were given to the client to avoid any other meal after super. The procedure for oral glucose tolerance test involved testing the fasting blood glucose using capillary blood obtained by a finger prick. The client is requested to submit a random urine specimen, which is used to investigate any presence of glycosuria. Client to be considered to proceed with the test must have urine showing negative for glucosuria.. Pure glucose depending on age and status of the client is given as follows:- children (1 gm per 1 kg body weight, adult men and adult non expectant women( 75 gms ) and expectant women( 100 gms ). is weighed and dissolved in a glass of water and the subject consumed this glucose solution marking the start of the procedure. A period of 5 minutes is allowed for the consumption of the glucose solution. Citric acid is provided to prevent nausea. Blood glucose level is tested by using capillary blood obtained through a finger prick after every 30 minutes for two hours and a half client is required to void urine after every one hour during the period of the procedure. The results are recorded in OGTT chart.</p>

                            <p>Glycosylated hemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c; sometimes also HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. It is formed in a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose. Glycosylated hemoglobin measures the percentage of hemoglobin bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is a protein found in every red blood cell. As hemoglobin and glucose are together in the red blood cell, the glucose gradually binds to the A1c form of hemoglobin in a process called glycosylation. The amount bound reflects how much glucose has been in the blood during the past average 120-day lifespan of red cells.</p>
                            <p>Measuring glycosolated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation. The $HbA_{1c}$ level is proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous four weeks to three months.</p>

                                <p><strong>STEP ONE:</strong><br>
                                Mwt of glucose ($\mathrm{C}_{6}\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_{6}$) = 180 gms<br>
                                180 gms = 180,000 mgs</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>STEP TWO:</strong><br>
                                One molar glucose solution is made by dissolving one mole(180,000mgs)glucose in one litre of water. Therefore:<br>
                                180,000 mgs in 1 L = 1 M OR 180000 mg in 1000 mls = 1 M<br>
                                1 M = 1000 mmols<br>
                                1000 mmols = 180000 mgs/L<br>
                                $1 \mathrm{mmol} = 1 \mathrm{mmol} / 1000 \mathrm{mmmol} \times 180000 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$<br>
                                $1 \mathrm{mmol} = 180 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>STEP THREE:</strong><br>
                                $1 \mathrm{mmol} = 180 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$<br>
                                $1 \mathrm{L} = 10 \mathrm{dL}$<br>
                                Therefore 180 mgs are in 10 dl , how many mgs are in a dl?<br>
                                180 mgs = 10 dl<br>
                                $1 \mathrm{dl} = 1 / 10 \times 180 \mathrm{mgs} = 18 \mathrm{mgs}$<br>
                                1 dl has 18 mgs = 18 mgs/dl<br>
                                Then $1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L} = 18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}$</p>

                                $198 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl} = 198 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl} / 18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl} \times 1 \mathrm{mmmol} / \mathrm{l} = 11 \mathrm{mmol} /$</p>
