\section*{INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL CHEMISTRY}

This is a major discipline in the field of laboratory medicine. Clinical chemistry (also known as clinical biochemistry, chemical pathology, medical biochemistry or pure blood chemistry) is the area of pathology that is generally concerned with analysis of body fluids.

\section*{HISTOLICAL DEVELOPMENT}

The discipline originated in the late 19th century with the use of simple chemical tests for various components of blood and urine. Subsequently other techniques were applied including the use and measurement of enzyme activities, spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay. Most current laboratories are now highly automated and use assays that are closely monitored and quality controlled. All biochemical tests come under chemical pathology. These are performed on any kind of body fluid, but mostly on serum or plasma. Serum is the yellow watery part of blood that is left after blood has been allowed to clot and all blood
cells have been removed. This is most easily done by centrifugation which packs the denser blood cells and platelets to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, leaving the liquid serum fraction resting above the packed cells. Plasma is essentially the same as serum, but is obtained by centrifuging the blood without clotting. Plasma therefore contains all of the clotting factors, including fibrinogen. A large medical laboratory will accept samples for up to about 700 different kinds of tests. Even the largest of laboratories rarely do all these tests themselves and some need to be referred to other labs.

This large array of tests can be further sub-categorised into sub-specialities of:
- General or routine chemistry
- Endocrinology - the study of hormones
- Immunology - the study of the immune system and antibodies
- Pharmacology or Toxicology - the study of drugs

\section*{CLINICAL CHEMISTRY GOALS}

1-diagnosis of pathological disorder using either qualitative and quantitative analysis using appropriate measurements and examinations

2- Indicate the order in which such measurements and examinations should be requested
3-confirmation of clinical impression,
4-provide therapeutic guideline for the purpose of treatment.
5-to carryout a comprehensive follow up on the disease management
6-determination of disease prognosis
7-provide necessary skills through training of the laboratory personnel
-
8 Interpret and translate laboratory measurements and examinations.
9- Recognize pitfalls, problems, and limitations of laboratory data,
10- Understand pathophysiology or sequence of disease as reflected by clinical chemistry data.
11-Appreciate and understand the importance of laboratory organization and management for efficient and cost - effective medical care delivery.
12- Be part of the medical team that constitute the working structure of medical with the ultimate goal of solving medical problems.

\section*{GENERAL LABORATORY TECHNIQUES}

\section*{GENERAL LABORATORY TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

The function of the clinical chemistry laboratory in the delivery of quality health care services is to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis on body fluids such as blood, urine, cerebral spinal fluid as well as faces, tissues, calculi and other materials.
- If the results have to be useful to the health provider in the diagnosis and management of various pathological disorders, the tests must be performed as accurately as possible. To achieve this goal, the instruments, reagents, analytical methods must be of good state. Qualified personnel and good infrastructure also plays an important role in achieving this goal of provision of quality laboratory results

\section*{(A) ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES IN CLINICAL CHEMISTRY}
-There are two important techniques used in clinical chemistry laboratory. These techniques are:
(1) QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
(2) QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

\section*{(1) QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS}
- This is a technique of analysis which is based on detecting the presence or absence of an analyte in a sample/specimen.
- The results of qualitative analysis are given as either POSITIVE (indicates presence of an analyte) or NEGATIVE (indicates absence of an analyte).
- Dry chemistry which involves the use of reagent strips is widely used in this technique.
- The constituent reagents used for a specific analyte are immobilized on the reagent strip and can be used directly by the health provider or indeed by bthe patients themselves.
- Comparatively the reagents strips are expensive but easy to handle and usually gives results in a very short time. That is they are very fast.
- Among the most commonly employed reagents strips are those designed to detect glucose in body fluids. The wafer thin plastic strips contain a narrow pad at one end, to which the sample is applied. The sample material diffuses inwards into the body of the pad which houses the appropriate diagnostic reagents.
- The reagents strips are designed such that one of the products is a chromogen thus coloured.
- Most systems are based on visual examination of any colour development on the pad after the sample has been applied. The intensity of the colour produced reflects the concentration of the metabolite in the sample applied.
- These reagent strips are also widely used in routine examination of urine for the detection of the presence or absence of proteins, bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, nitrites etc.

\section*{(2) QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS}
- This is the type of a technique which is based on determination of the actual concentration of an analyte in a sample.
- The results are given as a concentration followed by the unit of measure $\mathrm{eg} \times \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}, \mathrm{x} \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}, \mathrm{xg} / \mathrm{l}, \mathrm{xg} / \mathrm{dl}, \mathrm{xg} \%, \mathrm{x} \mu \mathrm{iu} / \mathrm{ml}, \mathrm{x} \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{l}$ etc.
- The procedures used in quantitative analysis can either be wet or dry chemistry. Wet chemistry procedures involve reactions whereby the participating reactants reacts with each other in a certain ratio.
- Currently there are other procedures in dry chemistry that give the actual concentration of an analyte under investigation.
- The reagents used in wet chemistry procedures are comparatively less expensive.
- Several instruments are involved in wet chemistry analysis eg simple calorimeters, spectrophotometers, automated chemistry analyzers, flame photometer.

\section*{REQUIREMENTS FOR A LABORATORY PROCEDURE(test)}
(1) SPECIMEN from the client-----A trained personell is supposed to collect the correct specimen from a client. Sometimes, a client is explained on how to collect the specimen by him/herself and deliver this specimen to the laboratory
(2) Reagent---Any procedure carried out in the laboratory must make use of the reagents/set of reagents.The reagents contains the molecules that react with the analyte in the specimen
(3) Equipment-This is the tool used for analyzing.It is the tool that contain the a vessel where the reaction between the sample and reagents takes place. It is also the avenue used for the generation of results.
(4) Standard operating procedure---This includes all the steps used in the process of collection of specimen, reaction phase and generation of results.
(5) Space---laboratory---This is the environment for carrying out the tests. The conditions in the environment must be conducive for testing to be performed
(6) Request form---This is what a health provider use to inform the technician what is supposed to be tested in a client
(7) Technician---This is a qualified trained personell who performs the test in the laboratory using all the facilities provided in the laboratory.

\section*{A REQUEST FORM}

DEFINATION: This is what a health provider use to inform the technician what is supposed to be tested in a client
- The health provider is guided by the clinical impression that the client presents.
* The symptoms enables the health provider to suspect the conditions that is in consistence with the symptoms presented by the client
- The health provider orders relevant tests which will lead to the confirmation of the clinical impression of the client
- The request form will contain the following characteristics:

✓ The name of the client for identification purposes
✓ The date when the request was made
✓ The address of the client/the clinic where the client is sent from
✓ The urgency of the test being requested for
✓ The type of specimen to be collected from the client
✓ Time when the request was made
✓ The name of the person requesting for the test
✓ The signature of the person requesting for the test
✓ Brief clinical history based on the impression presented by the client-----This will enable the technician to make proper conclusions in relation to the results generated.

✓ The request form should be neat and never soiled with the specimen
✓ The requester should ensure that the writing is legible enough to avoid mistakes.

\section*{(B) SOLUTIONS PREPARETIONS AND DILUTIONS PROCEDURES}

\section*{(B1) SOLUTIONS}
- Solutions are made of solutes and solvents.
- The concentration of a solvent in a solution may be expressed in different ways. Traditionally, in clinical chemistry concentration has most often been expressed as mass of a solute per volume of solution ( ie mass concentration)
- The system international (SI) recommends the use whenever possible of moles of solute per volume of solution (ie substance concentration), and the use of a litre as the reference volume.
- Atomic weights of elements are always considered whenever such reagents solutions are being prepared.

\section*{EXAMPLES}
(1) How many grams of NaCL are required to make 1 litre of 0.05 M NaCL solution?
(mwt: sodium $=23$, chloride $=35.5$ )
$$23+35.5=58.5 \mathrm{gms}$$
58.5 g dissolved in a litre of distilled water $=1$ molar solution of NaCL
$$\begin{aligned}
58.5 \mathrm{G} & =1 \mathrm{M} \\
? \quad & =0.05 \mathrm{M}
\end{aligned}$$
$$0.05 \mathrm{M} / 1 \mathrm{M} \times 58.5 \mathrm{G}=2.925 \mathrm{G} \mathrm{NaCL}$$
(2) How many grams of NaCL are required to make 1500 ml of 2 M NaCL
$1 \mathrm{M}=58.5 \mathrm{~g}$ dissolved in $(1 \mathrm{~L}) 1000 \mathrm{ml}$
$2 \mathrm{M}=58.5 \mathrm{~g} \times 2=117 \mathrm{~g}$ dissolved in a liter $(1000 \mathrm{ml})$
$1500 \mathrm{ml}=1.5 \mathrm{~L}$
$117 \mathrm{~g}=1 \mathrm{~L}$
$?=1.5 \mathrm{~L}$
$1.5 \mathrm{~L} / 1 \mathrm{~L} \times 117 \mathrm{~g}$
$=175.5 \mathrm{~g}$ of NaCL

\section*{(B2) DILUTIONS}
- Dilutions involve adding more solvent to a given solution. For instance: A 1:10 dilution results when 1 volume of a given solution is diluted to a total volume of 10 with solvent. Generally it would be acceptable to add 9 volumes of a solvent to obtain a total volume of 10 . The concentration of the solute in the final solution then is $1 / 10$ of its [ ] in the original solution
- If two successive 1:10 dilutions are carried out, the [ ] of the final sol. is $1 / 10 \times 1 / 10=1 / 100$ times the [ ] of the original solution.
- It is useful to carryout successive dilutions not only to avoid diluting very small volumes (which are difficult to measure accurately), but also to avoid diluting into large volumes ( which require large containers and excessive amount of solvent) eg

1;5000 ( 1 in 5000) dilution can be carried out by successive 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions
( 1 ml of the original solution diluted to 50 ml , then 1 ml of this solution diluted to 100 ml ), rather than a straight 1:5000 dilution, which would require a 5 litre container and nearly $5,000 \mathrm{ml}$ (5litres) of solvent if 1 ml of the original solution were taken for this solution.

\section*{A DILUTION FORMULA}
- Consider that a solution designated as A is diluted to give a solution B . If volume $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ of solution A is diluted to give volume $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}$ of solution B and the concentrations of solutions A and B are $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{B}}$ respectively, then the following very useful relationship is true whenever the same volume and [ ] units are used for both.
$$V_{A} \times C_{A}=V_{B} \times C_{B}$$

This formula is derived from the fact that the amount of solute in a volume $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the same as the amount of solute in volume $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}$. The amount is equal to the [ ] times the volume in each case , that is :
Amount of solute in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} \times \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{A}}$
Amount of solute in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}} \times \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{B}}$

\section*{Example}

What would be the final concentration of a NaCL solution if 10 mls distilled water is added to 10 mls of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml} \mathrm{NaCL}$ solution
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} \times \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{A}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}} \times \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{B}}$
$10 \mathrm{ml} \times 2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}=20 \mathrm{ml} \times \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{B}}$
$1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}=\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{B}}$

\section*{FACTORS CONSIDERED IN CHOOSING THE BEST INSTRUMENT (EQUIPMENT) FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES}
- Selection of the instrument is governed by the type of the tests being carried out in a specific laboratory.
- The choice of instrument is governed by the number of tests analyzed in a specific laboratory.
- The reliability and safety of the instrument must be assured.
- The laboratory should have enough space for the placement of the instrument.
-The cost of the instrument should be considered and the laboratory should source for funds to purchase the instrument.
- The climatic conditions of the country of origin and the country of use should be considered. This will take care of any variation that might be there that can affect the overall working of the instrument.
- The warranty period of the instrument should be well understood and signed by the buyer and the seller.
- Availability of spare parts must be assured. It has to be stated clearly whether they are locally available or have to be imported.
- During the acquisition of the instrument the buyer should ensure that the following are provided by the seller : (a) parts manual (b) operators manual (c) service manual
- Staff training on how to operate the instrument is important. This enables the staff to familiarize themselves with the instrument. The training can be organized locally or from the instruments country of origin.
- Operation procedures and instruments maintenance (periodical-daily,weekly or monthly) must be emphazised during the training.

\section*{SPECIMEN COLLECTION ,HANDLING AND PROCESSING}
-Health providers use laboratory test results to diagonize pathological disorders, to evaluate its severity, to monitor its progress or response to treatment and to screen for disease in the healthy individuals.
- Many factors besides disease affect the composition of the body fluids, these factors are pre-analytical based whilest those that affect the quality of result produced by a laboratory may be analytical or post analytical based.
- The variability of test results due to biological factors is often greater than the analytical factors and the control of these biological factors should begin with proper preparation of the client/ patient prior to specimen collection.

\section*{PRE-ANALYTICAL ERRORS}

NB/ These errors are known to occur before the specimen reaches the analytical area. They include:-
(a) Specimen from the wrong patient
(b) Incorrectly labeled bottles
(c) Blood taken from a vein close to intravenous infusion
(d) Prolonged venous occlusion of the upper arm
(e) Transferring blood from one tube to another, eg, EDTA to heparin to make up for a shortfall.
(f) Haemolysis of blood specimens
(g) Delay in a blood specimen reaching the laboratory
(h) In function tests a common source of error is the failure to empty the bladder completely or an incomplete or inaccurately timed collection of urine or faeces.
(i) Some drugs may interfere with certain analysis. If this is suspected the laboratory should be informed immediately.
(j) Failure of the requesting person to give a brief history about the patients illness.

\section*{ANALYTICAL ERRORS}

NB/ These errors are known to be contributed by the laboratory personnel.
They include:-
(a) Use of wrong analytical procedure
(b) Failure to calibrate the test
(c) failure to run a QC specimen
(d) Use of wrong specimen
(e) Use of a faulty equipment
(f) Failure to observe the incubation temperature where appropriate
(g) Wrong calculation of test results . Use of inappropriate formula
(h) Use of incorrect volumes for the sample and reagents.

\section*{POST-ANALYTICAL ERRORS}

NB/ These errors can originate from the laboratory or other sections of the health facility. They include:
(a) Transposition (interchanging) of results ie giving the patient the wrong results.
(b) Use of the incorrect units of measure
(c) Errors can arise when results are given by telephone. Results should always be read back to check them.
(d) Delay to dispatch results to the intended destination on time.
(e) Incorrect interpretation of laboratory results due to the use of wrong reference values.

\section*{SPECIMEN COLLECTION}

\section*{(A) BLOOD.}

Blood for analysis may be collected from veins, arteries and capillaries. Veinuos blood is the most commonly and usually the specimen of choice and is collected by a method referred to as venipunture. In young children, skin puncture is frequently used to obtain what is predominantly capillary blood. Arterial blood is collected for blood gases analysis.
An evacuated blood tube, needle and a syringe are usually used for collection of blood specimens. Before bleeding , the phlebotomist should verify the patients identity, the patient should be seated or supine if seating is not feasible and should be in that position 20 min before the specimen is drawn. Standardization of the patients position minimizes differences in [ ] of blood constituents caused by postural variations in blood volume( hemoconcentrations).
-The skin is cleaned with $70 \%$ isopropanol and allowed to dry, a tourniquet is applied $(10-15) \mathrm{cm}$ above the intended site of puncture so as to obstruct the return of blood to the heart band in the process distend the vein.
- Items for the collection of blood are-(1) vacuatainer tube (2) tube holder (3) a needle for use with multiple tubes intended for same patient..
- There are two classes of vacuatainer tubes ie those with a serum separating material and those without. Various anticoagulants and preservatives may be added to these tubes. The stopper colour denotes the type of the additives eg

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline COLOUR & USE & ADDITIVES \\
\hline Gray & Plasma, whole blood (glycolysis inhibitor) & Fluoride( $\mathrm{Na}+$ ), oxalate ( $\mathrm{Na}+, \mathrm{K}+$ ) or iodoacetate (NA+) \\
\hline Yellow & Sterile & None \\
\hline Green & Plasma ,whole blood & Heparin ( $\mathrm{Na}+$, Li or NH4) \\
\hline Red & serum & None \\
\hline Blue & Plasma or whole blood & Citrate ( $\mathrm{Na}+$ ) \\
\hline Lavender & Plasma or whole blood & EDTA \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Serum separator tubes contain an inert, thixotropic polymer polymer gel material with a spgr of approx. 1.04. Silica or glass particles that accelerate clotting may be associated with it. Aspiration of blood into the tube and subsequent centrifugation displaces the gel which settles like a disk between the cells and the plasma when the separation is done. RCF( relative centrifugal force) of at least $1,100 \times \mathrm{g}$ for gel release and barrier formation. The release of intracellular components into the serum is prevented by the barrier for several hours or some cases for several days.
Before venipunture the phlebotomist selects the appropriate tubes and needles (gauges 19-22) and they must be sterile and sharp.
-VENOUS OCCLUTION ----- It is rarely necessary to leave the tourniquet in place for more than 1 min . When the flow of blood in the large vein is obstructed by a tourniquet, the filtration pressure across the capillary wall is increased. This increase
causes fluids and compounds with molecular weight less than 5000 mwt to pass through the capillary wall. Slight changes might occur if left for 1 min but marked changes have been observed after 3 min . EG protein will increase by $4.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$, ast(9.3), total choleterol(5.1), bili(8.4), iron(6.7) and potassium (< 6.2). The composition of blood drawn first will be the most representative of the circulating blood.
- Stress associated with blood collection can have affects in patients at any age. Cortisol and growth hormone concentration in plasma may increase. Particularly in young children who are frightened , struggling and held in physical restraint, collection may cause adrenal stimulation leading to an increase in plasma glucose concentration increase or increase in activities of enzymes that originate in the skeletal muscles.
- Vigorous sunction on a syringe during collection or forceful transfer from the syringe to the receiving vessel may cause haemolysis of blood.

\section*{(B) SKIN PUNCTURE}

This is done when only a small amount of blood is required. However this procedure is time consuming and the risk of infection is higher than that of venipunture since the finger tip is more difficult to sterilize than the anticubital fossa. . Care should be taken when prick to avoid reaching the bone. The depth should be less than
$\mathbf{2 . 5 ~ c m}$. . The finger should be held in such way that gravity assists the collection of blood on the finger tip . Massage of the finger to stimulate blood flow should be avoided. .For an infant less than 1 hear old , the lateral and medial plantar surface of the foot should be used for skin puncture. For the collection of blood on filter paper for neonatal screening, the skin is cleaned and punctured. Then the filter paper is gently touched against a very large drop of blood and allowed to soak and fill the marked area.

\section*{(C) ARTERIAL PUNCTURE}

This procedure requires considerable skills and it is usually performed by the clinician, or specially trained nurse technician. The preferred site puncture are:- radial artery at at the wrist, brachial artery in the elbow, and femoral artery in the groin.

\section*{ANTI COAGULANT AND PRESERVATIVES FOR BLOOD}
-If whole blood or plasma is required for analysis, an anticoagulant must be added to the specimen during collection time.
- Whole blood is rarely required for clinical chemistry tests, only for blood gases, lactate and glycosylated haemoglobin. Serum from coagulated blood is the choice for many analytes
- The use of plasma is usually required for emergency cases since the blood has to wait for $15-30 \mathrm{~min}$ for completion of coagulation before centrifugation.
- The other advantage is that plasma yield from a given volume of whole blood is always greater than the yield of serum.
- The only disadvantage is the formation of fibrous clots or fragments during plasma storage and subsequent risk of clogging the sample probe of autoanalyzer.
-HEPARIN-----is the most widely used anticoagulant for clinical chemical tests and causes least interferences . It acts by preventing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and thus the formation of fibrous fibrinogen. Types of heparin anticoagulant are ammonium and lithium heparin .
- ETHYLENEDIAMINE TETRA-ACETIC ACID (EDTA)---- This is a chelating agent and in concentration of $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of blood. It is used for haematological examination since it preserves cellular components of blood. It is used as disodium or dipotassium salt and the later is more soluble. It prevents coagulation by binding calcium , which is essential for the clotting process.. In clinical chemistry is used to collect blood for GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) analysis.
- SODIUM FLUORIDE--- This is the best preservative of blood glucose, together with an anticoagulant such as potassium, sodium, ammonium or lithium oxalate, . It also acts as a weak anticoagulant. It exerts its preservative action by inhibiting the enzyme system involved in glycolysis. It is also an inhibitor of urease and many other enzymes. Glucose in blood specimen without antiglycolytic agent will decrease as much as $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}(0.56 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l})$ per hour at $25{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The decrease is even more in infants due to their increased metabolic activities of rbcs and in leukemia pts due to their high metabolic activity of the leucocytes. Sodium iodoacetate at a concentration of $2 \mathrm{mg} /$ ml of blood is an effective antiglycolytic agent and a substitute for sodium fluoride . It has no effect on urease and can be used when urea and glucose are requested in the same specimen.. It inhibits only creatine kinase and has no significant effect on the other parameters.

\section*{HAEMOLYSIS}

This is the breakdown of rbcs. Serum or plasma shows haemolysis when the [hb] exceeds $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. Slight haemolysis has little effect on most of the values. Severe haemolysis causes a slight dilutional effect on the constituent present at a lower concentration in the rbcs than in the plasma. However a marked effect may be obtained on those constituents that are present at a higher concentration in the erythrocytes than in the plasma. Eg potassium, alp, ldh, mg, aldolase and INpo4 . IF an electrophoresis is done on an heamolized specimen, an additional band due to hb appears $=$ fibrinogen band..

\section*{CAUSES OF HAEMOLYSIS}
- use of wet blood containers.
- Excess preservative
- Pushing through the neddle when transferring it from the syringes into blood container.
- Spending a lot of time during bleeding..
- Shaking the blood container vigorously.
- Separating the blood immediately after bleeding..

\section*{URINE COLLECTION}
-The type of urine specimen to be collected is dictated by the tests to be performed.
- Generally urine for quantitative analysis must be collected over an interval of time eg 1,4 , or 24 hours.
- Untimed or random urine specimen are suitable for only very few biochemical tests. A clean, early morning specimen is generally the most concentrated and this is prepared for routine examination.eg testing for unusual compounds such as beta chorionic gonadotropin.
- A clean timed urine specimen is the one obtained at specific times of the day or during certain phases of micturition. A double voided specimen is the urine excreted during a timed period following a complete emptying of the bladder . It is used to assess glucose excretion during a glucose tolerance test procedure. Its collection must be timed in relation to the ingestion of glucose.
- When specimen must be collected over a specified period of time, the patient must adhere closely to the instructions with regard to diet or medication , to avoid interference of ingested compounds with analytical procedures.
- Appropriate information regarding the collection including warnings with respect to handling of the specimen, should appear on the bottle label.
- Urine cannot be collected at the same time for two or more tests for which different procedures are required.
- The removal of aliquots is not permissible even when the volume removed is measured and corrected for , since the excretion rate of most compounds varies throughout the day and the effect of the removal of some specimen on the total concentration cannot be corrected.

\section*{URINE PRESERVATIVES}
-Preservatives of urine specimens have different roles but are usually added to:-
- (i) reduce bacterial action or chemical decomposition.
- (ii) solubilize constituents that might otherwise precipitate out of solution.
- (iii) decrease atmospheric oxidationof unstable cpds.

Some specimens should not have any preservative added bcoz of the possibility of interference with analytical methods.
$-\mathrm{NB} /$ one of the most satisfactory form of urine preservation is refrigeration during collection. Other preservatives are :-
(i) concentrated HCL ACID $(10 \mathrm{ML})=6 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$
(ii) sulfamic acid
(iii) thymol
(iv) chloroform
(v) toluene----- this is the only organic solvent that is still in use as a preservative.
- When timed collection is complete the specimen must be delivered to the laboratory without delay where the volume is measured using a graduated cylinder.

\section*{FAECES (STOOL)}
-Small portions of faeces are frequently analyzed to detect the presence of occult blood (hidden), which is recognized as one of the most effective clues to the presence of a bleeding ulcer or malignant dse in the gastro-intestinal tract. The patient is instructed to abstain from eating proteinous foods three days prior to the collection of the specimen.
- 72 hour faeces specimen is collected for the estimation of faecal fat ( to diagonize malabsorption disorders ).

\section*{CEREBRAL SPINAL FLIUD (CSF)}
-Obtained from the puncture of the lumber region
- Lumber puncture are done by the physicians.
- it is requested where there is suspicion of a cerebro-vascular accident, meningitis, demyelinating dse, or menengial involvement in malignant dse.
- The csf specimen is collected in fluoride bottles for the analysis of micro protein and glucose.

\section*{SYNOVIAL FLUID}
- Obtained from the joint to aid in the characterization of arthritis and differentiation of non- inflammatory effusions from inflammatory effusions. Normally only a small amount is present in any joint , but the fluid is increased in the presence of inflammatory conditions.. The technique of removing the fluid from the joints is referred to as arthrocentesis which is done by a physician.. The fluid is examined for proteins and glucose.
- Amniocentesis is the procedure for removing amniotic fluid for prenatal diagnosis of congenital disorders, to assess fetal maturity or detect intrauterine infection.

\section*{PLEURAL/ ASCITIC/PERICARDIAL FLIUD COLLECTION}
-Pleural, pericardial and peritoneal cavities normally contain a small amount of fluid that lubricates the opposing parietal and visceral membrane surfaces.
- Inflammation or infections affecting the cavities causes the fluids to accumulate.
- The tests analyzed are proteins and glucose.
- The removal of the specimen is done by the physician and the procedure is referred to as paracentesis but when specially applied to pleural cavity is called thoracentesis and for pericardial cavity is referred to as cardiocentesis.

\section*{HANDLING OF SPECIMENS}
-A quality result will depend on a quality specimen which has been well collected, preserved, transported and well identified. The information on the label should have the following:-
(i) pt name,
(ii) location
(iii) identity number
(iv) date and time of collection
(v) type specimen.

\section*{SEPARATION AND STORAGE}
-Serum or plasma should be separated from the cells as soon as possible and certainly within 2 hours from the collection time. If this is not possible the specimen should be kept at room temperature rather than at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to avoid haemolysis.
- Separated serum or plasma can be placed at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for later analysis. If analysis is to be carried out in two weeks time, the specimens can be stored at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. or at $-70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if it is to be analyzed in future.
- Specimens are supposed to be centrifuged with the stoppers (caps) in place to reduce evaporation and to prevent aerosolization of infectious particles.

\section*{TRANSPORTATION OF SPECIMEN TO REFERENCE LABORATORY}
-It should be assumed that transport from a referring lab. To a referral lab. may take as long as 72 hrs . Referring lab. should retain some specimen under optimal conditions for retesting should an unanticipated problem arise during shipment.
- for transportation of frozen or refrigerated specimen, a Styrofoam container should be used . Dry ice is the most convenient refrigerant material for maintaining specimen frozen temperature as low as $-70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ can be achieved. The amount of dry ice required depends on the size of container, insulation efficiency and time for freezing.

\section*{CRIETERIA USED FOR ACCEPTING OR REJECTING SPECIMEN.}
(1) All specimens must be brought to the laboratory in the correct container.
(2) The must be accompanied with a duly filled request form. The following information must be given:-
(i) patient/ client name -- identification
(ii) type of specimen
(iii) location of patient/ client (address)
(iv) time and date of collection.
(v) signature and name of the person ordering the tests
(vi) urgency of the tests
(vii) the request / report form should be clean ie not soiled (if soiled reject the
specimen.
(viii) specimen which is grossly haemolyzed should be rejected.

\section*{NB/ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT QUALITY SPECIMEN MEANS QUALITY RESULTS}

\section*{AUTOMATION IN CLINICAL CHEMISTRY/REAGENT KITS}
-Automation in clinical chemistry is a representation of mechanization of conventional manual technics.
- The first practical automation was introduced in the clinical laboratory in mid last century.
- Factors that necessitated the introduction of automation were:-
(a) Increase in number of patient in health institutions
(b) Clinicians started ordering panel of tests in an effort of making conclusive diagnosis and this became increasingly difficult to handle using the manual techniques.
(c) Invention of new analytical methods which replaced the older methods.
- Several types of automated systems have been since mid last century. Although these systems may differ from each other in many ways, they all represent mechanization of conventional methods.
- The operating details for each instrument is best found in manuals supplied by the manufacturers.

\section*{DISCRETE AUTO ANALYZER}
- The discrete auto-analyzer involves the treatment and measurement of samples individually.
- This system is made up of four major compartments namely:- (a) reagent (b) specimen (c) reaction and (d) data manager.

\section*{ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF AUTOMATION}

\section*{(1) ADVANTAGES}
(a) Large number of samples can be analysed within a very short time.
(b) Two or more analytical methods may be performed simultaneously.
(c) Precision and accuracy is very superior to manual methods (techniques).
(d) Cost of reagents is minimal compared to manual methods.
(e) Very little amount of sample is required for analysis.
(f) It is very fast (improve turnaround time) therefore saves the time the health provider uses to manage a patient.
(g) Automation also helps relieve stress on technologists brought about by increased workload
(h) The manual handling of samples that may be infectious constitutes a hazard to laboratory staff, hence robotic system improves safety for laboratory staff by eliminating the exposure to pathogens
(i) boost productivity of the laboratory which could not be achieved through manual method.

\section*{(2) DISADVANTAGES}
(a) The automatic nature of the machine discourages technicians from making observations regarding potential problems.
(b) These systems are only economical in busy laboratories. Small laboratories will always require the use of manual or semi automated methods of analyzing samples.
(c) These systems contribute to unemployment in developing countries
(d) The systems require placement in big rooms ie occupies huge spaces in the laboratory.
(e) The systems are very expensive to purchase and maintain.

\section*{REAGENT KITS}
-There are many methods available commercially as kits. A kit is a package which contains either some or all the reagents and components necessary to carry out an analytical procedure
- Some of these reagent kits are well designed and reliable while others are not and should be discarded.
- A good reagent kit should have the following characteristics (information)
(1) The name of the reagent which corresponds to the intended analysis.
(2) An insert which should have the following information:-
(a) Clinical significance of the analyte to be investigated using the reagent kit
(b) Test principle
(c) The specimen/s of choice to be used ( either whole blood, serum, plasma,urine,csf etc)
(b) Methodology
(c) Instructions on the reagent reconstitution if necessary
(d) Linearity range of the test ie the lowest and the highest value that can be achieved during analysis.
(e)Reference range of the analyte for the population used during the development of the kit
(f) Statement regarding accuracy and precision to be expected
(g) Description of any formula to be and a sample calculation eg OD TEST/OD STD x [STD]
(h) Should have unit conversion factors (if indicated)
(i) A performance evaluation from a reputable laboratory
(j) The expected number of tests which can be achieved with the kit
(3) The date of the manufacturing of the kit.
(4) The expiring date of the kit
(5) The production batch number
(6) Good and user friendly packaging
(7) The storage conditions
(8) The exact volume of the contained reagents

\section*{BIOCHEMICAL REFERENCE VALUES: NORMAL AND ABNORMAL VALUES; FACTORS AFFECTING INTERPRETATION}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- The interpretation of any clinical laboratory analytical test report involves an important concept in comparing the patient's results to the test's reference range. A health provider compares the given laboratory data with the given reference range of the particular analyte which then aid in making a diagnosis or in managing a pathological disorder.
- In any qualitative analytical reporting the patient's test result is either indicated as positive or negative.
- For the quantitative analytical reporting the patient's result's is followed by a reference range. The term reference range is preferred over normal range because the reference population can be clearly defined. Rather than implying that the test results are being compared with ill-defined concept of "normal", the reference range means the results are being considered in the most relevant context.
- When test results from different populations are examined it is quickly discovered that what is normal for one group is not necessarily normal for another group. For example, pregnancy changes many aspects of the body's chemistry so pregnant women have their own set of reference ranges.

\section*{ESTABLISHMENT AND TYPES OF REFERENCE RANGE}
- According to IFCC (International Federation Of Clinical Chemists), reference ranges are constructed from $95 \%$ of a healthy population.
- There are two types of reference ranges namely: the group (population) and subjects based reference ranges.
- In group (population) based, the health provider uses these (reference ranges) by estimating the probability that the client from whom the given laboratory report was obtained belongs to a group of healthy subjects from whom the reference ranges were obtained.
-If the reference values are from the same client when he/she was in a defined state of health, the health provider compares the present value with the past values to estimate whether the client is still in the same state of health eg managing a diabetic patient.

\section*{METHODS OF ESTABLISHMENT:}

Reference ranges can be constructed using two methods ie direct and indirect. Direct method involves the use of data obtained from a healthy population accessible to hospital, such as blood donors. A lot of work has been done in the production of reference ranges using direct methods. The indirect method involves the use of data obtained from patients' records. This data is used with the assumption that the majority of values come from subjects whose values are compatible with those of healthy subjects (in the sense that their values have not been altered by disease)). eg a client admitted for elective surgery.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING REFERENCE RANGES}

In the management of reference ranges it is very important to consider the affect the following factors have on reference ranges. These factors are:-

> Age,
> sex,
> race,
> geographical location,
> instruments,
> analytical methods,
> sample type
> diet

\section*{AGE}

The various body function are controlled by the metabolic activities in the body organs. Like wise the analytes involved either as ingredient or by products of the activities do vary appropriately with the activities in the organs.

\section*{EXAMPLES}
- For example, proteins are low in children compared to adults. Children requires more protein as the rate of organ development is higher than that of an adult. Therefore less proteins will be in circulation for a child as opposed to that of an adult.
- Menstrual and menopausal women have different levels of female fertility hormones eg follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
- Testosterone level are higher in a 23 year old man than in a 60 year old man

\section*{SEX (GENDER)}

Reference ranges of some biochemical parameter differ between male and female. The cause of this is due to different physiological activities.

\section*{EXAMPLES}
- Creatinine is higher in male than in female due to the fact that a man comparatively have more body muscle mass than a woman
- A woman has comparatively lower uric acid levels than a man due to the fact that uric acid clearance by the kidney is more in a woman than a man.

\section*{RACE}

This depends on the lifestyle, customary behavior (activities) which is different from the other group of people.

\section*{EXAMPLES}
- In Kenya, people from the central region of Kenya have a higher glucose levels than the rest of the country
- Men in south rift valley of Kenya have high levels of uric acid than the rest of the country due to high rate of meat consumption.
- In USA, blacks are known to demonstrate higher mean value than whites for serum immunoglobulin $\mathbf{G}$ (IgG) ( $\mathbf{2 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ higher) and immunoglobulin $\mathbf{M}$ (IgM) ( $\mathbf{3 5} \boldsymbol{\%}$ ) higher.

\section*{GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION,}
- People live in different geographical localities of the world. These locations have many features which are different including the climatic conditions. Studies have shown that these conditions affect reference ranges. Presently, only a few clinical laboratories have established their own reference ranges, while great majority use reference ranges reported in literature eg reagent kits insert or medical books. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommends that each clinical chemistry laboratory OR laboratories within the same locality establish own reference ranges for the biochemical parameters derived from the population they serve.
- The table below shows some biochemical parameter reference ranges from different geographical localities.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Parameter(unit) & Sex & KE & GER & USA & NIR & TZ \\
\hline ALB (g/L) & M/F & 29-53 & 34-48 & 35-50 & 38-44 & 36-50 \\
\hline ALP (U/L) & M & 73-224 & 0-117 & 32-92 & 98-279 & 46-158 \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{ALT (U/L)} & M & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{1-44} & 0-50 & 10-40 & 0-40 & 9-55 \\
\hline & F & & 0-35 & 7-35 & 0-31 & 7-45 \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{AST (U/L)} & M & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{3-45} & 0-50 & \multirow[t]{2}{*}{10-42} & 37 & 15-53 \\
\hline & F & & 0-35 & & 31 & 14-35 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Above table demonstrates that if one region reference range is used to interpret results for another region leads to mis-interpretation=mis-diagnosis of pathological disorders.

\section*{INSTRUMENTS}
- Different laboratories use different types of analytical instruments. The most commonly used are based on automation and manual technique. Studies have shown that these two analytical instruments produce different results for the same individual.
- The results produced by the automated method are higher than those produced by manual methods in all parameters studied. This suggests that automation is more superior to manual methods in terms of accuracy and precision.
- Analytical methods differences are shown by the ion selective electrode methods (direct and indirect) and calorimetric methods for the analysis of potassium and sodium

\section*{SAMPLE TYPE}
- A parameter can be found in different concentrations depending on the sample type eg Potassium is more concentrated in whole blood than in the serum . This is due to the fact that ICF contains more potassium than the ECF. In an event that blood is allowed to stand for some time, there will be a movement of this ion from the ICF to the ECF, therefore rising the levels in ECF.

\section*{DIET}
- If a diet consumed has a higher concentration of eg ions, this will be reflected by individuals who constantly consume that food stuff. Bananas are known to contain a high concentrationof potassium therefore potassium of individuals who take this food stuff will have a higher level of potassium.

\section*{DRUGS EFFECT ON REFERENCE RANGES}
-Drugs often alter laboratory test results; the literature reports $>40000$ drug effects on laboratory tests .
-These effects may cause misinterpretation of laboratory data and lead to unnecessary further tests, missed diagnoses, and additional costs, as pointed out in the case report below.

The vast amount of medical information, with its varying quality and ready availability, has to date made it laborious to take drug-laboratory effects into account in everyday patient care.

The prevalence of DLEs is not negligible: as many as $12 \%$ of patients have had laboratory results potentially affected by drugs in a general medical ward .

The effects of drugs on laboratory tests have been published in extensive catalogs, from which data have to be sought manually with active effort.

A modern solution for bringing this knowledge to clinical routine is computerization and automatic reminders.

Because physicians are already flooded with information, it is important to remind them only of the effects relevant for the patient in question.

This requires storing individual medications in a structured way and coding the data on DLEs in a logical way as well as building a reminder system that can be integrated into the laboratory information system (LIS) and hospital information system . Until now, there have been very few computer applications offering automatic monitoring of DLEs.

\section*{QUALITY ASSURANCE IN CLINICAL CHEMISTRY}
-All laboratory staff must be conscious of how the quality of their work affects medical diagnosis and treatment of patients.
- The staff should ensure that the product of the laboratory ie tests, are of good quality and beneficial to the clients (patients) and health providers.
- Erroneous laboratory data (results) can lead to unnecessary medical treatment, prolonged hospital stay and missed or wrong diagnosis.
- In order to avoid all these, it is important therefore to introduce a system which will control the quality of data (results) produced in the laboratory.
-The system put in place is referred to as quality assurance system .
- Quality assurance system is a broad spectrum of plans, policies and procedures that together provide an administrative structure for laboratory efforts to achieve quality goals.
- A quality assurance program involves virtually everything and everybody in the laboratory. An error in any step during acquisition, processing and analysis of specimens and the reporting of a laboratory test result can invalidate the quality of the analysis and cause the laboratory to fall short of its quality goals.
- There are several essential elements of a good quality assurance program. These are:-commitment, facilities and resources, technical competence, quality assurance procedures, problem solving mechanism.
(1) COMMITMENT
- Dedication to quality service must be central. Quality must be a major consideration in all management decisions because any single decision may compromise other plans and practice for attaining quality goals.
(2) FACILITIES AND RESOURCES,
-laboratories must have adequate space , equipments , materials, supplies, staff and supervisory personnel and budgetary resources. The facilities and resources are the basis upon which quality services can be developed and maintained.
(3) TECHNICAL COMPETENCE

High quality personnel are essential for high quality services. The educational background and experience of all personnel are important as is the capability for providing in-services training to develop and maintain skills and knowledge.
(4) QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES
- This can be divided into three groups:-
(a) Control of pre-analytical variables;- such as test request, patient preparation and identification, specimen acquisition and transport, specimen processing and distribution, preparation of work list and record maintainenance.
(b) control of analytical variables:- This includes analytical methodology, standardization/calibration procedures
(c) monitoring of analytical quality by the use of statistical methods and QC charts.
(5)PROBLEM SOLVING MECHANISM

This involves the link between the identification of a problem and the implementation of a solution to solve that problem. In this case of problem solving, teams must be established

\section*{ACTIVITIES INVOLVED IN A GOOD AND COMPLETE QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM}
- These interrelated activities includes:- assessment, maintenance and improvements
(A) ASSESSMENT
- For an operational laboratory, the quality data being produced must be assessed and evaluated. Two terms that are important in this regard are ACCURACY and PRECISION

\section*{ACCURACY}
- This refers to how close a measurement is to the true value. This true value is also referred to as the actual, correct, most expected, the target value or the right value.
- The closer the measured value is to the true value, the greater is the accuracy.

\section*{PRECISION}
- This refers to how close together are multiple measurements of the same sample. The question here is whether the same result will be obtained when the test is repeated.
- Precision can also refer to reproducibility or the agreement between replicate measurements. This means that the results of repeated analysis on the same sample are all very close to each other .
- It is worth to note that demonstrated precision is not a guarantee of accuracy

\section*{MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT}
-To ensure quality data from the laboratory, accuracy and precision must always be maintained. This is achieved by the use of quality control materials. The quality control material must always be analyzed before any analysis of specimens is commenced.
- Improvement of a good quality control program is achieved by taking the necessary remedy whenever anything that can compromise quality is detected.
- the laboratory must have quality reagents, good working equipments and skilled personnel in order to maintain and improve on the quality of test results produced by the clinical laboratory.

\section*{QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAMS}
-There are two types of quality control programs that are recommended for every practicing clinical laboratory. These are:- (a) INTERNAL QC program (b) EXTERNAL QC program

\section*{-INTERNAL QC PROGRAM (IQC)}

\section*{DEFINATION}
-This can be defined as the set of procedures undertaken in a laboratory for the continual assessment of work carried out within the laboratory and the evaluation of the results of tests to decide whether the latter are reliable enough to be released to the requesting health provider.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS}
(a)-must be done always when an analytical test is being carried out.
(b)- must be done before the patients specimens are analysed
(c)-when many specimens are set for analysis, it can be included within the run.
(d) -has a lower and upper value ie has a given range which represents mean +/_2 SD
(e)- must be treated the same way as test sample during the analysis.

\section*{IQC Results representation}
- The results for the day are represented on a levy jenning QC chart as demonstrated using the example below

\section*{EXAMPLE}

The following are the IQC results for potassium a the month of October: day $1=4.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $2=4.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $3=5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $4=4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $5=3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $6=4.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $7=5.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $8=6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $9=5.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, day $10=4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). The IQC target value is $4.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ and the control range is ( 3 up to 6$) \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$.
Step one----is to calculate the value of 1SD.
Target value $\pm 2 \mathrm{SD}=\mathrm{X} \pm 2 \mathrm{SD}=4.5 \pm 2 \mathrm{SD}$
$4 \mathrm{SD}=(6-3)$
$4 \mathrm{SD}=3$
$1 \mathrm{SD}=\frac{3}{4}=0.75$
DAY $1=4.2-4.5=-0.3(\mathrm{NB} /$ the negative sign indicates which side of the mean (target value) is the QC value)
$1 \mathrm{SD}=0.75$
$$?=-0.3 \mathrm{SD}$$
-0.3 divide by $0.75=-0.4$ (ON the lower side of the target value)
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ SD FOR EACH OF THE OTHER DAYS IS CALCULATED USING THE EXAMPLE GIVEN ABOVE. (The SD are as follows: day $2=-0.4$, day $3=0.7$ and day $4=-0.7$, day $5=-2$, day $6=0$, day $7=1.3$, day $8=2$, day $9=0.9$, and day $10=-0.7$ ).
-The above SD are represented on a Levy Jennings QC chart given below.

\section*{EXTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL(EQC) PROGRAM}

\section*{DEFINATION}
- This is a retrospective comparison of performance with a pre-set criteria or with other laboratories. The aim of EQC is to assess the degree of harmonizationof results between clinical laboratories_

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS}
(a) This is organized by an external agency that may be nationally or internationally based.
(b)Lyophilized material is suitable for this purpose
(c) the EQC material can be of two forms ie blind or known .Blind material (blind QC serum) means that the QC ranges are not given but are determined by the participating laboratories .It is upon the results given by these laboratories that their performance is determined by the external agent. On the other hand the known qc is similar to the internal QC but the results have to be sent back to the external agent for statistical analysis and interpretation .
(d) -the EQC materials are analyzed periodically eg once in every 3 months
(e) -all participating laboratories are expected to perform all the requested tests and send the results back to the organizing centre(agent)

\section*{STANDARDS FOR HANDLING PROFICIENCY TESTING SPECIMENS ARE AS FOLLOWS:}
- PT samples must be tested with the laboratory's regular patient load.
- PT samples must be tested the same number of times that patients' samples are tested routinely.
- Laboratories participating in PT programs must not engage in interlaboratory comparison of PT sample results.
- Laboratories may not send PT samples to another laboratory for analysis.
- Laboratories must document all steps of processing for PT samples.
- PT is required for only the primary method used for testing of analytes in patients' samples during the period covered by the PT event.

In return for their participation, the laboratory will receive the following information:
- results for each analyte sample;
- mean result for each analyte;
- standard deviation of results by the comparative method;
- number of laboratories using the same method;
- standard deviation index (SDI); and
- lower and upper limits of acceptability of results.

PT results that are between the lower and upper limits of acceptability are considered satisfactory.

\section*{External quality control serves several purposes, including:}
- evaluating the internal quality control program;
- detecting errors in a lab's methods, including technical errors; and
- providing a comparison of testing methods, which is useful in selecting new methods.

\section*{TOPIC TWO---LIPIDS DISORDERS AND LIPIDS ESTIMATIONS LIPIDS (FATS) DISORDERS}
-Lipids are insoluble (does not dissolve in water but are soluble (dissolves) in alcohol and other solvents. When diatary fats are digested and absorbed into the small intestine, they eventually re-form into triglycerides, which are then packaged into lipoproteins.
- Dietary fats, including cholesterol are absorbed from the small intestine and transported into the liver by lipoproteins called CHYLOMICRONS. Chylomicrons are large droplets of lipids with a thin shell of phospholipids, cholesterol, and protein . Once chylomicrons enter the bloodstream , an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase breaks down the tryglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol.After 12-14 hours fast, chylomicrons are absent from the bloodstream. Thus, individuals who are having a lipid profile done should fast overnight to ensure that chylomicrons have been cleared.
- The liver removes the chylomicrons fragments and the cholesterol is repackaged for transport in the blood in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) , which eventually turn into low density lipoprotein(LDL).LDL- cholesterol(LDL-C) ---the bad cholesterol---consist mainly of cholesterol . Most LDL-C particles are absorbed from the bloodstream by receptor cells in the liver. Cholesterol is then transported throughout the cells. Diets high in saturated fats decrease the uptake of LDL particles by the liver. LDL particles are also removed from the blood stream by scavenger cells or macrophages, which are white blood cells that bury themselves in the blood vessels such as arteries. Scavanger cells prevent cholesterol from re-entering the bloodstream, but they deposits the cholesterol in the inner walls of the blood vessels, eventually leading to the development of plaque.
-High density lipoprotein -cholesterol (HDL-C), are a separate group of lipoproteins that contain more protein and less cholesterol than LDL. HDL-C is also called -good cholesterol--. HDL-C is produced primarily in the liver and intestine, and it travels in the bloodstream, picks up cholesterol, and gives the cholesterol to other lipopteins for transport back to the liver.
- HDL-C and LDL-C are the major types of lipids that circulate in the bloodstream. Therefore, a person"s total cholesterol is mostly determined by the amount of the HDL-C and LDL-C in a measured sample of blood.( For example a total cholesterol level of $5.6 \mathrm{mmol} / 1$ could be represented by an HDL-C of $3 \mathrm{mmol} / 1$ and an LDL-C of $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / 1$ or HDL-C of $2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / 1$ and an LDL-C of $3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$..
-From a clinical laboratory perspective, the levels of lipids is measured by carrying out a lipid profile estimation which takes into account total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-C, the triglycerides and the ratio of TC/HDL-C. a health provider may order a lipid profile as part of annual exam or if there is specific concern about cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially coronary artery disease (CAD) also referred to as coronary heart disease(CHD)

\section*{LIPIDS (FATS) DIORDERS}

The lipids disorders forms part of the cardiovascular diseases which are coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, congenital heart disease and rheumatic heart disease. A person may have one of these diseases or combination of forms at the same time. Each form exists in varying degrees of severity. All forms are capable of causing secondary damage to other body organs and body systems.
Among the above mentioned major CVD, coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease is the one directly related to the lipids disorder.

\section*{CORONARY HEART DISEASE OR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE}
-This form CVD involves damage to the vessels that supply blood to the heart muscles. The bulk of this blood is supplied by the coronary arteries. Any damage to these important vessels can cause a reduction of blood (and its vital oxygen and nutrients) to specific areas of heart muscles. The ultimate result of inadequate blood supply is a heart attack.

\section*{ATHEROSCLEROSIS}

The principal cause for the development of coronary heart disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis produces a narrowing of the coronary arteries. This narrowing stems from the long term buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, on the inner walls of the arteries. This buildup reduces the blood supply to specific portions of the heart. Some arteries of the heart can become so blocked (occluded) that all blood supply is stopped. Heart muscle begins to die when deprived of oxygen and nutrients. This damage is known as myocardial infarction (in lay terms, this event is called a heart attack).

\section*{LIPIDS AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS}
-After much scientific studies, it has been determined that high levels of LDL-C, are a significant cause of atherosclerosis. This makes sense because LDL-C carry the greatest percentage of cholesterol in the bloodstream. LDL-C are more likely to deposit excess cholesterol into the artery walls. This contribute to plaque formation.For this reason, LDL-C, is often referred to as -THE BAD CHOLESTEROL---. High levels of LDL-C are partially related to inheritance, but they are clearly associated with smoking, poor dietary patterns, obesity and lack of exercise.
- On the other hand, high levels of HDL-C are related to decrease in the development of atherosclerosis. HDL-Care thought to transport cholesterol out of the bloodstream . Thus HDL-C, have been called the----GOOD CHOLESTEROL---. Certain lifestyle alteration such as quitting smoking, reducing obesity, increase physical activities, and decreasing dietary fats, help in increasing the levels of HDL-C.
- Reducing serum total cholesterol levels is a significant step in reducing the risk of death from coronary heart desease.

\section*{ANGINA PECTORIS}
-When coronary arteries becomes narrowed, chest pain, or angina pectoris is often felt. This pain results from a reduction supply of oxygen to heart muscles . Usually angina pectoris is felt when the patient becomes stressed or exercises too strenuously. Angina pectoris reportedly can range from a feeling of mild indigestion to a severe viselike pressure in the chest. The pain may extend from the centre of the chest to the arm and even up to the jaw. Generally the more severe the blockage , the more pain is felt.

\section*{LIPID PROFILE ANALYSIS}
-This is a panel of tests done in the investigation of fat metabolism disorders and its related complication such as diabetes mellitus, acute and chronic pancreatitis and some endocrine disorders.
- The tests under these profiles are: total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)

\section*{TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC)}

The laboratory analysis of total cholesterol take into account all types all cholesterol in solution ie HDL-C, LDL-C, and VLDL-C

SPECIMEN USED for analysis are either FASTING serum or heparinized plasma

\section*{REFERENCE RANGES IN LITERATURE (3.6-7) MMOL/L}

\section*{TRIGLYCERIDES (TG)}

This is the most common complex lipid also referred to fatty acid derivative. This fatty acid derivative is covalently linked to an alcohol. The most common alcohol s found in human metabolism is glycerol-Esterification of fatty acids with glycerol produces GLYCERIDES (ACYLGLYCEROLS). TRIGLYCERIDES are the most prevalent dietary glycerol esters encountered.. they constitute $95 \%$ of the fat stored in the tissues and are the predorminant form of glycerol ester found in plasma.- Clinically , triglycerides assays are used to help classify various genetic and metabolic lipids disorders, and in the assessment of risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.. Triglyceride assays also are used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis, DM, nephrosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction.

\section*{HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN -CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C)}
-This is a part of lipid which is in circulation attached to a protein molecule (ie albumin), thus refered to as lipoprotein. It is produced in the liver and the intestines .
- HDL appears to be important in cholesterol efflux from the tissues , thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol stored there. Due to this action, HDL is referred to as GOOD CHOLESTEROL.

\section*{HDL-CHOLESTEROL}

High levels of HDL-C are related to decrease in the development of atherosclerosis. HDL-Care thought to transport cholesterol out of the bloodstream . Thus HDL-C, have been called the----GOOD CHOLESTEROL---. Certain lifestyle alteration such as quitting smoking, reducing obesity, increase physical activities, and decreasing dietary fats, help in increasing the levels of HDLC.

SPECIMEN USED for analysis are either FASTING serum or heparinized plasma

\section*{LDL CHOLESTEROL}

This is the type of cholesterol that has been associated with causing the development of coronary heart disease(CHD), with numerous clinical and epidemiological studies demonstrating its atherogenic properties. High levels of LDLC- are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and familial hyperlipideamia. Reduced levels of LDL-C may be found in malabsorption and malnutrition.

\section*{CARDIAC FUNCTION AND CARDIAC TEST PROFILE INTRODUCTION}

Over the past thirty years, the ability to diagnose heart disease has improved dramatically, largely because of the evolution of new, increasingly sophisticatedcardiac-testing techniques that include electrocardiography, exercise stress testing, radioisotope studies, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization.Despite these technological advances, the initialdiagnosis of heart disease is still supported by twolow-technology, low-cost cornerstones: the medical history and physical examination. When carefullyperformed and properly interpreted, the history andthe physical will yield an accurate diagnosis in many, if not the majority of cases. Signs and symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and an abnormal pulse, coupled with detailed cardiopulmonary examinationand a careful history that may reveal major risk factors, have proved over and over their value in establishing a diagnosis.

After an initial presumptive diagnosis is made based on the findings of the history and physical, cardiac testing can be used to establish the diagnosis and determine the functional capability of the patient, the severity of the disease, and the category of risk into which the individual falls. With varying levels of detail and precision, diagnostic tests can establish or confirm the presence of blockages in the coronary arteries, the degree of blockages, damage to the heart muscle, enlargement of the heart chambers, congenital heart defects, abnormalities of the heart valves, and electrical disturbances that interfere with the rhythm of the heartbeat.
Thus, a major value of cardiac testing is its ability to increase the precision of the diagnosis, enabling today's physician to prescribe the treatment with the greatest likelihood of success for each individual patient. In many situations, judiciously ordered tests may also be used to uncover a cardiac abnormality even when there are no signs or symptoms. The choice of tests and the order in which they are used is guided by the findings of the history and physical and by the physician's clinical judgment. For example, if a patient's symptoms are similar to those of congestive heart failure, the physician will recognize that heart failure is associated with poor heart muscle function and that a radioisotope study is an excellent method of evaluating the degree of heart muscle damage. If the patient has a heart murmur, the physician will suspect a lesion of a heart valve; in this case, echocardiography is warranted because itallows the physician to see the valve actually functioning.

In general, the diagnosis of heart disease progresses in a stepwise fashion from the simplest, least invasive, least expensive, and least risky method. As more information about a patient's condition is accumulated, appropriate decisions can be made regarding the use of more sophisticated and more invasive diagnostic procedures. The following sections describe each of these tests in detail and generally in the order in which they might be orderedthough not all of them would be used in any one patient. Many patients with heart disease may require only one, or at most two, tests to make an accurate diagnosis. (The role of these diagnostic procedures is also discussed in individual chapters on specific types of heart disease.)

\section*{(1) NORMAL CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION}

The cardiovascular or circulatory system uses a muscular pump to send a complex fluid on a continuous trip within a closed system of tubes. This pump is the heart, the fluid is the blood and the closed system of tubes is the network of blood vessels.

\section*{CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS}

The following are compounding risk factors that are associated with cardiovascular diseases. These risk factors includes those that cannot be changed, those that can be changed and those that are thought to be contributing to heart disease.
Risk factors that cannot be changed
(a) Increasing age----

Heart diseases tend to develop gradually over the course of one's life. Most of the consequences of heart disease are evident in old ages eg approximately 80\% of people who die from heart attack are 65 years and above.
(b) Male gender----

Men are prone to heart disease than women. It is thought that women are some what more protected from heart disease than men because of their natural production of the hormone estrogen during their fertile years.
(c) Heredity----

Children born in families with history of heart disease are said to have a genetic predisposition to develop heart disease as they grow and develop throughout their lives

\section*{Risk factors that can be changed}

There are four cardiovascular risk factors that that are influenced, in large part by our lifestyle choices.

\section*{(a) Cigarette or tobacco consumption}

Smokers have a heart attack risk that is over twice that of nonsmokers. Smoking cigarettes is the major risk factor associated with sudden cardiac death. Cigarettes and tobacco smoke also adversely affects nonsmokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to this risk, indoor smoking in public areas and business settings are increasing tremendously in most countries.

\section*{(b) Physical inactivity}

Lack of exercise is a significant risk factor for heart disease. Regular exercise helps to strengthen the heart muscle, maintain healthy blood vessels, and improve the ability of the vascular system to transfer blood and oxygen to all parts of the body. Physical activities also helps to lower the overall blood cholesterol, encourages weight loss and retention of lean muscle mass and allows people to moderate stress in their lives.

\section*{(c) high blood lipid levels}

The higher the blood cholesterol the higher the risk of heart disease. Specifically the high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides

\section*{(d) high blood pressure}

High blood pressure can seriously damage a person's heart and blood vessels. High blood pressure causes the heart to work much harder, eventually causing the heart to enlarge and weaken. It increases the chances of stroke, heart attack, congestive heart failure and kidney disease.

\section*{Other risk factors that contribute to heart disease}

\section*{(a) diabetes}

Diabetes mellitus is a debilitating chronic disease that has a significant effect on the human body. In addition to increasing the risk of developing kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage, DM increases the likelihood of developing heart and blood vessel disease. The cardiovascular damage is thought to occur when DM begins to alter normal cholesterol and blood fat levels.

\section*{(b) Obesity}

Even without any other risk factor, odese people are more likely than nonobese people to develop heart disease and stroke. Obesity places considerable strain on the heart, and tends to influence both blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.It also triggers diabetes in predisposed people.

\section*{(c) Individual response to stress}

Unresolved stress over a long period may be a contributing factor to the development of heart disease. People who are unable to cope with stressful life experiences are more likely to develop negative dependence behaviors eg smoking, underactivity, poor dietary practice 0 which can lead to cardiovascular problems.

\section*{FORMS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE}

\section*{CORONARY HEART DISEASE (coronary artery disease)}

Involves damage to the vessels that supply blood to the heart.The bulk of this blood is supplied by the coronary arteries. Any damage to these important vessels will cause a reduction of blood (and its vital oxygen and nutrients) to specific areas of the heart muscle. The ultimate result of inadequate blood supply is a heart attack.
Atherosclerosis is the principle cause of the development of coronary heart disease. It produces the narrowing of the coronary arteries which is due to long term buildup of fatty deposits called plaque on the inner walls of the arteries.

\section*{Hypertension}

This is the consistent elevation of blood pressure. People with hypertension are often not aware that they have it. Hypertension is not thought as a curable disease, rather, it is controllable disease.

\section*{© Stroke}

Results due to blood vessel damage in the brain perhaps due to the blockage of a cerebral artery. Blood clot that forms within the artery (thrombus) or a clot that travels from another part of the body to the brain (embolus). The resultants accidents ie cerebral thrombosis or cerebral embolism causes between 70\% to 80\% of all strokes.

\section*{Congenital heart disease}

This disease is present at birth. It is caused by valve damage, holes in the septum, blood vessel transposition and underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. Rubella has been known to cause this disease.

\section*{Rheumatic heart disease}

This is the final stage in a series of complications started by streptococcal infections of the throat.

\section*{CARDIAC FUNCTION TESTS (CARDIAC PROFILE)}

To investigate the above mention pathological complications of the cardiac system, the following parameters which makes cardiac profile are analyzed in the clinical laboratory:
(1) Creatine kinase or creatine phosphokinase(CK or CPK)
(2) Creatine kinase isoenzymes ie CK BB (CK-1), CK MB (CK-2) and CK MM (CK-3)
(3) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
(4) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
(5) Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH)
(6) Myoglobin (MYG)
(7) Troponin

Most routine laboratory are able to carry out analytes CPK,LDH, and AST. HBDH is analyzed in place of LDH. Creatine isoenzymes CK BB, CK MB and CK MM , MYOGLOBIN and TROPONIN are done as special chemistry.

\section*{CREATINE KINASE OR CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE (CK OR CPK) AND ITS ISOENZYMES}

CK activity is greatest in striated muscles, brain and heart tissue. CK is a dimer composed of two sub units ie B or Brain and M or muscle which are the product of two distinct genes. From these two sub units, three pairs of iso enzymes (isoforms) do exists ie CK BB, CK MB and CK MM. All these three isoenzymes are found in the cell cytosol .
- The CK BB isoform is predorminantly found in the brain,
- CK MB isoform predorminantly found in the heart tissue
- CK MM predorminantly found in the skeletal muscles.

\section*{CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE}

Investigated in the diagnosis of diseases of the skeletal muscles (muscular dystrophy) especially in the Duchenne type
Investigated in the diagnosis of diseases of the heart. After myocardial infarction, CK levels in blood are invariably elevated.Also after a heart surgery the CK levels are elevated.
Diseases of the central nervous system will increase the activity of CK especially in cerebral ischemia, acute cerebralvascular disease and head injury.
Disease of thyroid------Serum CK activity demonstrate an inverse relationship with thyroid activity. About $60 \%$ of hypothyroid subjects usually have elevated CK levels. By contrast, in hyperthyroidism subjects, the serum CK activity tends to be at the low end of the reference ranges.

\section*{DETERMINATION OF CK ACTIVITY}

This is an enzymatic kinetic UV method for quantitative determination of creatine kinase.

Reference range for the adult Kenyan population ( $26-262$ U/L).

\section*{DETERMINATION OF CK ISOENZYMES (CK BB, CK MB AND CK MM)}

The three techniques most commonly used for the determination of CK isoenzymes are :-
- electrophoresis,
- ion-exchange chromatography
- immunological methods.-----this is the most routinely practiced method which is based on antigen antibody reactions.

\section*{SPECIMEN OF CHOICE:serum, heparinized plasma}

Reference range in literature of CK MB ( $0-5 \mathrm{NG} / \mathrm{ML}$ ).

\section*{MYOGLOBIN ESTIMATION}

Myoglobin is a heme protein which reversibly binds oxygen, thus favouring its distribution in the muscle cells. Myoglobin is stored in the cytoplasm and this accounts for its rapid release from damaged muscle cells. The rapid increase of myoglobin concentration in blood makes it a useful, early maker of acute myocardial infarction. Since myoglobin is present in both cardiac and skeletal muscles, serum levels may increase in conditions relating not only to the heart (infarctus, heart surgery) but to the muscles (strenuous exercise, muscular dystrophy)

\section*{LAB INVESTIGATION}

\section*{Uses immunological technique ie ELFA}

Reference range in literature $(10-46 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{I})$.

\section*{Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)}

LDH activity is present in all cells of the body and it is invariably found in the cytoplasm of the cell.LDH is a hydrogen transfer enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of I-lactate to pyruvate with the mediation of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$as hydrogen acceptor. The reaction is reversible and the equilibrium strongly favors the reverse reaction, namely the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.

\section*{TROPONIN}

The troponins are a family of regulartory proteins found in skeletal and heart muscle (cardiac) fibers. There are three different types: troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). Together, these three proteins regulate muscular contraction. The main
difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion binding sites, whereas (TnT), and (TnI) in cardiac muscle have only three calcium binding sites.

The other difference is that, TnC is predominantly found in the skeletal muscles where it exacts its regulatory function whereas Cardiac-specific troponins I and T (cTnI and cTnT) are troponins that are found only in the heart. Cardiac-specific troponins differ in their molecular weights in that cTnI has a molecular weight of 23.9 kD whereas cTnT has a molecular weight of 39.7 kD .

All these types of troponin are normally present in very small to undetectable quantities in the blood.
- When there is damage to heart muscle cells, cardiac-specific troponins I and T are released into circulation. The more damage there is, the greater their concentration in the blood. The troponin test measures the amount of cardiac-specific troponin I or $T$ in the blood and is used to help determine if an individual has suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction).
- When a person has a heart attack, levels of cardiac-specific troponins $I$ and $T$ can become elevated in the blood within 3 or 4 hours after injury and may remain elevated for 4-9 days (cTnI) OR up to 14 days (cTnT)

Troponin tests (I and T) are primarily ordered to evaluate people who have chest pain to see if they have had a heart attack or other damage to their heart. Either a cardiac-specific troponin I or troponin T test can be performed; usually a laboratory will offer one test or the other. Troponin tests are sometimes ordered along with other cardiac biomarkers, such as AST,LDH,CPK, CK-MB, CK-MM or myoglobin. However, troponins are the preferred tests for a suspected heart attack because they are more specific for heart injury than other tests (which may become elevated in skeletal muscle injury) and remain elevated for a longer period of time.

TnT and Tnl circulation levels are not affected by damage to other muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect cardiac troponin levels. Troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance..Increased cardiac troponin concentrations should not be used by themselves to diagnose or rule out a heart attack. A physical exam, clinical history, and ECG are also important as is whether the troponin levels from a series of tests are stably elevated or show a rise and/or fall over several hours. Very rarely, people who have a heart attack will have normal troponin concentrations, and some people with increased troponin concentrations have no apparent heart injury.

Troponin (TnC, Tnl and TnT) levels may also be elevated with acute or chronic conditions such as myocarditis (heart inflammation), congestive heart failure, severe infections, kidney disease, and certain chronic inflammatory conditions of muscles and skin.

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}

\section*{DETERMINATION OF TROPONIN I AND T}
- The most commonly used technique for the determination of CARDIAC TROPONINS is the immunological technique based on antigen antibody reactions.
- The two approaches of these two immunological techniques are (1) enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) (2)electrochemiluminescence immuno assay(ECLIA)

Specimen of choice: serum or heperinized plasma

\section*{Normal Results as quoted in literature}

Cardiac troponin levels are normally so low
- Troponin I : less than $10 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$
- Troponin T : $0-0.1 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$

Normal troponin levels 12 hours after chest pain has started mean a heart attack is unlikely.

\section*{GLUCOSE METABOLISM , DISORDERS AND TESTS PROFILE}

Glucose is the end product of carbohydrate metabolism. It is a simple sugar that provides energy to all cells in human body (some cells, like brain cells and red blood cells, rely solely on glucose for fuel) (D'Orazio, et al., 2005). Human body tries to keep a constant supply of glucose for the cells by maintaining a constant concentration otherwise the cells would have more than enough glucose supply right after meal and starve in between meals and overnight. The body responds to oversupply of glucose by storing the excess in the liver and the muscles in form of glycogen (Ferraris and Ronaldo, (2001).When glucose is in short supply, the body mobilizes glucose from stored glycogen and this is the key to maintain a constant blood-glucose level. To maintain a constant blood-glucose level, the body relies on two hormones produced in the pancreas that have opposite actions: insulin and glucagon (Dunning, et al., 2006).

\section*{INSULIN}

Insulin is made and secreted by the beta cells of the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans), small islands of endocrine cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a protein hormone that contains 51 amino acids. It is required by almost all of the body's cells, since it enhances glucose entry into these cells. Liver cells, fat cells and muscle cells are considered as the major target cells for insulin where it does the following: -stimulates liver and muscle cells to store glucose in glycogen,- stimulates fat cells to form fats from fatty acids and glycerol,-stimulates liver and muscle cells to make proteins from amino acids and inhibits the liver from making glucose from intermediate compounds of metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis). As such, insulin stores nutrients right after a meal by reducing the concentrations of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids in the bloodstream

\section*{GLUCAGON}

Glucagon is another protein hormone that is made and secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans). Glucagon acts on the same cells as insulin, but has the opposite effects: Stimulates the liver and muscles to break down stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) and release the glucose. It stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver. In contrast to insulin, glucagon mobilizes glucose from stores inside the body and increases the concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream. Insulin and glucagon have opposite effects on liver and other tissues for controlling blood-glucose level

\section*{DIABETES MELLITUS}

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose concentration) resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the $\beta$-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia

Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome (Cooke and Plotnick, 2008). Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes.

The incidence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly growing in the world. In 2000, an estimated 177 million people suffered from this chronic disease, which, by the end of 2006, had increased to 230 million, representing $6 \%$ of the world population. Of this number, $80 \%$ is found in the developing world It is estimated that, during the next 35 years, diabetic world-wide prevalence will reach $25 \%$, with India being the hardest hit. Approximately, 7.1 million Africans were said to be suffering from diabetes at the end of 2000, a figure that is expected to rise to 18.6 million by 2030 Data from the Ministry of Health in Kenya indicated that, of all humans living in Africa, an estimated 1.2 million Kenyans live with diabetes, and if the trend continues, by 2025 that number is expected to rise to 1.5 million The racial and ethnic puzzle of diabetes has led scientists to suggest that genetic predisposition might be a major factor, along with environmental factors, diet, lifestyle (inactivity), and residence In Africa, diabetes is more prevalent among the wealthy and the powerful, hence its designation as the "disease of opulence," and remains more pronounced in urban areas where people tend to be less physically active, eating a diet that is rich in saturated fats and refined sugars. It is well known now that obesity is one of the most significant contributors to increased prevalence of diabetes, leading to the use of the word "diabesity,), both in rural and urban areas. In comparison to the rural areas, the urban setting also presents an increased prevalence of obesity In Africa, in general, the Word Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than one-third of the women are obese compared to one-fourth of the men, with the poor being as vulnerable as the rich

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF DIABETES MELLITUS}

\section*{TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (JUVENILE DIABETES OR INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES)}

Diabetes is classified into three types: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Type 1 (juvenile diabetes or insulindependent diabetes) is caused by a lack of insulin. This type is found in five percent to 10 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in children or adolescents. Type 1 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and little or no insulin in their blood. In Type 1 diabetics, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are destroyed, possibly by the person's own immune system, genetic or environmental factors. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is relatively rare in sub-Saharan Africans, especially in young children - the peak age of onset is about a decade older than in white Europeans Although data are limited, available information indicates that the prognosis in T1DM is poor in Africa, as a result of both acute and long-term complications. Diabetic nephropathy appears to be particularly frequent in diabetic Africans and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality perhaps more so than in comparable populations of European extraction; no comparative data have been published.

\section*{TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (ADULT-ONSET DIABETES OR NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES)}

Type 2 (adult-onset diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the body does not respond or can't use its own insulin (insulin resistance). Type 2 occurs in 90 percent to 95 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in adults over the age of 40 years, most often between the ages of 50 years and 60 years. Globally in 2003 it was estimated that there were 150 million people with type 2 diabetes The incidence varies substantially in different parts of the world, almost certainly because of environmental and lifestyle factors, though these are not known in detail In the United States there are 23.6 million people ( $7.8 \%$ of the population) with diabetes with 17.9 million being diagnosed, $90 \%$ of whom are type 2 . With prevalence rates doubling between 1990 and 2005, Centre for disease control (CDC) has characterized the increase as an epidemic. Traditionally considered a disease of adults, type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel to rising obesity rates due to alterations in dietary patterns as well as in life styles during childhood There is also a strong inheritable genetic connection in type 2diabetes: having relatives (especially first degree) with type 2 increases risks of developing type 2diabetes very substantially. In addition, there is also a mutation to the Islet Amyloid Polypeptide gene that results in an earlier onset, more severe, form of diabetes

About 55 percent of type 2 diabetes patients are obese at diagnosis (Eberhart et al., 2004). Chronic obesity leads to increased insulin resistance that can develop into type 2 diabetes, most likely because adipose tissue (especially that in the abdomen around internal organs) is a (recently identified) source of several chemical signals to other tissues (hormones and cytokines). Other research shows that type 2 diabetes causes obesity as an effect of the changes in metabolism and other deranged cell behavior attendant on insulin resistance.

However, environmental factors (almost certainly diet and weight) play a large part in the development of type 2 diabetes in addition to any genetic component. This can be seen from the adoption of the type 2 diabetes epidemiological pattern in those who have moved to a different environment as compared to the same genetic pool who have not. Immigrants to Western developed countries, for instance, as compared to lower incidence countries of origins There is a stronger inheritance pattern for type $\mathbf{2}$ diabetes. Those with first-degree relatives with type 2 diabetes have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, increasing with the number of those relatives. Concordance among monozygotic twins is close to $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$, and about $\mathbf{2 5 \%}$ of those with the disease have a family history of diabetes.

Genes significantly associated with developing type 2 diabetes, include TCF7L2, PPARG, FTO, KCNJ11, NOTCH2, WFS1, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, JAZF1, and HHEX, KCNJ11 (potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11), encodes the islet ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir6.2, and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) regulates proglucagon gene expression and thus the production of glucagon-like peptide-1. Moreover, obesity (which is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes) is strongly inherited. Various hereditary conditions may feature diabetes, for example myotonic dystrophy and Friedreich's ataxia. Wolfram's syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that first becomes evident in childhood. It consists of diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness, hence the acronym DIDMOAD Gene expression promoted by a diet of fat and glucose as well as high levels of inflammation related cytokines found in the obese results in cells that "produce fewer and smaller mitochondria than is normal," and are thus prone to insulin resistance

Type 2 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and higher than normal levels of insulin in their blood. In Type 2 diabetics, the insulin resistance is linked to obesity, but it is not know exactly how this occurs. Some studies
suggest that the number of insulin receptors on liver, fat and muscle cells is reduced, while others suggest that the intracellular pathways activated by insulin in these cells are altered

\section*{GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS (GDM)}

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can occur in some pregnant women and is similar to Type 2 diabetes mellitus.GDM has also been defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, to differentiate it from pre-diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) in women that get pregnant. This broad definition of GDM therefore includes women whose glucose intolerance develops during pregnancy and those that had pre-existing diabetes which had not been diagnosed before pregnancy. The distinction here is important as, unlike most unborn babies of women who develop glucose intolerance in pregnancy, those of women with pre-existing diabetes can be exposed to hyperglycaemia in the first two trimesters of pregnancy resulting in an increased risk of a range of both isolated and multiple cardiovascular and other abnormalities (including central nervous system and musculoskeletal defects) Pregnancy is a diabetogenic condition characterized by insulin resistance with a compensatory increase in $\beta$-cell response and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin resistance usually begins in the second trimester and progresses throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. Insulin sensitivity is reduced by as much as $80 \%$ Placental secretion of hormones, such as progesterone, cortisol, placental lactogen, prolactin, and growth hormone, is a major contributor to the insulin-resistant state seen in pregnancy The insulin resistance likely plays a role in ensuring that the fetus has an adequate supply of glucose by changing the maternal energy metabolism from carbohydrates to lipids (Kelly et al., 2005). In USA, GDM affects ~ $7 \%$ of all pregnancies, resulting in $>200,000$ cases per year (Tracy et al., 2005). Depending on the population sample and diagnostic criteria, the prevalence may range from 1 to $14 \%$. Of all pregnancies complicated by diabetes, GDM accounts for $\sim 90 \%$.

GDM has long been known to raise the risk of macrosomia in the offspring, with the high glucose levels thought to cross the placenta and stimulate fetal insulin secretion which then acts as a growth factor Macrosomia brings its own difficulties such as increased risks of shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injuries and clavicular fractures in natural deliveries leading to a higher requirement for birth by Caesarean section Other short-term risks associated with GDM in the mother are pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia, urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis and polyhydramosis (which itself leads to increased risk of abruption placentae). There is also
increased risk of stillbirth and congenital abnormalities. Short-term risks for the baby include neonatal hypoglycaemia (caused by the excess insulin produced initially in response to the maternal hyperglycaemia, once the baby has been born and that drive has been removed), hyperbilirubinaemia, hypocalcaemia, respiratory distress syndrome, and polycythaemia (Kapoor et al., 2007). Having been diagnosed with GDM, as already stated, the mother is subsequently at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (Bellamy et al., 2009), Buchanan et al., 2007), with the prospectively studied Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort showing that this risk is independent from preconception glucose tolerance and obesity or a family history of diabetes. As well as long-term risks for herself, in her offspring there is increased risk of childhood obesity (Dabelea et al., 2008), and type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia in adolescence and beyond. Where the baby is female, exposure to maternal hyperglycaemia in utero increases their own risk of subsequently developing GDM in their own pregnancies (Claesson et al., 2007). This metabolic programming by in utero exposure to hyperglycaemia therefore is a transgenerational effect that may contribute to the expected huge increase in prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide, especially given the increasing prevalence of obesity. Management of GDM is by special diets and/or supplemental injections of insulin. It usually clears after the baby is delivered (Kapoor et al., 2007).

\section*{IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT) AND IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE (IFG)}

Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal (The Expert Committee (Wild et al., 2004). Patients with IFG and/or IGT are now referred to as having "pre-diabetes" indicating the relatively high risk for development of diabetes in these patients. A study in Iranian population showed that more people have IFG (16.8\%) than DM (7.7\%) (Alireza et al., 2008). In the absence of pregnancy, IFG and IGT are not clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for future diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (Marianne et al., 2004). IFG and IGT are associated with the metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia of the high-triglyceride and/or low-HDL type, and hypertension. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition in reproductive-aged women associated with impaired glucose tolerance (Lisa et al., 2010).

\section*{PREVIOUS ABNORMALITY OF GLUCOSE TOLERANCE}

Previous abnormality of glucose tolerance is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals known to have had an abnormality of glucose tolerance at one time but have been shown to have normal results on repeat testing. Someone who had Type 2 diabetes mellitus, was obese, not treated with insulin, and after weight reduction had a normal glucose tolerance test falls under this category (Green et al., 2003).

\section*{POTENTIAL ABNORMALITY OF GLUCOSE TOLERANCE}

Potential abnormality of glucose tolerance is a category of hyperglycaemic disorder which identifies individuals who are at greater than average theoretical risk for later development of diabetes mellitus. Identical twin of a patient with type 2 diabetes or a child of parents who each had type 2 diabetes falls under this category (Inzucchi and Sherwin, (2005).

Regardless of the type of diabetes, diabetics exhibit several (but not necessarily all) of the following symptoms: Excessive thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), extreme hunger or constant eating (polyphagia), unexplained weight loss, presence of glucose in the urine (glycosuria), tiredness or fatigue, changes in vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities (hands, feet), slow-healing wounds or sores and abnormally high frequency of infection (Gunderson et al., 2007).

\section*{HYPOGLYCÆMIA}

Hypoglycæmia is the medical term for a state produced by a lower than normal level of blood glucose. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects but the principal problems arise from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain, resulting in impairment of function (neuroglycopenia) (Crye et al., 2009). Effects can range from vaguely "feeling bad" to seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage or death. The most common forms of hypoglycemia occur as a complication of treatment of diabetes mellitus with insulin or oral medications. Hypoglycemia is less common in non-diabetic persons, but can occur at any age, from many causes. Among the causes are excessive insulin produced in the body (hyperinsulinemia), inborn errors of metabolism, medications and poisons, alcohol, hormone deficiencies, prolonged starvation, alterations of metabolism associated with infection, and organ failure (Cryer, (2001). The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on (i) the measurement method, (ii) the age of the person, (iii) presence or absence of effects, and (iv)
purpose of the definition. While there is no disagreement as to the normal range of blood sugar, debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment, or can cause harm (Koh et al., 1988). Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below the lower reference value in many people. Hormonal defense mechanisms (adrenaline and glucagon) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about ( $3.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ ) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and dysphoria. (Cryer, 2003). Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below ( $2.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ ), and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below $3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ in the morning without apparent effects. Since the brain effects of hypoglycemia, termed neuroglycopenia, determine whether a given low glucose is a "problem" for that person, most doctors use the term hypoglycemia only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects (Cornblath et al., 2000).

\section*{GLUCOSE TEST PROFILES}

Clinical laboratory investigation plays a great role in the diagnosis of either hyperglycaemic or hypoglycaemic status of an individual. Laboratory diagnostic profile tools that forms part of ones glucose status diagnosis are:-fasting blood glucose (FBG), random blood glucose (RBG), oral glucose screening test (OGST) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (WHO, 1999).

\section*{FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG)}

The success of FBG requires that an individual abstains or refrains from food of any kind overnight or any other period except water; and for purposes of confirming, fasting should take a minimum of 8 hours overnight. It is a reliable simple test preferred by many health workers. It is not affected by age or activities surrounding the patient and may be repeated after a while to further verify results (Cowie et al., 2006). Fasting as a matter of principle triggers the pancreas to release glucagon that will control the liver to start digesting its stored product glycogen into glucose for use in energy production during the night. The sequence of events is dynamic; the same pancreas will respond on short notice, by releasing insulin to manage any excesses of glucose and level it up (Mooy et al., 1996). Under normal circumstances the leveling up of glucose by the hormones results with stability, whereas in diabetic cases glucose will rise above normal and upon testing will obviously exhibit a positive diagnosis to the disease for the simple reason; insulin is missing or not enough (Liu et al., 2007). Different cut off levels of FBG has been used
to determine the relationship between diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Study involving Korean men showed a linear increase in the risk of ischemic stroke, independently of other cardiovascular risk factors observed at a level below the current FBG criteria for impaired fasting glucose ( $5.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). However, for other cardiovascular diseases, the current cutoff for diagnosing diabetes appropriately identified Korean men at risk (Joohon et al., 2009).

\section*{RANDOM BLOOD GLUCOSE (RBG)}

Approximately 50 to $70 \%$ of people with diabetes remain undiagnosed in both developed and developing countries and these individuals often present with complications of diabetes (Mohan et al., 2006). It is established that good control of diabetes can prevent complications. Undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes therefore need to be detected and treated early through community based screening (Harris et al., 1992). RBG which is a non-fasting test has been used in community based screening since it is the most convenient way to reach out to large numbers of people. The most commonly used tests for screening for type 2 diabetes, are FBG and 2Hr OGTT (Somannavar et al., 2008). Measurement of random blood glucose has the advantage that it can be undertaken at any time of the day, does not require a veni-puncture. In the early detection of diabetes type $2, \mathrm{RBG}$ has been found to have a higher sensitivity (75\%) than either FBG (50\%) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (16.7\%). However, RBG has a lower specificity ( $88 \%$ ) in the detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus than either either FBG ( $95 \%$ ) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (98.9\%) (Harris et al., 2003).

\section*{SCREENING GLUCOSE CHALLENGE TEST (SGCT)}

SGCT (sometimes called the O'Sullivan test) is a test performed under the two approaches recommended for the screening of GDM. Since there is no worldwide agreement on the best way to screen for GDM, universal and selective screening approaches have been adopted. Universal screening involves giving a drinking a solution containing 50 grams of glucose to non-fasting pregnant woman and blood glucose levels determined 1 hour later. Women with a 1 -hour glucose level $>7.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ are referred for a diagnostic OGTT . Selective screening was developed by categorizing pregnant women into three groups ((low-, intermediate-, and high-risk) based on a complex scoring system using weighted risk factors: age, BMI before pregnancy, and race (Naylor et al., 1997). American Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends selective screening for GDM. According to the ADA guidelines, patients should be screened for risk factors for GDM at their initial visit. A woman is considered high risk if she has one or more of the following: marked obesity, personal history of GDM, glucose intolerance or
glycosuria, or a strong family history of type 2 diabetes. A woman is considered low risk risk if she meets all of the following criteria: age $<25$ years, normal pre-pregnancy weight, not a member of an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes no known diabetes in first-degree relatives, no history of abnormal glucose tolerance, and no history of a poor obstetric outcome. A woman is considered intermediate risk if she does not fall into either the highor low-risk category. If a woman is high risk, glucose testing should be done as soon as possible. (Brody et al., 2003).

The ADA recommends two approaches to screening for GDM if a woman has one or more risk factors-a one-step or a two-step approach. The more commonly used two-step approach involves initial non-fasting screening with the 50-g oral glucose challenge test, followed by a 1-hour serum glucose concentration. If the glucose level exceeds the glucose threshold value on this test, the patient is further evaluated with the diagnostic OGTT. A 1-hour glucose value $>7.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ identifies $\sim 80 \%$ of women with GDM. A 1-hour glucose value $>7.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ identifies $\sim 90 \%$ of women with GDM, but it has a higher false positive rate (Metzger and Coustan, 1998). The one-step approach requires a diagnostic OGTT without prior screening with the $50-\mathrm{g} 1$-hour glucose challenge test. This may be costeffective in some high-risk patients. Of note, if a patient has a fasting plasma glucose level $>7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or a random plasma glucose level $>11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$, this meets the threshold for diabetes mellitus and should be confirmed on a subsequent day (Jovanovic et al., 1997).

\section*{ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT)}

This is the gold standard for the diagnosis diabetes, insulin resistance, and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia or rarer disorders of carbohydrate metabolism according to WHO and ADA (CDC, (2004). OGTT has also been used to evaluate clinically useful measures of Beta-cell function to assess insulin secretion, in comparison with the gold standard method of the hyperglycemic clamp (Hyper-C) (Fida et al., 2008).. Usually the OGTT is performed in the morning as glucose tolerance can exhibit a diurnal rhythm with a significant decrease in the afternoon (ADA, 2007). The patient is instructed to fast (water is allowed) for $8-12$ hours prior to the tests. During the three previous days the subject must have an unrestricted diet and unlimited physical activity. The subject should remain seated during the test and should not smoke throughout the test. Fasting blood glucose level of the subject is tested and should be within the laboratory FBG reference range. The test involves drinking a solution containing a certain amount of glucose (pregnant women ( 100 gm ), adults ( 75 gm ) and children ( $1 \mathrm{gm} / 1 \mathrm{~kg}$ body weight) within five minutes and
drawing blood to measure glucose levels at the start and on set time intervals thereafter (Eschwege et al., 2000). Current studies have established that a single OGTT can over estimate the diagnosis of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore it is important to carryout at least two OGTT to make proper diagnosis (Zhang et al., 2010).

\section*{POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE TEST (PPGT)}

Two hours postprandial blood sugar measures blood glucose exactly 2 hours after eating a meal which acts as a glucose challenge to the body's metabolism. By this point blood sugar has usually gone back down in healthy people, but it may still be elevated in people with diabetes (Goldstein et al., 2004). Thus, it serves as a test of whether a person may have diabetes, or of whether a person who has diabetes is successfully controlling their blood sugar. A fasting blood sugar (FBS) is done before the 2 hr PPG. It is an easily performed screening test for diabetes mellitus. In healthy, non-diabetic subjects in American population, 2-hr postprandial blood glucose levels are usually $<6.7$ and rarely $>7.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ (ADA, 2001). This test has been used in large, randomized, prospective trials that showed reductions in hyperglycemia and management of diabetes-related risk factors significantly reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes (Stratton et al., 2000). PPGT has been found to be a more useful diagnostic parameter than FBG and HbA 1 c especially in the investigations of diabetes and cardiovascular related complications (Temelkova-Kurktschiev et al., 2000)

\section*{Standard operating procedures involved in glucose analysis}

Instructions were given to the client to avoid any other meal after super. The procedure for oral glucose tolerance test involved testing the fasting blood glucose using capillary blood obtained by a finger prick. The client is requested to submit a random urine specimen, which is used to investigate any presence of glycosuria. Client to be considered to proceed with the test must have urine showing negative for glucosuria.. Pure glucose depending on age and status of the client is given as follows:- children $(1 \mathrm{gm}$ per 1 kg body weight, adult men and adult non expectant women( 75 gms ) and expectant women( 100 gms ). is weighed and dissolved in a glass of water and the subject consumed this glucose solution marking the start of the procedure. A period of 5 minutes is allowed for the consumption of the glucose solution. Citric acid is provided to prevent nausea. Blood glucose level is tested by using capillary blood obtained through a finger prick after every 30 minutes for two hours and a half client is required to void urine after every one hour during the period of the procedure. The results are recorded in OGTT chart.

\section*{GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN TEST (GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN, HBA1c) INTRODUCTION}

Glycosylated hemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c; sometimes also HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. It is formed in a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose. Glycosylated hemoglobin measures the percentage of hemoglobin bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is a protein found in every red blood cell. As hemoglobin and glucose are together in the red blood cell, the glucose gradually binds to the A1c form of hemoglobin in a process called glycosylation. The amount bound reflects how much glucose has been in the blood during the past average 120-day lifespan of red cells.

Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycosolated hemoglobin. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycosolated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way. This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous months prior to the measurement.

In the normal 120-day lifespan of the red blood cell, glucose molecules react with hemoglobin, forming glycosolated hemoglobin. In individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, the quantities of these glycosolated hemoglobins are much higher than in healthy people.

Once a hemoglobin molecule is glycosolated, it remains that way. A buildup of glycosolated hemoglobin within the red cell, therefore, reflects the average level of glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its life-cycle.

Measuring glycosolated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation. The $H b A_{1 c}$ level is proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous four weeks to three months. Some researchers state that the major proportion of its value is related to a rather shorter period of two to four weeks.

\section*{Purpose}

HBA1c test is therefore a test that measures the amount of hemoglobin bound to glucose. It is a measure of how much glucose has been in the blood during the past two to four months. As a person's blood sugar becomes higher, more of the person's hemoglobin becomes glycosylated. The glucose remains attached to the hemoglobin for the life of the red blood cell, or about 2 to 3 months.

HBA1c measures the percentage of hemoglobin bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is a protein found in every red blood cell. As hemoglobin and glucose are together in the red blood cell, the glucose gradually binds to the A1c form of hemoglobin in a process called glycosylation. The amount bound reflects how much glucose has been in the blood during the past average 120-day lifespan of red cells.

This information helps a physician evaluate how well a person is responding to diabetes treatment and to determine how long sugar levels have been high in a person newly diagnosed with diabetes.

\section*{Indications and use}

Glycosolated hemoglobin testing is recommended for both:
(a) checking blood sugar control in people who might be pre-diabetic and
(b) monitoring blood sugar control in patients having diabetes mellitus.

There is a significant proportion of people who are unaware of their elevated $H b A_{1 c}$ level before they have blood lab work. For a single blood sample, it provides far more revealing information on glycemic behavior than a fasting blood sugar value. However, fasting blood sugar tests are crucial in making treatment decisions.

It is recommended that glycosolated hemoglobin test be performed during a person's first diabetes evaluation, again after treatment is begun and sugar levels are stabilized, then repeated at least semiannually. If the person does not meet treatment goals or sugar levels have not stabilized, the test should be repeated quarterly.

Glycosolated hemoglobin measurement is not appropriate :
(a) where there has been a change in diet or treatment within 6 weeks.
(b) To people with recent blood loss, hemolytic anemia, or genetic differences in the hemoglobin molecule (hemoglobinopathy) such as sickle-cell disease and other conditions, as well as those that have donated blood recently.

\section*{Reference ranges in literature}

Diabetes treatment should achieve glycosylated hemoglobin levels of less than $7.0 \%$. Normal value for a nondiabetic person is 4.0-6.0\%. Because laboratories use different methods, results from different laboratories can not always be compared.

\section*{Methodology Options}

There are currently four main techniques for determining glycated hemoglobins:
1. Cation-exchange chromatography - separates hemoglobins using HPLC based on net charge as a result of glycation;
2. Gel electrophoresis;
3. Affinity chromatography - separates total glycated hemoglobins by binding to solid-phase dihydroxyborate;
4. Immunoassay - based on binding to specific antibodies.
5. Calorimetric /spetrophotometric estimaton

Specimen of choice: sequestrenated blood(blood collected in an EDTA vacuitainer) or capillary blood

Reference ranges: $F B G(2.7-6.4)$,
RBG(2.7-8.3) mmol/L

Units of measure: The commonly used units of measure are either mmol/L or $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}(\mathrm{mg} \%)$. A blood glucose report can be changed from one unit to another to suite the requesting health provider or for uniformity purposes.

Example: Given a blood glucose report as 198 mg/dl convert this to mmol/L
STEP ONE:
Mwt of glucose $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}\right)=180 \mathrm{gms}$
180 gms $=180,000 \mathrm{mgs}$
STEP TWO:
One molar glucose solution is made by dissolving one mole(180,000mgs)glucose in one litre of water. Therefore:
$180,000 \mathrm{mgs}$ in $1 \mathrm{~L}=1 \mathrm{M}$ OR 180000 mg in $1000 \mathrm{mls}=1 \mathrm{M}$
$1 \mathrm{M}=1000 \mathrm{mmols}$
$1000 \mathrm{mmols}=180000 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$
$1 \mathrm{mmol}=1 \mathrm{mmol} / 1000 \mathrm{mmmol} \times 180000 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$
$1 \mathrm{mmol}=180 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$
STEP THREE:
$1 \mathrm{mmol}=180 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{L}$
$1 L=10 d L$
Therefore 180 mgs are in 10 dl , how many mgs are in a dl?
$180 \mathrm{mgs}=10 \mathrm{dl}$
$1 \mathrm{dl}=1 / 10 x 180 \mathrm{mgs}=18 \mathrm{mgs}$
1 dl has $18 \mathrm{mgs}=18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}$
Then $1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}=18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}$

Therefore $198 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}=$ ?mmol/l
$1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}=18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}$
$198 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl}=198 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl} / 18 \mathrm{mgs} / \mathrm{dl} \mathrm{X} 1 \mathrm{mmmol} / \mathrm{l}=11 \mathrm{mmol} /$

\section*{QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF KETONES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS INTRODUCTION}
- Energy required for metabolic activities is delivered from glucose
- Insulin and glucagon are important hormones that control blood glucose.
- Made and secreted by the pancrease but have opposite roles
- Insulin enhances entry of glucose into the cells
- Insulin insufficiency, insensitivity and deficiency results causes diabetes mellitus(DM)
- Types of DM of great medical importance -
- IDDM(Type 1 DM),NIDDM(Type 2DM) and gestational DM
- Insulin inactivity causes the body to source energy from fats resulting with formation of ketones
- Three types of ketones---acetone, acetoactate and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-hydroxybutyrate
- Under normal metabolic conditions ketones do not accumulate in blood therefore undetectable
- During starvation, after exercise or at night
- In DM ketones level rises due to:-
- (i)rise in blood glucose levels due to insulin inactivity----No entry of glucose into ICF
- (ii)body cells burning fat for energy production
- (iii) continuous accumulation of ketones as fat is used as source of energy
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a complication which results from accumulation of ketones in the circulation of a diabetic patient
- $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate is the ketone related to the development of DKA
- DKA is more common in IDDM than in NIDDM and DKA is a potentially lethal in either case of DM.

\section*{ANALYSIS OF KETONES}
- Urine(qualitatively) and Blood(quantitatively)

\section*{Urine(qualitatively)}
- Until recently has been the only method of ketones analysis
- Limitation s: (i) could only reveal the presences of ketones BUT NOT the levels
(ii)detects acetone and acetoactate BUT NOT $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (main cause of DKA)
(iii)Urine analysis for ketones is retrospective
(iv)Resolution of ketoacidotic episode is difficult to monitor
(v)Urine specimens not easily obtained in the prsence of dehydration and altered consciousness

\section*{Quantitative analysis}
- This is the analysis of $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate $(\beta-H B)$ using blood specimen
- BENEFITS OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
- (i)gives the actual levels of $\beta-H B$ in blood
- (ii)gives earlywarning of impending DKA
- (iii) the specimen is easily available
- (iv) testing is done prospectively
- (v) iv)Resolution of ketoacidotic episode is easy to monitor

\section*{RENAL FUNCTION , DISODERS AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS}

\section*{(A) THE KIDNEY}
-A normal human being has two pair of kidneys which are located just below the level of the ribs at the back of the body,(retroperitoneal space) one on either side of the spine where they are protected from damage by the rib cage.
- Each kidney weigh (adult kidney) about 150 g and measures approximately 12 cms in length. And it is bean shaped.
- The major structural parts of the kidney include-:
a) Renal artery---this is the blood vessel that brings the cardiac output to the kidney.
b) Renal vein---this is the blood vessel that carries the blood from the kidney to the heart.
c) Central hilus---- this is the location where the renal artery. Renal vein and the ureters enter the kidney.
d) Renal pelvis--- this is the location where all the collecting ducts drain to form the ureter.
e) Calyses--- this is the converging point of the renal pyramaid (made of the collecting ducts). All the calyses join to form the renal pelvis.
f) Medulla--- This is a major point of the kidney which consist of the loop of henle and the collecting ducts.
g) Cortex----This is composed mainly of the glomeruli, proximal and distal tubules

\section*{B) THE FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEY}
-The functions of the kidney may be characterized as EXCRETORY, REGULATORY and ENDOCRINE.

\section*{1) EXCRETORY FUNCTION}
-Serves to rid the body of most of the undesirable end products of metabolism as well as any excess of inorganic substances ingested in the diet. The metabolic waste products include the non-protein nitrogenous compounds (NPN) eg urea, creatinine, and uric acid, a number of other organic acids including amino acids are excreted in small quantities.
- Diet contains a variable and usually excessive supply of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sulphate and bicarbonates. The dramatic efficiency of the excretory function is illustrated by sodium ie body sodium content is maintained essentially constant regardless of whether daily sodium intake is 1 or 150 mmol or more.
- In order to achieve the excretion of the waste metabolic products and the ingested surpluses without disrupting homoestasis (this is the maintenance of the optimal chemical composition of the intra- and extra-cellular fluids through out the body), the kidney must exercise both its excretory and regulatory function.

\section*{2) REGULATORY FUNCTION}
- The regulatory function of the kidney plays a major role in homoestasis (this is the maintenance of the optimal chemical composition of the intra- and extra-cellular fluids through out the body). The mechanism of differential re-absorption and secretion located in the tubules of the nephron are effectors of regulation.(NB will be discussed in details in the formation of urine.\}

\section*{3) ENDOCRINE FUNCTION}
- The endocrine function of the kidney can be regarded as either primary or secondary. Primary because the kidney is an endocrine organ producing hormones eg Renin, Prostagladins and Erythropoeitin.

\section*{A) RENIN}
-Is a proteolytic enzyme synthesized and stored in juxtaglomerular cells located along the afferent arteries of the renal glomeruli. The primary stimuli for rennin release are a decrease in perfusion pressure to the juxtaglomerular apparatus and negative sodium balance. Following stimulation,rennin is released in the blood where it hydrolysis its substrate called angiotensinogen (this is a globulin synthesized in the liver) to produce angiotensin I, which is then rapidly converted to angiotensin ii by the circulating angiotensin- converting enzymes that is abundant in the lung. Angiotensin ii (which is a potent vasoconstrictor) stimulates the cells of the zone glomerulosa to produce aldosterone hormone. The rennin - angiotensin system is an important regulator of blood pressure, it is also responsive to sodium and potassium concentration and regulates the aldosterone effect on sodium-potassium exchange in the distal tubule

\section*{B) PROSTAGLANDINS-}
-These are a series of carbon 20 (C20) unsaturated fatty acids containing a cyclopentane ring. The parent fatty acid is prostanoic acid.
- Prostaglandins appear hormone like in action and are synthesized at the site of action in almost all tissues eg kidney, lung, spleen, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), thyroid, skin and brain.
- Prostaglandins are thought to play a great role in reproduction, blood pressure control and to act as mediators of inflammation. They have been reported to have many pharmacologic actions and have been used therapeutically to induce abortion via uterine smooth muscle contraction. In the kidney they have an effect on sodium concentration and increased free water clearance.

\section*{C) ERYTHROPOETIN}
-This is a glycoprotein hormone in nature produced by the kidney and acts on the bone marrow to stimulate the proliferation and maturation of erythrocytes precursors. Therefore anaemia is a prominent feature in of renal insufficiency.
In the secondary but no less important aspect of kidneys endocrine function, it is a site of degradation of insulin, glucagons and aldosterone. It is also an important location of the hydroxylation of 25-(OH)2D3 that produces 1,25$(\mathrm{OH}) 2 \mathrm{D} 3$,the most active known form of vitamin $\mathrm{D} . \mathrm{nb} /$ progressive , chronic renal failure is regularly associated with a combination of osteomalacia ( inadequate mineralization of bone), due to altered vitamin D metabolism, and osteitis fibrosa cystica, caused by secondary elevation of PTH levels.

\section*{THE NEPHRON}
-This is the functional unit of the kidney. Each kidney has approximately $\mathbf{1}$ million nephrons. The nephron consists structurally of $-: 1$ ) the glomerulus ( which is a spherical epitherial space invaginated by a capillary network that connects the afferent and efferent arterioles and 2) a tubule of epithelial cells continuous with the glomerular epithelial space and ultimately leading to collecting ducts that empty into the renal pelvis
- Three distinct processes take place in each nephron:-
1) The blood flowing through the capillaries of the glomerulus is filtered , the filtrate passing into the tubules through the glomerular membrane =this process is called GLOMERULAR FILTRATION. The glomerular filtrate contains most of the constituents of the blood with the exception of the protein which does not pass through the normal glomerular membrane in any appreciable quantity.
2) As the glomerular filtrate passes through the walls of the tubule, more solutes are added by secretion through the walls of the tubules from the adjoining blood vessels= This process is called TUBULAR SECRETION.
3) Solutes and water pass back into the blood from the tubules through the walls of the tubules $=$ This process is called TUBULAR REABSORPTION

The end product of these three processes passes through larger collecting tubules into the ureters which carry it into the bladder , from where it is excreted through the urethra as urine. The constituent of urine are the products of glomerular filtration plus the products of tubular secretion minus constituents returned into the blood through tubular reaabsorption.

\section*{FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE OPTIMAL FUNCTION OF THE KIDNEY}
-The normal rate of urine formation requires presence of properly functioning kidneys. These kidneys should receive adequate blood supply at a sufficient high pressure.There should be no obstruction to urine out flow. Malfunction in the formation and elimination of urine may be due to :- a) pre-renal causes, 2) renal causes and 3) post-renal causes.
-PRE-RENAL CAUSES
-prerenal causes include those factors affecting blood pressure, blood volume and blood flow eg shock, haemorhage, dehydration, prolonged diarrhaea and cardiac failure.
-RENAL CAUSES
-these are factors that will affect directly the GFR, various tubular activities and renal blood vessels
-POST RENAL CAUSES
- These are factors that will decrease renal function and those that obstruct urine flow . They include :-
(1) renal calculi
(2) carcinoma or tumors that compress the ureter, urethra or bladder opening
(3) enlarged prostrate glands occludes( blocks) the bladder wholly or partially.
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ Chemistry alone cannot differentiate between the three prime causes of renal dysfunction (pre renal, renal and post renal ) hence clinical history and physical examination of the patient is very important.
-Several diseases have bee found to cause renal malfunction and they include:-
-(a) glomerulonephritis----this is a non pus forming inflammation of the glomeruli
(b) nephrotic syndrome---this is a condition characterized by reduction in blood plasma albumin, albuminuria
(c) pyelonephritis---a type of renal infection spreading from the pelvis to the cortex of the kidney, The origin of the infection is usually from the ureter and below or from from the blood stream.
FORMATION OF URINE
-The FORMATION OF THE KIDNEY IS THE KEY ROLE OF THE KIDNEY. The urine formed by the kidney constitutes most of the undesirable end products of metabolism as well as any excess of inorganic substances ingested in the diet.
-The undesirable waste products of metabolism includes non-protein nitrogenous compounds such as urea, creatinine,uric acid . A number of organic acids including amino acids are excreted in small quantities. Excess inorganic substances excreted by the kidney includes sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphates, magnesium, sulphates and bicarbonates.
- In the formation of urine there are several activities involved which includes:
1) Filtration
2) Re-absorption and secretion (tubular function)
3) Hormonal function
1) FILTRATION PROCESS
-The first step in urine formation is filtration at the glomerulus of plasma water driven by a net filtration pressure of about 15 mmhg .
-The filtrate is referred to as ULTRAFILTRATE because its composition is essentially the same as that of that plasma, with notable absence of molecules of mwt above approximately 15,000 daltons.
- Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons and about 170-200 litres of ultraflitrate pass through the glomeruli in 24 hours.nb/ In the passage of the glomeruli filtrate through the tubules, re-absorption of solutes and water in various regions of the tubules reduces the total volume to 0.4-2 litres per day.
- The filtration of blood at the bowmans capsule is a passive process, whereby the flow of fluid from the blood depends on the fact that hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries is greater than that in the tubules lumen.
- Any factor that reduces the pressure gradient will lower the filtration rate. An imbalance in the hydrostatic pressure $2^{0}$ to vascular collapse, renal arterial occlusive disease, inflammatory disease, or obstruction of urinary flow system results in a marked decrease in glomeruli filtration resulting with the formation of scanty urine (oliguria) or no formation of urine at all (anuria). The maintenance of glomeruli filtration is dependent on an adequate renal blood flow rate as well as adequate perfusion pressure. The normal renal blood supply is well designed to meet these needs.
2) RE-ABSORPTION AND SECRETION (TUBULAR FUNCTION)
- In the tubules the solute composition of the ultrafiltrate is altered by the processes of reabsorption and secretion so that the urine excreted may have a completely different composition from that of the original filtered fluid.
- Different regions of the tubule have been shown to specialize in certain functions.
a) In the proximal tubules , $60-80 \%$ of the ultrafiltrate is reabsorbed. This activity is a passive process.
b) Threshold substance ie glucose is also reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. $\mathrm{nb} /$ THRESHOLD SUBSTANCE-----Certain substances almost completely reabsorbed by the tubules when their [ ] in the plasma are relatively low , appear in the urine when their plasma levels are above a certain set point or threshold level.
- High threshold substances such as glucose and amino acids are almost completely reabsorbed by means of specific transport systems in the tubular cells.
- The appearance of high threshold substance in urine is evidence that the filtered load of the substance is exceeding the maximal reabsorption rate of its tubular cell transport system..
- The renal threshold of a filtered compound is therefore that plasma [ ] of the substance at which the tubular reabsorption rate is not sufficiently fast to remove all of the substance from the plasma ultrafiltrate , so that the substance spills over into the urine.
c) In the loop of henle, chloride and more sodium without water are reabsorbed, generating a dilute urine.
d) Water reabsorption in more distal tubules and collecting duct is then regulated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) . In the distal tubules, secretion is the prominent activity. It is in this region that hydrogen ions are secreted in exchange with the reabsorption of sodium ions. Bicarbonates are reclaimed from the urine in aid of acid-base regulation.-In the loop of henle and collecting duct there two mechanisms which are responsible for the nature of urine produced.. These are COUNTER CURRENT MULTIPLICATION and COUNTER CURRENT EXCHANGE..

\section*{**COUNTER CURRENT MULTIPLICATION}
-This is an active process
- It is responsible for the removal of solutes and reabsorption of water from the loop of henle and collecting duct
- This process occurs in the absence of ADH.
- It creates a urine low osmolality (diluted urine).
**COUNTER CURRENT EXCHANGE..
- This is a passive process.
- It is responsible for differential reabsorption of water without solutes from the loop of henle and collecting duct
- This process occurs in the presence of ADH.
- It creates a urine high osmolality (concentrated urine)

\section*{ANTI DIURETIC HORMONE MODE OF ACTION}
-ADH determines the [ ] of urine produced.
- It is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary
- The amount of ADH produced depends on the osmoreceptors present in the hypothalamus which are stimulated by the high plasma osmolality or low plasma volume (hypovolumea).
- ADH causes the pores in the collecting duct to increase in diameter permitting an increase amount of water to be osmoticaly reabsorbed into the renal medulla. The resulting urine osmolality becomes x 5 that of the plasma. - In the absence of ADH, eg in diabetic inspidus or a non response of the collecting tubules to ADH, large volumes of dilute urine results.-
However, at the distal collecting ducts ADH, not only increases the permeability of the cells to water but also to urea. . This is the main reason fro the rise in urinary osmolality.

\section*{RENAL DISORDERS}

INTRODUCTION- There are several renal disorders which are classified according to the clinical presentation and the kidney (nephron) structural change. Consequently, many names for renal diseases actually represent clinical syndromes and their structural basis as revealed by a renal biobsy.
- An additional difficulty in classifying renal diseases is the tendency of distinct primary disease to emerge with time into a single clinical entity, regardless of their initial etiology or anatomic region of injury. This is contributed by the fact that there is a great relationship between the anatomy and function of renal structures and their blood supply. For example any decrease in the normal cardiac output may impair all the functions of the nephron and produce the clinical syndrome of pre-renal azotomia (increased blood urea).If the decrease in the cardiac output is very severe it may lead to injury of the renal tubules and the syndrome of acute renal failure . The injury of the renal tubules triggers the release of renin from the kidney resulting with hypertension. Hypertension is in fact a
complication of many renal diseases of varied causes. Additionally severe hypertension itself can damage renal arterioles, further compromising nephron function.
- Irrespective of the initial cause of the injury whether immunological, injury of the glomerulus or toxic injury to the tubular cells, the ultimate result is the loss of complete nephron.
- Most of the renal disorders will start to be noticed when the nephrons have lost $75 \%$ of their functioning capacity. The loss of $>90 \%$ of the nephrons function resulting to end stage renal disease produces remarkably consistent clinical and laboratory picture. Once the renal disease has reached this stage, it may be impossible to determine the site and nature of the initial injury.
-Some of the renal disorders to be discussed includes: end stage renal failure/disease (ESRD), acute renal failure (ARF), chronic renal failure (CRF), glomerular diseases (GD) (for example-acute glomerulonephritis (GN) and nephrotic syndrome (NS))

\section*{END STAGE RENAL FAILURE (ESRF/ESRD)}
-This is the stage where the kidney has lost entirely (>90\%) its noble functions that is has failed to maintain adequate excretory, regulatory and endocrine function.
- This stage is characterized by the constellation of symptoms, physical signs and abnormal diagnostic studies. These characters can also be referred to as uremic syndrome. The classic signs of uremia includes:- progressive weakness and easy fatigability, hypertension, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, muscle wasting, tremors, abnormal mental function, frequent but shallow respiration and metabolic acidosis.. This syndrome progress to produce stupor, coma, and ultimately death unless support is provided by haemodialysis or successive renal transplantation..

\section*{ACUTE RENAL FAILURE (ARF)}
-This clinical syndrome occurs when there has been a rapid and severe reduction of GFR OF $<10 \mathrm{ML} / \mathrm{MIN}$.
- Patients with ARF are oliguric (reduced urine output) for example will produce $<400 \mathrm{mls}$ of urine after fluid challage.
-During this oliguric state the patient is unable to excrete water and sodium, leading to expansion of ECF which results to oedema, hypertension and congestive heart failure.
- Another feature of ARF is that water is retained in excess of salt producing hyponatreamia (low levels of sodium in the blood). If this hyponatreamia is very severe, central nervous system symptoms results ( for example: seizures and coma).
- Another feature encountered in ARF is inability of the nephron to excreate potassium resulting with life threatening hyperkaleamia (high levels of potassium in the blood).
- Other features seen in ARF are: retention of phosphate leading to hyperphosphotaemia and hypocalcaemia (inadequate mineralization).
- Accumulation of urea and creatinine is evident. When ARF is due to under perfusion (lesser blood supply to the kidney) of the kidney, BUN will accumulate in excess of creatinine ( high bun/creat ratio). The rise in serum creatinine and less often the increase in BUN is used to monitor the degree of renal impairment.
- Patients with ARF develop all symptoms of uremic syndrome. However anaemia and metabolic bone disease seen in CRF are not very prominent.
- Patients with ARF are at risk of getting gastrointestinal haemorrhage and systemic infection which are the major cause of death.
- Some causes of ARF includes:- crush (accident) syndrome, toxic injury to the kidney ( drug toxicity), hypertension and malaria.
- ARF is manageable by the control of the primary cause for example loss of blood (give blood transfusion), drug toxicity( withdrawal of the drug or giving an anti dose), hypertension ( control with hypertensive drugs).
- Recovery from ARF can be achieved by subjecting the patient to haemodialysis.

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS}
-serial monitoring of creatinine, GFR,(creatinine clearance), serum eletrolytes, urine volume, urinalysis and serum and urine osmolality.

\section*{CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE (CRF)}
-Pts who do not recover from ARF may develop CRF if early death does not occur.- CRF is the end result of a variety of many conditions such as: chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic obstructive uropathy, polycystic kidney disease, renal artery blockage and any other condition that causes tubular dysfucntion.
- As ARF progresses without any kind of treatment, more nephrons get damaged and the oliguric nature of the patient changes into anuric nature (total suppression of urine output) due to the fact that all the nephrons have been damaged resulting to no more urine output. The patient is said to be in a total renal shutdown.
-All the symptoms of uremia syndrome are very prominent in patients having CRF.
- Inability to excrete potassium resulting with hyperkalaemia is very evident as in the case of ARF. Hypernatreamia, hperphosphotaemia and hypocalcaemia are also evident.
- If not managed , this condition is often terminal with exceedingly high rise in urea, creatinine, potassium and marked severe acidosis.
- The life of CRF pt can be sustained by haemodialysis or a successive kidney transplant.

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS}
-serial monitoring of creatinine, GFR,(creatinine clearance), serum eletrolytes, uric acid, urine volume, urinalysis and serum and urine osmolality.

\section*{GLOMERULAR DISEASES}
-These are pathological factors that cause direct injury to the renal glomerulus while preserving tubular functions and may resemble pre-renal factors.
- Eventually, chronic progressive glomerular disease will affect blood supply to the tubules and this will result in the loss of complete nephrons producing CRF and the uremic syndrome.
- The two most common glomerular diseases are : acute glomerulonephritis and the nephritic syndrome.

\section*{ACUTE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS}
-This pathological process is related to recent group A beta - haemolytic streptococcal infection. Other causes includes :- reactions to drugs, acute infection of the kidney, systemic disease with immune complexes deposition in the kidney such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), bacterial endocarditis and recent viral infection.
- This condition is characterized by the rapid onset of haematuria, proteinuria, reduced GFR, sodium and water retention resulting to oedema, hypertension and congestive heart failure. Oliguria may also be evident.
- In pts suspected of acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, evidence of recent infection may be found in increased titres of antibodies to streptococcal extracellular products ie Antistreptolysin O (ASO).

\section*{NEPHROTIC SYNDROME}
- This pathological process is related any interference with the normal glomerular filtration processes.
- The glomelular capillary wall is a special membrane which is uniquely designed to support rapid utrafiltration and to retain nearly all proteins with in the plasma..
- The glomerulus capillary wall is composed of three structural elements:-
(i) a layer of endothelial ells
(ii) the glomerular basement membrane that separate the endothelial cells from epithelial cells.
(iii) The outer epithelial cell layer that is attached to the basement membrane by the discrete cytoplasmic extentions.

\section*{DIAGRAMATIC REPRESENTATION OF A GLOMERULUS CAPILLARY WALL}
-These glomerular structures allows for the utrafiltration at a rate that removes approximately $20 \%$ of the plasma water ( with small molecular weight solutes) during transit of plasma through the glomerular capillaries but that restricts passage of protein molecules with mw of $>15000$ daltons eg (albumin)- Apart from the high molecular weight of solutes, molecular shape and charge also affect glomerular flitration eg globular proteins will be less cleared than those similar sized molecules which are linear in shape.
- Molecules that are highly negatively charged exhibit much lower glomerular permeability than do neutral molecules of the same size. This is a strong direct evidence that the filtering membrane has a negative charge that tends to repel negatively charged molecules and thus decrease the effective radius of pores in the membrane as molecules with like charges approach. The glycosialoproteins structures in the membrane provides the negative charge and any factor that may injure, decrease or alter the glycosialoprotein content of the basement membrane will be the cause of nephrotic syndrome. Circulating polyanions eg albumin are thought to be repelled by the rich distribution of the inner barriers of the negatively charged glycosialoproteins coat.
- An established case of nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria (massive proteinuria of $>3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ), hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hyperlipidaemia.
- GFR is usually depressed.
- The loss of albumin in urine overwhelmes hepatic synthesis capacity and hypoalbuminaemia results ( $<3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ).
- Loss of intravascular onchotic pressure results in oedema which is enhanced by sodium and water retention.
- The genesis of hyperlipaedemia is not het clear.

CAUSE OF N/S
(i) primary renal disease---most types of glomerulonephritis usually due to deposition of immune complexes (SLE) on the glomeruli. This accounts to $80 \%$ of all $\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{s}$ cases.
(ii) secondary renal diseases eg diabetic mellitus, amyloidosis(bilateral destruction of adrenal glands by an autoimmune disease), SLE, malaria and renal vein thrombosis.
(iii) other causes are drugs and toxins.

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS}
(i) urinalysis---to detect proteinuria
(ii) total serum/plasma protein and albumin estimation------to detect hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia
(iii) serum protein electrophoresis------alpha 2 and beta globulins are usually increased.
(iv) serum IgG -----usually decreased while the other are normal.
(v) serum binding proteins-----eg transferring, transcortin and thyroxine binding globulin are usually decreased.Also decreased are total serum iron, t3(triiodothyronine) and t4 (thyroxine
(vi) lipid profile----total cholesterol and triglycerides will be elevated.

\section*{RENAL CALCULI}

Renal calculi are usually composed of products of metabolism present in normal glomerular filtrate often at concentration near their maximum solubility. Minor changes in urinary composition may cause precipitation of such constituents in the kidney or in the urinary tract.

\section*{CONDITION FAVOURING CALCULI FORMATION}
(1) A high urinary concentration of one or more constituents of the glomerular filtration due to :-
(a) low urine volume with normal renal function due to restricted fluid intake or excessive fluid loss over a long period of time.
(b) a high rate of excretion of the metabolic product forming stone, due to high plasma levels than the filtrate levels or impairment of tubular re-absorption from the filtrate.
(c) change in ph of the urine often due to bacterial infection which favours precipitation of different salts at different hydrogen ion concentration (ph).
(d) urinary stagnation due to obstruction to urinary flow .
(e) lack of normal inhibitors:- eg pyrophosphate and glycoprotein which prevents the formation of calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate crystals respectively.
- Renal calculi (urinary calculi) constitute the following:-
(a) calcium containing salts----between $70-80 \%$ of all renal stones contain calcium.

Precipitation is favoured by hypercalciuria. Alkaline conditions favouring calcium phosphate precipitation and stone formation are usually present in pts with CRF due to urease spliting organisms such as proteus valgaris. These stones are usually hard, white and radiopaque.They are also small in size and are usually lodged in the ureters.
The management of these stones involves;-
** treatment of the primary cause eg urinary infection
** treatment of hypercalcaemia (by reducing dietary intake).
** maintain a high fluid intake both day and night
** use of thiazide diuretics to reduce urinary calcium excretion.
(b) Uric acid stones------This constitutes $10 \%$ of all renal stones. They are associated with hyperuricaemia with or without clinical gout. Precipitation is favoured by acidic urine. The stones are usually small, yellowish brown.
The management of these stones involves:-
** treatment of hyperuricaemia by reducing purine intake.
** increase renal excretion of urates by taking uricosuric drugs(probenecid and salicylates)
** a lot of fluid intake is encouraged both day and night.
(C) Cystine--- these stones are very rare and when present they resemble uric acid stones.
(d) xanthine stones - these are very uncommon and when present may be due to rare inborn error called xanthinuria. They have been reported during treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Such as allopurinol, which impair the conversion of xanthine to uric acid.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF RENAL DISORDERS}
(1) DIALYSIS
-Dialysis helps to remove urea and other toxic substances from plasma and collects electrolytes balance by dialyzing the patient's blood against fluid containing no urea and appropriate concentration of electrolytes, free ionized calcium and other plasma constituents.
-The principle forms of dialysis includes:-

\section*{(a)HAEMODIALYSIS}
- In haemodialysis, blood is passed through an artificial kidney(DIALYZER) . This dialyzer contains a fliud (dialyzing fluid or dialysate) which consists mainly of water . The water that make this dialysate is highly purified . The dialysate does not contain any of the substances intended to be cleared from the blood eg urea and creatinine. It
does contain some of the substances the body needs such as calcium and biocarbonates. The following are the function of the dialysis machine:-
(a) it pumps blood from the patient via the patients access (which can be either catheter (blood lines),fistula(an artery joined to a vein) or a graft (placed between an artery and a vein)., around the machine and back to the patient.
(b)it mixes and warms the dialysate which passes through the artificial kidney.
(c) it monitors what is in the dialysate to make sure the right amount of the right substance s are there throughout the dialysis session.
(d) it checks the blood for air so that none gets into the patients bloodstream. (prevents air embolism)
(e) it monitors the pressure of the patients blood in the access .
- NOTE / during dialysis , heparin is added into the blood circulating in the dialyzer to be prevent any formation of clots.
-The number of sessions and the dialyis period depends on :
(a) the amount of waste in the blood (urea and creatinine levels)
(b) the body size of the patient

\section*{(b) HAEMODIAFILTRATION}
-This is an improved form of haemodialysis where large volumes of water and solutes can be removed through a highly permeable membrane.

\section*{(c) CONTINOUS AMBULATORY PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (CAPD)}
- The folds of peritoneum are used as the dialyzing membranewith capillaries on one side and appropriate fluid of high osmolality infused into the peritoneum on the other side.
- After a suitable time to allow for equilibrium of diffusible solutes depending on the type of peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum cavity is drained and cycle repeated.

\section*{THE FOLLOWING CAN BE NOTED ON DIALYSIS}
(1) Dialysis is used in cases of ARF until renal function improves OR as a regularly repeated procedure in suitable cases of CRF.
(2) Dialysis may also be used to prepare a patient for kidney transplantation and maintain him/her until the transplant function adequately.
(3) dialysis will not cure the patient and will not get rid of the renal disorder symptoms. It only control the symptoms and prevent the patient from dying. The renal function achievement of either PD and HD is only $10 \%$ of the function the two normal kidneys. Comparatively the achievement of HD over that of PD is 15-20\%. PD is slow in removing potassium, hence when hyperkalemia is the prime indication for dialysis, HD is the preffered and more efficient means of treatment unless contraindicated.
- Even though dialysis technology has its limitations, it stands today as one of the management of renal failure and it is advisable to start this treatment as early as possible.

\section*{(2) KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION}
- This is a procedure whereby a renal patient receives a suitable kidney from a suitable donor. Almost anyone can donate a kidney. However, there are some situations where live kidney donation would not be possible. These includes people with the following conditions: (i) HIV or AIDS- related infection, hepatitis b,c and e infection (ii) major heart or breathing problems (iii) diabetes (either type) (iv) significant kidney disease (v) cancers (vi) hypertention (vii) intravenous drug abuse (viii) pregnancy (ix) having one kidney ( x ) $<18$ years and $>65$ years (xi) psychiatric disorders.
-Donors and recipient must be compatible ie same blood group and their tissues should match. The tissue typing (genetic make-up) should score $>65 \%$ match.
- Transplantation of kidney into immunologically suitable recipient corrects many of the abnormalities of CRF that HD only partially corrects.
- The only major problem encountered by the recipient is the rejection of the transplanted kidney .the medication given to the recipient to prevent rejection causes the body immunity to go down since the drugs are immunosuppresants. (eg cyclosporine).The most immediate danger is the infection by opportunistic organisms such as fungi, protozoa, and certain bacteria.
- Biochemical monitoring of renal transplant is designed to detect deterioration of function of the transplanted kidney especially as it relates to delayed rejection of the graft.. Several monitoring of creatinine is very important in early recognition of decline in GFR.

\section*{LIVING KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS}

This involves the transplantation of a kidney to a recipient whereby the kidney is either :-
(i) from a living donor who is related to the recipient by blood eg a brother, sister, mother, father,
uncle , aunt, first cousin. This type of transplantation will require the donor and the recipient to tissue match $>65 \%$ for any transplantation to commence.
(ii) From a living donor who is not related to the recipient by blood.This type of donors donate one of
their kidneys to the kidney bank where tissue typing is done. The prospective recipient must tissue match $>65 \%$ with the non- related donor for transplantation to commence.

\section*{CADAVERIC KIDNEY TRANSPLANT}
-This involves the transplantation of a kidney to a recipient whereby the kidney is from a kidney bank. The donor of the kidney may be dead (cadaveric). Cadaveric are people who have been declared brain stem dead in hospital intensive care units. Brain stem death means the donor brain is completely dead, with no chance of recovery. However in this situation many organs (including the kidneys) are still functioning. The most common cause of the brain death is a head injury resulting from a road traffic accident or a brain haemorrhage.
-- A tissue match is done and the cadaveric kidney musthave a good tissue match( $65 \%$ ) with that of the cadaveric donor.

\section*{RENAL FUNCTION TESTS}

These are a panel of tests carried nout in the clinical chemistry laboratory to investigate the functioning of the kidney. The panel has the following analytes:-blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes, creatinine, uric acid and creatinine clearance test.

\section*{BLOOD UREA NITROGEN(BUN)}

Urea is the major nitrogen containing metabolic product of protein metabolism in human.
Over $90 \%$ of urea excretion is through the kidney and $10 \%$ is through the skin and gastrointestinal tract.. Urea is filtered freely by the glomerulus. In the normal kidney $40-70 \%$ of the highly diffusible urea moves passively out of the renal tubules and enters the interstitium ultimately to re-enter plasma. The back diffusion of urea is dependent on the urine flow rate, and more enters the interstitium in a slow-flow state
-A wide variety of renal diseases can cause an increase in plasma urea concentration. Unfortunately , the usefulness of urea as an independent indicator of renal function is limited by the variability of its blood levels as a result of non renal factors. Mild dehydration, high protein diet , increased protein catabolism, muscle wasting as in starvation, reabsorption of blood proteins after a gastrointestinal haemorrage , treatment with cortisal or its synthetic analogs.
-The principal clinical utility of of plasma urea determination lies in its measurement conjunction with plasma creatinine.. Clinicians calculate a convenient relationship ie BUN/CREAT ratio. Normal individual on a normal diet has a ratio of 12-20. Lower values indicate acute tubular necrosis, low protein intake starvation or severe liver disease. High ratio may be seen in case of catabolic states of tissue breakdown, prerenal azotomia, high protein intake or after G.I HAEMORRAGE.. Thus the bun/creatinine can show great variability and is only a rough guide to the nature of the underlying abnormality.

\section*{METHODS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF UREA.}

\section*{(1)Berthelot Reaction}

\section*{(2) Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GLUDH)}

SPECIMEN: serum or urine is suitable for assay. plasma is also suitable provided that the anticoagulant used contains neither ammmonium nor flouride salts. flouride inhibits urease since it is an enzyme poison. the best anticoagulant is heparin. Urea is stable in serum for up to 24 hrs at room temperature, for at least a week at (4-8) ${ }^{0} \mathrm{c}$. and for several months when frozen at $-70^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.

RREFERENCE RANGES:- $(2.7-8.3) \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ as quoted in literature. It is recommended that each laboratory or laboratories in the same geographical location should establish their own ref.ranges based on the population in that region.
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ Neonates have lowe r urea levels than adults due to the kidney size whilst old persons above 70 years have higher levels due to the deterioration rate of the kidney functions.

\section*{CREATININE}
-This is the spontaneous degradation product of creatine in the muscles. The formation of creatinine is reasonably constant and has a direct relationship to the body muscle mass.
- Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomerulus but it is not reabsorded to any appreciable extent if at all under normal circumstance. A small but significant amount of creatinine is also excreted by active tubular secretion, which increases with increasing plasma creatinine [ ].
- The formation and excretion of creatinine which is usually constant, makes it one of the best renal fuction test.
- By virtual of its relative independence of such factors as diet ,hydration and protein metabolism, plasma creatinine is significantly a more reliable screening test for renal function than blood urea nitrogen.
- in relation to sex, men have a higher normal creatinine than women since males have a greater muscle mass than females, whilst children due to their small body mass have lower normal creatinine.

\section*{DETERMINATION OF CREATININE BY \\ * JAFFE REACTION METHOD \\ * SARCOCINE ENZYMATIC METHOD}

KENYAN BASED REFERENCE RANGES:MEN=(68-128)UMOL/L:WOMEN: = (60-122) UMOL/L

\section*{CREATININE CLEARANCE(CrCL)}

This is so far one of the best clearance test to determine the clearance capability of the kidney. In essence it estimates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Creatinine is released into the circulation at a relatively constant rate and has a stable plasma concentration. Creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized by the kidney.
The CrCL as a measure of GFR has several unique advantages over the clearance of inulin or other exogenous substances. Not only are plasma and urine creatinine easily measured, but extensive data are available for reference ranges of both plasma creatinine and CrCL in individuals of all age groups. Therefore CrCL remains the most practicableand popular method for estimating GFR in most hospitals. Linear decrease of CrCL over time , as renal function fails has been thoroughlydocumented in cases such as diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis. - In the management of renal diseases and monitoring of chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients, creatinine clearance is the first choice test.

\section*{LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF CrCL}
-urine is collected over a period of 24 hrs and preserved in a container with 10 mls conc hcl, thymol or toluene whereby the first urine during this time is discarded and the last one included.NB/ if no preservative is available, the urine can be refrigerated all throughout the collection period
- Blood specimen is collected within this 24 hrs due to its constant nature in the plasma.
- creatinine estimation is done using the standard method of creatinine estimation.
- the following formula reffered to as standard formula is used for the calculation of CrCL for a an average adult

24 hrs Urine volume(mls) x urine creatinine (umol/l

\section*{Serum creatinie (umol/l) x 1440 min}

NB/ (1)FALSELY low values will be obtained if the collected urine is not refrigerated and / or a bacterial inhibitor (thymol, conc hcl or toloune )is not added to the urine container.
(2) the urine creatinine concentration should be determined no later than 24 hrs after collection

Acidity or alkalinity of the urine (as a result of bacterial metabolism)promotes the conversion of creatinine to creatine, which is not measured directly by Jaffe reaction method. Bacteria in addition to causing a change in PH of the urine also produces creatinase which destroy creatinine.
REFERENCE RANGES OF CrCL(as quated in literature)MEN $=(85-125) \mathrm{ML} / \mathrm{MIN}$ : WOMEN: $=(75-115)$ ML/MIN.
KENYAN BASED REFERENCE RANGES:MEN= (52-110)ML/MIN: WOMEN: = (50-92) ML/MIN
$\mathrm{NB} /$ the difference in the reference ranges is due to the differences in gfr and also to the fact that males have more muscles than females.

\section*{ESTIMATED CREATININE CLEARANCE (Ecrcl)}

This is achieved by the use of COCKCROFT AND GAULT formula which use the following characters (factors):

\section*{ELECTROLYTES}

The electrolytes to be covered under renal function tests are:- sodium, potassium and chlorides .

\section*{(1) SODIUM -}

This is the major cation of the extracellular fliud, representing approximately $90 \%$ of the $154 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ of inorganic cations per liter of plasma water.. Thus sodium ions are responsible for almost half the osmolality of the plasma and play a central role in maintaining the normal distribution of water and osmotic pressure in the extracellular fluid compartment.
- The average daily diet contains $130-260 \mathrm{mmol}(8-15 \mathrm{~g})$ of sodium chloride, which is nearly completely absorbed from the GIT . Since the body requirement is only $1-2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{d}$ the excess is excreted in the urine. The kidneys are the ultimate regulators of the amount of sodium and potassium in the body.
- Sodium is initially filtered by the glomeruli, but approximately $90 \%$ of the filtered load is reabsorbed in the renal tubules along with bicarbonates, chloride and water.
- HYPONATREMIA (decreased plasma sodium cocentration) is a predictable consequence of decreased intake of sodium , particularly when low intake is complicated by unusual losses.. Depletional hyponatremia may be the result of excessive sweating, prolonged vomiting, persistent diarrhea, or salt losing enteropathies (ie conditions in which sodium loss is greater than water loss). The dilutional type of hyponatremia is secondary to excessive retention of water. This is seen in conditions such as edema, ascites in chronic cardiac failure, uncontrolled diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis , nephritic syndrome and malnutrition.
- HYPERNATREMIA( increased plasma sodium concentration) is often attributable to excessive loss of sodium poor body fluids ie to water loss disproportionate to sodium loss as may occur in profuse sweating ,vomiting and diarrhea or polyuria. Other causes are decreased production of ADH, decreased tubular sensitivity to the hormone. and osmotic diuresis.
- other causes are due to accumulation of sodium as in inappropriate forms of parenteral therapy with saline solution or high salt intake without corresponding intake of water.

\section*{DETERMINATION OF SODIUM}
(A) SPECIMENS---Serum, heparinized , plasma, sweat, urine, feces or gastrointestinal fluid .IF plasma is used for assay, the lithium or ammonium saltof heparin should be used as anticoagulant. urine should be collected without any addition of preservative.

REFERENCE RANGES AS QUOTED IN LITERATURE FOR SODIUM $=136-148 \mathrm{MMOL} / \mathrm{L} . \mathrm{NB} / \mathrm{NO}$

\section*{DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS.}

\section*{POTASSIUM}

Potassium is a major intracellular, cation. In pathological conditions it is either reduced [hypokalemia]or elevated [hyperkalemia,].

\section*{LIVER, LIVER DISODERS AND LIVER FUNCTION TESTS PROFILE}

The liver is the largest organ inside the body and the most metabolically active. In an adult, it is about the size of a football and weighs close to three pounds. It is located behind the ribs in the upper right-hand portion of the abdomen. Shaped like a triangle, the liver is dark reddish-brown and consists of two main lobes. There are over 300 billion specialized cells in the liver that are connected by a well organized system of bile ducts and blood vessels called the biliary system (Perez and Lima, 2007).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/bfb3019b-79e8-423f-8b6c-d79a04912b7c-055.jpg?height=615&width=931&top_left_y=799&top_left_x=249)

This complex organ performs multiple interrelated functions that are essential for life, including: 1) uptake, storage, metabolism, and release of nutrients (e.g., amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals); 2) synthesis of bile salts from cholesterol and their secretion to assist with fat absorption and digestion; 3) synthesis and secretion of plasma proteins necessary for blood clotting and transport of molecules through the circulation; 4) detoxification of drugs, hormones, and the endproducts of metabolism and distribution to the bile or urine for excretion; and 5) removal of bacteria and dying red blood cells from the circulation. This functional complexity is attested by the fact that reconstitution of the organ in the form of an artificial or bioartificial liver capable of supporting patients with liver failure has yet to be achieved (Franzese et al., 1997).
The liver is subject to damage by a wide variety of diseases. Viruses, bacterial infections, toxins, and several forms of cancer are a few of the possible causes of liver disease. Some diseases cause very sudden and severe liver damage and others are slow and insidious. If the disease progresses slowly, symptoms of disease may not appear for many months, but the liver may be slowly destroyed. A normal liver has a lot of excess capacity. By the time signs appear in some slow moving diseases, $3 / 4$ of the liver may already have been destroyed. On the other hand, many liver problems are mild or short lived, and the liver is very good at healing and regenerating itself once the cause of the disease is under control (Tessier et al., 2002 ).
Liver disease (also called hepatic disease) is a broad term describing any single number of diseases affecting the liver. Many are accompanied by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red
blood cells; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile. Some of the liver diseases includes; hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, cystic Fibrosis, cancer, wilson's disease, gilbert's disease and glycogen storage disease type II

\section*{HEPATITIS}

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. The condition can be self-limiting (healing on its own) or can progress to fibrosis (scarring) and cirrhosis. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to jaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise (Armstrong et al., 2000). Hepatitis is acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persists longer. A group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses (hepatitis $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$ and E) cause most cases of hepatitis worldwide, but it can also be due to toxins (notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvent and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases (Marc et al., 2009).

\section*{ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE}

Research established a firm connection between heavy alcohol consumption and liver disease. Studies show that the amount of alcohol consumed and the duration of that consumption are closely associated with cirrhosis. The most prevalent types of alcoholic liver disease are fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Often, as people continue to drink heavily, they progress from fatty liver to hepatitis to cirrhosis. The disorders can also occur together, however, and liver biopsies can show signs of all three in some people (Mandayam et al., 2004). About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with alcoholism develop cirrhosis, but many survive it. Many are unaware that they have it, and about 30 percent to 40 percent of cirrhosis cases are discovered at autopsy (Douds et al., 2003).

\section*{NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD)}

NAFLD refers to a group of conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol. This is a chronic liver disease that affects a high proportion of the world's population. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress play a critical role in the pathogenesis. The clinical implications of NAFLD are derived mostly from its common occurence in the general population as well as its potential to progress to cirrhosis and liver failure (Paul and Keith, 2002). NAFLD affects $10-24 \%$ of the general population from different countries. The prevalence of NAFLD, however, increases significantly to $57.5-74 \%$ in obese individuals. NAFLD affects $2.6 \%$ of children 10 and this figure increases to $22.5-52.8 \%$ in the obese child population. NAFLD is the cause of asymptomatic elevation of aminotransferases in $42-90 \%$ of cases once other causes of liver disease are excluded and represents a common explanation for abnormal liver tests in blood donors (Ballentani et al., 2000). Clinical, biochemical and imaging studies are of value in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with NAFLD, but liver biopsy remains the most sensitive and specific means of providing important diagnostic and prognostic information (Chin and Zobair, 2008).

\section*{LIVER CIRRHOSIS}

Cirrhosis is a potentially life-threatening condition of the liver that refers to scarring of the liver which results in abnormal liver function as a consequence of chronic (long-term) liver injury.

This scarring replaces healthy tissue and prevents the liver from working normally. Cirrhosis usually develops after years of liver inflammation. When chronic diseases cause the liver to become permanently injured and scarred, the condition is called Cirrhosis. Cirrhosis harms the structure of the liver and blocks the flow of blood. The loss of normal liver tissue slows the processing of nutrients, hormones, drugs, and toxins by the liver. Also, the production of proteins and other substances made by the liver is suppressed (Rockey, 2005).
Cirrhosis affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. In the United States, approximately 5.5 million people ( $2 \%$ of the U.S. population) are affected by cirrhosis. Cirrhosis causes 26,000 deaths each year and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States among adults between the ages of 25 and 64. There also is a great toll in terms of human suffering, hospital costs, and the loss of work by people with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis has many causes. In the United States, chronic alcoholism is the most common cause. Cirrhosis also may result from chronic viral hepatitis (types B, C, and D and autoimmune hepatitis). Other causes of Cirrhosis include blocked bile ducts, fats in the liver (Steatohepatitis), and many inherited diseases. Prolonged exposure to environmental toxins can also lead to Cirrhosis .

\section*{CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF)}

Evidence of chronic liver disease is found in $25 \%$ of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is the cause of liver decompensation in $2-3 \%$. Studies suggest that approximately $20-25 \%$ of CF patients will develop liver disease but only $6-8 \%$ of these will have established cirrhosis, majority of which will present in the first 20 years of life. The marked variation in the presence and severity of disease may be due to modifier genes (Corbett et al., 2004). Most cases are detected on routine screening and only a small proportion present with variceal bleeding, ascites or persistent jaundice. Abnormalities of liver function tests have a low sensitivity and specificity and the presence of established cirrhosis will be diagnosed on imaging

\section*{LIVER CANCER}

Liver cancer can refer to a variety of malignant diseases that are either primary or secondary to the liver. Primary liver cancers, which originate in the liver, include hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and several other rarer forms. The liver is also a frequent site for secondary tumors that have metastasized, most frequently from colorectal, breast, or gastric cancers (Llovet et al., 2005).

HCC comprises more than 80 percent of primary liver cancers in most countries. Concern about HCC has been growing recently due to the recognition of the magnitude of the problem in many developing countries and because of the striking increase in its incidence in the United States and other developed, western countries in recent years. The incidence of HCC has doubled over the last two decades in the United States. This chapter focuses on the problem of HCC (AJCC, 2010).

\section*{WILSON'S DISEASE}

Wilson's disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene, with resultant impairment of biliary excretion of copper. Subsequent copper accumulation, first in the liver but ultimately in the brain and other tissues, produces classical clinical manifestations that may include hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and other derangements (Walshe, 2000). A prevalence rate of 30 cases per million (or one per 30,000 ) and a birth incidence rate of one per 30,000 to 40,000 are often quoted. It has been estimated that there are approximately 600 cases of Wilson's disease in the United States and that approximately $1 \%$ of the population are carriers (Olivarez et al., 2001).

In approximately 40 to $50 \%$ of individuals with Wilson's disease, hepatic dysfunction is the initial clinical manifestation. The average age of onset for those who present with hepatic symptoms is 11.4 years.

\section*{LIVER FUNCTION TESTS}

Liver function tests is a profile that is composed of the following analytes:-total protein(TP), albumin(ALB), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase(AST),Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT or $\gamma$ GT) , Total bilirubin (T BILI) and Direct bilirubin (D BILI) .This profiles investigates the health status of the liver thereby diagnizing the pathological disorders affecting the liver. The specimen of choice for allthe following parameters are either serum or heparinized plasma

Total protein (TP): *reference range in literature (62-83G/L)
Albumin (ALB) *reference range in literature (30-52G/L)
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) *reference range in literature (98-279U/L)
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)_*reference range in literature (<42U/L)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) *reference range in literature (<39 U/L)
Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) *reference range in literature (Male:5-45U/L, female: 5-35U/L

Total bilirubin (T bili) *reference range in literature (<23umol/L)
Direct bilirubin (D BILI) *reference range in literature (<4.3umol/L)

\section*{CALCIUM (CAL) METABOLISM AND RELATED DISORDERS}

Calcium is a mineral that helps build strong bones and teeth. Calcium and phosphorus in the mineral phase of the hard tissue i.e. bone and teeth co-exist in a relatively fixed proportions. The three main regulators of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis are parathyroid hormone,vitamin D and calcitonin each exert independent effects on both ions. Intracellularly, calcium is the prime inorganic messenger for regulation of cell functions. Calcium is needed throughout an individual's life and the amount required changes over time. A lot of calcium is required during childhood years to build strong bone, a bit less during the middle years to keep bones strong, and much later in life to prevent bone loss.
Pathological conditions associated with calcium levels in blood are hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia. These are determined in relation to the reference ranges of calcium in a particular population. Hypercalcemia is a condition of elevated levels of calcium in plasma and it is a common metabolic abnormality frequently related to primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Hypercalcaemia affects 8 in 100,000 individuals and it common between the ages 40-50 years. In relation to gender, females are more affected than males. Studies have identified hypercalcaemia as a complication in critically ill patient with adrenal insufficiency. Hypercalcemia has been reported to occur not only with primary hypoadrenalism but also with secondary hypoadrenalism .
Hypocalcaemia is a condition of low calcium levels in plasma. It manifests as a symptom of. Hypocalcemia is a common condition characterized by a net loss of calcium from extracellular fluid in greater quantities than can be replaced by the intestine or bone. Hypocalcemia is caused by a number of clinical entities eg a parathyroid hormone [PTH] deficiency/malfunction, a Vitamin D deficiency, or unusually high magnesium levels hypermagnesaemia, or low magnesium levels hypomagnesaemia and often presents with signs of generalized neuromuscular irritability including paresthesia, muscle cramps, laryngospasm, tetany, and seizures. Osteomalacia (adults) and rickets (children) are disease conditions encountered in hypocalcaemia and similar to hypophosphotaemia.

\section*{PHOSPHORUS (PHOS) METABOLISM AND RELATED DISORDERS}

Phosphorus is also an abundant element in the body. At least $85 \%$ is found in the bone whilst the other $15 \%$ is found mostly combined with lipids proteins, carbohydrates and other organic substances. Most phosphorus in the extracellular fluid is inorganic. Major organs involved in phosphorus homeostasis are small intestines, kidneys and the skeleton, which acts as a storage reservoir. Phosphorus is present virtually in all foods. Consequently dietary deficiencies do not occur. Dietary intake is between $800-1000 \mathrm{mg}$ for adults and is mostly from milk and other dairy product.
Pathological conditions related to phosphorus are hypophosphotaemia (reduced phosphorus levels) and hyperphosphotaemia (elevated phosphorus levels). Hypophosphotaemia is a common condition is critically ill patient and its aetiology multifactorial. Phosphate plays an important role in the glycolysis and the production of high energy compounds such as Adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Evidence of its depletion in critically ill patients may manifest itself as impairment in respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular and haematological function.
Osteomalacia (adults) and rickets (children) are caused by an inadequate supply of vitamin D leading to inadequate mineralisation of bone matrix. Vitamin $D$ deficiency is most often caused by nutritional deficiency but can be secondary to a wide range of other underlying causes, such as disorders of the gut, pancreas, liver and kidney. Vitamin D deficiency causes a low calcium and phosphate, which lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Normal bone mineralisation depends on adequate calcium and phosphate and this is maintained by vitamin D. Vitamin D is supplied either in the diet or produced from a precursor in the skin following exposure to ultraviolet light. $90 \%$ of our daily vitamin D requirement is usually obtained by the action of sunlight on the skin and $10 \%$ is obtained from the diet. It has been estimated that 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency. One study found the prevalence of rickets in non-Caucasian children to be $1.6 \%$. In the United Kingdom, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in all adults is about $14.5 \%$ and possibly more than $30 \%$ in those over 65 years old.
Hyperphosphatemia is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is an abnormally elevated level of phosphate in the blood. Often, calcium levels are lowered (hypocalcemia) due to precipitation of phosphate with the calcium in tissues. Chronic renal failure is a cause of hyperphosphotaemia whereby kidneys aren't working well, there is increased phosphate retention. Drugs can also cause hyperphosphatemia e.g taking oral sodium phosphate solutions
prescribed for bowel preparation for colonoscopy in children. Studies have shown the association of hyperphosphotaemia with increased mortality in patient with end stage renal disease undergoing hamodialysis. In these patients, hyperphosphotaemia causes cardiovascular calcification CVC has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and valvular heart disease.

\section*{HORMONES THAT REGULATE CALCIUM AND PHOPHORUS CONCENTRATION IN THE CIRCULATION}

The three primary regulators of calcium and phosphorus are parathyroid hormone(PTH), calcitonin(CT) and 1,25dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(1,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}\right.$

\section*{PARATHYROID HORMONE (PTH)}
-Synthesized by the parathyroid glands located on the posteriorsurface of the thyroid gland.
-Its primary role is the regulation of ECF calcium concentration. Synthesis and secretion of PTH is under precisefeedback regulation by the concentration of ionized calcium in the circulation.PTH synthesis and secretion are stimulated within a few minutes by low concentration of calcium whilst high concentration of calcium suppresses secretion.
-although PTH affects the concentration of phosphorus in the circulation, high or low levels of phosphorus does not have a direct effect on the secretion of PTH.
-It stimulates osteoclasts to mobilize calcium from bones
- it increases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium

It inhibits proximal renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus it promotes bone formation in certain circumstances after PTH binds to membrane receptors of target organs

\section*{THE NET EFFECTS OF PTH ARE INCREASES IN PLASMA CALCIUM AND A DECREASE IN PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION.}

\section*{CALCITONIN}
-Produced by C cells of the thyroid gland.
- it role is to decrease resorption of calcium and phosphorus from bone by inhibiting the action of osteoclasts leading to lower plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus.
- CT has its greatest physiological effect in the fetus and young children, probably because bone calcium turn over is very rapid at this stage of development.
-plasma CT levels are are higher in neonate and in pregnant and lactating women than in normal adults. CT may have a function in promoting deposition of calcium in the skeleton of the human fetus and may be a causative factor in neonatal hypocalcemia.

\section*{VITAMIN D AND ITS METABOLITES}

There are two families: VIT $D_{3}$ (cholecalciferol)-is the natural form produced by the skin from the action of sunlight. VIT $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (Ergocalciferol)-manufactured commercially from precursors of plant origin.
-to exert its physiological action, Vit D must undergo two hydroxylations both of which are catalyzed by specific hydroxylases (OHase) . The first takes place in the liver where Vit D is converted to 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25$(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$. The latter is transported to the kidney by vit d binding proteins, where it undergoes further hydroxylation to either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(1,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}\right)$ or 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(24,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}\right.$.
FUNCTION: - Vit D----(1,25-(OH)2---1,25-(dihydroxyvitamin D)-is the most potent of the known metabolite of vit D . It has a rapid and powerful stimulatory action on membrane transport of calcium. When calcium mobilization is required, 1-OHase activity is stimulated and synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2 D takes place. When calcium mobilization is unnecessary or would be detrimental to the individual, 1 -hydroxylation ceases and $25-(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{D}$ is converted to inactive $24,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$.
$1,25-(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \mathrm{D}$ has the following biological actions:
- Stimulates calcium absorption by the small intestine
- Stimulates phosphorus absorption by the small intestine
- Stimulates calcium resorption from bones, in this action,PTH acts synergistically
- It increases calcium reabsorption by the distal renal tubules.

In summary, the net effect of 1,25-(OH)2 D , is an increase in plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations.

\section*{REGULATION OF CALCIUM AND PHOPHORUS METABOLISM}
-The concentration of calcium and phosphorus in plasma are determined by the balance between absorption and excretion in the kidneys, the intestine and to a small extent the skin, and by exchanges between plasma, ECF and tissues including bone.
- These dynamic processes are determined by many factors , principally parathyroid hormone (PTH),calcitonin (CT) and vitamin D. The actions of these three hormones results in a remarkably precise control of the plasma calcium concentration in healthy individuals.
-In the case of plasma phosphorus concentration regulation, PTH exerts a particularly important effect by inhibiting phosphate reabsorption by the kidney tubules. Therefore PTH lowers the plasma phosphorus concentration.

\section*{CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS RELATED DISODERS}

Rickets (AND Osteomalacia) ----- is a softening of bones in children due to deficiency or impaired metabolism of vitamin $\mathrm{D},{ }^{[1]}$ phosphorus or calcium, ${ }^{[2]}$ potentially leading to fractures and deformity. Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries. The predominant cause is a vitamin D deficiency, but lack of adequate calcium in the diet may also lead to rickets (cases of severe diarrhea and vomiting may be the cause of the deficiency). Although it can occur in adults, the majority of cases occur in children suffering from severe malnutrition, usually resulting from famine or starvation during the early stages of childhood.Osteomalacia is a similar condition occurring in adults, generally due to a deficiency of vitamin D.
(1)OSTEOPOROSIS----describes a group of diseases of diverse causes that are characterized by the reduction of bone mass that is required for normal mechanical function even though the ration of mineral to the organic matter is normal.
-It can be secondary to well defined condations such as cushings disease, glucorticoid administration and chronic immobilization. Most often it is primary and not associated to any definite disease.
-Idiopathic osteoporosis is the most common skeletal abnormality in post menopause women and it is frequently seen in aged individuals.
LAB FINDINGS----- Normal calcium and phosphorus. Raised calcium when the pt is immobilized and raised ALP in a pt that has a fractured bone.
FURTHER NOTES

\section*{RICKETS}

Young babies with rickets can be fussy and have soft skulls. Infants and toddlers may not develop, walk, or grow well. Older children may have bone pain and bowed legs, or their wrists and knees may get wider.

The most common cause of rickets is a lack of vitamin D or calcium in a child's diet. Both are essential for children to develop strong and healthy bones. Sources of vitamin D are: sunlight your skin produces vitamin D when it's exposed to the sun, and we get most of our vitamin D this way.
To prevent rickets, make sure your child eats foods that contain vitamin D naturally - fatty fish such as salmon and tuna, fish oil and egg yolks - or that have been fortified with vitamin D, such as: Infant formula. Cereal.
Vitamin D deficiency rickets among breastfed infants is rare, but it can occur if an infant does not receive additional vitamin D from foods, a vitamin D supplement, or adequate exposure to sunlight.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia depend on how low the baby's calcium is and how fast the drop happened.

\section*{What Are the Signs \& Symptoms of Hypocalcemia in Babies?}
- be fussy.
- vomit.
- seem weak or floppy.
- twitch, shake, or seem jittery.
- not feed well.
- be sluggish.
- have seizures.

\section*{OSTEOMALECIA}
- This condition is similar to rickets BUT the condition affects adults
- As define under rickets, the condition has to do with softening of bone tissue., typically through a deficiency of vitamin D or calcium.
- Osteomalacia is softening of the bones. It most often occurs because of a problem with vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. Your body needs calcium to maintain the strength and hardness of your bones
- As osteomalacia progresses, you might develop bone pain and muscle weakness. The dull, aching pain associated with osteomalacia most commonly affects the lower back, pelvis, hips, legs and ribs. The pain might be worse at night or when you put pressure on the bones. The pain is rarely relieved completely by rest.
- Fortunately, getting enough vitamin D through oral supplements for several weeks to months can cure osteomalacia. To maintain normal blood levels of vitamin D, you'll likely have to continue taking the supplements

\section*{OSTEOPOROSIS}
- A medical condition in which the bones become brittle and fragile from loss of tissue, typically as a result of hormonal changes, or deficiency of calcium or vitamin $D$.
- The main cause of osteoporosis is bone loss due to a drop in your body's estrogen levels. Estrogen is a hormone that helps build and maintain your bones. The most common cause of estrogen loss in women is menopause.

\section*{Symptoms}
- Back pain, caused by a fractured or collapsed vertebra.
- Loss of height over time.
- A stooped posture.
- A bone that breaks much more easily than expected.

Osteoporosis, or thinning bones, can result in painful fractures. Risk factors for osteoporosis include aging, being female, low body weight, low sex hormones or menopause, smoking, and
some medications. Prevention and treatment include calcium and vitamin D, exercise, and osteoporosis medications

\section*{PAGETS DISEASE OF THE BONE TISSUE}

Paget's disease of bone is a chronic disease of the skeleton. In healthy bone, a process called remodeling removes old pieces of bone and replaces them with new, fresh bone. Paget's disease causes this process to shift out of balance, resulting in new bone that is abnormally shaped, weak, and brittle.

\section*{DISORDERS OF CALCUIM AND PHOSPHORUS}
-The disorders are hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia ,and hypophosphotaemia.
-Hypercalcaemia is associated with hyperparathyroidism. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are either asymptomatic or have fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomitingwhich are present if hypercalcaemia is protracted and severe.

\section*{-HYPERCALCAEMIA AND MALIGNANCY}

High levels of calcium occurs in 10-20 \%of patients with malignant diseases. Malignant associated with hypercalcaemia are classified in three categories ie either SOLID, TUMORS (secretes a humorol factor with PTH like activity), SOLID NON SECRETING TUMORS withskeletal metastasis, HAEMATOLOGIC MALIGANCY( multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia are most common neoplasia. DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH HYPOCALCAEMIA.
-Hypoparathyroidism---due to deficient secretion of PTH. Causes could be due to advertent removal or damage during thyriodectomy or an autoimmune destruction of the glands.
- low calcium could be due to vit d deficiency.
-Heriditary vit d dependency rickets type 1 and 2 .
-Intestinal malabsorption could lead to rickets(children) or oesteomalacia(adults)

\section*{-HYPERPHOSPHATAEMIA.}
-RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY-This refers to skeletal lesions that occur in CRF. Rickets, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosceleria, and osteoporosis are found in varying degrees.
-In CRF the ability of the kidney to excrete inorganic phosphorus is greatly impaired and hyperphosphataemia results.

\section*{HYPOPHOSPHATAEMIA}
-Rickets and osteomalacia may occur in chronic hypophosphataemia..

\section*{BONE DISEASE WITH NORMAL CALCIUM AND INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS.}

OSTEOPOROSIS===This is a term used to describe a group of diseases of diverse causes that are characterized by reduction of bone mass that is required for normal mechanical function . Osteoporosis could be secondary to conditions such as Cushings disease , glucocorticiod administration and chronic immobilization.. THIS CONDITION IS VERY COMMON IN OLD AGE.. PAGETS DISEASE OF BONE
-This is a non metabolic bone disease characterized by excessive bone resorption and repair , increased turn over of bone minerals and matrix and formation of abnormal bones .Evidence of viral origin has recently been presented..

\section*{MAGNESIUM (MG) METABOLISM AND RELATED DISORDERS}

Magnesium is one of the major intracellular cation. It is an essential factor in many important enzymatic reactions, either as an integral part of a metal-coenzyme or as an activator. The best defined manifestation of magnesium deficiency is impairment of neuromuscular function e.g., hyperirritability, tetany, convulsions and electrocardiographic changes. Conditions associated with hypomagnesaemia (reduced magnesium blood levels) include chronic alcoholism, childhood malnutrition, lactation, malabsorption, acute pancreatitis, hypoparathyroidism, aldosteronism and prolonged intravenous feeding (Lu and Nightingale, 2000). Increased levels of magnesium (hypermagnesaemia) have been observed in dehydration, severe diabetic acidosis and Addison's disease. Conditions that interfere with glomerular filtration .e.g., renal failure, result in retention of magnesium and hence elevation of plasma levels.

\section*{BODY FLUIDS AND ELECTROLYTES BALANCE}
--The main fluid in the body is water. Total body water is $\mathbf{6 0 \%}$ of body weight whilst the other $\mathbf{4 0 \%}$ is made up of fats, protein, carbohydrates and minerals.
--The distribution of the body water is as follows:-
*Intracellular fluid which makes up 40\% or ( $2 / 3$ ) of the body water.
* The extracellular fluid makes up the remainder $\mathbf{2 0 \%}$ or $(\mathbf{1} / \mathbf{3})$ of the body water and consists of: Interstitial fluid - ( fluid between the cells),-Plasma and lymph -(the intra-vascular fluid, - Cerebrospinal fluid ( found in ventricles of brain and surrounding the brain and spinal cord), - G.I. tract fluids (gastric, pancreatic and intestinal juices), - Synovial fluid (found inside synovial joint capsules), - Eye and ear fluids
( aqueous and vitreous humours, perilymph and endolymph.), - Pleural, pericardial and peritoneal fluids and Glomerular filtrate.
-- Water moves from one compartment to another due to osmosis. Osmosis is chiefly influenced by dissolved solutes in fluids. Selectively permeable membranes separate body fluids into distinct compartments. Plasma membranes of individual cells separate ICF from ECF and blood vessel walls separate blood plasma from interstitial fluid.
--The major components of these fluids include water and solutes. The solute is mostly comprised of electrolytes: inorganic compounds that dissociate into ions. Electrolytes include cations (positively charged atoms - sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, carbonate) and anions (negatively charged atoms - chloride, sulphide, phosphate, bicarbonate).

\section*{-- SOURCES OF BODY FLUIDS}
1. Preformed water represents about $2,300 \mathrm{ml} /$ day of our daily intake. This is the water found in our food and drink.
2. Metabolic water is produced through the catabolic breakdown of nutrients occurring during cellular respiration, This amounts to about $200 \mathrm{ml} /$ day .
3. Combining preformed and metabolic water gives us a total daily intake of $\mathbf{2 , 5 0 0 ~ m l}$.

\section*{FLUID BALANCE}

Fluid Balance - When each compartment of the body contains the appropriate concentration of water and electrolytes, the body is said to be in fluid balance. Normally, there is a balance achieved between our total daily intake and output of water.

\section*{Regulation of Fluid Gain}

The term fluid balance defines the state where a body's required amount of water is present and proportioned normally among the various compartments; this state is inseparable from electrolyte balance.

Under normal conditions water loss equals water gain and a body's water volume remains constant. Avenues for water loss include the kidneys, skin, lungs, feces, and menstruation. Water is sourced mostly from dietary intake; this is called preformed water. However, metabolic processes such as cellular respiration and dehydration synthesis reactions generate a small component. Approximately 1.6 litres per day is sourced from ingested water, 0.7 litres per day from ingested food, and 0.2 litres from metabolic processes.

Water is not produced by the body to maintain homeostasis; metabolic water production is simply a by-product of cellular respiration. The body regulates water intake via the thirst reflex which stimulates us to drink. When water loss is greater than water gain the body reaches a state of dehydration, and dehydration stimulates the thirst reflex in three ways:
1. the level of saliva drops resulting in a dry mucosa in the mouth and pharynx;
2. there is an increase in blood osmotic pressure which stimulates osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus;
3. there is a drop in blood volume, which leads to the renin/angiotensinII pathway stimulating the thirst centre in the hypothalamus.

All three mechanisms stimulate the thirst centre in the hypothalamus resulting in the sensation of thirst and causing us to drink to increase fluid volume. Drinking inhibits the thirst centre by stretching the stomach and intestines and reducing the osmotic pressure of the blood ${ }^{1}$.

Typically, if the thirst centre is activated dehydration has already occurred to some extent, and it is noted that this reflex is not always reliable in young children, the elderly, or those in a confused mental state ${ }^{1}$.

\section*{Regulation of Fluid Loss}

If fluid loss regulation is considered as the maintenance of the volume of fluid already present in the body, then three hormones play a key role: Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), Aldosterone, and Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP).

A drop in body fluid results in an increase in blood tonicity and a decrease in blood volume which in turn causes the release of renin in the kidneys and stimulation of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus causes ADH to be released from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH targets the kidneys, and sudoriferous glands reducing fluid loss through each, and it also causes arterioles to constrict. Renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, it acts on angiotensinogen a plasma protein produced in the liver to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted in the lungs to the active hormone angiotensin II by the imaginatively named angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II causes: vasoconstriction of the arterioles; stimulation of the release of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex; stimulation of the thirst centre in the hypothalamus; and stimulation of the release of more ADH. Aldosterone increases the retention of sodium and chloride ions as well as water by the kidneys. These factors combined result in an increase in the level of body fluid and an increase in blood pressure.

On the other hand an increase in body fluid results in an increase in blood volume. This causes stretching of the right atrium, which stimulates the release of ANP a hormone that increases the loss of fluid in the urine. At the same time the level of ADH and renin is decreased under negative feedback.

Other factors that control fluid loss include:
- severe dehydration which results in a decrease in blood pressure and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate with a resultant decrease in the loss of water in urine;
- water overload will increase the blood pressure and the glomerular filtration rate resulting in an increased loss of water in the urine;
- hyperventilation increases fluid loss via water vapour in the lungs;
- vomiting and diarrhea increase fluid loss via the GIT;
- fever, heavy perspiration, and skin loss (burns) increase fluid loss via the skin.

\section*{FLUID IMBALANCES}
(1) fluid volume deficit (FVD) ---deficiency in both the amount of water and electrolytes in the ECF where water and electrolyte proportions remain near normal (commonly known as hypovolemia). Occurs as a result of: -(A) abnormal losses through the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidney (B) decreased intake of fluid (C) bleeding (D)a shift of fluid into a third space ie the shift of fluid from the intravascular space into an area where it is not readily accessible as ECF, e.g.: sequestered in the bowel, in the interstitial spaces as edema, in inflamed tissue, in potential spaces such as the peritoneal or pleural cavities $. \mathrm{Nb} /$ the patient with a shift of fluid into a third space may not manifest signs/symptoms of fluid volume deficit
(2) fluid volume excess (fve) ---excessive retention of water and sodium in similar proportions to normal ECF (commonly known as hypervolemia). Occurs as a result of: (A) excessive intake of sodium chloride (B) administering sodium-containing infusions too rapidly, particularly to patients with impaired regulatory mechanisms
(C) disease processes that alter regulatory mechanisms, such as congestive heart failure, renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and Cushing's syndrome.
* In FVE, both the intravascular and interstitial spaces have an increased water and sodium chloride content . Excess interstitial fluid is known as edema . Edema can be found around the: eyes, fingers and ankles. Edema may result in a weight gain in excess of $5 \%$

\section*{(3)Dehydration}

Dehydration is a deficit of body water that results when the output of water exceeds intake. Dehydration stimulates the thirst mechanism, instigating water consumption. Sweating and the output of urine both decrease. If water intake continues to fall short of water loss, dehydration worsens.

Causes of dehydration may include:
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- diuretics
- excessive heat
- excessive sweating
- fever
- decreased water intake

Dehydration induces water to move from the reservoir inside cells into the blood. If dehydration progresses, body tissues begin to dry out and the cells start to shrivel and malfunction. The most susceptible cells to dehydration are the brain cells. Mental confusion, one of the most common signs of severe dehydration, may result and can lead to coma. Dehydration can occur when excessive water is lost with such diseases as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and Addison's disease.

Dehydration is often accompanied by a deficiency of electrolytes, sodium and potassium in particular. Water does not move as rapidly from the reservoir inside of the cells into the blood when electrolyte concentration is decreased. Blood pressure can decline due to a lower volume of water circulating in the bloodstream. A drop in blood pressure can cause lightheadedness, or a feeling of impending blackout, especially upon standing (orthostatic hypotension). Continued fluid and electrolyte imbalance may further reduce blood pressure, causing shock and damage to many internal organs including the brain, kidneys, and liver.
treatment of dehydration. Consumption of plain water is usually sufficient for mild dehydration, although when both water and electrolyte losses have occurred after vigorous exercise, electrolytes must be replaced; sodium and potassium in particular. Adding a little salt to drinking water or consuming such drinks as Gatorade during or following exercise can replace lost fluids. Individuals with heart or kidney problems should consult a physician regarding the replacement of fluids after exercise.

Sodium chloride may be administered intravenously by medical personnel if blood pressure decreases enough to induce shock or risk of shock. The underlying cause of dehydration must be addressed along with treatment to replace fluids. For example, if the cause of dehydration is due to diarrhea, then drugs may be given to alleviate diarrhea as well. Following treatment of the cause, individuals may be monitored to ensure that oral fluid intake is adequate to maintain fluid hydration.

\section*{Overhydration}

Overhydration is an excess of body water that results when water intake exceeds output. Drinking large amounts of water does not typically lead to overhydration if the kidneys, heart, and pituitary gland are functioning properly. An adult would have to drink more than 2 US gallons per day ( 7.6 L per day) to exceed the body's ability to excrete
water. Excessive body water causes electrolytes in the blood, including sodium, to become overly diluted. Overhydration occurs in individuals whose kidneys do not function normally, primarily in kidney, heart, or liver disease. People with these conditions may have to limit their water and dietary salt intake. Similar to dehydration, the brain is the most sensitive organ to overhydration. The brain cells can adapt to increased fluid volume when overhydration increases slowly; however, when it occurs rapidly, mental confusion, seizures, and coma can result.

Overhydration can occur alone or in conjunction with excess blood volume. Distinguishing between the two conditions may be quite complicated. Overhydration induces water accumulation within and around the cells but does not typically show symptoms of fluid accumulation. On the other hand, with excess blood volume, there is an accumulation of sodium and the body cannot transfer water into the reservoir within cells. Conditions such as heart failure and liver cirrhosis may induce volume overload, whereby fluid accumulates around cells in the abdomen, chest, and lower legs.
treatment of overhydration. Treatment of overhydration depends somewhat upon the cause, although whatever the underlying condition, fluids must be limited. Drinking less than about 1 US quart $(1 \mathrm{~L})$ of fluid a day usually improves overhydration over several days. Fluids should only be limited at a physician's request. A diuretic may be prescribed to increase water output by the kidneys. Diuretics are particularly beneficial for treatment of excess blood volume where overhydration is accompanied by excess blood volume.

\section*{ELECTROLYTES AND ELECTROLYTES BALANCE}
*Electrolytes are anions (negatively charged particles) or cations (positively charged particles) depending on whether they move in an electrical field towards the anode (positively charged side) or towards the cathode (negatively charged side) that is whether they have a neative or positive charge.
** Electrolytes are essential components of all living matter and include the major electrolytes: sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, bicardonate, phosphate lactate and sulphate.as well as trace elements.Although amino acids and proteins in solution also carry an electrical charge, in clinical chemistry they are usually considered separately from electrolyes.
*** The major electrolytes occur primarily as free ions; the trace metals occurs primarily in combination with proteins..
**** The diatary requirements for electrolytes vary widely; most need to be consumed only in small amounts or at rare intervals and are retained when in short supply.Some like calcium and phosphorus, are continuously excreted and must be ingested regularly in order to prevent deficiency.

\section*{ROLE OF ELECTROLYTES}
*The role of electrolytes is manifold.There are almost no metabolic processes that are not dependent on or affected by electrolytes. Among functions of electrolytes are:-
(a) maintenance of osmotic pressure and water distribution in various body fluid compartments.
(b) maintenance of proper body ph
(c) regulation of proper heart and other muscle functions
(d) involvement in oxidation-reduction (electron transfer) reactions
(e) participation in catalysis as cofactors for enzymes
* Therefore abnormal levels of electrolytes may be either the cause or the consequences of a variety of disorders, and determination of electrolytes is one of the most importantfunctions of clinical chemistry laboratory.
* Sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate in body fluids are commonly grouped in the familiar test order for an electrolyte profile.

\section*{REGULATION OF ELECTROLYTES}
(A) SODIUM $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$
-Chief electrolyte in the ECF representing 90\% of the total cations per liter of plasma water.Thus sodium ions are responsible for almost half the osmolality of the plasma.
*Average daily requirement is approximately $1-2 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day and the intake is approximately $130-260 \mathrm{mmol}(8-15 \mathrm{~g} 0$ of sodium chloride.This daily intake is nearly completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.The excess sodium is excreted in the urine, the kidneys are the ultimate regulators of the amountof sodium in the body. small amounts are lost in the feces and perspiration. Aldosterone increases $\mathrm{Na}+$ reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the tubules.
*Sodium-rich foods: bacon ,ham , sausage , mustard , processed cheese , vegetables , bread cereal , salted snack foods and table salt (about $46 \%$ sodium),

\section*{-Functions:}
(a) regulating ECF volume and distribution
(b) maintaining blood volume
(c) transmitting nerve impulses and contracting muscles

DETERMINATION OF SODIUM IN BODY FLUIDS: Is estimated through flame photometry, ion selective electrodes(ISE) or colorometric method. *Referencerange for serum sodium as quoted in literature $=136-148 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.

\section*{(B)POTASSIUM (K+)}
* This is the chief electrolyte in the intracellular fluid. In tissue cell its average concentration is $150 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$. In the erythrocytes the concentration is $105 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$, approximately 23 times that of the plasma..High intracellular concentration are maintained because potassium difuses only slowlyoutward through the cell membrane whereas the sodium- potassium -ATP pump continually transports potassiuminto the cell.
*Excreted primarily by the kidneys .Kidneys have no effective means of conserving potassium Potassium deficits develop rapidly if it is excreted in excess without being replaced simultaneously .It can also be lost through gastrointestinal tract and some through perspiration and saliva .Potassium regulation is achieved through:-renal excretion and conservation - aldosterone increases $\mathrm{K}+$ excretion - movement into and out of cells ,-insulin helps $\mathrm{K}+$ move into cells and tissue damage and acidosis shifts $\mathrm{K}+$ out of cells into the ECF .
*foods rich in potassium: bananas, dates, oranges, melons, potatoes, prunes and figs

\section*{* Functions:}
(a) maintaining ICF osmolality
(b) transmitting nerve and other chemical impulses
(c) regulating cardiac impulse transmission and muscle contraction
(d) skeletal and smooth muscle function
(e) regulating acid-base balance

DETERMINATION OF POTASSIUM IN BODY FLUIDS: Is estimated through, ion selective electrodes(ISE) or colorometric method. *Referencerange for serum sodium as quoted in literature $=3.5-5.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.

\section*{(C) CHLORIDE (CL-)}
*This is the major extracellular anion and represents the largest fraction of the plasma total anion concentration of approximately $154 \mathrm{mmol} / 1$. It is present in the blood, interstitial fluid and in minute amount in the ICF.Chloride ions in food are almost completely absorbed from the intestinal tract but the average dialy reduirement is not known..They are filtered along the glomeruli and passively reabsorbed along with $\mathrm{Na}+$ in the proximal tubules.In the loop of henle, chloride is actively reabsorbed by the so called CHLORIDE PUMP whose action promotes
reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}+$ as well.Surplus chloride is excreted in the urine, excessive losses in the sweat as can occur in hot weather is minimized by the secretion and action of aldosterone hormone which causes the sweat glands to reabsorb more $\mathrm{Na}+$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-$.
* foods rich in chloride are: foods rich in sodium, dairy products and meat.

\section*{(D)BICARBONATE ( $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$-)}
*Chief chemical base buffer within the body present in both the ECF and ICF. Average daily requirement is not known. Unlike other electrolytes that must be consumed in the diet, adequate amounts of bicarbonate are produced through metabolic processes to meet the body's needs *Bicarbonates are excreted by the kidneys and its regulation is through excretion and and reabsorption by the kidneys

(b)essential component of the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffering system
* DETERMINATION OF bicarbonate IN SERUM: colorometric method. *Reference range for serum bicarbonate as quoted in literature $=23-29 \mathrm{MMOL} / \mathrm{L}$

\section*{FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE MOVEMENT}

There are four ways in which fluid and electrolytes move in the body:-osmosis,diffusion, active transport and filtration.

\section*{(1) OSMOSIS}

\footnotetext{
*This is the movement of a solvent across a selectively permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established. Water is the primary solvent that holds solutes (substances) in solution in the body. The concentration of these solutes in the body fluids is osmolality, whichis determined by the total solute concentrationwithin a a fluid compartment. Osmolality is measured as parts of solute per kilogram of water and is reported as milliosmols per $\mathrm{lkg}(\mathrm{mOsmol} / \mathrm{L})$. The osmolality of plasma is $275-295 \mathrm{mOsmol} / \mathrm{L}$. The greatest determinant of osmolality within a fluid compartment is sodium concentration.
}
*Tonicity---may be used to refer to the osmolality of a solution. Isotonic solutions have the same osmolality as body fluidseg $0.9 \%$ normal saline. With isotonic solutions, water remains in the intravascular compartment without any net flow across selective membranes
* hypertonic solutios-have a higher osmolality than body fluids eg $3 \%$ saline solution. With a hypertonic solution in the intravascular compartment, water moves out of the intracellular compartment(inside the cell) and into intravascular compartment that is hypertonic causing the cell to shrink
*hypotonic solutions have a lower osmolality than the body fluids eg $0.45 \%$ saline. With hypotonic solutions water moves out of the intravascular compartment into intracellular compartment(inside the cells)that is hypetonic causing the cell to burst.

\section*{(2) DIFFUSION}
* This is the movement of solutes across a selectively permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established . "Coasting downhill"--- diffusion is affected by:
(A) the size of the solutes:-. Larger solutes move less quickly and, consequently, have a lower rate of diffusion WHILST smaller solutes move more quickly and, consequently, have a higher rate of diffusion
(B) the concentration of the solutes :-solutes move from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes
(C) the temperature of the solutes:- increases in temperature increase the rate of motion of solutes and, consequently, leads to a higher rate of diffusion WHILST decreases in temperature decrease the rate of motion of solutes and, consequently, leads to a lower rate of diffusion

\section*{(3) ACTIVE TRANSPORT}
* Movement of solutes across a selectively permeable cell membrane, usually against a pressure gradient and with the expenditure of metabolic energy(ATP), from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established ."Pumping uphill" in active transport: a solute combines with a carrier on the outside surface of a cell membrane , the solute and carrier move to the inside surface of the cell membrane .Once on the inside surface of the cell membrane, the solute and carrier separate and the solute is released to the inside of the cell. Eg the sodium-potassium pump is an important active transport mechanism: Under normal conditions: sodium concentrations are higher in the ECF and potassium concentrations are higher in the ICF.So to maintain these conditions, the sodium-potassium pump continually pumps sodium out of the cells into the ECF and pumps potassium into the cells into the ICF .

\section*{(4)FILTRATION}
* Movement of solutes and solvent across a permeable cell membrane from an area of higher concentration of solutes to an area of lower concentration of solutes until equilibrium is established. This is influenced by two pressures ie colloid osmotic, (or oncotic pressure) and the hydrostatic pressure. Oncotic pressure is that pressure that prevents water from moving out from the intravascular to extravascular compartments to maintain vascular volume whilst hydrostatic pressure is that pressure that moves water outward from the intravascular to extravascular compartments

\section*{ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCES}

Electrolyte imbalance ----This occurs when the levels of the body electrolytes are either elevated (increased) or reduced (decreased) in the ECF. The term of reference is the reference value of the electrolyte used in a given population.

\section*{BLOOD GASES, ACID/BASE BALANCE AND ACID/BASE DISORDERS}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
-Metabolic processes of the body results with the production of large amounts of carbonic acids $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$, sulfuric, phosphoric and other acids. These products of metabolism are transported to the excretory organs (lungs and kidney) via the ECF and the blood with minimal change in the plasma PH. This is accomplished by the combined functions of the buffer systems of the blood and the mechanisms of respiratory and renal systems.
- Clinical management of respiratory and metabolic disorders of patients undergoing surgical correction of cardiopulmonary disorders has been greatly improved by the development of instrumentations for rapid accurate measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood and expired air.
- The determination of blood gases and ph also plays an important role in the detection of acid/base imbalance and in following the effect of therapy.
- The measurement of blood gases, acid/base balance and ph of blood is very important in the management of patients in HDU(high dependency unit) and in ICU( INTENSIVE CARE UNIT). These are patients who can not breath normally especially those in a coma.
- The gases commonly measured are $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although small amounts of these gases exist as dissolved gases in the blood , they are for the most part , chemically combined with other substances. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ exist chiefly as $\mathbf{H C O}_{3}{ }^{-}$while most of $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ is bound to haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin. The PH of blood is dependent on the relative amounts of $\mathbf{H C O}_{3}{ }^{-}$and carbonic acid $\left(\mathbf{H C O}_{3}\right)$ which are present in the blood.

\section*{RESPIRATION}
- Respiration is responsible for the supply of oxygen needed by the tissue cells for their metabolic activities , and for removing carbon dioxide produced by these metabolic activities. There are two types of respiration ie EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL RESPIRATION.
- EXTERNAL RESPIRATION---This is the term given for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs between alveolar air and blood whilst INTERNAL $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ RESPIRATION the oxygen in the blood is exchanged with the carbon dioxide in the cells. Regulation of respiration is mediated by neuro chemical centres in the brain.

\section*{$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ AND $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ IN THE BLOOD}

Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in several forms and the three most abundant and important are :a)bicarbonate ---in plasma and rbcs
b) carbamino haemoglobin-----in rbcs
c) dissolved carbondioxide ( $\mathrm{dCO}_{2}$ ) ---in fluid of rbcs and plasma
- oxygen is transported to the tissues in two forms:
a) reversibly bound to haemoglobin in $\operatorname{rbcs}\left(\mathrm{HB} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$
b) ) dissolved oxygen( $\mathrm{d} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) ---in fluid of rbcs and plasma
- The various forms of carbon dioxide deserves special notice since it is on understanding of these forms that comprehension of acid/base regulation is based. In plasma, a small portion of dissolved cardon dioxide reacts with plasma water to form carbonic acid and bicardonate
$\mathbf{C O}_{\mathbf{2}}+\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O} \quad \leftrightarrow \mathbf{C D} \quad \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \quad \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \mathrm{H}+\quad+\quad \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
(CD=carbonate dehydratase)
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ (1) the kidney plays an important role in maintaining the circulating $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$and eliminating the circulating $\mathrm{H}+$ from circulation
(2) The CD (CARBONATE DEHYDRATASE) is present in high concentration in rbcs and renal tubular cells therefore the organs concerned with acid/base balance are rbcs and tubular cells. At the same time not only do rbcs have high concentration of CD BUT it also have the means of removing one of the products ie hydrogen ions

\section*{WHAT IS ACID/BASE BALANCE?}

In physiology, a component is said to be in balance if the rates of outputs and inputs are equal for a given time interval.
-A positive balance indicates that there is a net gain the component over a given period of time whereas a negative balance indicates there is a net loss of the component over a given period of time. Evaluation of a net balance takes into account all inputs(intakes plus production) and all outputs(excretion plus metabolic conversion) over a period of given time interval.
- Therefore acid base balance involves co2 balance as well as non-carbonic acid and base and the effect this has on the acid/base status of titratable acids or base and other acid/base variables.
- The PH of plasma is a function of two independent variables. ie The Pco2

Which is regulated by respiratory mechanisms and the concentration of titratable base, which is regulated by the renal mechanism.. Plasma bicarbonate is always taken as a measure of the base in plasma and ECF. The hydrogen ion balance is closely associated with the balance of other electrolytes because hydrogen ion cannot be introduced into the ECF without concomitent anion eg CL or in exchange for a cation ( $\mathrm{Na}+$ )

\section*{THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN $\mathbf{P H}, \mathbf{H C O}_{3}{ }^{-}$AND $_{2} \mathbf{H C O}_{3}$}

This relationship is explained by the HENDERSON-HASSELBALCH equation.
The equation is derived starting with the following equilibrium
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H}+\quad+\quad \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$
Let K be the equilibrium constant
$$\mathrm{K}=\frac{[\mathrm{H}+]\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}$$

Make $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$the subject
$$[\mathrm{H}+]=\mathrm{KX}\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$
$$\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$$

Take the log of both sides
$$\begin{array}{r}
\log [\mathrm{H}+]=\log \mathrm{K}+\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right] \\
{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}
\end{array}$$

Multiply both sides by -1
$$-\log [\mathrm{H}+]=-\log \mathrm{K}-\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$
$$\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$$

By definition $-\log [\mathrm{H}+]=\mathrm{PH}$ and $-\log \mathrm{K}=\mathrm{PK}$ therefore
$$\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{PH}=\mathrm{PK}-\left[\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]-\log \left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\right. \\
\mathrm{PH}=\mathrm{PK}-\log \left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]+\log \left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] \\
\mathrm{PH}=\mathrm{PK}+\log \left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}
\end{gathered}$$
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ The PK of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ is 6.1 thus $6.1+\mathrm{Log}+\mathrm{Log}\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]$
$$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$
$\mathrm{Nb} /$ the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ includes the actual $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ which is present along with dissolved CO 2 .
-Normally the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ - in blood is approximately $26 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ while the $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$ is approximately $1.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$. . The blood PH can be calculated by inserting these values into the equation
$$\mathrm{PH}=6.1+\log \frac{26}{1.3}$$

\section*{ACID/ BASE DISORDERS}
-Many pathological conditions are accompanied by or caused by disturbances of acid-base balance and electrolyte composition of the body. These changes are usually reflected in the acid /base and anion/cation patterns of the ECF.
- Since blood is the only sample of ECF that can be obtained, acid/ base status is evaluated from measurement of blood $\mathrm{PH}, \mathrm{PCO} 2$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$or [ TCO2]. It is important to note that the results obtained in blood or plasma may not always be the reflection of the acid/ base status of ICF.
- Acid / base balances disorders can be classified into four groups ie METABOLIC ACIDOSIS and ALKALOSIS and RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS and ALKALOSIS.

\section*{METABOLIC ACIDOSIS( PRIMARY BICARBONATE DEFICIT)}
- Caused by -:
(a) production of organic acids that exceeds the rate of elimination
(b) reduced excretion of acids in renal failure
(c) excessive loss of bicarbonates (base) due to excessive loss of duodenal fluids as in diarrhaea

In these conditions the ratio $\left[\left[\underline{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}{ }^{-}\right]\right.$is decreased_because of the primary decrease in_
$$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$

Bicarbonates $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}-\right]$. In such situation , the body will try to compensate for the bicarbonate deficit inorder to restore the acid/ base balance ie to restore the PH between ( 7.35-7.45)
$$6.1+\log +\log \left[\underline{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}{ }^{-}\right]$$

Pathological conditions associated with metabolic acidosis are renal failure, ketoacidosis and salicylate intoxication. Laboratory finding-----plasma bicarbonate, total carbondioxide and partial pressure of carbondioxide and PH are all low.

\section*{METABOLIC ALKALOSIS (PRIMARY BICARBONATE EXCESS)}

\section*{Caused by :-}
(a) excess administration of alkali eg NaHCO 3 , Citrate (as in transfused blood) or some anti acids.
(b) excess loss of HCL from the stomach after prolonged vomiting and after gastric suction.
(c) renal bicarbonate retention
(d) prolonged administration of certain diuretics
(d) prolonged administration of laxatives.
- In these conditions, the ratio $\left[\left[\underline{\mathrm{HCO}}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]\right.$is increased_because of the primary increase
$$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$
of bicarbonate.
Laboratory finding------plasma bicarbonate, dissolved carbon dioxide and partial pressure of carbondioxide , and PH are all high.

\section*{RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS (PRIMARY DISSOLVED CARBONIC DIOXIDE EXCESS)}
- Any condition that decreases elimination of carbondioxide through the lungs results in an increase of partial pressure of carbondioxide( hypercapnia) and respiratory acidosis. Increase in carbonic acid will results with the decrease in the ratio $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}-\right]$
$$\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$$

Cause :-
(a) any factor that directly depress the respiratory centre eg CNS trauma, infections or mechanical obstruction of the air way
(b) cardiac disease may cause respiratory acidosis.

Laboratory findings:- low PH, High [ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ]

\section*{RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS (PRIMARY DISSOLVED CARBONIC DIOXIDE DEFICIT)}
-A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( hypocapnia) caused by an increase in the rate of or depth of respiration or both. Excess elimination of carbon dioxide which causes an increase in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}-\right]$ ratio and an increase in PH.
Causes :- hysteria, fever, CNS infections pneumonia , asthma , pulmonary embolism and CHF.
Lab findings- PH high, $\left[\underline{\mathrm{HCO}}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]$is high,

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}

An arterial blood gas (ABG) is a blood test that is performed using blood from an artery. It involves puncturing an artery with a thin needle and syringe and drawing a small volume of blood. The most common puncture site is the radial artery at the wrist, but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or other sites are used. The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter.

The test is used to determine the pH of the blood, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and the bicarbonate level. Many blood gas analyzers will also report concentrations of lactate, hemoglobin, several electrolytes, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. ABG testing is mainly used in pulmonology, to determine gas exchange levels in the blood related to lung function, but has a variety of applications in other areas of medicine.

\section*{TEST PRINCIPLES/CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE}

Blood gas analysis is performed to assess the acid-base balance and evaluate the respiratory oxygenation status of the patient.
$\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{pCO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pO}_{2}$ are measured directly from the specimen by using electrodes. The pH and $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ electrodes are potentiometric where the voltage produced across a semi-permeable membrane to hydrogen ions or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas is proportional to concentration. $\mathrm{pO}_{2}$ is measured similarly, but using an amperometric (current producing) electrode.

The bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{cHCO}_{3}{ }^{-}(\mathrm{P})_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$, total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{ctCO}_{2}(\mathrm{P})_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ and arterial base excess $\left(\mathrm{ABE}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ are calculated according to the following formulae:
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (carbonic acid) $=\mathrm{pCO}_{2} \times 0.0301$
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$(bicarbonate) $=$inv. $\log \left(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{a}}\right) \times \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$
$\mathrm{tCO}_{2}$ (total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) $=\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$

\section*{SPECIMEN TYPE}

Heparinized Arterial blood is the specimen of choice. Capillary blood collected in heparinized tubes can also be used especially when dealing with neonates. Specimens must be placed on wet ice analyzed within 10 minutes of collection if held at room temperature or within one hour if kept at $4-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{QUALITY CONTROL}

Level One, Level Two, and Level Three controls are tested daily. At least one quality control specimen is run every 8 hours.

\section*{REFERENCE INTERVALS}

The following ranges are used for interpretation of results:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{ANION GAP}
-This is a calculation used to detect altered concentration of ions other than ( sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonates.
= The law of electro neutrality demands that the number positive change (sodium, potassium calcium, magnesium and traces of other cations) in plasma exactly equal the number of negative change ( chloride, bicarbonate, sulphate, phosphates, protein anions organic acids and traces of other anions).
-Sodium and potassium ion provide over $90 \%$ of plasma cations concentrationin a normal subject. The balance includes low concentrations of calcium and magnesium which vary very little even in disease. Over $80 \%$ of plasma anions is accounted for by chloride and bicarbonates. The remaining $20 \%$ or so is referred to as unmeasured anions (made up of proteins, urates, phosphates, sulphates and other organic anions)
Therefore the term anion gap refers to the differences in charge concentration between unmeasured anions (UA-) and unmeasured cations(UC+). The anion gap can be calculated using the follwing formula where "A" represent the anion gap
"A" $=\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{CL}^{-}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]$
$\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)=$"A" $+\left(\mathrm{CL}-+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right]$

\section*{ENDOCRINOLOGY}

Endocrinology is a branch of biology and medicine dealing with the endocrine system, its diseases, and its specific secretions called hormones, the integration of developmental events proliferation, growth, and differentiation (including histogenesis and organogenesis) and the coordination of metabolism, respiration, excretion, movement, reproduction, and sensory perception depend on chemical cues, substances synthesized and secreted by specialized cells.

Endocrinology is concerned with study of the biosynthesis, storage, chemistry, biochemical and physiological function of hormones and with the cells of the endocrine glands and tissues that secrete them.

The endocrine system consists of several glands, all in different parts of the body, that secrete hormones directly into the blood rather than into a duct system. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action; one hormone may have several effects on different target organs, and, conversely, one target organ may be affected by more than one hormone.

Below is a list of glands in the human body and what they do:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/bfb3019b-79e8-423f-8b6c-d79a04912b7c-080.jpg?height=830&width=634&top_left_y=1289&top_left_x=275)

Hormones act by binding to specific receptors in the target organ. As Baulieu notes, a receptor has at least two basic constituents:
- a recognition site, to which the hormone binds; and
- an effector site, which precipitates the modification of cellular function. Between these is a "transduction mechanism" in which hormone binding induces allosteric modification that, in turn, produces the appropriate response.

\section*{TYPES OF HORMONES}

\section*{Amines}

Amines, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, are derived from single amino acids, in this case tyrosine. Thyroid hormones such as $3,5,3^{\prime}$-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T4) make up a subset of this class because they derive from the combination of two iodinated tyrosine amino acid residues.

\section*{Peptide and protein}

Peptide hormones and protein hormones consist of three (in the case of thyrotropin-releasing hormone) to more than 200 (in the case of follicle-stimulating hormone) amino acid residues and can have a molecular mass as large as $\mathbf{3 0 , 0 0 0}$ grams per mole. All hormones secreted by the pituitary gland are peptide hormones, as are leptin from adipocytes, ghrelin from the stomach, and insulin from the pancreas.

\section*{Steroid}

Steroid hormones are converted from their parent compound, cholesterol. Mammalian steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups by the receptors to which they bind: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. Some forms of vitamin D, such as calcitriol, are steroid-like and bind to homologous receptors, but lack the characteristic fused ring structure of true steroids.

\section*{AN OVERVIEW OF HYPOTHALMUS ,PITUITARY AND TARGET GLAND HORMONAL PRODUCTION AND ACTION}

The pituitary gland is often portrayed as the "master gland" of the body. Such praise is justified in the sense that the anterior and posterior pituitary secrete a battery of hormones that collectively influence all cells and affect virtually all physiologic processes.

The pituitary gland may be king, but the power behind the throne is clearly the hypothalamus. As alluded to in the last section, some of the neurons within the hypothalamus - neurosecretory neurons - secrete hormones that strictly control secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamic hormones are referred to as releasing hormones and inhibiting hormones, reflecting their influence on anterior pituitary hormones.

Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones are carried directly to the anterior pituitary gland via hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal veins. Specific hypothalamic hormones bind to receptors on specific anterior pituitary cells, modulating the release of the hormone they produce.

As an example, thyroid-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus binds to receptors on anterior pituitary cells called thyrotrophs,

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Systemic target organs}
\end{figure}
stimulating them to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH. The anterior pituitary hormones enter the systemic circulation and bind to their receptors on other target
organs. In the case of TSH, the target organ is the thyroid gland.
Clearly, robust control systems must be in place to prevent over or under-secretion of hypothalamic and anterior pituitary hormones. A prominent mechanism for control of the releasing and inhibiting hormones is negative feedback.. Keep in mind that summaries are just that, and ongoing research continues to delineate additional, sometimes very important effects.

A final point to be made is that individual cells within the anterior pituitary secrete a single hormone (or possibly two in some cases). Thus, the anterior pituitary contains at least six distinctive endocrinocytes. The cells that secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone do not also secrete growth hormone, and they have receptors for thyroid-releasing hormone, not growth hormone-releasing hormone.

The following table summarizes the major hormones synthesized and secreted by the pituitary gland, along with summary statements about their major target organs and physiologic effects

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{REPRODUCTION AND HORMONES (GONADAL HORMONES)}

\section*{-PUBERTY}
-During childhood, circulatory levels of the sex steroids and gonadotropins are low and similar in both sexes.
- Values for LH, FSH and gonadol steroids (testosterone, progesterone, estradiol,) rise gradually over several years before stabilizing in the adult range when full sexual maturity is reached.
- In girls, precocious puberty is defined as the onset of pubertal development before the age 8.5 years and puberty is said to be delayed if there has been no development by the the age 12-14 years and if menarche (first menstrual cycle) has not occurred by age 16.5 years.
-In boys, puberty is considered precocious if it occurs before the age of $\mathbf{1 0}$ years and delayed when the onset is later than age 16 years. Nb precocious puberty is more common in girls.

\section*{MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND HORMONES}

Sperm cell development starts at about the age of 11 years. This is influenced by the hormone testosterone. By the time the boy is 15 years, sufficient levels of testosterone exist so that the testis become capable of full spermatogenesis. Before the age of $\mathbf{1 5}$ years most of the sperm cells produced in the testis are incapable of fertilization. The production of fully mature sperm (spermatozoa) is triggered by FSH. LH influences the secretion of testosterone by the leyding cells of the testis.

\section*{MALE HORMONAL REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS=(INFERTILITY)}
-Infertility in male is rarely the presentation of primary and secondary hypogonadism, other clinical pictures eg impotence, azoospermia, oligospermia generally points to that diagnosis. Other feature is androgen deficiency.

\section*{(1) IMPOTENCE}
-This is the persistent inability to develop or maintain a penile erection sufficient for intercourse and ejaculation.
- Causes of impotence are-:
-low levels of testosterone.
- hyperprolactinemia.
-a number of systemic diseases that affect the pituitary/ gonadal axis eg CRF, Chronic liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.
-severe malnutrition, stress,
- alcohol may have a direct effect on the testis impairing spermatogenesis.
- Low and elevated levels of the following hormones can cause impotence eg cortisol, Thyroid hormones, and low levels of LH and FSH.

\section*{(2) GYNECOMASTIA}
-This is the growth of glandular breast tissue in male. The growth may be bilateral or unilateral .NB unilateral growth has no specific significance.
- gynecomastia may develop due to excessive use of alcohol, marijuana or certain medication.
- gynecomastia may be associated with hyper- and hypo thyroidism.
-Tumors that produce chorionic gonadotropin, estradiol producing tumors of the adrenals and testis and prolactin-producing pituitary adenomas all may cause gynecomastia.
- When physical examination and history do not point to any specific disorder, measurement of HCG, ESTRADIOL and PROLACTIN are appropriate.
- The presence of glandular breast tissue in pubertal males is quite common and almost always resolves sportenously,

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND HORMONES}

\section*{THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE(MC)}

Each month or so the inner wall of the uterus prepares for a possible pregnancy. Incase a pregnancy does not occur (as in the case throughout most months of a woman's fertile years ),the linning of the uterus must be released and a new one prepared. The breakdown of the endometrial wall and the resultant discharge of blood and endometrial tissue are known as menstruation (or menses)
-The Cyclic timing of menstruation is governed by the hormones released from the pituitary and the ovaries.
- Girls generally have their first menstrual cycle, the onset of which is called menarche sometimes between 12-14 years of age. Body weight, nutrition, heredity, and overall health are factors related to menarche.
- This cycle activity continuous until about age $\mathbf{4 5}-\mathbf{5 5}$ years.
- The normal MC lasts for 28 days but very few women perfects 28 - day cycle. Most women fluctuates by a few days to a week around this 28 day pattern and some are extremely from this cycle.
- Day 1 of the cycle starts with the first day of bleeding or menstrual flow.
- The normal cycle occurs in three phases i.e. Follicular, ovulation and luteul

FOLLICULAR PHASE---This is the phase after the menstrual flow and takes around 2 weeks up to the period of ovulation. During this phase the hormonal status are that Estradiol and progesterone are low, FSH and LH are elevated .
OVULATORY PHASE----This is the phase that comes at the mid cycle and last for 48 hours. Ovulation takes place in this phase and the released ovum travels in the fallopian tube for 48 hours awaiting fertilization. The hormonal status is that there is a rise in estradiol, LH and FSH. Progesterone is low.
-LUTEUL PHASE----This is the last half of the MC. It comes between the ovulation periods up to the time of bleeding. The hormonal status is that there is increasing production of progesterone and estradiol and low production of LH and FSH.
HORMONAL STATUS DURING MC
HORMONAL STATUS DURING MC

\section*{FEMALE HORMONAL REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS=(INFERTILITY)}

\section*{---IRREGULAR MENSES}
-In a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle, bleeding usually occurs 14 to 15 days after the mid cycle. In infertile women, luteal phase may be shortened and menses occurs 5-10 days after mid cycle peak. The cycle may be normal but no ovulation occurs ie anovulatory.

\section*{(1)AMENORRHEA}
- This is of two types ie primary and secondary.
- Primary amenorrhea is a disorder whereby no menses has begun by the age of 16.5 years or the patient has never menstruated and this is encountered in delayed puberty.
- The cause of this are endocrine disturbances such as hirsutism, virilism (testicular ferminization)
- Secondary amenorrhea is a disorder which occurs when previously established MC has stopped. This could be due to physiological factors eg pregnancy and menopause which are not abnormal, or stress and some contraceptive medication.
- Other causes are severe illness, excessive and rapid weight loss and obesity.
-Hyperprolactinemia is an important cause of secondary amenorrhea. High levels of prolactin inhibit normal release of GnRH and this affects the fertility hormone s release directly.
(2)MENOPAUSE
-This is a condition whereby the ovulation and menstrual cycle stops.
- This occurs in women at the age of 45-55 years and above. If it occurs at the age less than 40 years it is regarded as immature.
- Menopause is a normal physiological process and not a disease condition.
- Other signs associated with menopause are:- hot flashes (temporary feeling of warmth caused by blood vessel dilation), vaginal wall dryness and breast changes.
- Ovarian function and hormonal production diminishes.
(3) HIRSUTISM
- This is excess of facial and body hair in a woman.
- Could be caused by:- excess testosterone production which could be due to some medication or from a neoplasm in the ovaries or the adrenal glands.
(4) VIRILISM (TESTICULAR FEMINIZATION)
-This is the enlargement of the clitoris that resembles a penis (clitomegaly).
- Caused by excessive testosterone production.
- It is characterized by hair growth of male distribution, deepening of the voice and breast atrophy (no female breasts)
- Other causes are ovarian tumor, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

FERTILITY HORMONAL PROFILE
Fertility hormonal profile analysis plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of various pathological disorders that contribute to infertility in an individual. Infertility is defined as the absence of pregnancy following 12 months of unprotected intercourse. Infertility may be caused by ovulatory dysfunction, blocked fallopian tubes, male factor infertility or unexplained causes. Ovulatory dysfunction can be caused by hypothalamic causes, endocrinopathies (hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction) or ovarian causes (polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian failure) (Makar and Toth, 2002). Approximately $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ of all couples will seek fertility assessment. Even though human fertility does not appear to be declining per se, infertility services are increasingly being utilized due to the later age of first pregnancy and associated reduction in female fertility (Akre et al., 1999). Although spontaneous pregnancies continue to accumulate among unselected couples for up to 3 years, for many decades it has been conventional to define infertility as 1 year of failure to conceive. This arbitrary criterion balances the capacity of infertility services with couples' expectations and patience (Collins et al., 1995). The greater participation of women in the workforce and the associated delay in the ages of marriage and first child-bearing, require more flexibility in allowing for earlier infertility evaluation. Male infertility refers to the inability of a male to achieve a pregnancy in a fertile female. In humans it accounts for $\mathbf{4 0 - 5 0 \%}$ of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Male infertility is diagnosed when, after testing of both partners, reproductive problems have been identified in the male partner. Studies have shown that in about one in five infertile couples the problem is solely in the male partner (male infertility) (Brugh and Lipshultz, 2004). Infertility can be primary, in women who have never conceived, or secondary, in women who have previously conceived. Rates of primary infertility vary widely between countries, ranging from $<6 \%$ in China, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia; $9 \%$ in the Philippines; $>10 \%$ in Finland, Sweden, and Canada; and $18 \%$ in Switzerland. Reported rates of secondary infertility are less reliable (Siladitya et al., 2010).
To investigate primary and secondary infertility that affect both male and female the following diagnostic parameters are carried out: testosterone (TESTO), prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol 2 (EII) and progesterone (PRG)
TESTOSTERONE (TESTO)
Testosterone, a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol, occurs more abundantly in circulation among men, than women. Testosterone is synthesized in the testes among males, the ovaries among females, and possibly the adrenal glands in both sexes , though the physiological mechanism of testosterone synthesis and excretion in women is not completely understood (Davis and Tran, 2001), In men, testosterone plays two key roles : (i)

Anabolic effects include growth of muscle mass and strength, increased bone density and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and bone maturation and (ii)Androgenic effects include maturation of the sex organs, particularly the penis and the formation of the scrotum in the fetus, and after birth (usually at puberty) a deepening of the voice, growth of the beard and axillary hair. Many of these fall into the category of male secondary sex characteristics. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and wellbeing as well as the prevention of osteoporosis (Tuck and Francis, (2009).
In males, testosterone levels rise briefly in the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week of gestation and again shortly after birth. A sharp increase occurs at puberty, subsequently the levels remain relatively constant except for slight diurnal variation. The highest level occurs in the morning and gradually deceases to $25 \%$ of the peak by evening. A slow and progressive decline begins after the $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ decade. On average, an adult human male body produces about ten times more testosterone than an adult human female body, but females are more sensitive to the hormone. In females testosterone increases the libido which is expressed by clitoral engorgement. The levels are increased at puberty and mid-cycle where it plays a great role during ovulation (Davis and Tran, 2001).

Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels decrease in the later decades of adult life. Recent studies have shown conflicting results concerning the importance of testosterone in maintaining cardiovascular health. Nevertheless, maintaining normal testosterone levels in elderly men has been shown to improve many parameters which are thought to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, such as increased lean body mass, decreased visceral fat mass, decreased total cholesterol, and glycemic control (Mehta, and Josephs, 2006).

Under dominance challenge, testosterone may play a role in the regulation of the fight-or-flight responseFalling in love decreases men's testosterone levels while increasing women's testosterone levels. It is speculated that these changes in testosterone result in the temporary reduction of differences in behavior between the sexes (Marazziti and Canale, 2004). Studies have suggested that testosterone level plays a major role in risk-taking during financial decisions. Fatherhood also decreases testosterone levels in men, suggesting that the resulting emotional and behavioral changes promote paternal care (Berg and Wyne, 2001)

During the aging process, testosterone levels diminish gradually in both sexes and without an abrupt decline during menopause (Lobo, 2001). Surgical menopause due to premenopausal oophorectomy (surgical removal of ovaries) results in abrupt decline in testosterone. Evidence suggests that early oophorectomy (under age 45) may be associated with earlier mortality. The ovaries of postmenopausal women continue to secrete testosterone. Post-menopausally, testosterone production is reduced by about $25 \%$, due to a decrease in the source hormone androstenedione (Hendrix, 2005).

In both sexes, decline in testosterone levels leads to bone density loss and decline in muscle mass. Conversely, high levels of testosterone have been linked to higher risk for prostate cancer. In both sexes, low levels of testosterone have been correlated with lower coital frequency and loss of sexual desire. Since testosterone levels decrease gradually over time, the sharp decrease in sexual interest, among menopausal women, does not seem to be solely attributable to declining testosterone levels. Studies have shown that testosterone administration improves mood and well-being in both sexes, but especially among men (Wilson, 2001).
PROLACTIN (PRL),

Prolactin is a protein hormone produced in the anterior pituitary by the pituitary mammotropic cells.Its secretion is controlled by an inhibitory influence from the hypothalamus that is thought to be dopamine. Prolactin has many effects including regulating lactation and stimulating proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. It stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk (lactation). Increased serum concentrations of prolactin during pregnancy cause enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and prepare the production of milk. However, the high levels of progesterone during pregnancy suppress the production of milk. Milk production normally starts when the levels of progesterone fall by the end of pregnancy and a suckling stimulus is present. Sometimes, newborn babies (males as well as females) secrete a
milky substance from their nipples known as witch's milk. This is in part caused by maternal prolactin and other hormones (Horseman, 2001).

Prolactin provides the body with sexual gratification after sexual acts: The hormone counteracts the effect of dopamine, which is responsible for sexual arousal. This is thought to cause the sexual refractory period. ${ }^{[6]}$ The amount of prolactin can be an indicator for the amount of sexual satisfaction and relaxation. Unusually high amounts are suspected to be responsible for impotence and loss of libido (see hyperprolactinemia symptoms) (Gerlo et al., 2006).

Prolactin also has a number of other effects including contributing to surfactant synthesis of the fetal lungs at the end of the pregnancy and immune tolerance of the fetus by the maternal organism during pregnancy; it also decreases normal levels of sex hormones - estrogen in women and testosterone in men. It is this inhibition of sex steroids that is responsible for loss of the menstrual cycle in lactating women as well as lactation-associated osteoporosis. Prolactin also enhances luteinizing hormone-receptors in Leydig cells, resulting in testosterone secretion, which leads to spermatogenesis (Kruger et al., 2006). Prolactin levels peak during sleep, and in the early morning. Levels can rise after exercise, meals, sexual intercourse, minor surgical procedures, or following epileptic seizures. Hypersecretion of prolactin is more common than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most frequent abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors. Clinical signs include inappropriate lactation, lack of menses, infertility in females, and impotence in males (Mancini et al., 2006).

\section*{FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH)}

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone found in humans and other animals. It is synthesized and secreted by gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland. FSH regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the body. FSH and Luteinizing hormone (LH) act synergistically in reproduction. FSH is a glycoprotein. Each monomeric unit is a protein molecule with a sugar attached to it; two of these make the full, functional protein. Its structure is similar to those of LH , TSH, and HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) (Radu et al., 2010).

In males, FSH stimulates maturation of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis. FSH enhances the production of androgen-binding protein by the Sertoli cells of the testes by binding to FSH receptors on their basolateral membranes, and is critical for the initiation of spermatogenesis. In females, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting granulosa cells. With the concomitant rise in inhibin B, FSH levels then decline in the late follicular phase. This seems to be critical in selecting only the most advanced follicle to proceed to ovulation. At the end of the luteal phase, there is a slight rise in FSH that seems to be of importance to start the next ovulatory cycle (Fowler et al., 2003).

The most common reason for high serum FSH concentration is in a female who is undergoing or has recently undergone menopause. High levels of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone indicate that the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to an unrestricted pituitary FSH production. If high FSH levels occur during the reproductive years, it is abnormal. Conditions with high FSH levels include: premature menopause, poor ovarian reserve, gonadal dysgenesis (in female) castration and testicular failure (in male). Most of these conditions are associated with subfertility and/or infertility. Therefore high FSH levels are an indication of subfertility and/or infertility (Mendiola et al., 2008). Diminished secretion of FSH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifested in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, cessation of reproductive cycles is commonly observed. Conditions with very low FSH secretions are: polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity , hirsutism , hypothalamic suppression, hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinemia, gonadotropin deficiency and gonadal suppression therapy (Bouloux et al., 2001 ).

\section*{LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH)}

Luteinizing hormone is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Its structure is similar to that of the other glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The release of LH at the pituitary gland is controlled by pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Those pulses, in turn, are subject to the oestrogen feedback from the gonads. In both males and females, LH is essential for reproduction (Smellie, 2007). In females, an acute rise of LH called the LH surge triggers ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH), it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. (Pincus et al., 1997)

Persistently high LH levels are indicative of situations where the normal restricting feedback from the gonad is absent, leading to a pituitary production of both LH and FSH. While this is typical in the menopause, it is abnormal in the reproductive years. There it may be a sign of: premature menopause, gonadal dysgenesis, polycystic ovary syndrome (in female), castration and testicular failure (in male). Diminished secretion of LH can result in failure of gonadal function (hypogonadism). This condition is typically manifest in males as failure in production of normal numbers of sperm. In females, amenorrhea is commonly observed. Conditions with very low LH secretions are: hypothalamic suppression, hypopituitarism, eating disorder hyperprolactinemia, gonadotropin deficiency and gonadal suppression therapy (Newcomb et al., 1995).

ESTRADIOL 2 (EII)

Estradiol is the predominant sex hormone present in females. It is also present in males, being produced as an active metabolic product of testosterone. It represents the major estrogen in humans. Estradiol has not only a critical impact on reproductive and sexual functioning, but also affects other organs including the bones. In plasma, estradiol is largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin, also to albumin. Only a fraction of $2.21 \%(+/-0.04 \%)$ is free and biologically active, the percentage remaining constant throughout the menstrual cycle (Pentikäinen et al., 2000). In the female, estradiol acts as a growth hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting the lining of the vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. The development of secondary sex characteristics in women is driven by estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated at the time of puberty most enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after the menopause. Thus, estradiol enhances breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, fat deposition. Fat structure and skin composition are modified by estradiol (Douma et al., 2005). Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women's mental health, with links suggested between the hormone, mood and well-being. Sudden drops or fluctuations in, or long periods of sustained low levels of estrogen may be correlated with significant mood-lowering. Clinical recovery from depression postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause was shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored (Lasiuk, and Hegadoren, 2007).

The effect of estradiol (and estrogens) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol is produced in the Sertoli cells of the testes. There is evidence that estradiol functions to prevent apoptosis of male sperm cells. Several studies have noted that sperm counts have been declining in many parts of the world and it has been postulated that this may be related to estrogen exposure in the environment. Suppression of estradiol production in a subpopulation of subfertile men may improve the semen analysis (Raman and Schlegel, 2002).

\section*{PROGESTERONE (PRG)}

Progesterone also known as P4 (pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) is a C-21 steroid hormone involved in the female menstrual cycle, pregnancy (supports gestation) and embryogenesis of humans and other species.

Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestogens, and is the major naturally occurring human progestogen. Progesterone is produced in the ovaries (to be specific, after ovulation in the corpus luteum), the adrenal glands (near the kidney), and, during pregnancy, in the placenta. Progesterone is also stored in adipose (fat) tissue. In humans, increasing amounts of progesterone are produced during pregnancy: In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after ovulation, and are elevated during the luteal phase (Conneely et al., 2004).

Progesterone is sometimes called the "hormone of pregnancy", and it has many roles relating to the development of the fetus: Progesterone converts the endometrium to its secretory stage to prepare the uterus for implantation.

At the same time progesterone affects the vaginal epithelium and cervical mucus, making it thick and impenetrable to sperm.

If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels will decrease, leading, in the human, to menstruation. Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding (Sitruk, 2004).

During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy.

Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. In addition progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production.

A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor (Shanker et al.1997).
Progesterone levels are relatively low in children and postmenopausal women. Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Since most progesterone in males is created during testicular production of testosterone, and most in females by the ovaries, the shutting down (whether by natural or chemical means), or removal, of those inevitably causes a considerable reduction in progesterone levels (Dennerstein et al., 2003).

\section*{PITUITARY GLAND}
-The pituitary gland (hypophysis) lies in a bony cavity, the sella turcica, located at the base of the skull. The gland is approximately 1 cm in diameter and weighs approximately 500 mg .
-Anatomocally the gland is divided into two lobes, anterior (adenohypophysis) and posterior (neurohypophysis).
- Blood reaches the pituitary from two sources: arterial blood is supplied by a branch of the internalcarotid, and venous blood carrying neurosecretory material from the hypothalamus reaches the pituitary through a venous portal system.

\section*{ANTERIOR PITUITARY (ADENOHYPOPHYSIS)}
- This pituitary lobe secretes (produces) at least 6 types of hormones, all of which are proteins or peptides. These hormones are: growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
- The activity of the anterior pituitary is under the control of the hypothalamus, which synthesizes small peptides (neuropeptides) known as releasing or inhibiting hormones or factors. These hypothalamic factors are:- corticotrophin-releasing hormone(CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone(TRH), growth hormonereleasing hormone (GRH), somatostatin (also called growth hormone- inhibiting hormone,GHIH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH), GnRH is sometimes referred to as LHRH (luteinizing hormone -
releasing hormone. Therapeutic use of releasing hormones may be indicated in conditions where insufficient secretion of anterior pituitary hormones is due to hypothalamic dysfunction.
- The functional relationship between the pituitary and its target glands is based on feedback regulation, primarily negative feedback from the target gland to the pituitary and hypothalamus. The effect of negative feedback control is opposite to that of the initial stimulus. The importance of such feedback control lies in the maintenance of an optimal concentration of hormones in the blood under a variety of physiological circumstances.
(1) GROWTH HORMONE AND SOMATOMEDINS
- Growth hormone (GH)or somatotropin (STH), is the most abundant hormone in the anterior pituitary. Plasma levels of GH in adult remain stable and relatively low with four or five sharp spikes occurring 3-4 hrs after meals and a marked rise an hour after the onset of sleep.

\section*{REGULATION OF SECRETION}
- The release of GH appears to be under the control of two hypothalamic factors. One is GH-releasing hormone (GRH) and the other is somatostatin or GHIH which inhibits GH release. The release of these two factors is in turn controlled by the higher centres of the brain. Thus various stimuli such as exercise, physical and emotional stress, hypoglycaemia, increased amino acid levels and hormones such as testosterone, estrogens and thyroxine stimulate GH secretion.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION}
- The overall action of GH is to promote growth of cartilage, bone and many soft tissues by stimulating protein synthesisMost GH effects are delayed rather than immediate.

\section*{SOMATOMEDINS}
- GH stimulates secretion by the liver of peptides called somatomedins. Their effects include enhanced incorporatin of sulfate into cartilage and stimulation of synthesis of DNA and RNA for collagen formation. Unlike most other peptide hormones, somatomedins circulate in the blood complexed with a plasma - binding protein.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE----Clinically important states of growth hormone excess or deficiency are rare. When present, GROWTH HORMONE EXCESS results in over growth of the skeleton and soft tissues. The most commonly occurs in adult and is known as ACROMEGALY. When GH excess occurs before long-bone growth is complete, there is a striking acceleration of linear growth a condition termed as pituitary gigantism.
- GH deficiency leads to growth retardation. Children who lack sufficient GH production or action will not grow normally. GH deficiency may be congenital or acquired OR due to anatomic damage to the pituitary or hypothalamus OR associated to deficiency of other pituitary hormones. Somatomedin levels are low in patients with GH deficiency and growth failure.

\section*{LAB INVESTIGATION}

BY analysing GH in blood specimen using either immunoassays or enzyme linked fluorescence assay (ELFA).

\section*{OTHER MAJOR HORMONES PRODUCED BY THE ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND}

NB/---LH,FSH,TSH,PRL,ACTH----reffer to appropriate section

\section*{POSTERIOR PITUITARY (NEUROHYPOPHYSIS)}
- This is part of a neurosecretory system consisting of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in the hypothalamus, the tracts of nerve fibres from the cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei, and the posterior lobe of the pituitary.The two hormones secreted by this part of the pituitary are the ADH(VASOPRESSIN or ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE), and OXYTOCIN

\section*{ADH ( ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE)}
- The principal stimulus for ADH secretion is an increase in plasma osmolality. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus and probably in the posterior pituitary respond to changes in plasma osmolality. Other important stimuli for ADH release include a reduction in plasma volume or arterial pressure, pain, stress, sleep exercise and drugs such as nicotine, morphine and barbiturates. Hyposmolality, volume expansion,hypertension, exposure to cold, alcohol and some drugs eg phenytoin, glucocorticoids-inhibits the release of ADH.
- The prinicipal physiological action of ADH is stimulation of water reabsorption from the renal tubular fluid. The blood levels of ADH regulates water balance, which indirectly regulates the concentration of osmotically active solutes in the ECF.ADH increases the volume of water reabsorbed by the renal tubules; consequently, urine becomes concentrated and its volume decreases. ADH is believed to play an important role in maintaining arterial blood pressure during acute blood loss.

\section*{CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ADH}
-POLYURIC STATES---deficient production or action of ADH results in polyuria due to failure of the renal tubule to reabsorbed solute -free-water. POLYURIC STATES can be divided into three general categories:-
(1) Deficient ADH production(central diabetes insipidus)-----due to destructive or infiltrative lesions involving the hypothalamus or pituitary. The defieciency of ADH may be partial or complete.
(2) decreased response of the kidney to the action of ADH ( nephrogenic diabetes insipidus)----due to variety of conditions affecting the kidney eg amyloidosis, multiple myeloma nd chronic electrolytes abnormalities(hypokalaemia,hypercalcaemia).
(3) excessive water intake (psychogenic polydipsia)----this may be difficult to distinguish from dibetes insipidus.Patients with psychogenic polydipsia generally have significant psychiatric illness and may deny that their intake of liquids is excessive. In many case it may be difficult to determine whether the primary problem is due to excessive fluid intake or to uncontrolled water loss as a result of deficient ADH action OXYTOCIN
-The primary stimulus for oxytocin release is suckling. Stretch receptors in the uterus and in the vaginal mucosa may also stimulate release of oxytocin.Emotional stress inhibits lactation, possibly by inhibiting oxytocin release.
- oxytocin is present in both male and female but its physiological effects are only in females. Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the estrogen - primed uterus. It is useful therapeutic agent in inducing labor. Oxytocin also stimulates lactation by the mammary gland. Progestins are belleived to inhibit the action of oxytocin.

\section*{THYROID GLAND HORMONES}

The major thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid gland is thyroxine, also called T4 because it contains four iodine atoms. To exert its effects, $T 4$ is converted to triiodothyronine (T3) by the removal of an iodine atom. This occurs mainly in the liver and in certain tissues where T3 acts, such as in the brain. The amount of T4 produced by the thyroid gland is controlled by another hormone, which is made in the pituitary gland located at the base of the brain, called thyroid stimulating hormone (abbreviated TSH) . The amount of TSH that the pituitary sends into the blood stream depends on the amount of $\mathbf{T 4}$ that the pituitary senses. If the pituitary senses very little T4, then it produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more T4. Once the T4 in the blood stream goes above a certain level, the pituitary's production of TSH is shut off. The thyroid and pituitary act in many ways like a heater and a thermostat. When the heater is off and it becomes cold, the thermostat reads the temperature and turns on the heater. When the heat rises to an appropriate level, the thermostat senses this and turns off the heater. Thus, the thyroid and the pituitary, like a heater and thermostat, turn on and off . (explanation of the negative and positive feedback mechanism)
Thyroid gland tests
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
The best way to initially test thyroid function is to measure the TSH level in a blood sample. A high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is failing because of a problem that is directly affecting the thyroid (primary hypothyroidism). The opposite situation, in which the TSH level is low, usually indicates that the person has an overactive thyroid that is producing too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). Occasionally, a low TSH may result from an abnormality in the pituitary gland, which prevents it from making enough TSH to stimulate the thyroid (secondary hypothyroidism). In most healthy individuals, a normal TSH value means that the thyroid is functioning normall.
Thyroxine or tetraiodothyronine (T4)
Thyroxine circulates in the blood in two forms: 1) T4 bound to proteins that prevent the T4 from entering the various tissues that need thyroid hormone and 2) free T4, which does enter the various target tissues to exert its effects. The free T4 fraction is the most important to determine how the thyroid is functioning, and tests to measure this are called the Free T4 (FT4). Individuals who have hyperthyroidism will have an elevated FT4, whereas patients with hypothyroidism will have a low level of FT4. Combining the TSH test with the FT4 accurately determines how the thyroid gland is functioning. The finding of an elevated TSH and low FT4 indicates primary hypothyroidism due to disease in the thyroid gland. A low TSH and low FT4 indicate hypothyroidism due to a problem involving the pituitary gland. A low TSH with an elevated FT4 is found in individuals who have hyperthyroidism.
Triiodothyronine (T3)
Triiodothyronine tests are often useful to diagnosis hyperthyroidism or to determine the severity of the hyperthyroidism. Patients who are hyperthyroid will have an elevated T3 level. In some individuals with a low TSH, only the T3 is elevated and the FT4 is normal. T3 testing rarely is helpful in the hypothyroid
patient, since it is the last test to become abnormal. Patients can be severely hypothyroid with a high TSH and low FT4, but have a normal T3
Thyroid glands disorders
Disorders of the thyroid gland fall into the following categories: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, initial hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism, cancers and non-cancerous nodules. Thyroid abnormalities affect a considerable portion of the population (1-3). Numerous studies from various countries differ in their prevalence estimates for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. The difficulty with many of these studies lies in the variable definitions of disease states, the poorly defined and diverse populations studied, and the historically insensitive measures of thyroid function.
Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, is the overproduction of the thyroid hormones $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$, and is most commonly caused by the development of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease in which antibodies are produced which stimulate the thyroid to secrete excessive quantities of thyroid hormones. The disease can result in the formation of a toxic goiter as a result of thyroid growth in response to a lack of negative feedback mechanisms. It presents with symptoms such as a thyroid goiter, protruding eyes (exopthalmos), palpitations, excess sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, muscle weakness and unusual sensitivity to heat. Beta blockers are used to decrease symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as increased heart rate, tremors, anxiety and heart palpitations, and anti-thyroid drugs are used to decrease the production of thyroid hormones, in particular, in the case of Graves' disease. This type of hyperthyroidism tends to run in families, and it occurs more often in young women. Little is known about why specific individuals get this disease.
Another type of hyperthyroidism is characterized by one or more nodules or lumps in the thyroid that may gradually grow and increase their activity so that the total output of thyroid hormone into the blood is greater than normal. This condition is known as toxic nodular or multinodular goiter. Also, people may temporarily have symptoms of hyperthyroidism if they have a condition called thyroiditis. This condition is caused by a problem with the immune system or a viral infection that causes the gland to leak thyroid hormone. It can also be caused by taking too much thyroid hormone in tablet form.
It has been demonstrated in quite a number of studies that iodine-induced hyperthyroidism may occur after the introduction of iodine supplementation to iodine-deficient populations. The occurrence of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which is related to the thyroid autonomy due to the long-term iodine deficiency, was transient and its peak appeared in the third to the fifth year after iodine introduction. In addition, after iodine supplementation programs, the iodine intake levels of some countries (such as China) have been more than adequate or excessive.
Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is the underproduction of the thyroid hormones $\mathbf{T}_{3}$ and $\mathbf{T}_{4}$. Hypothyroid disorders may occur as a result of congenital thyroid abnormalities (see congenital hypothyroidism), autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, especially in poorer countries, or the removal of the thyroid following surgery to treat severe hyperthyroidism. Typical symptoms are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, baldness, cold intolerance. Hypothyroidism is treated with hormone replacement therapy, such as levothyroxine, which is typically required for the rest of the patient's life. Negative feedback mechanisms result in growth of the thyroid gland when thyroid hormones are being produced in sufficiently low quantities as a means of increasing the thyroid output; however, where the hypothyroidism is caused by iodine insufficiency, the thyroid is unable to produce $\mathbf{T}_{3}$ and $\mathbf{T}_{4}$ and as a result, the thyroid may continue to grow to form a non-toxic goiter. It is termed non-toxic as it does not produce toxic quantities of thyroid hormones, despite its size. Studies have shown that hypothyroidism occurs in about $\mathbf{4 \%}$ to $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ of the US population and in up to $18 \%$ of those over age 60 ; for women in this age group, the prevalence of hypothyroidism may be as high as $20 \%$. The most common cause of permanent hypothyroidism in North America is a chronic autoimmune condition, Hashimoto's thyroiditis. High titers of antithyroid peroxidase autoantibodies may be present in up to $95 \%$ of those with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and are helpful in diagnosis. Other permanent causes of hypothyroidism include thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine therapy, head or neck irradiation, and congenital defects. Hypothyroidism may temporarily arise from an inflammation of the thyroid gland, from some medications, or from too much or too little iodine.

Initial hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism
This is the overproduction of $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ followed by the underproduction of $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$. There are two types: Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder whereby the body own immune system reacts with the thyroid tissues. At the beginning, the gland is overactive, and then becomes underactive as the gland is destroyed resulting in too little thyroid hormone production or hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's is most common in middle-age females and tends to run in families. Also more common in individuals with hashimoto's thyroiditis are Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. Postpartum thyroiditis occurs in some females following delivery. The gland becomes inflamed and the condition initially presents with overactivity of the gland followed by underactivity. In some cases, the gland does recover with time and resume its functions.

\section*{Thyroid cancer}

Cancers do occur in the thyroid gland and are more common in female occuring in the third, fourth and fifth decade of life. In most cases, the thyroid cancer presents as a painless mass in the neck. It is very unusual for the thyroid cancers to present with symptoms, unless it has been neglected. One may be able to feel a hard nodule in the neck. Diagnosis is made using a needle biopsy and various radiological studies. Most of the nodules are due to cystic change in nodular goiter or colloid cyst while a few of the solitary nodules are neoplastic. Marked variation in the prevalence of thyroid tumours has been observed in different regions of the world. In iodine - rich areas, higher frequency of papillary carcinoma of thyroid gland has been encountered. Malignancies of the thyroid gland are relatively rare worldwide, but incidence has steadily increased over the last few decades. Among US females, thyroid cancer accounts for about $3 \%$ of all cancers and is the eighth most common malignancy. In contrast, in Kuwait, thyroid cancer ranks second, comprising $8 \%$ of all female cancers, and similar findings have been reported for other countries in the Gulf region .

\section*{Non-cancerous nodules}

Many individuals may find the presence of small masses (nodules) in the neck. The majority of these thyroid nodules are benign (non cancerous). The presence of a thyroid nodule does not mean that one has thyroid disease. Most thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms, and most are discovered on an incidental examination. Doctors usually perform a needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid to determine the status of the nodules. If the nodule is found to be non-cancerous, no other treatment is required. If the nodule is suspicious then surgery is recommended
Thyroid disorder and diabetes mellitus
Studies show that the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and thyroid disease is higher in patients with DM than in the general population. Thus, screening for thyroid disorders in individuals with diabetes might be recommended. However, there is no consensus as to best markers for this screening. Thyroid autoantibodies are more frequent in patients with DM than in the general population. Higher prevalence rates have been reported in Type 1 DM than in Type 2 DM .

\section*{Thyroid disease and breast cancer}

Breast cancer is a hormone-dependent neoplasm. Conflicting results regarding the clinical correlation between breast cancer and thyroid diseases have been reported in the literature. Studies have shown that thyroid diseases are common among women with breast cancer, whereas other reports have not confirmed such an association of breast cancer with thyroid diseases. Almost every form of thyroid disease, including nodular hyperplasia, hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer, has been identified in association with breast cancer. These findings have led to the investigation of the relationship between breast cancer and autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs). Some authors have reported a higher prevalance of AITDs among breast cancer patients than in age-matched control individuals. The precise significance of this association remains elusive, and some reports have shown that the presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies is associated with a significant improvement in outcome among breast cancer patients and is of similar importance to other prognostic indices such as axillary nodal status and tumour size.

\section*{ADRENAL HORMONES AND FUNCTION TESTS}

\section*{ADRENAL GLANDS}

This is an endocrine gland tissue that release their secretory products into extracellular and interstitial fluids.the secretory products are called hormones. Hormones may be transported in the bloodstream from their place of synthesis to a distant location where they exert their action, but some hormones also act in close proximity to their site of release.
- adrenal glands are situated in the kidney . It is divided into two parts ie adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. Adrenal cortex is the site of synthesis and secretion of (A)adrenocortical steroids hormones and (B) adrenal medulla is the site of production of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine).

\section*{(A)ADRENOCORTICAL STEROIDS}
- The corticosteroids are physiologically and quatitatively the most important group of adrenal steroids. The major corticosteroids are cortisol and aldosterone.
- Functionally ,corticosteroids may be subdivided into glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids .Glucocorticoids tend to elevate blood glucose through promotion of gluconeogenesis and decrease carbohydrate utilization. In addition, glucocorticoids inhibits amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in peripheral tissues (muscles, skin, bone) and affect fat metabolism. Large circulating amounts of glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory, immunosupprsive and antiallergic properties. Of the naturally occurring corticosteroids, only cotisol and corticosterone have glucocorticoid activity. Of the two cortisol is more active.
-The term mineralocorticoids refers to those steroids that regulate salt metabolism (sodium conservation and loss of potassium) and water metabolism (control of extracellular fluid volume). The most potent naturally occurring mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.

\section*{OTHER ADRENAL STEROID HORMONES}

Besides corticosteroids, the adrenals also secrete androgens, progesterone, and estrogens, all of which are produced by the gonads as well. Androgens include androstenedione, testosterone, hydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), AND 11 § - hydroxyandrostnedione. From the quantitative standpoint, androstenedione and DHEAare the most important adrenal androgens. Estrogen and progesterone of andrenal origin are quantitatively insignificant.

\section*{BIOSYNTHESIS OF ADRENAL CORTICOSTEROIDS}
-The adrenal cortex consists of three layers of cells(zones) each having different secretory products: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculate, and the zonareticularis.
(a) the zona glomerulosa produces aldosterone
(b) the zona fasciculate procuduces cortisol (the principal product) and to a lesser extent corticosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone.
(c) the zona reticularis is the principal site for the secretion of androgens such as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and to a very limited extent estrogens.
-The ACTH (ADRENAL CORTICOTROPIC HORMONE) produced by the pituitary glands stimulates the adrenal glands for the secretion of the above mention hormones.
-- All the above mentioned steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol
- The major site of corticosteroid catabolism is the liver. About $1 \%$ of cortisol secreted appears unchanged in urine(urinary free cortisol).

\section*{REGULATION AND CORTISOL SECRETION}
-About $90 \%$ of circulating cortisol is bound to plasma proteins primarily to an alpha globulin known as corticosteroid-binding globulin(CBG) OR transcortin. There is also a weak binding to albumin..The concentration of CBG in plasma rises during pregnancy and during estrogen therapy, with a concomitant increase of total cortisol in plasma. However since the amount of free, physiologically active hormone remains at normal levels, there are no unwanted effects..
- Synthesis and release of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens are under the control of the anterior pituitary hormone ACTH, through a negative feedback mechanism.. Only cortisol is involved in the negative feedback regulation of ACTH secretion. As the levels of free cortisol in blood rises, the release of ACTH is inhibited. Conversely, if cortisol levels are subnormal, negative feedback is diminished, ACTH levels rises , and adrenal cortex is stimulated until normal blood levels of cortisol are restored. The release of ACTH itself is under the control of hypothalamic corticotrophin- releasing hormone (CRH).
-There is diurnal variation in the secretion of cortisol and ACTH .In the early morning hours, blood levels ofACTH and cortisol start to rise, reaching a maximum between 6 am and 8 am ( $6-8 \mathrm{am}$ ), after which there is a gradual decline to the lowest level between early evening_ and mid-night ( $\mathbf{3 p m}-\mathbf{1 2}$ mid night). The levels at 8 pm are normally $2 / 3$ the levels at 8 am . The regularity of this rhythm is a function of sleep-wake habits and can be altered by consistent revision of the time and duration of the sleep-wake schedule. The normal
regulatory system can be superseded by stimulatory factors such as trauma and stress, regardless the time of the day and independent of the plasma levels of cortisol. The response of normal individuals to stressful situation is a sharp rise in ACTH secretion and a consequent increase in cortisolsecretion. In certain adrenal diseases ( eg Cushings syndrome), the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion may be absent.

\section*{REGULATION AND CONTROL ALDOSTERONE}

The control mechanism for the secretion of aldosterone involves the rennin-angiotensin system.

\section*{CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF GLUCOCORTICOID MEASUREMENTS}
-Cortisol measurements aree the key to evaluating suspected abnormalities of glucocorticoid production. However, a single cortisol measurement under random conditions is rarely of value, since cortisol varies under normal circumstances through the course of a day and with stress.
-Pathological conditions that leads to the measurement of cortisol levels are :
(1)_GLUCOCORTICOID DEFICIENCY (ADDISON"S DISEASE)---This may be due to either destructive processes that involves both adrenal glands(such as autoimmunity, infection, or neoplasm) or to deficient pituitary production of acth secondary to disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus. . Pharmacologic doses o glucocorticoids may also cause sufficient suppression of ACTH such that cessation of treatment will be followed by a period of hypoadrenocortical function.
(2) GLUCOCORTICOID EXCESS ( CUSHING"S SYNDROME)--excesive cortisol production results in the clinical picture known as CUSHING"S SYNDROME ( obesity, hypertension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, $\mathbf{C H O}$ intolerance disturbance in reproductive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms). Excess cortisol production may be due to excess ACTH production by pituitary adenoma or benign or malignant adrenal cortical neoplasm, or it could be due to production of ACTH by nonendocrine neoplasm

\section*{CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RENIN AND ALDOSTERONE MEASUREMENTS}
-The interaction of rennin, angiotensin and aldosterone is important in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume , blood pressure and the balance of sodium and potassium. Achange in one of these variables leads to changes in the others.
(1) HYPER ALDOSTERONISM---this is overproduction of aldosterone which may be due to an adenoma of adrenal gland, or adrenal carcinoma
(2) HYPOALDOSTERONISM-low production of aldosterone which cause hyponatramia and hypokalemia

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}
- BY analysing cortisol either in urine or in blood specimen using either immunoassays or enzyme linked fluorescence assay (ELFA).

\section*{(B) CATECHOLAMINES}
-Catecholamines are benzene rings bearing two hydroxyl groups (catechol) and an alkylamine chain..The most important endogenously produced compounds of this group are:-
(1)epinephrine (adrenalin),
(2)norepinephrine (noradrenalin)
(3)dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine).
- The main site of production of catecholamines are the brain, chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, and sympathetic neurons. Epinephrine is quantitatively the most important substance produced by the adrenal medulla. Norepinephrine is the major substance liberated by the postganglionic sympatheyic nerves..
- Each of these catecholamine hormones have a characteristic physiolocal functionand pharmacological actions:-
(1)Dopamine and norepinephrine are importantneurotransmitters in the central nervous system ( the brain and the spinal cord). Both have a lot opf influence on the vascular system
(2) Epinephrine influences metabolic processes, especially carbohydrate metabolism

\section*{BIOSYTHESIS, STORAGE AND RELEASE}
-- L-amino acid tyrosine is the precursor of the catecholamines.
- Tyrosine is coverted to dihydroxyphenyalanine (DOPA) through some enzymatic action in the mitochondria. DOPA is converted to dopamine in the cytoplasm through the action aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase.. Dopamine is the transported by an energy -dependent mechanism into storage granules (vesicles) that are present both in the sympathetic nerve endings and in the adrenal medulla..These granules contain dopamine-ß-oxidase, an enzyme that is responsible for the final conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine which is then stored in the granules.
-In the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine released from the storage granules becomes the substrate for another cytoplasmic enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, which catalyses the formation of epinephrine.
- Biosythesis and release of catecholamines are regulated both by intracellular compartmentalization and by feedback inhibition on rate-limiting steps by the products. Nerve stimulation is necessary for the release of catecholamines from their vesicles by the process of exocytosis, which is aided by contraction of the microfibrils of the cells.
- Upon release from the storage vesicles, catecholamines act on effector sites. Catecholamines are then rapidly inactivated via reuptake by storage granules, conversion to metabolites, or excretion. Catecholamines are transported free in blood and have a very short half-life of les than 2 minutes.
-The principal end product of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) metabolim is vanillymandelic acid (VMA) and to a lesser extent methoxyhydroxyphenylglyco I(MHPG). To this reason, urinary measurement of VMA reflect the total production of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the body.

\section*{CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CATECHOLAMINES}
- Catecholamines plays an important role both in health and in disease.
(A) Increase in catecholamines is associated with stress, a fall in blood pressure or blood volume, thyroid hormone deficiency, congestive heart failure. Decreased amount of catecholamines are seen in idiopathic postural hypotension.
(B) Laboratory measurement of norepinephrine, epinephrine or the metabolites are primarily useful for the diagnosis of catecholamine-secreting neurochromaffin tumors (ie pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas or neuroblastomas). Benign or malignant neoplasms may arise in the autonomic nervous systemor the adrenal medulla. These tumors may produce excessive amounts of catecholamines or catecholamine metabolites. Such tumors are rare. However , when the classic picture of catecholamineexcess occurs -hypertension, weight loss, spells of sweating, headache, palpitations and anxiety- it is quite striking. Although life threatening, this condition is curable with surgery
- In adults, $90 \%$ of these rare tumours occur in the adrenal medulla where they are called pheochromocytomas. The $10 \%$ that occur in extra-adrenal sites are known as paragangliomas. .Although hypertension is a common symptom of patients with pheochromocytoma, this catecholamine- secreting tumour accounts for $<0.55$ of all hypertensive cases. Pheochromocytomas are familial in about $10 \%$ of cases .

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION}

Urine is used for the screening test of VMA.
determination of plasma catecholamines can be done using immunochemical techniques.

\section*{ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR HORMONES}

The current analytical technique employed in the analysis of all the hormones use the principle of immunochemical reaction based on an antiboby/antigen reaction. The set up of the reagent could either have the the antigen to the hormone being determined and this will react with the specific antibody (being the hormone in the specimen) in the specimen.
Analytical Principle:
The assay principle combined an enzyme immunoassay sandwich method with a final fluorescent detection (enzyme linked fluorescent assay (ELFA))

Analytical method:
The SPR served as the solid phase as well as the pipetting device for the assay. Reagents for the assay were ready for use and pre-dispensed in the sealed reagent strips. All the assay steps were performed automatically by the machine. The reaction medium was cycled in and out of the SPR several times. The sample was taken and transferred into the well containing alkaline - phosphatase labeled anti- (T4, T3, FT4, FT3, TSH, LH, PRG, FSH, PRL,, EST, TESTO) immunoglobulins (conjugate). The sample/conjugate mixture was cycled in and out of SPR several times to increase reaction speed. The antigens binds with the antibodies coated on the SPR and to the conjugate forming a "sandwich". Unbound components were eliminated during the washing steps of the assay.

In the final detection step, the substrate (4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) was cycled in and out of the SPR. The conjugate enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of the substrate into a fluorescent product (4-methylumbelliferone). The intensity of the fluorescence was directly proportional to the antigen present in the
sample.At the end of the assay, results were automatically calculated by the machine in relation to the calibration curve stored in memory and then printed out.

\section*{GASTRIC, PANCREATIC AND INTESTINAL FUNCTION, DISODERS AND ANALYSIS INTRODUCTION}
*The stomach, intestines and the pancrease functions are inter-related well coordinated and regulated with a final result of ensuring efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients that are essential for the maintenance and survival of body cells.
*These coordination and regulation of the organs activities are all dependent on hormones that stimulate or inhibit secretion of fluids containing hydrochloric acid (HCL), Bile acids, bicarbonates and digestive enzymes. *The stomach is the centre of food digestion. It is divided into three sections (zones):- (1) cardiac zone (2)the stomach body zone (3) pyloric zone.
Zonal activities
(1) Cardiac zones-----contains mucus secreting epithelial cells
(2) Body of stomach---has four different cells each performing specific duty (a)surface epithelial cells secrete mucus (b) parietal cells--- the main and possibly only source of HCL and intrinsic factors (c) chief or peptic cells---secretes considerable amount of pepsinogen (d) neck chief cells or mucus cells----secretes mucus and pepsinogen.
(3) Pyloric zone---(sub-divided into:-antrum, pyloric canal and the pyloric sphincter)-The cells in this zone secretes mucus, some pepsinogen and gastrin BUT NO HCL.

\section*{DIGESTIVE PROCESS}

Digestive process consists of three phases namely :-(1)Cephalic phase (2) gastric phase (3) intestinal phase.
:-(1) Cephalic phase----initiated by the sight, smell and the taste of food. This will stimulate the cerebral cortex and subsequently the vagal nuclei which results with the secretion of pepsinogen, HCL and gastrin in readiness for the food entering the stomach.
(2) gastric phase-----This phase is initiated by the distention caused by food entering the stomach. There is the release of HCL caused by the direct stimulation of the parietal cells by the vagus nerve. There is also the release of gastrin which stimulate the secretion of pepsinogen and pancreatic fluid rich in enzymes and the release of a number of gastrointestinal hormones(secretin, insulin, acetylcholine, somatostatin and pancreatin polypeptide). As a result of acidic environment, pepsinogen is rapidly converted to the active proteolytic enzyme pepsin.
(3) intestinal phase--- This process begins when the partially degested food mixed with mucus (chime) enters the duodenum.This phase is accompanied with the release of the hormones secretin, gastrin and cholecystokinin.
PANCREASE---This organ lies across the posterior wall of the abdomen. It secretes the bicarbonate richpancreatic juice which contains the pancreatic digestive enzymes. Amylase is concerned with the breaking down od oligo- and disaccharides into monosaccharides which are then actively absorded into the blood stream. Trypsin, and carboxypeptidase from the pancrease and aminopeptidase from the small intestine are concerned with the break down of proteins into amino acids which are then absorded in the blood stream.

GALL BLADDER—produces the bile juice which contains the bile salts which aids in the emulsification of the dietry fats which are the hydrolyzed by lipase to individual fatty acidsand then absorbed in the small intestine.
- Most nutrients, including vitamins and minerals are absorbed at the small intestine into the blood stream.
- At the large intestine (ceacum, colon rectum) water is actively absorbed, electrolytes balance is regulated and bacterial action take place. These processes results with the formation of faeces.

\section*{GASTROINTESTINAL HORMONES}
*The gasrointestinal(GI) tract is both a mojor endocrine organ and a target for many hormones released locally and a distance. The GI hormones are released by endocrine cells found throughout the gut mucosa and are so numerous that the gut is recognized as the largest endorine organ in ythe body
* Collectively, the GI hormones influence motility, secretion, digestion and absorptionin the gut. They regulate bile flow as well as secretion of pancreatichormones and affect tonicityof vascular walls, blood presure and cardiac output. Many of these hormones are present both in the gut and in the central nervous system makingthem important in the neuroendocrine control of of the gut.In addition they may have a role as neurotransmitters when released from nerve synapses.
* The following is a list of the GI hormones and their major function and clinical significance:-
(1)GASTRIN----

Produced and stored mainly by the special cells (G-cells) of the antral mucosa of the stomach. The Dcells of the islets of langarhans of the pancrease produce very little of gastrin.It controls the secretion of gastric juice, secretion of $\mathbf{H C l}$ and secretion of pancreatic bicabonate.. Maximum secretion of gastrin from the fundus occurs at an antral $\mathbf{p H}$ of 5-7 but is inhibited by lower $\mathbf{P h}$. This negative feedback regulation appears to be a safe guard against overacidification. Other stimulus of gastrin secretion are:- alcohol, caffeine and insulin induced hypoglycaemia.
Secretin is known to inhibit the secretion of gastrin.
Clinical significance----Knowledge of blood gastrin levels is helpful in the diagnosis of ZOLLINGER-ELLISON(Z-E) SYNDROME. Z-E syndrome is caused by gastrinomas(duodinal or pancreatic endocrine tumours) that produce and secrete large quantities of gastrin. Patients with gastric ulcer disease sually demonstrate elevated basal and postprandial serum gastrin levels which are most likely due to decreased inhibition of gastrin secretion.
(2) CHOLECYSTOKININ-PANCREOZYMIN (CCK-PZ)

Produced and stored in the intestine. It activates gallbladder contraction, increases the motility of the duodenum and the small intestines and also stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Because of its dual action it is sometimes called CCK-PZ.
Clinical significance---Its estimation helps to investigate the absorption and movement of food in the small intestine.
(3)SECRETIN

Produced and stored by the $S$ cells of the duodenum. Its major role is the stimulation of pancrease to produce an increased amount of juice with high concentration of bicarbonate content.This is the reason for its inclusion in pancreatic test profile.Secretin inhibits gastrin release(except in Z-E syndrome) and therefore gastric acid secretion.
Alcohol appears to increase secretin release by stimulation of gastric acid secretion with subsequent lowering of duodenal Ph. The only inhibitor of secretin release is somatostatin.
(4)VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE(VIP)

This hormone is present throughout the body and it is found in high concentration in the nervous system and the gut..
-Unlike other GI hormones, VIP is distributed along the entire length of the gut from the oesophagus to the colon but it is more concentrated in the jejunum, ileum and colon.
Its physiological action includes:- neurotransmittion, increase water and electrolyte secretion from the pancrease and gut, release of hormones from the pancrease, gut and hypothalamus, stimulation of lipolysis, glycogenolysis and bile flow., inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion.
(5)GASTRIC INHIBITORY POLYPEPTIDE(GIP)

GIP is synthesized and released by the $K$ cells located in the duodenal and jejuna mucosa. Plasma level is increased by oral administration of glucose. Its physiological role includes (1)stimulation of insulin secretion in the presence of hyperglycaemia, (2) reduction of intestinl motility with stimulation of small intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretions ( 3) inhibition of gastric acid, pepsin and gastrin secretion
(6)SOMATOSTATIN

This is one of the most potent known inhibitors of endocrine secretions. It inhibits the release of growth hormone, TSH, insulin,glucagon, gastrin, CCK, Secretin, VIP,GIP. It inhibits the effect of these hormoneson their target tissues.
(7)BOMBESIN---High concentration in the stomach and the duodenum . Function as a local releasing factor for some GI hormones
(8) MOTILIN---seceted by the stomach. It has strong stimulant effect of the of smooth muscles of the upper GI. It increases motily of the stomach.It has a unique action since it is effective in fasting states contraction. LABORATORY ANALYSIS

\section*{ALL THESE GI HORMONES ARE ANALYZED BY IMMUNO-CHEMICAL ASSAYS METHODS. ENZYMES OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT}

The enzmes that fall under this includes(1) pepsin and pepsinogen (2)Amylase (3) lipase (4)trypsin (5)chymotrypsin (6) elastase
pepsin and pepsinogen-----
the chief and peptic cells, the mucus cells of the stomach produce pepsinogen. It is secreted into the stomach and forms part of the gastric fluid.Its production is stimulated by the vagus nerve and some GI hormones eg secretin, gastrin. Its secretion is inhibited by gastric inhibitory polypeptide.
Methods of analysis includes:- measurement of the enzymatic activity by hydrolysis of specific protein or peptide substrates followed by measurement of the amount of substrate remaining or product formed (2) radioimmunoassay test (3)diffusion of the enzyme through a turbid mixture of agarose and dye-linked protein with subsequent measurement of cleared zones as the dye is split off from the protein by proteolytic action.
AMYLASE
Alpha-Amylase is one of the diagnostic parameter performed in the investigation of pancreatic disorders. It belongs to a group of hydrolaes that split complex carbohydrates composed of alpha-D-glucose units linked through carbon atoms 1 and 4 located on adjacent glucose residues. Amylase is present in a number of organs and tissues. The greatest concentration is present in the pancreas, where the enzyme is synthesized by the acinar cells and the secreted into the intestinal tract by way of the pancreatic- duct system. The salivary glands also secrete a potent amylase to initiate hydrolysis of starches while the food is still in the mouth and oesophagus (Udani et al., 2004).
Diseases resulting in elevation of plasma alpha-amylase include: acute pancreatitis, parotitis, alcoholism, renal insufficiency and viral diseases such as hepatitis, AIDS and abdominal typhoid. In acute pancreatitis, amylase increases 5-6 hours aftervthe onset of symptoms and remains elevated for 2-5 days.The increase in amylase plasma activity does not reflect disease severity and conversely, extensive destruction of the pancreas may not cause a significant increase in the plasma concentration of pancreatic alpha-amylase (Perry et al., 2007).

\section*{LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF AMYLASE}

Amylase reagent is used to measure the concentration of amylase by a kinetic colour method. In the reaction, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl- $\alpha$-D-maltotrioside ( $\mathrm{CNPG}_{3}$ ) substrate reacted with amylase in the serum to release 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol (CNP) from the substrate which is directly proportional to the concentration of amylase in the sample. $3 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of sample is reacted with $300 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of reagent and the change in absorbance is monitored at 340 nm , due to reduction of NAD. This change is directly proportional to the concentration of GLU in the sample and is used to calculate and express concentration in mmol/L. The reaction takes place at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
$$\underset{\text { LIPASE }}{\mathrm{CNPG}_{3}}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text { amylase }} \mathrm{CNP}+\text { maltotriose }$$

Assays fro lipase in serum are used chiefly for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, in which levels change in a manner similar to those of amylase. The elevations are frequently more pronounced, more prolonged and more specific for the disease than are amylase elevations. For diagnostic purposes, lipase and amylase evaluations complement one another.
Trypsin
Recently developed immunochemical techniques have shown that elevation of serum trypsin is a highly sensitive and relatively specific indicator of pancreatic disease.

\section*{GASTRIC FUNCTION TESTS}

This can be achieved through the analysis of gastric residue, the determination of basal and stimulated secretion rates and the determinations of intrinsic factors and pepsinogen.

\section*{GASTRIC RESIDUE TEST}

Gastric residue is defined as the entire contents of the stomach after a fast of approximately 12 hours. The specimen is obtained by aspiration through a gastric tube. A normal total volume is between 20 to 100 mls but usually below 50 mls . Increased volume could be due to delayed emptying, increased gastric secretion and admixture of material from the duodenum. The colour of a normal gastric residue is clear.

\section*{FREE HCL DETERMINATION}

The concentration of free HCL in a normal person is $\mathbf{0 - 4 0 ~ m m o l} /$ l. Deermination of FREE HCL is often done through titration methods but measurement of $\mathbf{p H}$ of the gastric residue is the preferred method.

\section*{ANALYSIS OF GASTRIC RESIDUE}

\section*{Qualitative analysis}
(1) preparation of the patient---PT should be in a fasting state (no food or liquids for 10-12 hrs). No smoking or any exercise the morning of or during the test
(2) Gastric residue is collected by oral or nasal intubation under fluoroscopic guidance.

Screening test for free acid---the $\mathbf{p H}$ of aspirated gastric juice is measured using a $\mathbf{p H}$ meter OR use of Toepfer's reagent ( 0.5 g diethylaminoazobenzene/ 100 ml ) which gives red color at a pH less than 3 indicating free $\mathbf{H C L}$ and a yellow color when the $\mathbf{p H}$ is above 3 indicating absence of free HCLacid.

\section*{Quantitative analysis}
- a known volume of gastric residue is titrated with $\mathbf{N a O H} \mathbf{0 . 1 M O L} / \mathbf{L}$, to a $\mathbf{p H}$ of $\mathbf{3 . 5}$ by using a $\mathbf{p H}$ meter or until the toepfers reagent added to the gastric residue juice takes a salmon colour. The concentration of free hcl acid is then calculated as follows
( Free HCL $\boldsymbol{(} \mathbf{m m o l} \boldsymbol{/} \mathbf{l} \boldsymbol{)} \boldsymbol{=} \mathbf{N a O H} \boldsymbol{(} \mathbf{m l} \boldsymbol{)} \mathbf{X 0 . 1 m o l} \boldsymbol{/} \mathbf{I X 1 0 0 0}$ ) divide by (gastric specimen titrated(ml)
REF RANGE(0-40 MMOL/L)

\section*{INDERECT TEST PANCREATIC FUNCTION (TESTS FOR MALABSORPTION or IMPAIRED ABSORPTION}

These tests are based on the fact that proper pancreatic function is essential for normal intestinal absorption. Since the pancrease is the major source of amylase, lipase, and proteolytic enzymes, significant decrease in pancreatic function cause decreased digestion of starch, fats and protein and a parallel increase in the excretion of these food materials in stool. In pancreatic dysfunction

\section*{TOTAL FEACAL FAT ESTIMATION}

The quantification of faecal fat is the most definitive test for determining the presence of steatorrhea (increased presence of lipids but not for determining its cause.

\section*{Method 1(gravimetric method)}

PRINCIPLE---In the gravimetric method, a preweighed, emulsified stool specimen is acidified to decrease the ionization of fatty acids. The lipids are then extracted from stool specimen into an organic solvent, the solvent is evaporated, and the residue is quantitated by gravimetry

\section*{Method 2(titrimetric method)}

In titrimetric method, a weighed stool specimen is subjected to alkaline hydrolysis to convert esterified lipids to fatty acids and then acidified to facilitate the transfer of fatty acids into an organic solvent.The solvent is evaporated, and the residue is dissolved in ethanol and titrated with a standard solution of sodium hydroxide. T he results represent 80\% of total faecal fat.

\section*{Specimen collection----}

The pt should be on a diet containing 50-150 g of fat per day for 3 days prior to the day of testing and during the 72 hrs stool collection period. The pt should not have had castor oil or other laxatives prior to the specimen collection.
Stool specimen are conveniently collected in one-gallon paint can ( 4 litre). Contamination of the faeces with urine should be avoided.
Reference ranges(children $<6 \mathrm{yrs}$ (<2g/day),adults (2-6g/day). Values $>7 \mathrm{~g} /$ day indicates steatorrhea.

\section*{GASTRIC, PANCREATIC AND INTESTINAL DISEASES}

\section*{(A) PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE}

This iis a common name given to chronic duodenal ulcer and chronic gastric ulcer. Although both of these diseases have many features in common they differ with respect to incidences, pathogenesis, medical history, outcome and management.

\section*{CHRONIC DUODINAL ULCER}
-This type of ulcer affects the duodenum or the pyloric channel of the stomach.
- complications associated with this type of ulcer are :-
(a) haemorrahage due to ulcer eroding a blood vessel.
(b) perforation of the duodenal cap causing peritonitis
(c) penetration of the ulcer into the surrounding organs such as pancrease, liver, colon, abdominal wall and even the lungs.
(d) luminal obstruction caused by gradual contraction of the ulcer scar..

DIAGNOSIS---Is made primary by radiologic technique or endoscopy or the estimation of pepsinogen in the serum.

\section*{CHRONIC BENIGN GASTRIC ULCER}
-Gastric ulcers occur anywhere in the stomach. Some patients with gastric ulcer have a coexistent duodenal ulcer.
- As with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer can cause haemorrhage and may perforate

DIAGNOSIS--- is through radiologic examination.
(B)ZOLLINGER- ELLISON (Z-E) SYNDROME
-Gastrin is produced and stored mainly by special endocrine cells(G-CELLS) of the mucosa of the stomach and to a lesser extent G-cells of the duodenum and D-cells of the pancreatic islets.. After secretion the principal circulating type of gastrin is G-34( denoting the number of amino acids found in gastrin hormone
- Gastrin stimulates the secretion of gastric acid by the mucosa of the stomach. Maximum secretion of gastrin from the stomach mucosa occurs at a Ph of 5-7 but it is inhibited by o lower Ph. . This negative feedback appears to be a safeguard against over acidification.
- Knowledge of blood gastrin levels is helpful in the diagnosis of Zollinger-ellison syndrome which is caused by GASTRINOMAS( duodinal and pancreatic endocrine tumors) that produce and secrete large quantities of gastrin. This syndrome consists of peptic ulcer, massive gastric hyper secretion, non-b-islets cells tumors of the pancrease. ---Other characteristics of Z-E syndrome includes:-hypergastrinaemia, diarrhea, steotorrhae ( losing of a lot of fats in stoll). Gastrin levels are usually elevated 2-2000 times that of the normal.
DIAGNOSIS-----A secretin challenge is the most useful provocative test for the diagnosis of Z-E syndrome.
(C) GASTRITIS----this is the term used to denote mucosal inflamation. it can be classified as erosive , nonerosive or specific gastritis.
(A) Erosive Gastritis( also referred to as stress lesions or acute gastritis) occurs in five well defined clinical situations:- 1)following severe trauma, 2) following severe burns,3) in patients with intra-cranial disease 4) following craniotomy or tramatic head injuries, 5)in patients who chronically have to take drugs such as corticosteroids, aspirin or ethanol.
Diagnosis----endoscopy is usually definitive technique
(b) Non-Erosive---(also referred to as chronic gastritis)-associated with gastric ulcer dse and gastric carcinoma. Occurs following gastrectomy or in elderly healthy persons.
(c) Specific Gastritis---this is very rare.
(D) GASTRIC CANCER(ADENOCARCINOMA)

Arises fro the mucous cells of the gastric mucosa. Diagnosis is by biobsy. Pts with gastric cancer have fasting achlorhydria (high levels of HCL), volume of gastric residue may be increased and some cases of blood in the stomach may also be present.
(E) POST GASTRECTOMY SYNDROME
- this occurs after the treatment of peptic u,lcer disease by gastric resection or denervation ( vagatomy) of the stomach.. pts always suffer some functional incapacity. Symptoms includes- dumping syndrome, diarrhea, weight loss, anaemia and bone dse. The syndrome is caused by decrease in absorption of vital nutrients.
(F)DUMPING SYNDROME-

Occurs because the stomach after gastrectomy empties more rapidly than normal. pts experiences abdominal pains ,diarrhae and cardiac palpitations30-60 min after eating
-weight loss and some specific nutritional deficiencies are not uncommon following gastric surgery. Anaemia develops due to decreased iron, vit b12 and folate absorption.
- maldigestion will occur due to rapid gastric empting resulting with less gstric dispersion of solid foods and reduced digestion time.
2) PANCREATIC DISORDERS
- The pancrease is the organ concerned with the secretions of exocrine and endocrine substances. The endocrine function is the secretion of insulin and glucagons and the exocrine function is the production of amylase and alkaline fluid. . the diseases associated with the pancreas are acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and tumor of the pancreas.
1)Acute Pancreatitis---this is the sudden enzymatic destruction of the pancrease tissues resulting with the escape of the active pancreatic enzymes into the glandular parenchyma,. This dse can resolve once the causative factor has been eliminated.. Alcohol abuse has been associated with this dse. Diagnosis is by the estimation of serum amylase or radiological examination.
2) Chronic pancreatitis---this is the progressive damage of the pancrease even after the causative factor has been eliminated.. Ethanol abuse has been associated with this dse. Diagnosis is through radiological examination.
3)Tumor of the pancrease--this includes carcinoma of the pancrease as a whole, adenocarcinoma, of thepancreatic ductal epithelium . Tumors includes_ ; insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, stomatostatinoma. These tumors can also secrete adenocorticotropic hormone and calcitonin.
