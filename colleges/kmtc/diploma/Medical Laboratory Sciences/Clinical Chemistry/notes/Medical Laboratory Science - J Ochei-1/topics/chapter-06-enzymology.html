                                Introduction to Enzymes
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Enzymes are proteins produced by living cells. They are biocatalysts, i.e., they are able, in very small amounts, to hasten or modify a chemical reaction in the body without becoming involved in the reaction or affected by it. Enzymes are very useful tools in the diagnosis of diseases.</p>
                            <p>Enzymes are specific in their reaction. They act on one type of substrate and will take part in only one type of reaction or in a small range of reactions. The substrate is the substance on which the enzyme acts. For example, protease acts on protein, amylase on starch and urease on urea. Note that the names of enzymes usually end in the suffix -ase.</p>
                            
                            <p>Different enzymes work in different ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Dehydrogenases:</strong> Catalyse oxidation-reduction process.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Amino transferases:</strong> Catalyse the transfer of functional amino groups from one compound to another.</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Many enzymes work only in the presence of an activator (a simple inorganic salt or ion) or a co-enzyme (a complex organic compound).</p>

                            <h3>Measurement of Enzymes</h3>
                            <p>Enzymes are not measured directly because they are present in serum or plasma in very small amounts. They are therefore assayed by measuring either the amount of substrate reduced or used during the reaction or the amount of product formed during the reaction. Thus, it is in fact the enzyme activity that is measured.</p>

                            <h4>Units of Enzyme Activity</h4>
                            <p>In recent times, the units of enzyme activity have been, to some extent, standardised. The unit mostly used is the <strong>International Unit (IU)</strong>.</p>

                                    <p>One unit of any enzyme is that amount, which under defined assay conditions, will catalyse the conversion of 1 micromole (μmol) of the substrate per minute. The results are expressed in International Unit (IU) per litre.</p>

                            <p>Alkaline phosphatase is capable of transporting phosphate groups across cell membranes and is most active between pH 8 and 10. It is found in bone, liver, kidney and many other tissues. It is estimated to investigate diseases of the liver or bone, especially in cases of biliary obstruction, tumours, hydatid cyst and abscesses.</p>

                            <h4>Principle</h4>
                            <p>The enzyme alkaline phosphatase hydrolyses the substrate, disodium phenyl phosphate to release phenol. The quantity of phenol released under standardised conditions is measured by the absorbance of the red colour it assumes in alkaline solution. The phenol reacts with 4-aminophenazone in the presence of alkaline potassium ferricyanide to produce the red colour.</p>
