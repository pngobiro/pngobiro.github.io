                            <p>The kidneys are located one on each side of the vertebral column at the posterior side of the abdomen. Each kidney is bean shaped and is enclosed in a capsule of fibrous tissue. Beneath the capsule is the cortex followed by the medulla. The medulla consists of renal pyramids which converge into the renal pelvis. The hilum is the point from where renal arteries and nerves enter and renal veins leave the kidney.</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance of the body.</strong> The proximal renal tubules reabsorb about 85% of the water filtered by the glomerulus while the rest passes through the loop of Henle where some of the water is reabsorbed. Under normal circumstances all the glucose, amino acids, potassium, bicarbonate and about 70% of the sodium are also reabsorbed by the proximal tubules. The distal renal tubules, on the other hand, control the amount of water (tubular fluid) reabsorbed.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Tubular fluid passes into the collecting ducts which stretch through the renal medulla and empty urine into the renal pelvis. The cells lining the collecting ducts which are normally impermeable to water are rendered permeable by the action of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin). Thus water is allowed through the wall of the tubule to re-enter circulation. When the body needs to excrete more water, the level of ADH is reduced, making the tubules impermeable to water, resulting in more water being excreted in the urine (dilute urine).
                                    <br><br>
                                    About 70% of sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The remainder of the sodium is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts under the stimulus of the hormone aldosterone produced by adrenal cortex. The presence of aldosterone causes increased reabsorption of sodium by the tubules. In order to maintain electrolyte balance in the body, reabsorption of sodium is linked to potassium and hydrogen ions excretion and chloride and bicarbonate ions reabsorption.</span>

The walls of the capillaries within the glomerulus, and the walls of the Bowman's capsule act as semipermeable membranes. They allow some molecules to pass through while others are held back within the capillary lumen. Since the efferent arteriole is able to constrict, the pressure in the glomerulus is higher than that in the capsule. As a result, water, glucose, electrolytes, amino acids and waste products of metabolism like urea, creatinine and uric acid are able to pass from the bloodstream and to the Bowman's capsule. This process is known as ultrafiltration.

                            <h3>Non-Protein Nitrogen (NPN)</h3>
                            <p>Renal function is traditionally monitored by the determination of non-protein nitrogenous substances. The term non-protein nitrogen (NPN) originated from early days of clinical chemistry when analytical methods required protein to be removed before analysis. There are about 15 components of NPN and majority of them arise from the catabolism of proteins and nucleic acids. The important components are urea, amino acids, uric acid, creatinine, creatine and ammonia.</p>

                            <h3>Urea</h3>
                            <p>Urea constitutes almost half the total of the non-protein nitrogenous substances of the blood. It is manufactured in the liver from carbon dioxide and ammonia resulting from the breakdown of amino acids. It is the major excretory product of protein metabolism. Urea is carried by the plasma to the kidney where it is filtered from the plasma by the glomerulus. About 40% of the urea in the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. Most of the urea in the filtrate is excreted in urine while small amounts are excreted through the gastrointestinal tract and the skin.</p>

                            <h4>Estimation of Blood Urea</h4>
                            <p>Measurements of urea were initially done on a protein free filtrate of whole blood and so, early analytical methods were based on measuring the amount of nitrogen. This analysis was commonly referred to as Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). Though current methods of urea estimation use whole blood, plasma or serum, the term BUN is still used by some workers.</p>
                            <p>The nitrogen concentration of urea can be converted to urea concentration by multiplying it by 2.14.</p>
                            
                            <p>One molecule of urea $\left[\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{NH}_2)_2\right]$ corresponds to two atoms of nitrogen.</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Concentration of urea} = \frac{\text{Mol. wt. of urea}}{\text{Atomic wt. of N} \times 2} = \frac{60}{14 \times 2} = 2.14 \times \text{concentration of BUN}$$

                            <p>Creatinine is a nitrogenous product which is produced from the metabolism of creatine in the skeletal muscles. It is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Unlike urea, creatinine level in the blood is not linked to protein intake. But like urea, the measurement of creatinine level is a test of renal function. The formation of creatinine is constant, and has direct relationship to muscle mass. For this reason, it varies with age and sex.</p>

                            <h4>Creatinine Clearance Test</h4>
                            <p>The clearance test is done to assess the glomerular filtration capabilities of the kidneys. The creatinine clearance is defined as the millilitres of blood (plasma) that are cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. The clearance is calculated with this formula:</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Average creatinine clearance (ml/min)} = \frac{U \times V}{P}$$

                            U = concentration of creatinine in urine (mg/dl)<br>
                            P = concentration of creatinine in plasma (mg/dl)<br>
                            V = volume in millilitres of urine excreted per minute, i.e., 24 hour urine volume (ml) divided by 1440, the number of minutes in 24 hours.</p>

                            <h4>Quantitative Estimation of Creatinine (Alkaline Picrate/Jaffe Method)</h4>
                            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Creatinine reacts with alkaline picrate reagent to form an orange-red colour which is measured in a spectrophotometer.</p>

                            <p>Uric acid is the final breakdown product of purine metabolism. Purines such as adenosine and guanine result from the breakdown of nucleic acids. They are either ingested or come from the destruction of tissue cells, and are converted mainly in the liver into uric acid. From the liver, uric acid is transported to the kidneys where it is filtered by the glomeruli. Nearly all the filtered uric acid is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules; and small amounts are then secreted by the distal tubules and ultimately appear in the urine.</p>

                            <p><strong>Benedict’s Test (Qualitative) Principle:</strong> The test is based on the reduction of alkaline blue cupric sulphate to yellow or red cuprous oxide by the aldehyde or ketone group of carbohydrates.</p>

                            <h4>Ketone Bodies</h4>
                            <p>Ketone bodies belong to a group of three related substances—acetone, acetoacetic acid (acetoacetate) and β-hydroxybutyric acid. Tests include Rothera's nitroprusside test and Gerhardt's test.</p>
