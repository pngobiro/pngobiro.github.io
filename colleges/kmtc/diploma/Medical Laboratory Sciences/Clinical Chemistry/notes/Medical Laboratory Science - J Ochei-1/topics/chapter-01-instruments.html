                            <p>Colorimetry, in simple terms, is the measurement of colours and is probably the most widely used method for determining the concentration of biochemical compounds. This important laboratory procedure is based on the principle that when white light passes through a coloured solution, some wavelengths are absorbed more than others. Many compounds, though not coloured themselves, can be made to absorb light in the visible spectrum by reaction with suitable reagents. The coloured compounds absorb light at given wavelength at visible spectrum. The extent to which a solution absorbs light depends on the intensity of its colour.</p>
                            
                            <p>Light travels in the form of waves. Wavelength is the distance between two wave peaks in nanometers (nm). Amplitude is the height of each wave. The number of waves passing a fixed point $x$ per unit time is the frequency (Fig. 1.1). The wavelength of light is expressed as:</p>

                            <p>The wavelength of light determines the colour of the light seen by the naked eye. White light is a combination or a mixture of light energy of different wavelengths. Any colour that is seen emits light of a particular wavelength, and is called monochromatic light.</p>
                            
                            <p>Wavelengths between $400\mathrm{nm}$ and $700\mathrm{nm}$ form the visible spectrum of light which is the visible band of light of electromagnetic spectrum. Table 1.1 shows the colour spectrum of white light.</p>

A coloured solution absorbs all the coloured components of white light and selectively transmits only one colour. This is its own transmitted colour.

                                    <p>The proportion of the incident light absorbed by the molecules in a solution is directly proportional to the number of absorbing molecules in the light path. The ability of a substance to selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light while transmitting others is determined by its molecular and atomic structure. Thus, it follows that the concentration of a substance, i.e., absorbing molecules is directly proportional to the intensity of the colour of the solution. In Beer's law, the light path is constant while the concentration varies. As the concentration of the coloured substance in the solution increases, absorbance increases and the amount of light passing through (transmittance) decreases.</p>

                            <p><strong>Beer-Lambert law</strong> The basic principles of colorimetry, absorptiometry and spectrophotometry are established, by combining Beer's law and Lambert's law.</p>
                            <p>This joint law shows that under suitable conditions, the amount of light absorbed by a coloured solution, when illuminated with a light of suitable wavelength, is directly proportional to the concentration of the coloured solution and the length of the light path through the solution. Therefore the amount of light decreases exponentially with the increase in the concentration of the solution and with increase in thickness of the layer of solution through which light passes.</p>

                                Application of Beer-Lambert Law
                            </h2>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The principle of Beer-Lambert law is applied in Clinical Chemistry quantitative tests. It shows that a linear relationship exists between the concentration of the solution being measured and its absorbance. Many instruments and methods are first of all calibrated before a test on clinical samples is carried out.</p>
                            <p>For manual methods, absorbance is normally used since if Beer’s law is obeyed, a plot of concentration against absorbance is a straight line and therefore much easier to handle than the exponential curve given by plotting %T against concentration.</p>
                            <p>It should be remembered that $a$ is usually constant since the same conditions apply for both the test and standard solutions. As the test and standard solutions are compared in the same or identical cuvettes or tubes, the same lightpath or thickness of solution is employed and so $b$ is also a constant value.</p>
                            
                            <p>Thus in the equation $A = abc$.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, $A(\text{test}) = c(\text{test})$ and $A(\text{std}) = c(\text{std})$</p>
                            <p>i.e., $A(\text{test}) \times c(\text{std}) = c(\text{test}) \times A(\text{std})$</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$c(\text{test}) = \frac{A(\text{test}) \times c(\text{std})}{A(\text{std})}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>In other words, concentration of unknown =</p>

                                $$\frac{\text{Absorbance of Unknown}}{\text{Absorbance of Standard}} \times \text{Conc. of standard}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>This formula is the basis of calculation in photoelectric absorptiometry and spectrophotometry when Beer’s law is obeyed. Absorbance scales or the special scales for absorptiometers and spectrophotometers are used for faster calculations.</p>

                            <p>The major difference between an absorptiometer and spectrophotometer is that the latter can measure absorbance at specific wavelengths due to the presence of a prism that disperses white light into a continuous spectrum. This enables wavelengths of monochromatic light to be detected. Most absorptiometers are however, fitted with special coloured filters that cover certain wavelength ranges.</p>

                            <h3>Absorptiometer (Colorimeter)</h3>
                            <p>There are five essential parts or systems in a photoelectric absorptiometer:</p>

                            <h4>A. Light source</h4>
                            <p>The type of light source will depend upon the region of the spectrum required. For visible light, the most common source is a tungsten-filament lamp, or the higher powered tungsten-halogen (quartz-iodine) lamp. For the ultraviolet region, hydrogen or deuterium lamps are used.</p>

                                        <li>Do not handle the lamps as finger prints can affect the performance. Use a clean tissue to hold the lamp when installing.</li>
                                        <li>The electric current should be constant (steady).</li>
                                        <li>The lamp must be correctly aligned with the optical system. Always follow the manufacturer’s instruction.</li>
                                        <li>Allow sufficient time for the instrument to warm up before use.</li>

                            </div>

                            <h4>B. Monochromator/Wavelength selector</h4>
                            <p>To select the wavelength, filters or monochromators are used to split the light from the light source. The monochromator can be a diffraction grating or prism and is usually used in the most expensive absorptiometers.</p>

                            <p><strong>Filters</strong> The simpler instruments such as colorimeters, use filters as means of selecting a band of wavelength. The simplest filters are either coloured glass or suitably dyed gelatin sandwiched in a glass. They have limited transmission band and are usually complimentary to the colour of the solution to be measured. The simple filters have a range of 400–680 nm. Table 1.2 shows the filters used for coloured solutions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Interference filter</strong> This is a more sophisticated type of filter. This filter consists of two partially transmitting films of metal separated by a transparent spacer of low refractive index, or of a piece of glass or silicon coated with materials of various refractive indices. The filter is constructed in such a way that only light of the required wavelength is transmitted, all other wavelengths being reflected or absorbed. This optical arrangement is called interference. The wavelength of the interference filters is from 330–1200 nm. Interference wedge which acts in a similar way to the interference filters, is not popular because it is costly to produce and it is inferior to diffraction gratings or prisms.</p>

                            <p><strong>Prisms</strong> Prisms are composed of glass, for visible wavelength, and of quartz or silica for the ultraviolet region. They are designed to be turned to allow the required light to pass through the focusing slit on to the solution. Prism monochromators allow for smaller bandwidths than filters. They are however much more expensive and require more advanced precision instruments.</p>

                            <p><strong>Diffraction gratings</strong>: Most modern spectrophotometers use diffraction grating method for wavelength selection. The grating is made of a series of finely etched parallel grooves on a shining reflecting surface. The grating is placed at an angle to a beam of light. It disperses the white light into a continuous spectrum, each groove acting as a very narrow prism. The grating is rotated and wavelength selected by turning the wavelength adjustment.</p>

                            <p>These are used to hold coloured solutions and must be scrupulously clean.</p>
                            <p>A number of different holders is available for manual, semi-automated and automated methods of analysis. The holders can be test-tubes or cuvettes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Test tubes</strong> These are used usually in the simpler instruments. They must be matched for transmission; sometimes a mark is etched on them, and this mark is lined up against a mark on the instrument to ensure consistent optical pathway.</p>
                            <p><strong>Cuvettes</strong> These are rectangular cells with one pair of opposite sides optically clear, while the other parallel sides are opaque and should not be placed in the light path. They are of glass for use at visible wavelengths, and of silica or quartz for use in the ultraviolet region.</p>
                            <p><strong>Flow-through cells</strong> These are used in absorptiometry to speed up analytical procedures. The cells or cuvettes are drained without being removed from the instruments. In this way, readings are taken more quickly. These cells are used in automated instruments.</p>

                            <h4>D. Photosensitive detector system</h4>
                            <p>There are three common photosensitive detectors in use—the barrier layer cell, the photoemissive tube and the photomultiplier tube. When light falls on these elements electric current is generated which deflects a galvanometer needle. The meter reading is proportional to the light intensity. These photosensitive detectors are also referred to as photoelectric cells.</p>

                            <p><strong>Barrier layer cell</strong> This is made up of a metal disc on which the selenium is thinly layered, and this is also covered by a thin transparent layer of metal with a thick end to which one of the terminals of the galvanometer is attached. The other terminal is connected to the underside of the disc which is covered by a non-oxidising metal. With light passing through the thin metal layer to selenium layer beneath, electrons are released which cross the "barrier" between the selenium layer and the transparent metal layer to become positively charged. The current set up is registered on the galvanometer. A strong incident light is required for the barrier cell layer since the current produced cannot be easily amplified. It is therefore usually used in filter instruments where there is plenty of light energy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Photoemissive tubes (vacuum phototubes)</strong> These consists of an evacuated glass tube or a tube containing inert gas at low pressure. The inside of the tubes are thinly layered with caesium or potassium oxide and silver oxide to act as the cathode, while the anode is a metal ring inserted close to the centre of the valve. Light goes through the valve to reach the sensitive layer and electrons are given off, causing a current to register on the outside circuit which is electronically amplified. This is the amount of light reaching the photosensitive cell. Thus, because the current can be amplified, the photosensitive tube can be used at much lower intensities of light.</p>

                            <p><strong>Photomultiplier tubes</strong> This is the most sensitive detector which is an improvements of the photoemissive tubes. It has enhanced sensitivity because the elements within the tube are connected in series. Light falling on the first element releases secondary electrons in large number resulting in an increase in current flow from the cell. It is used in the most sophisticated instrument where it is capable of measuring intensities of light 100 times weaker than those measured by the photoemissive tube.</p>

                            <p>The current from the detector is fed to a sensitive suitable measuring device, usually a galvanometer. The read-out can be by means of a scale or digital display. The scale may show both the absorbance and % transmission. The absorbance scale ranges from 0 to infinite, while the % transmission scale ranges from 0 to 100. The zero absorbance is equivalent to 100% transmission and the infinitive absorbance is equivalent to 0 transmission.</p>

                            <h3>Setting up the colorimeter/spectrophotometer</h3>
                            <p>An important step in colorimetric procedure is the selection of the correct wavelength or filter to use. The next step is to produce an absorption curve of the colour to be measured by plotting the absorbance against the wavelength using the same solution. In this way the wavelength that gives the maximum absorption is determined (Fig. 1.6). For this purpose, serial dilutions should be prepared from a coloured solution such as copper sulphate.</p>

                            <p><strong>Checking the wavelength</strong> The calibration curve must be carried out with extreme care. Freshly prepared reagents and standards and scrupulously clean glassware must be used. The accuracy of the wavelength calibration of a spectrophotometer should be checked from time to time, especially after the instrument has been shifted. This is to ensure that a linear relationship is maintained. For this purpose, it is ideal to follow the manufacturer's instruction using the special filters meant for the purpose.</p>

                            <p>Chromatography is a process of separation of a mixture of solutes dissolved in a common solvent.</p>
                            <p>The separation technique makes use of the differential distribution of the solutes between two phases, the mobile phase and the fixed stationary phase. The solvent is the mobile phase which carries the mixture of the solutes through the stationary phase. Depending on the characteristics of the solute molecules, the mobile phase and the stationary phase, there is selective retardation of the solute molecules relative to the moving phase. Under ideal conditions, the resulting different rates of migration bring about complete separation of the solutes.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Mechanisms of Separation in Chromatography</h3>
                            <p>There are three mechanisms by which separation occurs in chromatography. They are adsorption, partition and exclusion chromatographies.</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Adsorption chromatography</strong> In adsorption chromatography, the components within a sample are separated because of the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase and the mobile phase. The speed of migration of a component depends on its adsorptive affinity relative to other components. The example of this technique is the thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In ion-exchange chromatography, electrostatic forces operate between charged molecules and oppositely charged particles on the ion-exchange resin or modified cellulose or dextran. These electrostatic forces can be altered by changing the pH of the mobile phase.</span>

                            <p>$R_f$ value is the ratio of distance travelled by the substance (solute) to that travelled by the mobile phase in the same period. Generally, mobile phase travels faster than the solute components. Therefore $R_f$ value is generally a fraction.</p>

                            <h3>Types of Chromatography in Routine Use</h3>
                            
                            <h4>1. Paper chromatography</h4>
                            <p>In paper chromatography, the stationary phase is a paper, usually cellulose acetate, and the mobile phase is a solvent in which the solutes in the mixture are soluble. Initially, a mixture of substances, e.g., carbohydrates, is spotted at one end of the porous filter paper strip. In ascending type of paper chromatography, the filter paper is hung vertically into the solvent. The solvent moves up through the paper by capillary action. As it passes through the spotted area of solutes, various fractions in the mixture move at different rates. The rate of mobility is affected by relative solubilities and polarities of the solutes and the polarity of the solvent.</p>
                            <p>The paper is removed after the separation, dried and sprayed with a chemical for colour development. The spots of the solutes developed at different sites can be quantitated by the area and intensity of the colour.</p>

                            <h4>2. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</h4>
                            <p>TLC is very similar to paper chromatography except that the paper is substituted by a thin layer (0.025 mm) of very finely powdered silica gel, alumina, polyacrylamide gel, starch gel or kieselguhr, bound to a glass or plastic plate. The principle of separation is similar to that of paper chromatography. The advantages of TLC over paper chromatography include easier elution of separated spot from the plate by cutting the thin layer, and faster separation of constituents.</p>

                            <h4>3. Ion-exchange chromatography</h4>
                            <p>Ion-exchange resins are suitable polymers which contain ionic groups as a part of their structure. Ion-exchange resins can be, cation exchangers, e.g., with SO₄ or COO⁻ groups; or anion exchangers, e.g., with N⁺(NH₃)₂ group.</p>
                            <p>It is suitable ion-exchange resin used for column packing, its affinities for the members of a group of ionised substances can be used for their separation.</p>

                            <h4>4. Gas chromatography</h4>
                            <p>Gas chromatography is a separation process by which a mixture of compounds in a gaseous state is passed through a gas in a stationary phase. The mobile phase is usually nitrogen, helium or argon. Separation of the mixture is achieved by a difference in the partitioning of the various molecules between the two phases. If the stationary phase consists of a thin layer of non-volatile liquid, the technique is called gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). If the stationary phase is a solid sorbent, then it is called gas-solid chromatography (GSC).</p>
                            <p>A gas-chromatograph has six components—(1) Pressurised carrier gas with a flow regulator (2) Sample injection area (3) A column: gas, liquid or solid (4) A detector (5) A recorder (6) A thermoregulated component enclosing the injection area, column and detector.</p>
                            <p><strong>Working</strong> At a sufficiently high temperature, the components of a mixture to be injected are in a gaseous phase. Each component of the mixture requires specific time to reach the detector after application to the column. The output of the detector is displayed on a recorder. This 'retention time' may be expressed as an absolute time or as a relative retention time with reference to a standard.</p>

                            <h4>5. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)</h4>
                            <p>In HPLC, the stationary phase is composed of uniform, ultrafine particles which greatly increase its adsorptive area. This stationary phase is packed firmly into a column. The resistance to flow in this column is high, therefore large pressures (500–5000 pounds per square inch) are required to deliver constant flow rates. The elute from the column is monitored by a variety of detectors such as UV or redox-potential electrode detectors.</p>
                            <p>HPLC is a very efficient technique for the detection and quantitation of drugs.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The movement of charged particles such as molecules or ions through an electrolyte under the influence of electric current is called electrophoresis. The electric field is applied to a solution by placing two oppositely charged electrodes in the solution. Depending on the nature of charges, the molecules move through the solution towards the electrode of the opposite charge. The positively charged particles, the cations, move towards the negatively charged electrode (cathode); and negatively charged particles, the anions, move towards the positively charged electrode (anode). At a fixed pH, the rate of migration of particles with similar charge will depend on the magnitude of charges carried on them and molecular weight; or charge/size ratio. Because of these variations in migration, it is possible to separate a complex mixture such as plasma proteins into a number of fractions or zones. This is called zone electrophoresis.</p>

                            <h3>Isoelectric Focusing</h3>
                            <p>A large molecule like protein has different groups such as carboxyl- (negatively charged) and amino- (positively charged) groups. The sum total of the charges on such different side groups decides the net charge on the molecule. Since the electric charge varies with pH, the pH at which a particular protein has net charge equal to zero is called its isoelectric point.</p>
                            <p>In the technique of isoelectric focusing, an electrolyte is used which produces a gradual increase in the pH from anode to cathode on the passage of electric current. If a complex mixture of substances is electrophoresed in such a solution, the fractions become arranged in order of the increasing pH of their isoelectric points. In a solution of gradually increasing pH, the molecules migrate towards the anode or cathode until they arrive at the point at which the pH is that of their isoelectric point.</p>

                            <h3>Electro-endosmosis</h3>
                            <p>Electro-endosmosis is a phenomenon which affects the movement of the molecules of the buffer fluid itself under the influence of the electric current. At an appropriate pH, the buffer molecules are attracted towards the cathode (-). The negatively charged protein molecules move towards the anode (+), but the electro-osmotic flow of the buffer fluid pushes the proteins back in the opposite direction towards the cathode. Under such conditions, the slowest moving proteins such as gamma-globulins which have a very small negative charge, are carried towards the cathode side of the point of application. This phenomenon is used for the detection of hepatitis B antigen and antibody in patient’s serum.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Spectroscopy</h3>
                            <p>A part of white light passing through certain coloured solutions is absorbed in relatively narrow areas of the spectrum, giving dark regions known as absorption bands. The position of these bands can be used to identify the coloured material in solution. A vision spectroscope is used to observe these absorption bands.</p>

                            <h3>Flame Emission Spectroscopy</h3>
                            <p>This is also referred to as flame photometry or flame spectrometry. When some elements are heated directly in a flame, their atoms become excited and emit energy at a wavelength characteristic for the element. The intensity of the flame colour is directly proportional to the concentration of atoms in the sample. Flame photometry is commonly used for elements such as sodium (yellow flame), potassium (red-violet) and lithium (red). The flame intensity can be measured in a flame photometer using appropriate filters.</p>

                            <h3>Potentiometry</h3>
                            <p>Potentiometry compares the potential difference between two electrodes immersed in a solution under zero current conditions. By using a reference electrode of known potential, the charge on the other indicator electrode can be determined. The most commonly used reference electrodes are the saturated calomel electrode and the silver-silver chloride electrode. Indicator electrodes can be a platinum wire, a carbon rod or a thin stream of mercury.</p>
                            <p>In clinical chemistry potentiometry is most often used for the measurement of pH.</p>

                            <h3>Coulometry</h3>
                            <p>Coulometry measures the current passing between two electrodes. When constant current is applied to generate a titrating agent, the time required to titrate the sample is related to the amount of analyte in the sample.</p>
                            <p>The most common clinical application of coulometry is in the determination of chloride ions in serum and other body fluids. If a constant current is applied across silver electrodes, it liberates silver ions into the solution at a constant rate. When all the chloride ions in solution have combined with the silver ions, the excess silver ions in solution activate a relay to stop the titration. The length of time of this titration is directly proportional to the concentration of chloride ions.</p>

                            <h3>Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE)</h3>
                            <p>If a metal rod is placed in one of its salts, it acquires an electric potential. If two different metals are immersed separately into their own salts, the difference in their potentials can be measured. By using a standard electrode, the potential of all other electrodes can be compared. An ion selective membrane is required to separate the solution of unknown activity from the detecting system. If the unknown solution has different concentration of the particular ion from that of the solution filling the electrode, the ions migrate towards the lower concentration. This brings about a change in potential across the membrane. The process goes on till an equilibrium is established across the membrane. The number of ions transported across the membrane is related to the original concentration of the ion in the unknown solution.</p>
                            <p>Ion selective electrodes (ISE) are used to measure dissolved gases such as $\mathrm{P_{CO_2}}$ or serum electrolytes such as $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{K^{+}}$.</p>

                            <h3>Ultraviolet spectrophotometry</h3>
                            <p>The wavelength used for spectrophotometry depends on the wavelength at which there is significant absorption by the substance to be measured. If the wavelength of the light absorbed is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum which is non-visible (200–400 nm), the analysis is called ultraviolet spectrophotometry.</p>

                            <h3>Turbidimetry and Nephelometry</h3>
                            <p>When light strikes a particle in a liquid, the light can either be absorbed, transmitted, reflected or scattered. Light scattering can be measured by two methods, turbidimetry and nephelometry.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Turbidimetry</strong> Turbidity causes a reduction in the intensity of the incident light as it passes through a solution of particles. Turbidimetry is the measurement of this loss in intensity because of scattering, absorption or reflectance of the incident light. Turbidity is measured at $180^{\circ}$ from the incident beam in the same manner as absorbance is measured in a spectrophotometer. Most colorimeters and spectrophotometers can measure turbidity with good precision and accuracy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nephelometry</strong> Nephelometry is the detection or measurement of light scattered or reflected toward a detector which is not in the direct path, i.e. at $180^{\circ}$, of the incident light. The instrument used for nephelometry is called nephelometer. Most nephelometers measure scattered light at $90^{\circ}$ to the incident light.</p>

                            <h3>Osmometry</h3>
                            <p>Osmometry is the measurement of osmolality of a solution. The osmolality of a solution depends on the number of particles in solution. The size, charge or mass of the molecule does not affect the measurement. One osmole of a substance is equal to the gram molecular weight divided by the number of particles or ions into which the substance dissociates in solution.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example, NaCl dissociates into two ions (Na⁺, Cl⁻) in solution.</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$1 \text{ osmole of NaCl} = \frac{58.5}{2} = 29.25 \text{ g}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>or</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\frac{1 \text{ mole}}{2} = 0.5 \text{ mole}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>One osmole can be measured as the mass of the solute which when dissolved in one kg of pure water produces an osmotic pressure of 22.4 atmospheres at normal temperature and pressure (NTP); or as the mass of the solute which when dissolved in one kg water depresses the freezing point by 1.86°C.</p>
                            <p>Osmolality is determined by measuring the depression in freezing point. An osmometer consists of a cooling bath to freeze the specimen, and a thermistor. A thermistor is a device whose electrical resistance increases as the temperature decreases. The resistance of the thermistor is so calibrated that it is directly related to the temperature being measured. The digital display on the instrument directly gives the osmolality of the solution.</p>

                            <h3>Fluorometry</h3>
                            <p>Fluorometry is the measurement of fluorescence. When a compound (fluorescent substance) absorbs light energy from one wavelength, an electron is raised to higher energy level. Part of the absorbed energy is used up. When the electron falls back to the original state, the excess energy is emitted as light in another wavelength; and the substance is said to fluoresce. The emitted light has a lower energy level (higher wavelength) than the absorbed light.</p>
                            <p>For example, some fluorescent substances absorb light energy from the invisible ultraviolet rays (wavelength 340 nm) and emit light in the visible spectrum (400–700 nm). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FIT) absorbs UV light and fluoresces green light. The instrument used to measure fluorescence are fluorometers or spectrophotometers. The basic components of these instruments are—(i) the excitation source (ii) the excitation monochromator (iii) the sample cell (cuvette) (iv) the emission monochromator and (v) the detector.</p>

                            <p>Fluorometry is an extremely sensitive technique and is very widely used for immunochemical measurements for the analysis of drugs, peptides, hormones and other compounds present in very low concentrations.</p>

                            <h3>Immunochemical Assays</h3>
                            <p>Immunochemical assays make use of the antigen-antibody reactions. Antigen is a foreign substance, which when introduced in the body stimulates the production of an antibody and reacts specifically with it. Antigen, antibody and their reactions are discussed in the Basic Immunology section of this book. Because of their high sensitivity and specificity, immunological reagents and methods are widely used in clinical chemistry. Antigenic properties of some drugs and hormones are used to raise specific antibodies in experimental animals. These antibodies are used as specific reagents for the detection and quantitation of drugs or hormones in patients' specimens. Serum immunoelectrophoresis is useful for the detection of abnormal fractions in the serum, which combines immunoassay with electrophoresis.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>An atom of an element consists of a small, central nucleus of positive charge surrounded by orbital electrons, each carrying a negative charge. The nucleus is composed of protons (with single positive charge) and neutrons (with no charge). The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus, where as the mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons. A nucleide is an atomic species (element) with given atomic number and mass number.</p>
                            <p>Isotopes are nucleides with the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Most elements occurring in nature are mixtures of isotopes. Isotopes of lighter elements are stable, but isotopes of some heavy elements are unstable. These unstable nucleides undergo spontaneous decay to produce stable nucleides by a process called radioactive decay. Decay is accompanied by emission of energy in the form of radiation. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time required for the isotope to decay to half its activity.</p>

                            <h3>Radiation</h3>
                            <p>Radiation from an atom or its nucleus may either be particulate or electromagnetic.</p>
                            <p><strong>Particulate radiation (decay)</strong> consists of small particles of nuclear fragments. These are of two types, α-decay and β-decay. The α-decay emits α-particles made of two neutrons and two protons. In the β-decay, the nucleide loses one neutron and gains one proton.</p>
                            <p><strong>Electromagnetic radiations</strong> These can be divided into two groups. Those with very low energy and long wavelength are called <em>radiowaves</em> while those of high energy and short wavelength are called <em>light waves</em>. The radiations with the highest energy are called <em>x-rays</em> and <em>gamma rays</em>. The gamma rays can penetrate material which block both α- and β-radiations.</p>

                            <h3>Detection and Measurement of Radioactivity</h3>
                            <p>There are various methods by which radioactivity can be detected. For example, darkening of photographic emulsion is used for x-rays. In clinical chemistry, scintillation counting systems are in common use. The isotopes used for radioactivity measurements include $^{125}\mathrm{I}$ and $^{3}\mathrm{H}$ (tritium). $^{125}\mathrm{I}$ emits gamma rays where as $^{3}\mathrm{H}$ emits β-particles.</p>
                            <p>Gamma rays are detected by a scintillation counter, which is a large sodium iodide crystal with thallium as an activator. The crystal is in close contact with a photomultiplier tube. When a gamma ray strikes a molecule of sodium iodide, a photon of light energy is produced. This light is amplified by the photomultiplier tube and converted to a pulse of electrical energy. The number of pulses is thus proportional to the quantity of radioactive material in the sample.</p>
                            <p>β-particles are detected by a liquid scintillation system. These substances called fluors are dissolved in special grade solvents such as toluene. The light signals are picked up by two photomultiplier tubes and converted to pulses.</p>
