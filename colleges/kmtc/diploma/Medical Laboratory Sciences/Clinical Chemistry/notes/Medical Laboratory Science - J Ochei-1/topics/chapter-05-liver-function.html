                            <p>The liver is the largest organ in the body. It weighs about 1.5 kg in an adult. It is also the most active and most complex organ. It lies in the upper right side of the abdomen beneath the diaphragm. It has four lobes, the right one being the largest while the left one is smaller and wedge shaped (Fig. 5.1). The other two lobes are very small and can only be seen on the under surface of the liver.</p>
                            <p>The portal vein which enters the liver through the portal tissue carries blood from the stomach, spleen, pancreas and intestines. The hepatic artery carries the arterial blood to the liver. The hepatic vein leaves the liver to carry blood to the inferior vena cava. The right and left hepatic ducts carry bile to the gall bladder.</p>

                            <p>The liver is divided into many small circular units—lobules. Each lobule is made of rows of cells—the hepatocytes, radiating from the central vein.</p>

                            <h3>Secretion of Bile</h3>
                            <p>Bile is secreted by the liver cells, stored and concentrated in the gall bladder, and then released into the duodenum where it helps to emulsify dietary fat. Between meals the sphincter of Oddi in the gall bladder is closed and it is opened at the sight, taste or smell of food. When the gastric contents enter the duodenum, a hormone known as cholecystokinin and which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa, causes the gall bladder to contract, thereby making bile enter the duodenum. Here the bile is essential for adequate reabsorption of fats and of vitamin K. Reduction of bile by bacteria produces bile salts (usually sodium or potassium) such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acids conjugated with glycine and taurine.</p>
                            <p>Bile is golden yellow or greenish coloured fluid that contains cholesterol, bilirubin and bile salts. Much of the bile secreted into the intestine is reabsorbed into the hepatic portal circulation, recycled in the liver and re-excreted in the duodenum. Only small amount of bile is normally excreted in the faeces.</p>

                            <p>Bilirubin is mainly formed from the breakdown of haemoglobin in the cells of the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The haem (iron porphyrin) of the haemoglobin molecule is firstly removed from the globin. The porphyrin portion is then converted to biliverdin which is reduced to bilirubin. The bilirubin is insoluble in water, it is carried in the blood attached to albumin and it cannot be excreted by the kidney. This bilirubin is referred to as unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.</p>
                            <p>The enzyme glucuronosyl transferase in the liver cells joins (conjugates) glucuronic acid to bilirubin to form bilirubin glucuronides. This bilirubin is called conjugated (direct) bilirubin and it is water-soluble and non-toxic.</p>
                            <p>Conjugated bilirubin is passed from the liver into the gall bladder through the bile duct, and into the intestine. Here the bilirubin is deconjugated and reduced by bacterial enzymes to a colourless compound, stercobilinogen (faecal urobilinogen). This is oxidised to a brown pigment, stercobilin, the main pigment of faeces. Some of the stercobilinogen is re-absorbed via the portal vein back to the liver from where it re-enters the intestine in the bile and is excreted in the faeces. A small amount of the reabsorbed urobilinogen is carried in the blood through the liver and transported to the kidneys where it is excreted in the urine. Figure 5.2 summarises the metabolism of bilirubin.</p>

                            <p><strong>Bile salt:</strong> Together with the bile, bile salts enter the duodenum and are found in small amounts in faeces and very little in urine. The bile salts are reabsorbed via the portal vein, removed by the liver and excreted in the bile. In obstructive jaundice, bile salts are present along with bile pigments in the urine.</p>

                            <h3>Jaundice (Icterus)</h3>
                            <p>This is the condition during which the patient has a yellow colouration of the eyes and some parts of the skin. The yellow pigmentation is due to a raised level of bilirubin which is normally present in small amounts in the plasma. Jaundice may be classified into three types.</p>

                            <h3>Principle</h3>
                            <p>Van den Bergh diazo reaction has been used for many years to determine bilirubin in the serum. This involves treating the serum with diazotised sulphanilic acid to form the azobilirubin complex. The conjugated bilirubin reacts directly with the diazo reagent while the unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin reacts with the diazoreagent only in the presence of an accelerator such as the caffeine-benzoate reagent, and takes about 10 minutes for the colour development. The azobilirubin is purple in the acid medium, and is converted to blue colour by the addition of alkaline tartarate solution. The diazo reaction is terminated at the end by the addition of ascorbic acid.</p>

                            <p>Primarily, a molecule of protein is made up of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds and sequentially arranged to form a polypeptide chain. The sequence of amino acids in the chain determines the biological properties of the protein.</p>
                            <p>Plasma proteins are a very complex mixture of proteins with diverse properties. The main plasma protein fractions are albumin, globulin and fibrinogen. Most plasma proteins are synthesised in the liver. Immunoglobulins are formed by the reticuloendothelial system and plasma cells. In normal healthy individuals, the various plasma proteins are present in delicately balanced concentrations, with a normal ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G ratio).</p>

                            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Protein molecules are made up of amino acids which are arranged in long chains called peptide chains; and the links joining the amino acids together are called peptide bonds. The biuret methods are based on the reaction which occurs between cupric ions in the reagent and peptide bonds of the protein molecules in an alkaline solution to form blue-violet or purple coloured complexes. The absorbance of the colour is measured in a colorimeter (yellow-green filter) or in a spectrophotometer at 540 nm.</p>

                            <h3>Clinical Significance</h3>
                            <p>Patterns of abnormalities of serum proteins due to various disease conditions can be detected by serum electrophoresis. The most important application of serum protein electrophoresis is to detect monoclonal gammopathies. Figure 5.4 (a-e) shows the normal and some abnormal patterns of serum protein electrophoresis.</p>
