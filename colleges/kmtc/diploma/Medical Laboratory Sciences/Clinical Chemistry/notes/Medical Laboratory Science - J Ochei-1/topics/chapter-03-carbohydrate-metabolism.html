                            <p>Metabolism is the general term that describes the different changes taking place in the body. Catabolic processes involve the production of heat and energy. The energy requirements of an individual depends on his/her age, size and metabolic rate. The metabolic rate is partly controlled by the thyroid gland hormones and is affected by temperature and a person's activity. What is referred to as Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the heat and energy required to maintain cellular functions when the body is at rest.</p>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Polysaccharides</strong> Many carbohydrates in nature exist in the form of polysaccharides. They are more complex and are not easily absorbed in the body. The most common polysaccharides are starch and glycogen which are hydrolysed by amylase to mainly maltose and glucose.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>When carbohydrate which has been ingested is converted into glucose by various enzymes, and the glucose is absorbed from the small intestine, then the metabolism of carbohydrate in the body begins. The glucose is transported through the bloodstream to the liver where it is used or stored depending on the need of the body at that time.</p>
                            <p>There are three ways in which the glucose is either utilised or stored in the body:</p>
                            
                            <h4>1. Glycolysis</h4>
                            <p>Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid or lactic acid (or both) for the production of energy in the form of the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is used to control the level of glucose in the blood. Glucose is taken from the blood by the tissues and is converted into pyruvic acid by glycolysis. The heat and energy produced is used for cellular activity.</p>
                            <p>Glycolysis occurs through aerobic or anaerobic pathway.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Aerobic pathway</h5>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Glucose} \rightarrow \text{Pyruvate} \rightarrow \text{Energy, Heat}$$
                                $$\text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$
                            </div>

                            <h5>Anaerobic pathway</h5>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{Glycolysis}} \text{Pyruvate} \xrightarrow{\text{Reduction}} \text{Lactate} + \text{Energy}$$
                            </div>
                            <p>Anaerobic pathway occurs when the energy requirement exceeds the oxygen available. This process continues only for a limited period till enough oxygen is made available for the cellular activity.</p>

                            <h4>2. Glycogenesis</h4>
                            <p>The process of glycogen formation is called glycogenesis, while the term glycogenolysis describes the breakdown of glycogen. Glucose is converted to glycogen and stored in the liver and skeletal muscles when it is not needed for immediate use.</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{Glycogenesis}} \text{Glycogen}$$
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>When glucose is required, the stored glycogen is converted back to glucose.</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Glucose} \xleftarrow{\text{Glycogenolysis}} \text{Glycogen}$$
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>A number of enzymes are involved in glycogenesis and glycogenolysis.</p>

                            <h4>3. Conversion to fat</h4>
                            <p>Excess glucose which is not immediately needed by the body and which cannot be stored as glycogen in the liver, is oxidised to fatty acids and is stored as fat in the tissues.</p>
                            
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$\text{Glucose} \xrightarrow{\text{Oxidation}} \text{Fatty acids} \longrightarrow \text{Fat}$$
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Glucose, when needed by the body can be recovered from fat and protein. This process of re-conversion is known as gluconeogenesis.</p>

It is the most important hormone that regulates the level of glucose in the blood, the rate of its absorption and its conversion to glycogen.

                            <h3>Glucose Homeostasis in the Blood</h3>
                            <p>The level of blood glucose is maintained within the fairly narrow limits by the homeostatic mechanisms described above. Following the intake of carbohydrates, all metabolic activities lead to lower blood glucose levels till it reaches the fasting level. The storage and distribution of glucose by the liver, and the use of glucose by tissues are determined by the above mentioned hormones. A simplified mechanism of glucose homeostasis is illustrated in Fig. 3.1.</p>

                            <p>When the fasting blood glucose level rises above 100 mg/dl (5.56 mmol/L), the condition is known as hyperglycaemia. A fasting blood glucose level which is less than 80 mg/dl (4.44 mmol/L), is known as hypoglycaemia. Glucose is normally filtered by the renal glomeruli and almost totally reabsorbed by the renal tubules. When, however, the blood glucose concentration rises above the range of 160 to 180 mg/dl (8.89 to 10.0 mmol/L), glucose appears in urine. This condition is characteristic of diabetes mellitus (which means "lots of urine tasting of honey"), and is referred to as glycosuria. A blood glucose level of 160 to 180 mg/dl is referred to as the renal threshold for glucose.</p>

                            <h3>Blood Glucose and Blood Sugar</h3>
                            <p>Glucose is the main carbohydrate in the blood, but the term "blood sugar" is generally used to include glucose, other sugars and reducing substances that may be present in the blood.</p>
                            <p>Some methods of estimation of glucose depend on the reducing properties of the sugar. These properties are shared by other sugars and reducing substances. Thus, these methods are not specific for glucose; and such estimations are expressed as Blood Sugar estimations. When the non-glucose reducing substances are removed as part of glucose determination, the resulting value is known as the true glucose value. Other methods like the oxidase-peroxidase method, confer a high degree of specificity on the measurement of glucose in blood and urine.</p>

                            <h3>Glycolysis</h3>
                            <p>When blood is shed, the cells do not die immediately. They continue to metabolise and use up glucose as a source of energy. Glucose, thus, disappears from whole blood on standing over a period of time. This is known as glycolysis. Glycolysis can be prevented with an enzyme inhibitor. The commonest inhibitor for this purpose is sodium fluoride which is usually used in conjunction with an anticoagulant potassium oxalate or sequestrene. Fluoride actually inhibits the enzyme enolase which is found in the metabolic pathway of glucose and has little effect on glucose oxidase and peroxidase enzymes. It also inhibits bacterial growth.</p>

                            <p>Blood glucose is usually measured on a protein-free filtrate of whole blood. This normally gives a value lower than that of plasma due to the presence of RBCs. However, most methods make use of plasma instead of serum or whole blood. Glucose estimation using plasma or whole blood requires the use of an anticoagulant. The fluoride-oxalate mixture used for this purpose is composed of 2 mg of sodium fluoride and 6 mg of potassium oxalate per ml of blood. More than 5 mg of sodium fluoride per ml of blood acts as an inhibitor for the enzymatic estimations.</p>
                            <p>Collection of specimen for measurements of blood glucose level should be done on the day and time requested. This is because collection times are usually related to food intake, insulin treatment, or both. It may be necessary sometimes to note the time of blood collection on the specimen container and on the patient's request form. Urgent glucose measurement becomes necessary in cases of severe hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia as both conditions can result in loss of consciousness (coma).</p>

                            <p>Glucose oxidase catalyses the oxidation of glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide and gluconic acid. The hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of enzyme peroxidase is broken down and the oxygen given off reacts with 4-aminophenazone and phenol to give a pink colour.</p>

                            <h3>3. Reflometric Method</h3>
                            <p>This is a simple enzyme method in which oxidase-peroxidase enzyme and the colour reagent are impregnated on the reagent strips. The method uses a Reflocheck meter to register the amount of glucose in the blood.</p>
                            <p><strong>Technique</strong> A drop of capillary blood is placed on the test strip which after the prescribed time interval is wiped and inserted into the instrument. The colour change is read in a reflectance meter on which the result in mg/dl is visualised.</p>
                            <p>There are many instruments based on the same principle which are used mainly by diabetic patients.</p>

                            <h4>Advantages of Reflometric Methods</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>(i) They are simple and reliable.</li>
                                <li>(ii) They have excellent correlation with reference methods.</li>
                                <li>(iii) They give good precision and accuracy.</li>
                                <li>(iv) The meter is automatically calibrated by the bar code on each test strip.</li>
                                <li>(v) They are battery or mains operated.</li>
                                <li>(vi) They can measure values as high as 450 mg/dl.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>4. O-Toluidine Method</h3>
                            <p>This method makes use of the principle that glucose reacts specifically with O-toluidine, an aromatic amine, in glacial acetic acid at 100°C to produce a blue-green colour. This colour can be measured colorimetrically. The method has the additional advantage that it can be performed directly on serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid or urine without deproteinization. The O-toluidine method is no longer widely used today because O-toluidine is believed to be a carcinogen.</p>

                                Diabetes Mellitus
                            </h2>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>When glycosuria is detected and hyperglycaemia is established, a chronic metabolic disorder known as diabetes mellitus is indicated. It is a condition which is characterised by disturbances in carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism. Hyperglycaemia and glycosuria indicate the major metabolic lesion in carbohydrate metabolism, accompanied by metabolic disturbances in protein (gluconeogenesis) and lipids (ketosis and hypercholesterolaemia).</p>
                            <p>The presence of hyperglycaemia and renal glycosuria with an osmotic diuresis (polyuria) eventually will lead to dehydration and its associated polydipsia (increased thirst). Hyperglycaemia is sustained by the processes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis which enhance the production of more glucose.</p>

                            <h4>Formation of ketone bodies</h4>
                            <p>Acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone are collectively known as ketone bodies or ketones. When any of these substances is detected in blood, the condition is referred to as ketoacidosis or ketonaemia; and when found in urine, it is called ketonuria.</p>
                            <p>When the intake of glucose is insufficient, as in starvation, or when glucose metabolism is impaired due to lack of insulin as in the case of untreated or uncontrolled diabetes, the body obtains its energy by breaking down fats to fatty acids. This increase in fat metabolism leads to the production of acetyl coenzyme A. The two carbon fragments in this enzyme condense to form the ketone bodies. Ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes mellitus.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                            <p>There are two types of the conditions known as primary diabetes:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>1. Maturity-onset (adult type)</li>
                                <li>2. Growth onset (juvenile or child diabetes)</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The course of diabetes mellitus runs in four stages:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>1. Prediabetes — The prediabetic stage is the period from birth until the first evidence of diabetes emerges.</li>
                                <li>2. Suspected diabetes — When an individual displays abnormal glucose tolerance test (GTT) result, or shows symptoms of diabetes under stressful conditions such as obesity, pregnancy, trauma or infections, the condition is referred to as suspected diabetes.</li>
                                <li>3. Chemical or latent diabetes — When a patient who is not under any stress and with no signs or symptoms of disease, displays an abnormal GTT result, or fasting hyperglycaemia, he/she is said to have chemical or latent diabetes.</li>
                                <li>4. Overt diabetes With overt diabetes, symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss are often linked to fasting hyperglycaemia and glycosuria.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Modern Classification of Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                            <p>National Diabetes Data Group has proposed a classification for hyperglycaemic disorders which is outlined below:</p>

                            <h5>1. Idiopathic diabetes mellitus</h5>
                            <p><strong>(a) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM Type I)</strong></p>
                            <p>The individuals in this category produce very little insulin. The patient is acutely ill with severe hyperglycaemia at the time of diagnosis. Satisfactory control of blood sugar is obtained with insulin treatment. About 10 per cent of diabetes mellitus cases belong to this category.</p>
                            <p><strong>(b) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)</strong></p>
                            <p>This is the most common form of diabetes mellitus (80–90%). Most patients with this form of diabetes are relatively deficient in insulin and have mild hyperglycaemia. Obesity is commonly associated with NIDDM and decrease in obesity brings about reduction in hyperglycaemia in most cases. Some persons with NIDDM may be non-obese. A small percentage of NIDDM patients may require insulin injections or an oral hypoglycaemia agent to control hyperglycaemia.</p>

                            <ol start="2">
                                <li><strong>2. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)</strong> In these cases, glucose intolerance is discovered for the first time during pregnancy. Such a woman is at high risk for foetal morbidity and should be promptly treated.</li>
                                <li><strong>3. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)</strong> Persons with IGT are borderline cases with slightly raised glucose levels without overt hyperglycaemia. Such cases may later develop diabetes mellitus or revert to normal levels. Generally, they are at high risk of development of cardiovascular disease.</li>
                                <li><strong>4. Previous abnormality of glucose tolerance (Prev. AGT)</strong> Persons in this category have a history of diabetes but have reverted to normal levels. e.g. those with GDM or obese NIDDM.</li>
                                <li><strong>5. Potential abnormality of glucose tolerance (Pot. AGT)</strong> Persons at a more than average risk of developing diabetes belong to this category. e.g., child of parents with NIDDM.</li>
                                <li><strong>6. Glucose intolerance associated with other disorders</strong> Hyperglycaemia due to underlying disorders such as chronic pancreatitis, Cushing’s disease, and acromegaly are included in this category.</li>

                                <p>The renal threshold is, however, elevated in diabetic kidney. Also, the renal threshold increases with age. In some elderly patients no glycosuria may be present even with serum glucose level as high as 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl).</p>
                                <p>Methods of screening for urine glucose are discussed later in the next chapter.</p></li>

                                <li><strong>2. Fasting blood sugar</strong> It is preferable to use plasma for this test. Glucose levels in excess of 6.6 mmol/L (120 mg/dl) is suggestive of diabetes mellitus; and values between 6.0 to 6.6 mmol (110 to 120 mg/dl) are doubtful and should be confirmed by performing the glucose tolerance test. It is important to remember that conditions such as emotional hyperglycaemia resulting from secretion of epinephrine; general brain damage such as skull fractures, tumours, vascular accidents, encephalitis as well as carbon monoxide poisoning can provoke hyperglycaemia and glycosuria.</li>

                                <li><strong>3. Two-hour post-prandial (pp) blood glucose</strong>
                                <p>Two hours after the patient has broken fast by being fed on adequate carbohydrate meal, a single blood sample is collected and analysed. Glucose level in excess of 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dl) is highly suggestive of diabetes mellitus and should be confirmed with a GTT. A single two-hour pp glucose level has the limitations due to</p>

                                    <li>(i) Delayed peak level due to slow absorption</li>
                                    <li>(ii) Early hyperglycaemia due to rapid absorption</li>
                                    <li>(iii) Quick fall in concentration of blood glucose level due to the release of insulin.</li>
                                    <li>(iv) Wrong specimen collection timing.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>4. Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT)</strong>
                                <p>This is also usually referred to as oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Glucose tolerance test (GTT) measures the ability of the body to tolerate a measured dose of glucose. The rate of glucose absorption and response of insulin mainly determines the extent of glucose tolerance as shown by the changes in the level of blood glucose. When there is rise in blood glucose, insulin is released from the pancreas to lower the glucose level. Tolerance is reduced when insulin is absent or insufficient. A rise in blood glucose value usually occurs after having a meal containing carbohydrates. Therefore, the response to carbohydrate level depends on the previous carbohydrate diet and on the amount ingested. The effect of ingested carbohydrate is the basis of the glucose tolerance test. It simply detects abnormalities in the carbohydrate metabolism and in cases where glycosuria has been found.</p>
                                <p>The oral glucose tolerance test is performed in order to screen</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>(i) Patients having glycosuria with no apparent symptoms of diabetes and with normal fasting and post-prandial blood glucose levels.</li>
                                    <li>(ii) Patients showing symptoms of diabetes with no glycosuria and normal fasting level of blood glucose.</li>
                                    <li>(iii) Persons with family history of diabetes but with no overt diabetes.</li>
                                    <li>(iv) Patients having glycosuria in conjunction with pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, liver disease or infection.</li>
                                    <li>(v) Patients showing evidence of neuropathies and retinopathies of unconfirmed origin.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </li>

                            <h4>Preparing the Patient for GTT</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>(i) Place the patient on a diet containing not less than 150 g of carbohydrate for about three days before the test.</li>
                                <li>(ii) The patient should not eat anything after supper and no breakfast is given on the day of the test. No drink, except ordinary plain water should be given. For children, the time the food is denied is as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>(a) Infants less than 4 months = 4 hours fast</li>
                                        <li>(b) Infants age 4 to 6 months = 6 hours fast</li>
                                        <li>(c) Children aged 6 to 24 months = 8 hours fast.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>(iii) Patient should not be subjected to excessive exercise like walking long distance, excitement or fear, because all these can lead to a reduction in glucose tolerance.</li>
                                <li>(iv) The test is preferably done in the morning and ideally, when the patient is not suffering from any other disease.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Glucose tolerance test method (WHO Reference method)</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>(i) Collect a fasting sample for blood glucose and collect a urine sample from the patient.</li>
                                <li>(ii) Give the patient 75 g glucose dissolved in 250 to 350 ml of water to drink. For children 1.75 g per kg body weight to a maximum of 75 g is given. Alternatively, a 105 ml of lemon flavoured glucose syrup called Hycal (Beecham research laboratories), diluted to 250 to 350 ml with water, can be given. This dose applies to adults only. For children, the pharmacy will supply the appropriate dose on request.</li>
                                <li>(iii) After one hour, take a sample for blood glucose and also collect a urine sample.</li>
                                <li>(iv) After 2 hours take a further sample for blood glucose and collect the final urine sample.</li>
                                <li>(v) Estimate the blood glucose levels of each specimen, and test the urines for the presence of glucose.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p><strong>Normal response:</strong> The fasting blood glucose should be less than 5.5 mmol/L and the two hour level less than 7.0 mmol/L.</p>
                            <p><strong>Diabetic response:</strong> The fasting levels of glucose should be greater than 7.0 mmol/L and the two hour level should be greater than 10.0 mmol/L.</p>
