                            <p>This topic deals with patient status and the collection of specimens.</p>

                            <h3>Patient Status</h3>
                            <p>Patient status refers to the physiological state of the patient at the time of collection of specimen for diagnostic investigation. This is to minimise variation in the final result. Factors such as food intake or physical activity may increase or decrease the levels of certain body fluid components being analysed. For most blood chemistry investigations, absolute fasting is not essential as the results are not significantly affected, but for tests such as glucose, triglycerides and inorganic phosphorus tests, the patient has to be in a fasting state, ideally for 12 hours. Intake of food and day-time variation may lead to alternation in the constitution of chemical substances in the blood. It is therefore more appropriate to collect blood specimens in the morning before the patient takes any food; but usually a 4 to 6 hour fast will suffice. In case of a plasma lactate test, the patient must be resting.</p>

                            <h3>Collection of Specimens</h3>
                            <p>It should always be borne in mind that all clinical specimens are potentially pathogenic. It is therefore important that all necessary safety precautions must be observed when collecting specimens. In addition, proper identification of the patient must be made before collecting specimen from him/her. A properly filled request form must accompany each specimen.</p>

                            <h3>Blood Specimens</h3>
                            <p>In case of blood specimens, specimen containers used for blood for biochemical investigation must be leak proof and chemically clean. Syringes and needles for collecting the blood samples must also be chemically clean, dry and sterile.</p>
                            <p>Venepuncture is the accepted method of blood collection. Some factors that affect the correctness of test results do originate from blood collection. These factors include:</p>

                            <p>The use of disposable needles and syringes minimises the risk of infections due to serum hepatitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For the same reasons, plastic tubes and bottles are preferred to glass ones.</p>

                            <h4>Venepuncture Technique</h4>
                            <p>It is easier to enter a vein which can be felt than the one that is only seen. The tourniquet should not be applied too tightly nor too long in order not to cause venous stasis which can lead to concentration of certain blood substances such as haemoglobin, plasma proteins and calcium. It is wrong to collect blood for chemical analysis from the arm into which an intravenous infusion is already being given.</p>

                            <h4>Haemolysis of Red Blood Cells</h4>
                            <p>Red blood cells are not often used for biochemical investigations as the rupture of the red blood cells can lead to unreliable results. This is because haemolysis causes substances from the cells to be released into the serum or plasma thereby giving a false increase in the concentration of the substances being tested.</p>

                                        <li>Use good, clean, sterile and dry syringe and needle.</li>
                                        <li>Withdraw blood slowly and steadily.</li>
                                        <li>Allow sufficient time for the blood to clot and retraction of the clot to occur.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid prolonged centrifuging; 3 to 5 min at 700 g is adequate.</li>

                                    </ol>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Specimen Containers</h4>
                            <p>Most biochemical analyses require serum. Blood is therefore collected into dry, clean containers. There are some tests, however, that require plasma. To obtain plasma, anticoagulants are used to prevent clotting. Whenever possible, using plasma instead of serum is more advantageous because the yield of plasma from a given volume of blood is greater, and the tests can be performed immediately. Lithium heparin is the most ideal anticoagulant as it does not affect chemical reactions, it helps to reduce the action of haemolysis and lacks sodium or potassium salts which might interfere when electrolytes are to be measured. But due to its high cost, other anticoagulants such as EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid) and fluoride-oxalates are widely used even though they contain sodium and potassium salts.</p>
                            <p>Fluoride is an enzyme inhibitor which prevents glycolysis (breakdown of glucose to lactic acid by enzyme action). Therefore, it must not be used where enzyme activity is to be estimated.</p>

                            <h4>Preservation of Blood</h4>
                            <p>Chemical substances in blood are present in both plasma and cells in varying quantities. Prompt separation of plasma or serum from cells is important in order to prevent chemical changes which can occur in whole blood. Refrigeration of blood specimen prior to separation of plasma can lead to false high potassium level. Glycolysis can occur if fluoride-oxalate anticoagulant is not used. Bilirubin will be decomposed on prolonged exposure to light. It is essential to refrigerate serum or plasma at 4°C or freeze at -20°C until analysed. As much as possible, blood specimen should be handled aseptically to prevent and minimise chances of bacterial contamination.</p>

                            <h3>Urine Specimens</h3>
                            <p>Urine is an important specimen for clinical analysis. A single specimen of urine may be adequate for analysis depending on the type of examination required. The container for urine collection should be clean, dry, leak-proof and sufficiently wide mouthed for the patient to use. The container must also be free from all traces of disinfectants and other chemicals.</p>
                            <p>Collection of urine specimen can be early morning, timed or random.</p>
                            
                            <dl>
                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="The first urine voided on waking up in the morning.">Early morning urine specimen</dt>
                                <dd>The first urine voided on waking up in the morning is referred to as early morning specimen. This specimen usually contains the highest concentration of substances than others passed later in the day. It is therefore, more suitable for easy detection of abnormalities.</dd>

                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="Urine collected over a specific period, typically 24 hours.">Timed specimen of urine</dt>
                                <dd>It may be necessary to collect a timed specimen of urine for certain quantitative analysis of substances such as hormones, calcium, protein, phosphates and steroids. This is because the concentration of these substances in urine varies from sample to sample; and so, a pooled specimen over a period of time, e.g. 24 hours, will give a more accurate result.</dd>
                            </dl>

                            <p>The laboratory staff should advise or instruct the ward staff or the patient on the proper and correct way of collecting timed specimen. A successful collection of 24 hour urine specimen is as follows:</p>

                            <h4>Preservation of Urine</h4>
                            <p>Chemical changes take place in urine on keeping at room temperature over a period of time. Some of these changes are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                </li>

                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker">c</span>

                            </ul>
                            <p>All these chemical changes can be arrested or slowed down by refrigerating the urine specimen at 4°C. Chemicals are also used to preserve the urine, especially, the 24 hour specimen.</p>

                            <h4>Chemical preservatives</h4>
                            <p><strong>(a) Concentrated hydrochloric acid</strong> 10 ml of conc. HCl is used to preserve 24 hour specimen of urine. It should be noted that urine for protein or urate estimation must never be acidified.</p>
                            <p><strong>(b) Thymol and other chemicals</strong> A few crystals of thymol are used to preserve 24 hour specimen of urine required for total protein and creatinine estimation. Chemical substances such as chloroform, toluene and formalin are used to preserve urine for chemical analysis while boric acid is ideal for urine which may require bacterial culture.</p>
                            <p>Storage of a large container of 24 hour specimen of urine usually presents a problem. It is convenient to keep small representative portions rather than the whole collection. To do this, mix the urine thoroughly and carefully measure and note down the total volume. Place small volumes in about 4 small universal bottles labelled with patient's details, date and time of collection.</p>

                            <h3>Faecal Specimens</h3>
                            <p>Collection of faecal specimen may be timed or random depending on the investigation to be carried out. For a qualitative test, such as occult blood, a number of random specimens should be collected and tested. A small portion of the faecal sample is sent to the laboratory in a clean, dry, wide mouthed container such as a waxed carton or a plastic universal container.</p>
                            <p>For quantitative analysis such as faecal fat estimation, the entire stools are sent to the laboratory over a period of five days. The specimen is collected into an appropriate jar with a cover. Alternatively, the specimen can be collected into a polythene sheet in a bed pan; the end of the polythene is then gathered and tied with an elastic band. The whole specimen is kept frozen in a deep freezer. The polythene is easily removed.</p>
                            <p>Stool specimens for chemical analysis apart from faecal fat, are refrigerated at 4°C with no preservative added.</p>

                            <h3>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)</h3>
                            <p>Cerebrospinal fluid is usually sent to the clinical chemistry laboratory for the estimation of glucose, total proteins and a few other investigations. For glucose estimation, the specimen is preferably collected into a clean, dry container with fluoride-oxalate preservative to prevent glycolysis. It can also be collected into an ordinary clean container and kept in the refrigerator if there is any delay in estimation.</p>
                            <p>Collection of CSF from the lumbar vertebrae is a delicate operation and should always deserve emergency treatment. Usually the sample is shared between Microbiology and Biochemistry laboratories, and so it is important that there is a cooperation between the two departments in the interest of the patient.</p>

                            <h3>Dispatch of Specimens</h3>
                            <p>It is always the best rule to dispatch the specimen to the laboratory after collection as quickly as possible. As a further safety measure to prevent transmission of infections, the specimen container may be placed in a leak-proof plastic bag for dispatch. The request form, in this case, is placed on the outside of the bag in a special pouch attached to the bag. Chemical changes in some clinical specimens take place very quickly at room temperature. These changes can be minimised by keeping the specimen at 4°C for up to 2 hours.</p>
                            <p>For long transportation of clinical specimens through the post, the laboratory must obey the existing statutory guidelines. The regulations for transporting specimens include:</p>

                            <p>Analytical quality control can be termed as the internal quality control carried out within the clinical laboratory. It is to ensure that tests are performed correctly and reliable results produced.</p>

                            <h3>Staff Development</h3>
                            <p>Faulty techniques in the performance of analytical procedures lead to incorrect results. Faulty techniques are usually due to the carelessness of the laboratory worker as well as inadequate training of the staff. One of the most effective ways to ensure correct results and so, maintain a high standard for the laboratory is through constant training and retraining of staff. For this reason, opportunity should be made available to staff members for further training and education.</p>

                            <h3>Instrument Quality Control</h3>
                            <p>Quality control on instruments is very essential if the laboratory must continue to produce reliable results. Unfortunately, this aspect of quality control is often given very little attention. This negligence very often leads to the typical laboratory "confusion" when inconsistent results are being produced. Analytical instruments and equipment such as balances, water baths, spectrophotometers etc. must be routinely checked in order to prevent errors. Some of these instruments like spectrophotometers, are supplied with the means of checking their efficiency. However, the very expensive ones are usually maintained by the manufacturers or their representatives. A well maintained instrument may probably go wrong, but a badly maintained one will surely go wrong. Breakdowns are virtually eliminated if, and only if, the manufacturer's instructions for operation and maintenance are strictly adhered to.</p>

                            <h3>Performance Standard</h3>
                            <p>The choice of test methods is usually left to the most senior laboratory staff to make. Such test methods must prove to work reliably before they are used for patient specimens. After the method has been introduced, it must be constantly and adequately controlled. For the purpose of quality control, a test method should be considered on the basis of the following criteria:</p>

Therefore, a good test method must be accurate and precise. For example, if a true value of a sample is 75 units, the same sample, when tested 5 times must give the same value or a value very close to the original value. This property of a test method is affected if, for example, the reagents are unstable, instruments are faulty or if the method is not specific.</span>

                            <h3>Errors in Test Methods</h3>
                            <p>There are two types of error that can occur when performing biochemical tests. These are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-content">Errors of scatter i.e. imprecision, and</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker">ii</span>
                                    <span class="list-content">Errors of bias, i.e., inaccuracy.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>(i) Errors of scatter</h4>
                            <p>These are random errors in which the results differ from the correct result by varying amount. The commonest causes of this type of error are</p>
                            <p><strong>(a) Faulty technique</strong> This may include</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>incorrect pipetting</li>
                                <li>inadequate mixing of sample with reagents</li>
                                <li>Wrong incubation of test at wrong temperature or for the incorrect length of time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The errors due to faulty technique can be minimised if a laboratory manual for test methods is clearly written and in sufficient details, and followed exactly by all members of staff. Any changes to the manual should also be in writing.</p>
                            <p><strong>(b) Dirty apparatus</strong> Dirty tubes, pipettes and other items of apparatus used in the test.</p>
                            <p><strong>(c) Erratic instrument readings</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(d) Incomplete removal of interfering substances in serum</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(e) Carelessness</strong> This refers to lack of concentration on the part of the analyst.</p>

                            <h4>(ii) Errors of bias</h4>
                            <p>These are regular errors in which results differ from the correct results by approximately the same amount. These errors may arise from</p>
                            <p><strong>(a) Use of impure chemicals</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(b) Incorrect calibration of test method</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(c) Use of expired reagents or reagents stored at wrong temperature.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(d) Use of incorrect light filter.</strong></p>

                            <h3>Standard Deviation (SD)</h3>
                            <p>It is important to check regularly for “scatter” and “bias” errors. This helps to detect at an early stage when errors are being introduced into routine test procedures. A statistical value that is used to measure precision is called Standard Deviation (SD). One way to determine SD is to repeatedly analyse one sample and then apply the formula:</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$SD = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$
                            </div>

                            <p>where $\sum (x - \bar{x})^2$ is the sum of the differences of each individual test from the mean, and $n$ is the number of observations. The $n$ should be greater than 30 for an adequate measure.</p>

                            <h3>Coefficient of Variation (CV or % CV)</h3>
                            <p>The difficulty in interpreting SD is usually over, come with the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV expresses SD as the percentage of the mean. For example, an SD of 0.4 with a mean value of 25 shows the same precision as SD of 0.8 with a mean value of 50. Therefore,</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$CV = \frac{0.4}{25} \times 100 = 1.6\%$$
                            </div>

                            <p>or</p>

                            <div class="equation">
                                $$CV = \frac{0.8}{50} \times 100 = 1.6\%$$
                            </div>

                            <p>The CV for several levels must be obtained for normal and abnormal ranges; and when using any CV, the mean value should be established.</p>
                            <p>The procedure for assessing reliability and variability is carried out under the best possible conditions. This condition is referred to as the Optimal Condition Variance (OCV). It is used to compare with the Routine Conditions Variance (RCV) of the test method when in routine use.</p>

                            <h3>Control Sample</h3>
                            <p>It is the sample that simulates the physical and chemical pattern of a clinical sample being analysed and it is treated just like the clinical sample. The control serum will detect errors due to reagents and standards only. Most laboratories make use of commercially prepared control sera which are fairly expensive. It is cheaper, however, to use analysed pooled sera which can be prepared and calibrated using a commercially prepared serum. To be excluded from the pool are those sera that are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>icteric (partaining to jaundice),</li>
                                <li>cloudy,</li>
                                <li>haemolysed, or</li>
                                <li>grossly coloured due to dyes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Commercially prepared control sera are available in two forms, freeze dried (lyophilized) sera, and synthetically produced liquid sera. It is very important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the preparation, use and calibration of control sera.</p>
                            <p>It is equally important to have information on a wide variety of control sera from different manufacturers.</p>
                            <p>To measure performance with respect to accuracy and precision, the following control measures are carried out:</p>

This checking system is monitored by an organisation outside the laboratory, e.g., a central laboratory. Participation in this scheme should be encouraged as it serves as an additional internal quality control measure, though it should never be a substitute for organised internal quality control. The system involves each laboratory being asked to analyse a predetermined set of samples and send the results back to the organisers. Each laboratory receives a feedback on its performance. In this way, the laboratory is able to compare its standard with that of other laboratories that use the same analytical methods. The scheme also helps a laboratory to decide whether or not to change a method in use.</span>

                            <h3>Quality Control Chart</h3>
                            <p>After a test method has been introduced as a reliable routine method, regular check on the precision of results is made with the use of a control chart. A control serum is used with each batch of tests. The control chart helps to reveal, diagnose and treat faults at an early stage before patient test results are affected and report delayed.</p>
                            <p>There are several ways to produce a quality control chart. A simple control chart can be produced in the following way:</p>

                            <p>A drift of values above the upper limit or below the lower limit is a clear warning that the test method is becoming unreliable. Therefore, the faults must be corrected before another batch of tests can be carried out. A new quality control chart must be prepared when the first control chart is about to be completed. It is necessary to include one or more samples from the previous batch.</p>

                            <p>Post analytical quality control is an area which concerns the reporting and verification of test results before they are dispatched to the clinics and wards. It has to do with that area of laboratory activity that is very often neglected but is equally as important as the pre-analytical and the analytical quality controls. All efforts and costs expended on quality control of methods, reagents and instruments will be a sad loss if test results are not clearly and correctly reported. There is no doubt that the task of reporting and cross-checking hundreds of specimens daily is a tedious one. It becomes necessary, therefore, that such a duty should not be handled by untrained and non-professional staff without adequate supervision. The introduction of computers in the laboratories has gone a long way in minimising clerical errors when reporting test results.</p>
                            <p>An efficiently run laboratory must have a well laid down quality control programme in order to improve its standard of work. A constant review of the various aspects of the programme should be given top priority. As a matter of departmental policy, a very senior staff is usually appointed as a quality control officer. It is the duty of this officer to monitor all quality control measures in order to detect faults and errors, and arrange for immediate correction.</p>
