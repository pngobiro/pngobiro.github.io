\section*{1. INTRODUCTION}

Haemoglobin is the respiratory protein in the red blood cells of vertebrates. Its physiological functions are to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to facilitate the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. In its oxygen binding properties and its interactions with other molecules and ions, haemoglobin exhibits phenomena similar to those of many multi-subunit enzymes in their interactions with substrates and cofactors. The intensive study of its structure and reactions has now reached a stage where a detailed model of its function has been developed. This in turn may contribute to the general understanding of the interactions of enzymes.

The approach taken by this article is outlined in section 1.5 of the Introduction. For those new to the subject, the well-established facts concerning haemoglobin structure and functions are given first.

\subsection*{1.1. The Structure of Haemoglobin}

Mammalian haemoglobin has molecular weight of about 64,500 and comprises four subunits, each having one polypeptide chain and one prosthetic group, the haem. The haem group is a protoporphyrin ring at the centre of which is an iron atom in the ferrous state. In free haem the ferrous iron atom is oxidized to ferric by reaction with oxygen whereas in haemoglobin the iron atom combines reversibly with oxygen and stays in the ferrous state in both the oxygenated and deoxygenated forms. This reversible combination with oxygen is made possible in haemoglobin by the folding of the polypeptide chains around the haem groups to enclose them in hydrophobic pockets. The four polypeptide chains are of similar length. Two identical chains, the $\alpha$-chains, each contain 141 amino acids and two other identical chains, the $\beta$-chains, each contain 146 amino acids. Their amino acid sequences have been determined for many species. The form of the backbone of each chain, together with the configuration of the amino acid side chains, is known as the tertiary structure of the subunit. Most of the amino acid residues in both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits form parts of helices, in which the amino groups of the peptide backbone are hydrogen bonded to the carboxyl groups in adjacent turns. Each subunit contains eight helical segments separated by corners and short, nonhelical regions. The arrangement of the four subunits in the haemoglobin tetramer is known as the quaternary structure.

The structures of haemoglobin with and without oxygen on the haems have been determined by X-ray analysis in sufficient detail to position many of the atoms except hydrogens to within $0.5 \AA$. The two species that have been studied are human and horse haemoglobin. High resolution studies of the deoxygenated forms of the two species show that differences between their tertiary structures are small and that their quaternary structures are virtually identical. Lower resolution studies of the two oxygenated forms show that they have the same quaternary structure as each other. The quaternary structures of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin, however, are very different. One view of a low resolution model of the structure of horse oxyhaemoglobin is shown in Fig. 1. The structure has a dyad axis which is preserved in the quaternary structure change so that the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ pair is identical to the $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ pair in both structures. The overall effect of the quaternary structure change between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin is to leave the $\alpha$-chains in much the same positions relative to each other but to increase the separation of the $\beta$-chains so that the space in the central cavity between them is increased and the haem groups are $6 \AA$ further apart. The interface between the $\alpha_{1}$ and

\caption{Fig. 1. Low resolution model of the oxyhaemoglobin molecule, $\alpha$ subunits are white, $\beta$ subunits are black and the grey discs are the haems. The helical segments of the subunits are denoted A to H and the non-helical regions between helices are denoted $\mathrm{CD}, \mathrm{EF}$, etc. In deoxyhaemoglobin, the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ dimer is positioned relative to $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ so that the positions of the $\alpha$-chains are little changed but lysine $40 \alpha_{1}$ is in contact with histidine $146 \beta_{2}$.}
\end{figure}
$\beta_{1}$ subunits is altered very little, whilst that between the $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ subunits is altered much more. In the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface the amino acid side chains are involved in totally different contacts in the two quaternary structures.

The tertiary structures of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin show differences which are small but significant. The iron atom is coplanar with the porphyrin ring of the haem group in oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in deoxyhaemoglobin it lies out of the plane by about $0.6 \AA$. In oxyhaemoglobin, the C -terminal residue, arginine 141 , of each $\alpha$-chain is free to take up several alternative positions, whereas in deoxyhaemoglobin the carboxyl group and the side chain of each arginine 141 form salt bridges with charged groups on the opposite $\alpha$-chains. The carboxyl group of the C -terminal residue, histidine 146, of each $\beta$-chain forms a weak salt bridge with the $\alpha$-amino group of the N -terminal residue of the opposite $\beta$-chain in oxyhaemoglobin, whereas in deoxyhaemoglobin the altered positions of the subunits enables the carboxyl group of histidine $146 \beta_{2}$ to form a salt bridge with the $\epsilon$-amino group of lysine $40 \alpha_{1}$. The positions of some of these groups are indicated in Fig. 1.

\subsection*{1.2. The Equilibrium of Haemoglobin with Oxygen}

Haemoglobin reacts reversibly with oxygen at the four haem groups. It picks up oxygen in the lungs, where the oxygen tension is high, and releases it in the tissues where the oxygen tension is low. In muscle the oxygen is taken up by myoglobin which is a single subunit respiratory protein containing only one haem group.

The fraction of haem groups having oxygen bound as a function of partial pressure of oxygen is shown for haemoglobin in Fig. 2, curve a. Such a curve is known as an oxygen equilibrium curve, and for haemoglobin it has the so-called sigmoid shape. The physiological advantage of the sigmoid oxygen equilibrium curve for haemoglobin is seen when it is compared with the corresponding curve for myoglobin, Fig. 2, curve b.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-169.jpg?height=801&width=820&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=460}

(a) Haemoglobin, (b) myoglobin, (c) myoglobin type equilibrium curve having the same fractional saturation as haemoglobin at venous pressure.}
\end{figure}

The partial pressure of oxygen, $p_{50}$, required to produce $50 \%$ saturation of oxygen binding sites is used as a measure of oxygen affinity, so that high affinity corresponds to a small value of $p_{50}$ and low affinity to a large value of $p_{50}$. Myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than has haemoglobin. As the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced from that corresponding to arterial pressure to that corresponding to venous pressure, the percentage saturation of haemoglobin drops from about $95 \%$ to about $73 \%$. At venous pressure the equilibrium saturation of myoglobin is about $90 \%$ so that it takes up and stores the oxygen that the haemoglobin unloads. If haemoglobin had a curve of the myoglobin type that gave the same fractional saturation as haemoglobin does at venous pressure (Fig. 2, curve c), it would be only $87 \%$ saturated at arterial pressure and could thus deliver only two-thirds as much oxygen to the tissues. A further advantage associated with the actual curve is that its steepness at the pressure corresponding to venous pressure enables the amount of oxygen unloaded to be adjusted sensitively by a drop in venous pressure.

The hyperbolic shape of the myoglobin curve is that expected for the combination of one molecule of myoglobin with one molecule of oxygen. The same shape of curve would be expected for haemoglobin if the four stages of oxygenation took place independently. But the sigmoid shape of the haemoglobin curve shows that, as oxygenation proceeds, combination with further molecules of oxygen is made easier. This phenomenon of co-operative interaction in oxygen binding is known as haem-haem interaction. It cannot be due to direct interaction between the binding sites since the haem groups are far apart in the haemoglobin structure. The interaction arises indirectly from conformational changes induced by the binding of oxygen which are associated with the change in quaternary structure between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin.

\subsection*{1.3. Factors Affecting the Oxygen Equilibrium}

The equilibrium of haemoglobin with oxygen is influenced by the presence of ions and molecules that have different binding constants to oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. The following are three examples of such effects, known as heterotropic interactions.

Binding of hydrogen ions. Both oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin bind hydrogen ions, but at physiological pH deoxyhaemoglobin has the higher affinity for them. Thus hydrogen ions are taken up when oxyhaemoglobin loses oxygen and are released when deoxy-
haemoglobin binds oxygen. The thermodynamically related effect is that the equilibrium between oxygen and haemoglobin is influenced by the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution, the pH . In the physiological range of pH , the oxygen affinity is decreased by lowering the pH and increased by raising it, but the extent of co-operative interaction is scarcely altered. This interaction between the binding of oxygen and of hydrogen ions is known as the Bohr effect. It is responsible for the efficient loading and unloading of oxygen in the lungs and in the tissues respectively, and for facilitating the transport of carbon dioxide in the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide being expelled from the tissues is transported to the lungs dissolved in the blood as carbonic acid, which dissociates with the formation of hydrogen ions
$$\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$$

In the tissues the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low and that of dissolved carbon dioxide is high. The pH is lowered by the increase in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$accompanying the dissolved carbon dioxide thereby lowering the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin. Thus the amount of oxygen that haemoglobin unloads is increased by the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide. As oxyhaemoglobin unloads oxygen, its affinity for hydrogen ions increases, removing them from solution and enabling more carbon dioxide to dissolve in the blood. In the lungs, where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is high and of dissolved carbon dioxide low, the reverse effects combine to increase the loading of haemoglobin with oxygen and to decrease the solubility of carbon dioxide.

Binding of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide binds directly to haemoglobin as well as interacting with it by altering the pH of the solution. Both oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin bind carbon dioxide at specific sites on the protein, but deoxyhaemoglobin has the higher affinity. Thus in a way exactly analogous to the binding of hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide is bound by deoxyhaemoglobin in the tissues and released when deoxyhaemoglobin becomes oxygenated in the lungs. Also by analogy, the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is decreased by the presence of carbon dioxide. This direct interaction between carbon dioxide and haemoglobin accounts for $10 \%$ of the physiological transport of carbon dioxide.

The effect of salts. Deoxyhaemoglobin has a higher affinity for certain salts than has oxyhaemoglobin. So the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is decreased by increasing salt concentration. The oxygen equilibrium is influenced particularly by organic phosphates such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which is present in the red blood cells of mammals and inositol hexaphosphate, which is closely related to inositol pentaphosphate present in the red blood cells of birds. Organic phosphates have been shown to play a role in adapting the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin to meet the needs of the tissues.

Changes in amino acid sequences of the polypeptide chains. The equilibrium between haemoglobin and oxygen is also altered by changes in the amino acid sequences of the polypeptide chains. These changes can alter the immediate environment of the haem groups and therefore their oxygen binding properties, or they can alter the tertiary structures of the subunits and the way they associate into the tetramer. Haemoglobins from most mammalian species give similar sigmoid oxygenation curves but they differ in their oxygen affinity, extent of co-operativity and heterotropic interactions. The amino acid sequences of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits have been determined for many species, a study of which shows that a large number of invariant residues, including those in the haem environment and the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ contact, are essential for the normal function of tetrameric haemoglobins.

Many mutant forms of human haemoglobin have been discovered. Most of them are due to the mutation of one amino acid in the molecule and in many cases the site of the mutation and the amino acid replacement have been identified. Some have abnormally high or low oxygen affinity and may lack the normal co-operative and heterotropic interactions and the accompanying changes in quaternary conformation.

The oxygen affinity and the co-operative and heterotropic interactions of haemoglobin are greatly affected by some chemical modifications to the protein, for example if the C -terminal residues of either the $\alpha$-or $\beta$-chain are removed by enzymatic digestion.

Experiments on modified haemoglobins have demonstrated the importance for normal functioning of links between the subunits involving the C-terminal residues. Other chemical modifications both inhibit the change of quaternary structure and destroy co-operative interactions, demonstrating the association between these effects. Methods have been developed for separating the haemoglobin tetramer into isolated $\alpha$ and $\beta$-subunits which can then be treated differently before reassembly into a tetramer. Artificial hybrids of many kinds have been produced, for example hybrids in which only one type of subunit can react with oxygen, the other being permanently in the ferric state. Their study makes an important contribution to the understanding of haemoglobin function.

\subsection*{1.4. The Equilibrium of Haemoglobin with Other Ligands}

Haemoglobin combines reversibly at the haem groups with ligands other than oxygen. The co-operative and heterotropic interactions shown by haemoglobin for binding the ligand carbon monoxide are very similar to those shown with oxygen, except that the affinity of haemoglobin for carbon monoxide is about 200 times its affinity for oxygen. Haemoglobin can also be reversibly oxidized to the ferric state, known as methaemoglobin, in which the ligand is a water molecule. The co-operative interactions for oxidation are less than for oxygenation and also vary with pH . Normally, the liganded forms of haemoglobin, whether the iron is ferrous or ferric, all have the same quaternary structure as oxyhaemoglobin whereas deoxyhaemoglobin with no ligand is unique in its structure.

\subsection*{1.5. Outline of this Article}

Some properties of haemoglobin have an explanation in terms of the structures of fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin, whereas other properties can be understood only in terms of the structures of the intermediate states. These are unobservable and have to be described by a model. This article discusses first those properties of haemoglobin which have an explanation that is independent of a particular model, and then introduces the currently accepted model for the discussion of other properties. The thermodynamics relating to both types of property are given in section 2 . The structures of fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin are described in section 3. In sections 4 and 5, the functional properties of normal and abnormal haemoglobins are discussed in terms of the fully liganded and unliganded structures, and evidence relating to the intermediate structures is described. Section 6 outlines the type of model of the intermediate states that this evidence suggests, and section 7 gives a detailed discussion of the functional properties of haemoglobin in terms of this model.

\section*{2. THEORY OF LIGAND BINDING TO HAEMOGLOBIN}

\subsection*{2.1. The Equilibrium Binding of Oxygen to Haemoglobin}

Haemoglobin has four subunits, each having one site at which an oxygen molecule can be bound. The reversible combination with oxygen at these four sites can be represented by the following scheme due to Adair (1925):
$$\mathrm{Hb}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{~A}_{1}} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{~A}_{2}} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{2}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{~A}_{3}} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{~A}_{4}} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}$$

This representation is thermodynamically exact, even if the four sites are not identical, provided that the system is pure and not dissociating into subunits. Four constants, known as the Adair constants, describe the oxygen equilibrium and these can be expressed in terms of the association constants of the actual steps in a specific model for oxygen binding. The Adair constants are given by
$$A_{1}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)\right]}{,[\mathrm{Hb}] \times p}, \quad A_{2}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)\right] \times p}, \quad A_{3}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{2}\right] \times p}, \quad A_{4}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}\right] \times p}$$
where all concentrations are expressed in mole fractions. $p$ in mole fractions is related to the partial pressure of oxygen $\mathrm{pO}_{2}$ by a dimensional factor C such that $p=\mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{pO}_{2}$. Experimentally determined Adair constants are usually quoted in $(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$ and are related to the constants $A$ by the same dimensional factor. In this article $p$ in algebraic expressions should be understood to be in mole fractions, whereas when discussing experimental results $p$ and $A$ will be in mm Hg .

The Adair constants are the macroscopic association constants for the successive steps in the oxygen binding reaction. They can be represented as the product of two factors, an intrinsic association constant for binding oxygen at each step and a statistical factor that takes into account the number of ways in which a given number of oxygen molecules can be distributed among the four subunits. Let $A_{1}^{\prime}, A_{2}^{\prime}, A_{3}^{\prime}, A_{4}^{\prime}$, denote the intrinsic association constants for the four steps of the reaction. Then
$$A_{1}=4 A_{1}^{\prime}, \quad A_{2}=\frac{3}{2} A_{2}^{\prime}, \quad A_{3}=\frac{2}{3} A_{3}^{\prime}, \quad A_{4}=\frac{1}{4} A_{4}^{\prime} .$$

The oxygen equilibrium curve is the plot of the fractional saturation of oxygen combining sites, $\overline{\mathrm{Y}}$, against the partial pressure of oxygen, $p \mathrm{O}_{2}$. By expressing the relative concentrations of haemoglobin molecules with 0 to 4 molecules of oxygen bound in terms of the Adair constants, the fractional saturation of oxygen binding sites, $\bar{Y}$, can be written
$$\bar{Y}=\frac{\left(A_{1} p+2 A_{1} A_{2} p^{2}+3 A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} p^{3}+4 A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} p^{4}\right)}{4\left(1+A_{1} p+A_{1} A_{2} p^{2}+A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} p^{3}+A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} p^{4}\right)} .$$

If $Y$ is the average number of bound oxygen molecules per haemoglobin molecule,
$$Y=4 \bar{Y} .$$

Equation (2.3) is the general equation for the oxygen equilibrium curve. Written in terms of the intrinsic association constants
$$\bar{Y}=\frac{\left(A_{1}^{\prime} p+3 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} p^{2}+3 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} p^{3}+A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime} p^{4}\right)}{\left(1+4 A_{1}^{\prime} p+6 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} p^{2}+4 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} p^{3}+A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime} p^{4}\right)} .$$

If the intrinsic association constants are all equal to $A^{\prime}$, eq. (2.5) reduces to
$$\bar{Y}=\frac{A^{\prime} p}{1+A^{\prime} p} .$$

This is the equation for the hyperbolic oxygen equilibrium curve (Fig. 2b and c) which is obtained when there is only one binding site for oxygen, as in myoglobin, as well as when the four Adair constants are equal. From eq. (2.6) it can be seen that for very small $p$,
$$\bar{Y} \longrightarrow A^{\prime} p$$
and for very large $p$
$$\bar{Y} \longrightarrow 1-\frac{1}{A^{\prime} p} .$$

If the intrinsic association constants are unequal, and if the association constant for the last step in oxygen binding is greater than that for the first step, the oxygen equilibrium curve will be sigmoid, which can be seen as follows. For very small $p$, eq. (2.5) becomes
$$\bar{Y} \longrightarrow A_{1}^{\prime} p,$$
i.e. the equilibrium curve at small $p$ is the same as the hyperbolic curve corresponding to association constant $A_{1}^{\prime}$. For very large $p$
$$\bar{Y} \longrightarrow 1-\frac{1}{A_{4}^{\prime} p},$$
i.e. the equilibrium curve at large $p$ is the same as the hyperbolic curve corresponding to association constant $A_{4}^{\prime}$. If $A_{4}^{\prime}$ is greater than $A_{1}^{\prime}$, the equilibrium curve must have a sigmoid shape.

The oxygen equilibrium curve for normal haemoglobin does have this sigmoid shape
(Fig. 2a) showing that the last molecule of oxygen combines more easily with oxygen than does the first. The reactivities of the oxygen binding sites must therefore be influenced by the presence of oxygen already combined at the other binding sites, in other words there is co-operative interaction between the binding sites.

The oxygen equilibrium curves of isolated $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains are hyperbolic and are similar to that of myoglobin (Fig. 2b). Isolated $\alpha$-chains are monomeric, whilst $\beta$-chains assemble into a $\beta_{4}$-tetramer which has no interaction between binding sites (Bucci et al., 1965; Tyuma et al., 1966; Geraci et al., 1969). The values of the association constants for oxygen binding to both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains are similar to that of the last oxygen molecule binding to haemoglobin.

\subsection*{2.2. The Free Energy of Ligand Binding and the Median Ligand Activity}

The standard free energy changes on binding a ligand to haemoglobin at each of the four steps are given by
$$-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{1}^{\prime}, \quad-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{2}^{\prime}, \quad-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{3}^{\prime}, \quad-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{4}^{\prime} .$$

The average free energy of ligand binding over the four successive steps is
$$F_{\mathrm{av}}=-\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{RT} \ln A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime} \text { from (2.7) }$$
where by eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) the product of the intrinsic association constants is
$$A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}\right]}{[\mathrm{Hb}] \times p^{4}} .$$

The median ligand activity, $p_{m}$, is defined as the value of $p$ at which the concentration of unliganded and fully liganded molecules are equal,
i.e.
$$\frac{1}{p_{m}^{4}}=A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime}$$

Therefore the average free energy of ligand binding can be written
$$F_{\mathrm{av}}=\mathrm{RT} \ln p_{m}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{m}$$
where $A_{m}=1 / p_{m}$.
The concept of median ligand activity was introduced by Wyman $(1964,1967)$ and is a very useful and fundamental parameter of the oxygen equilibrium curve. The median ligand activity for haemoglobin is given by eq. (2.8). For the isolated $\alpha$-and $\beta$-subunits it can be seen that
$$p_{m}=\frac{1}{A^{\prime}}$$

\subsection*{2.3. The Parameters Used to Describe Experimental Oxygen Equilibrium Curves}

Figure 3a shows the oxygen equilibrium curve $\bar{Y}$ against $p \mathrm{O}_{2}$ obtained for a particular set of conditions over as great a range of fractional saturation as is possible experimentally (Tyuma et al., 1973a). In principle the four Adair constants can be determined from a complete equilibrium curve and these give the free energies of ligand binding at the four successive steps, and the value of $p_{m}$. In many cases the equilibrium curve has not been measured over the entire range of fractional saturation. A useful way to present the experimental data is the Hill plot, $\log (\bar{Y} /(1-\bar{Y}))$ against $\log p \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Figure 3b shows the Hill plot of the equilibrium curve in Fig. 3a.

From eq. (2.5),
$$\frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}}=\frac{A_{1}^{\prime} p+3 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} p^{2}+3 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} p^{3}+A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime} p^{4}}{1+3 A_{1}^{\prime} p+3 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} p^{2}+A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} p^{3}} .$$

For very low partial pressures of oxygen,
$$\frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}} \longrightarrow A_{1}^{\prime} p \quad \text { and } \quad \log \frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}} \longrightarrow \log A_{1}^{\prime}+\log p .$$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-174.jpg?height=746&width=573&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=595}

\caption{Fig. 3a. Oxygen equilibrium curve for haemoglobin, at $\mathrm{pH} 7.4,25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, in 0.05 m bis-tris +0.1 m NaCl , plotted from the Adair constants of Tyuma et al. (1973a) in the range of fractional saturation over which data were measured. The Adair constants of the curve are: $A_{1}^{\prime}=0.024$, $A_{2}^{\prime}=0.074, A_{3}^{\prime}=0.086, A_{4}^{\prime}=7.4$.}
\end{figure}

For very high partial pressures of oxygen
$$\frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}} \longrightarrow A_{4}^{\prime} p \quad \text { and } \quad \log \frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}} \longrightarrow \log A_{4}^{\prime}+\log p .$$

Thus the plot of $\log (\overline{\mathrm{Y}} /(1-\overline{\mathrm{Y}}))$ against $\log p$ tends to a straight line of slope unity at very low and very high partial pressures. The asymptote at very low partial pressures has intercept $-\log A_{1}^{\prime}$ on the $\log p$ axis and the asymptote at very high partial pressures has intercept $-\log A_{4}^{\prime}$. Measurements at very high and very low saturations are needed in order to determine these intercepts. If such data are available $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ can be estimated and four Adair constants fitted to the complete saturation curve. The Adair constants of the equilibrium curve and Hill plot in Fig. 3 are given in the figure caption.

The difference between the free energies of binding the first and the last ligand, $\Delta F_{I}$, is obtainable from the asymptotes of the Hill plot. Wyman (1964) called $\Delta F_{I}$ the free energy of interaction,
$$\Delta F_{i}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{1}^{\prime}+\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{4}^{\prime} .$$

For the data in Fig. 3, this free energy difference is 3.4 kcal per mole haem (Tyuma et al., 1973a).

When the data are not sufficiently extensive, only the steep part of the Hill plot in the middle of the range of saturation can be plotted. Two parameters only, $p_{50}$ and $n$, are then used to characterize the plot.
$p_{50}$ is the value of $p$ required to give $50 \%$ saturation. The expression for $p_{50}$ in terms of the Adair constants is obtained by putting $\overline{\mathrm{Y}}=1-\overline{\mathrm{Y}}$ in eq. (2.11) and is
$$1+2 A_{1}^{\prime} p_{50}=2 A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} p_{50}^{3}+A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime} p_{50}^{4} .$$

In the case when all the Adair constants are equal, $p_{50}$ has a simple value,
$$p_{50}=\frac{1}{A^{\prime}}=p_{m} \quad \text { from }(2.8)$$

Hill's constant, $n$, is the slope of the Hill plot at $50 \%$ saturation and is a useful measure of the extent of interaction between the binding sites. When there is no interaction, $n=1$. If the four oxygen molecules were to combine with haemoglobin in
one step, corresponding to the maximum possible cooperativity, $n=4$. Analytically
$$n=\left(\frac{d \log \frac{\bar{Y}}{1-\bar{Y}}}{d \log p}\right)_{p_{50}}$$
and is a complicated function of $p_{50}$ and the Adair constants. The value of $n$ in the Hill plot for haemoglobin in Fig. 3b is 3.0. The Hill plots for oxygen binding to free $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains are straight lines of slope unity, near the upper asymptote in Fig. 3b. Free subunits have higher oxygen affinity, i.e. lower values of $p_{50}$, than that of the haemoglobin tetramer.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-175.jpg?height=573&width=478&top_left_y=675&top_left_x=633}

\caption{Fig. 3b. Hill plot of the equilibrium curve in Fig. 3a, plotted from the Adair constants. A continuous curve has been drawn in the region over which data were measured and the dashed lines indicate the asymptotes obtained by fitting four constants to the experimental curve. The Hill plot for isolated $\alpha$ - or $\beta$-subunits is nearly coincident with the upper asymptote of the Hill plot for haemoglobin.}
\end{figure}

The relation between $p_{m}$ and $p_{50 .} p_{m}$ is obtained experimentally only from a complete equilibrium curve, whereas $p_{s o}$ is easily determined from limited data. In two cases $p_{m}$ and $p_{50}$ are identical. Firstly, if the intrinsic Adair constants are all equal, or if there is only one binding site,
$$p_{m}=p_{50}=\frac{1}{A^{\prime}} .$$

This therefore applies to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains. Secondly, if the Hill plot is symmetric about the half saturation point,
$$p_{m}=p_{50}=\left(A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime}\right)^{-1 / 4} .$$

This can be shown from the condition for a symmetrical curve (Wyman, 1967), which is that at the $50 \%$ saturation point,
$$[\mathrm{Hb}]=\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}\right] \quad \text { and } \quad\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)\right]=\left[\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}\right] .$$

The first condition is the definition of median ligand activity. The difference between $p_{m}$ and $p_{50}$ will be small in practice even if the Hill plot is not symmetrical. This is illustrated by the work of Tyuma et al. (1973a) who have evaluated $p_{m}$ for some of their data which extends to both asymptotes. Even when a marked asymmetry is visible in the Hill plots, $p_{m}$ and $p_{50}$ differ by less than $9 \%$ or 0.04 in $\log p \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see Table 14 and Fig. 10). For the data in Fig. 3, $\log p_{50}=0.763$ and $\log p_{m}=0.737$. Theoretical discussions lead to simple algebraic results when expressed in terms of $p_{m}$ (Wyman, 1964, 1967; Szabo and Karplus, $1975 \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$ ) and for qualitative discussions $p_{50}$ and $p_{m}$ are equivalent.

\subsection*{2.4. The Association of Co-operative Effects with Changes in Stability}

As shown earlier, the sigmoid oxygen equilibrium curve is the result of the greater values of the intrinsic association constants for oxygen in the later stages of the
reaction. The co-operative interaction between binding sites which is the cause of this effect has become known as haem-haem interaction or homotropic interaction. Its relationship to the observed conformation changes induced in the protein as oxygen molecules bind was first discussed by Wyman and Allen (1951). Further studies of the conformation changes associated with ligation have confirmed their central role in the functional properties of haemoglobin. The following representation of the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, based on the treatment of Wyman (1964) and Noble (1969), emphasizes the relationship betwen the stability of different conformations and the Adair constants of the equilibrium curve.

The haemoglobin molecule is produced by the association of four subunits, $2 \alpha$ and $2 \beta$ into a tetramer. For the initial purposes of this discussion the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits can be regarded as equivalent, each with median ligand activity $p_{s}=1 / A_{s}$. Consider the combination of four deoxy subunits to form deoxyhaemoglobin,
$$4 s \stackrel{\kappa s_{0}}{\longleftrightarrow} \mathrm{Hb} \text { where } K S_{0}=\frac{[\mathrm{Hb}]}{[s]^{4}} .$$
$K S_{0}$ is the overall association constant of four subunits into the tetramer, so that the free energy of association is $\mathrm{RT} \ln \mathrm{KS}_{0}$. The free energy change can be written in terms of one association constant, even though there are many steps in the association. This is analogous to RT $\ln \left(p_{m}^{4}\right)$ being the total free energy change in binding four oxygen molecules to haemoglobin in spite of there being many steps with different microscopic association constants. If the association of subunits to tetramer depends on the state of ligation of the subunits, then $K S_{0}, K S_{1}, \ldots, K S_{4}$ will all be different, e.g.
$$\begin{gathered}
3 s+s \mathrm{O}_{2} \stackrel{K s_{1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{1}, \\
4 s \mathrm{O}_{2} \stackrel{K s_{4}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4} .
\end{gathered}$$

In practice the tetramer is very little dissociated into subunits, but the values of these association constants at different stages of ligation give a useful way of expressing the relative stability of the tetramers and free subunits.

The relation between $p_{m}$ for the tetramer and $p_{s}$ for the free subunit. The result of the association of the subunits into a tetramer is to lower the overall affinity for oxygen relative to the affinity of free subunits. The standard free energy change on binding a ligand to a free subunit is $-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{s}$, whereas the average for binding a ligand to a subunit in the tetramer is $-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{m}$. The free energy changes associated with ligand binding to haemoglobin compared to ligand binding to four free subunits are illustrated in Fig. 4. The diagram on the left, (a), indicates that when no ligands are bound to the deoxy tetramer it is more stable than four free deoxy subunits by $\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{in}} K S_{\mathrm{o}}$. When four ligands are bound, oxyhaemoglobin is more stable than four free oxy subunits by $\mathrm{RT} \ln \mathrm{KS}_{4}$. Thus from Fig. 4a
$$\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{RT} \ln K S_{0}+4 \mathrm{RT} \ln A_{m}=\mathrm{RT} \ln K S_{4}+4 \mathrm{RT} \ln A_{s}, \\
\ln A_{m}=\ln A_{s}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K S_{4}}{K S_{0}}
\end{gathered}$$
or
$$\ln p_{m}=\ln p_{s}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}} .$$

Thus the difference between $p_{m}$ and $p_{s}$ is related to the association constants of oxy and deoxy subunits into the tetramer. The structural features associated with this stability difference may be identifiable. For example, $\mathrm{RT} \ln \boldsymbol{K} \boldsymbol{S}_{\mathbf{0}}$, the free energy change accompanying assembly of deoxy subunits into a tetramer is expected to be related both to any change in tertiary structure between free deoxy subunits and those in a tetramer and to the free energy changes associated with the formation of intersubunit contacts rather than contacts with the solvent. Similarly $\mathbf{R T} \ln \mathbf{K S}_{4}$ will be related to the corresponding structural features for oxy subunits and oxyhaemoglobin. So from a knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin and of

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig. 4. The standard free energy changes of ligand binding to haemoglobin and of association of isolated subunits into tetramers.

The free energy levels drawn under the heading "tetramer" correspond to $\mathrm{Hb}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{2}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}$.}

oxy and deoxy free subunits, a structural explanation might be found for the difference between $p_{m}$ and $p_{s}$.

Co-operativity. From Fig. 4a, looking in turn at the free energy after each stage of ligation of the tetramer, the following equations for the Adair constants can be written down:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\ln A_{1}^{\prime}=\ln A_{5}+\ln K S_{1}-\ln K S_{0} ; & A_{1}^{\prime}=A_{5}\left(K S_{1} / K S_{0}\right), \\
\ln A_{2}^{\prime}=\ln A_{5}+\ln K S_{2}-\ln K S_{1} ; & A_{2}^{\prime}=A_{3}\left(K S_{2} / K S_{1}\right), \\
\ln A_{3}^{\prime}=\ln A_{3}+\ln K S_{3}-\ln K S_{2} ; & A_{3}^{\prime}=A_{3}\left(K S_{3} / K S_{2}\right), \\
\ln A_{4}^{\prime}=\ln A_{3}+\ln K S_{4}-\ln K S_{3} ; & A_{4}^{\prime}=A_{3}\left(K S_{4} / K S_{3}\right) .
\end{array}$$

The individual Adair constants are therefore related to the stability of the partially liganded states. If all the $K S_{i}$ are equal, the Adair constants will all be the same, there will be no co-operativity and the affinity of the tetramer will be the same as that of the subunit. If the ratios of successive $K S_{i}$ 's are all equal, i.e. $K S_{1} / K S_{0}=K S_{2} / K S_{1}$, etc., then again the Adair constants will all be the same, there will be no co-operativity but the association constant of the tetramer for oxygen will be $A_{3} K S_{1} / K S_{0}$. One of these situations must apply to the $\beta_{4}$-tetramer and any abnormal haemoglobin that shows no co-operativity. There will be interaction in oxygen binding, either co-operative or anti-cooperative, if the ratios of successive subunit to tetramer association constants differ.

The difference in free energy of binding between the first and last step, $\Delta F_{I}$ will be positive provided $A_{4}^{\prime}>A_{1}^{\prime}$, i.e. provided
$$\frac{K S_{4}}{K S_{3}}>\frac{K S_{1}}{K S_{0}} .$$

Thus $\Delta F_{I}$ is positive if the change in stability produced by binding the first ligand is greater than the change in stability produced by binding the last ligand. It can be seen to be independent of $\mathrm{KS}_{2}$.

The value of $n$, which measures the overall co-operativity, will depend on the changes of stability at each step. A structural explanation of the stability differences that are related to $\Delta F_{I}$ and the value of $n$ requires a knowledge of the structures of the intermediate states, and therefore cannot be understood directly from the results of three-dimensional structure determinations of fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin. Other properties of haemoglobin provide information on the nature of these intermediate structures. Before discussing differences of conformation in haemoglobin
at different states of ligation, it is interesting to compare the ligand binding properties of haemoglobin to those of free chains.

Comparison of median ligand activities. Table 1 gives some recently determined values for the oxygen affinity of isolated $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits in different conditions. The $\beta_{4}$-tetramers have approximately twice the affinity of $\alpha$-chains. The affinity of a

The median ligand activity of haemoglobin in the conditions of the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3 is given by $\log p_{m}=0.737$. Using expression (2.15), with $\log p_{s}=$ -0.4 from the data (4) of Table 1 and eq. (2.17),
$$0.737=-0.4+\frac{1}{4} \log \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}} .$$

So
$$\frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}=3.5 \times 10^{4} .$$

Thus in these conditions ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.4,0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}$ ), the difference in free energy between free deoxy subunits and the deoxy tetramer differs from that between free oxy subunits and the oxy tetramer by about 6.4 kcal per mole. Noble (1969) and Talbot et al. (1971) showed that in similar solution conditions, the value of ( $K S_{0} / K S_{4}$ ), and therefore of $K S_{4}$, was almost independent of the particular ligand binding to haemoglobin, whether oxygen, carbon monoxide or a large ligand like tertiary butyl isocyanide. It has been well established for a long time that on ligation haemoglobin undergoes a large change in quaternary structure, i.e. the arrangement of the four subunits in the tetramer (Cullis et al., 1962; Muirhead and Perutz, 1963), and that all liganded haemoglobins crystallize in the same quaternary structure (Perutz, 1953). This suggests that the constancy of $K S_{4}$ results from the free energy difference between liganded subunits and the liganded tetramer being wholly associated with the quaternary structure.

The value of $K S_{4}$ also has a similar value for oxidized haemoglobin. In oxidation the ferrous iron $\mathrm{Fe}^{++}$becomes ferric $\mathrm{Fe}^{+++}$. The fractional oxidation is defined as
$$\overline{\mathbf{Y}}=\frac{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} .$$

The plot of $\bar{Y}$ against the measured potential $E_{h}$ is analogous to a plot of $\bar{Y}$ against $\log p$ in the case of oxygenation, except for a scale factor such that $\log p=E_{h}(F / 2.3 \mathrm{RT})$ (see Antonini and Brunori, 1971). $E_{m}$ is analogous to $\log p_{m}$, being the potential at which the number of fully oxidized molecules is the same as the number of unligated ferrous molecules. The oxidation-reduction potentials $E_{\alpha}$ and $E_{\beta}$ of the isolated $\alpha$-and $\beta$-chains and $E_{1 / 2}$ of haemoglobin have been measured by Banerjee and Cassoly (1969a). At pH 7.0 and $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in phosphate buffer, they find $E_{\alpha}=0.052 \mathrm{~V}, E_{\beta}=0.113 \mathrm{~V}$ and $E_{m} \approx E_{1 / 2}=0.170 \mathrm{~V}$. The equivalent $\log p$ values, taking the factor $(F / 2.3 \mathrm{RT})=18.15$ at $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, are
$$\log p_{\alpha}=0.94, \quad \log p_{\beta}=2.04, \quad \log p_{m}=3.08$$

Substituting these values in (2.15),
$$\log \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}=6.4, \quad \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}=2.5 \times 10^{6} .$$

For oxygenation at pH 7.0 in phosphate buffer, $\log p_{m}=1.0$ (Kilmartin and Hewitt, 1971) which from eq. (2.15) gives
$$\log \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}=5.6, \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}=4 \times 10^{5}$$

Therefore in the same buffer conditions $K S_{4}$ is similar for oxygenated and oxidized haemoglobin, differing by a factor of only 6 , whereas $K S_{0}$ differs from $K S_{4}$ by a factor $10^{6}$.

Comparison of the first and last steps in ligand binding to haemoglobin with binding to isolated subunits. The equilibrium constants for the first and last stage in oxygen binding to haemoglobin are compared with those for oxygen binding to a non-interacting mixture of free chains in Table 2. If $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits in the haemoglobin tetramer differ in their oxygen binding properties, the first and last Adair constants are given by
$$\begin{gathered}
A_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{1 \alpha}+A_{1 \beta}\right) \\
1 / A_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1 / A_{4 \alpha}+1 / A_{4 \beta}\right)
\end{gathered}$$
where $A_{1 \alpha}$ is the intrinsic association constant for binding the first oxygen to an $\alpha$-chain of deoxyhaemoglobin, $1 / A_{4 \alpha}$ is the intrinsic dissociation constant for losing the first oxygen from an $\alpha$-chain of oxyhaemoglobin, and $A_{1 \beta}$ and $1 / A_{4 \beta}$ are the corresponding constants for the $\beta$-chains. A non-interacting mixture of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in equal proportions would have association constants for the first and last oxygens given by
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{1 s} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(A_{\alpha}+A_{\beta}\right) \\
1 / A_{4 s} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(1 / A_{\alpha}+1 / A_{\beta}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Table 2 shows that $A_{1}^{\prime}$ is less than $A_{1 s}$ by a factor of 100 to 500 , implying that both $A_{1 \alpha}$ and $A_{1 \beta}$ are smaller than $A_{\alpha}$ and $A_{\beta}$. In other words, the association of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains into a tetramer has greatly lowered the affinity of the subunits for the first oxygen molecule. $A_{4}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4 s}$, however, are the same within a factor of 2 or 3, showing that both $A_{4 \alpha}$ and $A_{4 \beta}$ are similar to or greater than $A_{\alpha}$ and $A_{\beta}$.

haemoglobin is approximately the same as the constant for ligand binding to free subunits, $K S_{3}$ must be approximately the same as $K S_{4}$ as can be seen from Fig. 4a. This suggests that $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}$ may also have the same quaternary structure as fully liganded haemoglobins. In other words, the quaternary structure change observed in oxygenation has already taken place for normal haemoglobin when three ligands are bound.

Comparison of the kinetic constants for the first and last ligand binding to haemoglobin with those for binding to free chains shows a similar relationship to that just seen for the equilibrium constants. The equilibrium of isolated chains with oxygen is described by the equations
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\alpha+\mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{\alpha}}{\stackrel{k_{\alpha}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \alpha \mathrm{O}_{2} & \text { where } & \frac{k_{\alpha}^{\prime}}{k_{\alpha}}=A_{\alpha} \\
\beta+\mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{\beta}}{\stackrel{k_{\beta}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \beta \mathrm{O}_{2} & \frac{k_{\beta}^{\prime}}{k_{\beta}}=A_{\beta}
\end{array}$$
$k^{\prime}$ denotes the rate constant for the forward reaction and $k$ the rate constant for the backward reaction.

The binding of oxygen to haemoglobin cannot necessarily be described by eight kinetic constants related to the Adair equilibrium constants by the relation
$$A_{i}^{\prime}=\frac{k_{i}^{\prime}}{k_{i}}$$

Only in the special case where all forms of haemoglobin having a certain number of ligands bound are exactly equivalent will this be true. In practice the Adair scheme of eight kinetic constants has been found adequate to describe the kinetics of oxygen binding to haemoglobin although differences in rate constants for the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits have now been detected (Olson et al., 1971; Gibson, 1973a).

The "on" constant $k_{4}^{\prime}$ and the "off" constant $k_{4}$ for the last step in ligand binding can be determined separately from the other constants by special techniques. $k_{4}^{\prime}$ is obtained by studying the recombination of haemoglobin with ligand after some of the ligands have been removed from fully saturated haemoglobin by flash photolysis. Gibson (1959) first found the existence of "rapid" haemoglobin by this method. The haemoglobin resulting from flash photolysis recombines with carbon monoxide about 10 times faster than normal deoxyhaemoglobin combines with carbon monoxide. Gibson and Parkhurst (1968), Antonini et al. (1972), Schmelzer et al. (1972) have shown that the rapid form of haemoglobin is partly dimeric and partly a rapidly reacting tetramer which must be a partially saturated intermediate in the ligation of haemoglobin. The rate of reaction of "rapid" haemoglobin is believed to be that of the last step in normal ligation, $k_{4}^{\prime}$. The "off" constant $k_{4}$ for oxygen dissociation can be determined from the replacement reaction of oxygen with carbon monoxide in the presence of dithionite (Gibson and Roughton, 1959). Gibson (1970) has determined the eight constants that describe the complete oxygen uptake curve by a curve-fitting procedure incorporating the separately determined values of $k_{4}$ and $k_{4}^{\prime}$. Table 3 compares the intrinsic "on" ( $k^{\prime}$ ) and "off" ( $k$ ) constants for the first and last binding step in oxygenation of haemoglobin with the "on" and "off" constants for oxygen binding to free chains. It can be seen that the last oxygen to bind to haemoglobin has quite similar kinetic constants to those of free chains. The rate constants differ by at most a factor of 2 . For the first oxygen to bind to haemoglobin, however, the "on" rate constant is smaller by a factor of about 10 than the "on" constant to free chains, and the "off" rate constant is very much higher than the free chains constant. Comparison of the last stage in the binding of $n$-butyl isocyanide ( n -BIC) to haemoglobin with the binding to isolated $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains, also given in Table 3, shows the same pattern as in oxygen binding. The rate constants again differ by no more than a factor of 2 .

Conclusions from the comparison of ligand binding to haemoglobin and to free chains. The following conclusions based on those of Noble (1969) are drawn from the preceding discussion. The overall affinity of haemoglobin is lowered relative to free

chains by association into the tetramer. The affinity for the first ligand to bind to haemoglobin is greatly lowered relative to free chains, which implies that favourable contacts made between the deoxy subunits result in conformation changes in the subunits that result in low affinity. The affinity and the kinetic constants for the last ligand to bind to haemoglobin are very similar to those of free chains, which has two implications. Firstly, the subunit contacts at this stage of ligation are not altering the ligand binding properties. Secondly, the stability relative to free chains is the same with either three or four ligands bound, suggesting that the quaternary structure when three ligands are bound is probably the same as that of the fully liganded structure.

The structural interpretation of the lowered affinity of deoxyhaemoglobin relative to free chains and how the change in quaternary structure is brought about will be discussed later.

\subsection*{2.6. Factors that Affect the Oxygen Equilibrium Curve}

The oxygen equilibrium properties of haemoglobin are altered by changes in concentration of protons (Wyman, 1939) and salts (Antonini et al., 1962), in particular by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) (Benesch and Benesch, 1967; Chanutin and Curnish, 1967). The oxygen equilibrium is also different for haemoglobins with mutations or chemical modifications. The relationship between the changes in oxygen binding properties and free energy differences is discussed below, the treatment being based on that of Wyman (1948, 1964, 1965, 1967) and being similar to that of Szabo and Karplus (1975a, b).

\subsection*{2.6.1. Abnormal haemoglobins}

Consider an abnormal haemoglobin represented by the energy diagram in Fig. 4b. Suppose that the abnormality alters the intrinsic affinity of a free subunit, so that its median ligand activity is $A_{s}^{*}$, and the association constants of the oxy and deoxy forms of the tetramer are $\mathrm{KS}_{4}^{*}$ and $\mathrm{KS}_{6}^{*}$. Then from eq. (2.15)
$$\ln p_{m}^{*}=\ln p_{s}^{*}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K S_{0}^{*}}{K S_{4}^{*}} .$$

The difference in $\log p_{m}$ between an abnormal and normal haemoglobin, $\Delta \log p_{m}$, is therefore given by
$$\Delta \log p_{m}=\Delta \log p_{s}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\log \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}-\log \frac{K S_{\%}^{*}}{K S_{4}^{*}}\right) .$$
$\Delta \log p_{m}$ is made up of a term due to the difference in intrinsic affinity of the free subunit
and a term due to the altered association constants of the subunits to tetramers between the two systems.
$$\mathrm{RT}\left(\ln \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}-\ln \frac{K S_{6}^{*}}{K S_{4}^{*}}\right)$$
is the difference of two free energy differences, $\mathrm{RT} \ln K S_{0} / K S_{4}$ being the difference between the free energy of deoxy subunits in a deoxy tetramer and the free energy of oxy subunits in an oxy tetramer, $\mathrm{RT} \ln K S_{0}^{*} / K S_{4}^{*}$ being the corresponding difference for the abnormal haemoglobin. Thus the expression for $\Delta \log p_{m}$ between an abnormal and normal haemoglobin involves terms due to the intrinsic affinity of the free subunits and terms associated with the stability of these subunits in fully liganded and in deoxy tetramers. It is quite independent of the stability of the intermediate states. From Fig. $4 a, b$ it can be seen that the stability changes between the normal and abnormal systems result in different stabilities for the deoxy tetramers and different stabilities for the oxy tetramers. The two halves of the diagram have been drawn with the unliganded free subunits at arbitrarily fixed energy levels since it is only the difference between these stability differences that is meaningful. The three-dimensional structures of normal and abnormal haemoglobins may show why the stability of the abnormal deoxy structure is altered relative to the normal deoxy structure to a different extent from that of the abnormal oxy structure relative to the normal oxy structure. This would give a structural understanding of the difference in $p_{m}$.

The effect on co-operativity, as seen in altered values of $n$ and $\Delta F_{I}$, will depend on changes in the stability of the partially liganded states which are not observable by X-ray techniques.

\subsection*{2.6.2. Heterotropic interactions}

Mutations of the protein have a permanent effect on the subunit affinity $p_{s}$ and the association constants to the tetramer. The effect of a ligand producing heterotropic interactions, however, varies with the concentration of the ligand in solution. A simple case will be considered first, then the more general results given. Let $X$ denote the ligand and let $x$ be its concentration.

When there is one binding site for the ligand per tetramer, and the free subunit does not bind $X$, the equilibrium between subunits, tetramer and $X$ is given by
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-182.jpg?height=189&width=828&top_left_y=1578&top_left_x=458)

The association constant for subunits to tetramer in the presence of $X$ is therefore
$$K S_{0}^{*}=\frac{[H b]+[H b X]}{[s]^{4}}=K S_{0}\left(1+B_{0} x\right) .$$

Similarly $K S_{4}^{*}=K S_{4}\left(1+B_{4} x\right)$ where $B_{4}$ is the association constant of $X$ to $H b\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}$. If $x$ is buffered, or effectively constant because it is in large excess, $x$ is the same at all stages of ligation. The following discussion assumes this is the case. From (2.15), if $\ln p_{m x}$ denotes the value in the presence of $X$ and $\ln p_{m}$ the value in its absence
$$\begin{aligned}
\ln p_{m x} & =\ln p_{s}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K S_{0}\left(1+B_{0} x\right)}{K S_{4}\left(1+B_{4} x\right)} \\
\ln p_{m} & =\ln p_{s}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}} \text { from (2.15), }
\end{aligned}$$
so
$$\ln p_{m x}=\ln p_{m}+\frac{1}{4}\left[\ln \left(1+B_{0} x\right)-\ln \left(1+B_{4} x\right)\right] .$$

Therefore the change in oxygen affinity, $\Delta \ln p_{m}$, is related to the association constants of $X$ to deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin and is independent of the binding of $X$ to the intermediate structures provided $x$ is buffered or effectively constant.

By analogy with eqs. (2.16) the Adair constants are given by
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\ln A_{1 x}^{\prime}=\ln A_{3}+\ln K S_{1}\left(1+B_{1} x\right)-\ln K S_{0}\left(1+B_{0} x\right), \\
\ln A_{1 x}^{\prime}=\ln A_{1}^{\prime}+\left[\ln \left(1+B_{1} x\right)-\ln \left(1+B_{0} x\right)\right] ; & A_{1 x}^{\prime}=A_{1}^{\prime} \frac{\left(1+B_{1} x\right)}{\left(1+B_{0} x\right)}, \\
\ln A_{2 x}^{\prime}=\cdots, & A_{2 x}^{\prime}=A_{2}^{\prime} \frac{\left(1+B_{2} x\right)}{\left(1+B_{1} x\right)}, \\
\ln A_{3 x}^{\prime}=\cdots, & A_{3 x}^{\prime}=A_{3}^{\prime} \frac{\left(1+B_{3} x\right)}{\left(1+B_{2} x\right)}, \\
\ln A_{4 x}^{\prime}=\ln A_{4}^{\prime}+\left[\ln \left(1+B_{4} x\right)-\ln \left(1+B_{3} x\right)\right] ; & A_{4 x}^{\prime}=A_{4}^{\prime} \frac{\left(1+B_{4} x\right)}{\left(1+B_{3} x\right)} .
\end{array}$$

This shows that the differences in co-operativity, i.e. differences in the ratios of the Adair constants, are related to the binding constants of $X$ to the intermediate structures.

The number of molecules, $\Delta X_{1}$, of bound $X$ released per mole haemoglobin in the first ligation step is
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta X_{1} & =\frac{[H b X]}{[H b]+[H b X]}-\frac{\left[H b\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right) X\right]}{\left[H b\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)\right]+\left[H b\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right) X\right]}, \\
\Delta X_{1} & =\frac{B_{0} x}{1+B_{0} x}-\frac{B_{4} x}{1+B_{4} x} \\
& =-\frac{d \ln A_{1 x}^{\prime}}{d \ln x}
\end{aligned}$$
as can be shown by differentiating (2.20). Similarly for successive ligation steps,
$$\Delta X_{i}=-\frac{d \ln A_{i x}^{\prime}}{d \ln x} .$$

Thus some $X$ is released at each stage in ligand binding if the corresponding Adair constant changes with concentration $x$. Conversely, no $X$ is released at any stage for which the Adair constant is independent of $x$. Also $X$ will be released uniformly with ligation only if all the Adair constants depend on $x$ in the same way.

The total number of moles of bound $X$ released per mole haemoglobin,
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta X & =\sum_{i=1}^{4} \Delta X_{i} \\
& =4 \frac{d \ln p_{m x}}{d \ln x} \quad \text { since } \quad p_{m x}=\frac{1}{A_{1 x}^{\prime} A_{2 x}^{\prime} A_{3 x}^{\prime} A_{4 x}^{\prime}} \\
\frac{\Delta X}{4} & =\frac{d \ln p_{m x}}{d \ln x}
\end{aligned}$$

This is a linkage relation (Wyman, 1964) for the case when one mole $X$ binds per mole tetramer of haemoglobin, as is the case for the binding of organic phosphates.

The general linkage relations. In general there will be many sites on the protein for binding a ligand $X$ and the sites may interact so that the binding of $X$ is co-operative or anti-cooperative. For example, haemoglobin binds protons at many sites and the general relations that will be derived below will be applicable to this case.

If there are $q$ sites per tetramer for binding $X$ and if the free subunits do not bind $X$, the equilibrium between subunits, deoxy tetramer and $X$ can be represented by
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-183.jpg?height=149&width=886&top_left_y=2313&top_left_x=468)

The binding of $q$ molecules of $X$ to haemoglobin is analogous to the binding of four oxygen molecules which was considered in section 2.1. Equations (2.4) and (2.3)
expressed the average number, $Y$, of bound oxygen molecules per haemoglobin molecule. If a function $\phi(p)$ is defined by the equation
$$\phi(p)=\left(1+A_{1} p+A_{1} A_{2} p^{2}+A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} p^{3}+A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} p^{4}\right)$$
then it can be seen that
$$Y=\frac{d \log \phi(p)}{d \log p}$$
$\phi(p)$ is the binding polynomial introduced by Wyman (1965). In a similar way the binding polynomial for the binding of $X$ to deoxyhaemoglobin can be defined by
$$\phi_{0}(x)=\left(1+B_{01} x+B_{01} B_{02} x^{2}+\cdots+B_{01} B_{02} \ldots B_{0 q} x^{q}\right)$$
where the $B_{0 i}$ are the binding constants of $X$ to the $q$ sites on deoxyhaemoglobin and are the analogues of the Adair constants $A_{i}$ for binding oxygen to haemoglobin. The number of bound molecules of $X$ per deoxyhaemoglobin molecule, $X_{0}$, is thus
$$X_{0}=\frac{d \log \phi_{0}(x)}{d \log x}$$

If the binding constants for $X$ depend on the state of oxygenation of haemoglobin, $i$, there will be different binding polynomials for each stage of oxygenation, denoted by $\phi_{i}(x)$, involving the different binding constants $B_{i j}$.

The total concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin molecules including molecules with any number of bound $X$ molecules is therefore $[\mathrm{Hb}] \times \phi_{0}(x)$. The association constant of deoxy subunits to deoxy tetramer in the presence of $X$ is
$$\begin{aligned}
K S_{\delta}^{*} & =\frac{[H b] \times \phi_{0}(x)}{[s]^{4}} \\
& =K S_{0} \times \phi_{0}(x)
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly $K S^{*}=K S_{i} \times \phi_{i}(x)$, for the other states of oxygenation.
The expression for $\log p_{m x}$. From equation (2.15),
$$\log p_{m x}=\log p_{m}+\frac{1}{4} \log \frac{K S_{8}^{*}}{K S_{4}^{*}}$$

So
$$\log p_{m x}=\log p_{m}+\frac{1}{4}\left[\log \phi_{0}(x)-\log \phi_{4}(x)\right]$$

This equation shows that if $x$ is buffered, $\log p_{m x}$ depends only on the binding constants of $X$ to fully oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin and is independent of the binding of $X$ to intermediate structures.

The expression for release of ligand $X$. The Adair constants for oxygen binding in the presence of $X$ will be given by eq. (2.16), substituting the altered values of $K S_{i}^{*}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\log A_{i x}^{\prime} & =\log A_{s}+\log \left[K S_{i} \times \phi_{i}(x)\right]-\log \left[K S_{i-1} \times \phi_{i-1}(x)\right] \\
& =\log A_{i}^{\prime}+\log \phi_{i}(x)-\log \phi_{i-1}(x)
\end{aligned}$$
or
$$A_{i x}^{\prime}=A_{i}^{\prime} \times \frac{\phi_{i}(x)}{\phi_{i-1}(x)}$$

By analogy with eq. (2.24), the average number of bound $X$ molecules per tetramer of haemoglobin when the state of oxygenation is $i$ is
$$X_{i}=\frac{d \log \phi_{i}(x)}{d \log x}$$

Therefore the number of molecules of $X$ released at each stage of oxygenation,
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta X_{i} & =X_{i-1}-X_{i} \\
& =\frac{d \log \phi_{i-1}(x)}{d \log x}-\frac{d \log \phi_{i}(x)}{d \log x}
\end{aligned}$$

By differentiating eq. (2.26)
$$\Delta X_{i}=-\frac{d \log A_{i x}^{\prime}}{d \log x}$$

This is the general expression for release of $X$ at each stage of ligation. $\Delta X$, the total number of molecules of $X$ released on oxygenation per tetramer, is the sum of the $\Delta X_{i}$,
$$\Delta X=-\frac{d \log A_{1 x}^{\prime} A_{2 x}^{\prime} A_{3 x}^{\prime} A_{4 x}^{\prime}}{d \log x} .$$

So by the definition of $p_{m x}$
$$\Delta X=\frac{4 d \log p_{\operatorname{mx}}}{d \log x} .$$

If there are $q$ sites for $X, \Delta \bar{X}$, the change in fractional saturation of the $X$ binding sites on oxygenation is given by
$$\Delta \bar{X}=\frac{4}{q} \frac{d \log p_{m x}}{d \log x} .$$

This general form of linkage equation applies to cases like proton binding when there are many binding sites which may interact with each other. Equations (2.25) and (2.29) show the general relations between $\log p_{m x}$ and the buffered concentration of ligand $X$ in solution. These expressions involve only the binding constants of $X$ to deoxy and fully oxygenated haemoglobin and are therefore independent of the binding of $X$ to intermediate states.

A structural explanation of the effect of protons on the oxygen affinity $p_{m}$ should therefore be possible from a knowledge of the structures of deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin.

The expression when the $q$ binding sites for $X$ are non-interacting. If there is no interaction between the $q$ binding sites for $X$ on the tetramer, each binding site will have an independent microscopic association constant. Let $Q_{i j}$ denote the binding constant for $X$ to the $j$ th site on haemoglobin when there are $i$ oxygen molecules bound. In this case the binding polynomials $\phi_{i}(x)$ can be factorized and can be written
$$\phi_{1}(x)=\left(1+Q_{11} x\right)\left(1+Q_{12} x\right) \ldots\left(1+Q_{1 q} x\right),$$
where the relationships between the constants $Q_{i j}$ and the constants $B_{i j}$ of the general polynomial can be seen by equating the coefficients of powers of $x$.

The expression for $\log p_{m x}$ then becomes, from (2.25),
$$\log p_{m x}=\log p_{m}+\frac{1}{4} \sum_{j=1}^{q}\left[\log \left(1+Q_{0 j} x\right)-\log \left(1+Q_{4 j} x\right)\right] .$$

The total release of $X$ can be expressed as a summation over the amount of $X$ released independently from each of the $j$ sites,
$$\Delta X=\sum_{j=1}^{q} \Delta X_{j} \quad \text { where } \quad \Delta X_{j}=\frac{d}{d \log x} \log \left(\frac{1+Q_{0 j} x}{1+Q_{4 j} x}\right) .$$

Changes in co-operativity with change in concentration of $X$. As discussed in section 2.4, differences in co-operativity are associated with differences in the relative stabilities of the partially liganded states. When a ligand involved in heterotropic interactions binds to haemoglobin, the Adair constants are multiplied by terms involving the concentration of the ligand (eq. (2.26)). If all the Adair constants are multiplied by the same factor, their ratios and therefore the co-operativity will remain the same, i.e. the shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve will be unaltered. In this case the equilibrium curve will just be shifted parallel to the $\log p$ axis. If the Adair constants are multiplied by different factors, the co-operativity and the shape of the equilibrium curve must change. An understanding of these changes in co-operativity will require an understanding of the structure of the partially oxygenated states.

The condition for linearity of release of $X$ with oxygen binding.
$$\Delta X_{i}=-\frac{d \log A_{i x}^{\prime}}{d \log x} \quad \text { from eq.(2.27). }$$

Release of $X$ is the same at all stages of oxygen binding if the Adair constants all depend on the concentration of $X$ in the same way, i.e. they have the same concentration dependent term as a multiplier. As just discussed above, this is the condition for invariance of shape of the equilibrium curves as the concentration of $X$ varies. Linearity of release of $X$ and invariance of shape of the equilibrium curves with change in concentration of $X$ are therefore thermodynamic consequences of each other, or in Wyman's terminology they are linked.

One particularly simple example in which release of $X$ is exactly linear with oxygenation is the case when each subunit within the tetramer releases ligand only due to changes in tertiary structure depending on its own state of oxygenation, independently of the state of oxygenation of the other subunits. Then each Adair constant has a multiplying term
$$\left(\frac{1+Q_{s 1} x}{1+Q_{s 0} x}\right)$$
where $Q_{s 0}$ is the binding constant of $X$ to the deoxy subunit and $Q_{s 1}$ the binding constant to the oxy subunit. The release of $X$ at each stage of oxygenation is
$$\Delta X_{i}=\frac{d}{d \log x} \log \left(\frac{1+Q_{s 1} x}{1+Q_{s 0} x}\right)=\frac{Q_{s 0} x}{1+Q_{s 0} x}-\frac{Q_{s 1} x}{1+Q_{s 1} x}$$
and the total release is $4 \Delta X_{i}$.
The discussion in section 2.6 has emphasized that from observations of the three-dimensional structures of fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin determined by X-ray analysis, an understanding of changes in oxygen affinity due to abnormalities in the protein or due to the presence of ligands producing heterotropic interactions may be found. Changes in co-operativity, however, require an understanding of intermediate states that cannot be observed by X-ray techniques. It will be useful to consider these two aspects of altered function in two stages, those aspects that might be explained in terms of the known structures and those that will require some model of the intermediate structures for their interpretation. The following section will describe the structures of fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin. The understanding they provide of some aspects of heterotropic interaction and the properties of abnormal haemoglobins will be discussed in sections 4 and 5.

\section*{3. THE STRUCTURE OF HAEMOGLOBIN}

The three-dimensional structure of haemoglobin has been studied by the methods of X-ray crystallography. From low resolution studies, the haemoglobin molecule was shown to comprise two pairs of identical subunits, the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains (Cullis et al., 1962). The structure of each subunit is similar to that of the monomeric respiratory protein myoglobin (Kendrew et al., 1961). The four subunits are arranged tetrahedrally and the structure is such that the four haem groups, the binding sites for oxygen, are far apart, each in a separate pocket on the surface of the molecule. The arrangement of the four subunits in the haemoglobin tetramer is different in deoxygenated and liganded haemoglobin (Muirhead and Perutz, 1963), explaining Haurowitz's observation (1938) that crystals of deoxyhaemoglobin dissolve on exposure to air and that oxyhaemoglobin crystals with a different morphology precipitate from the solution. Electron density maps have now been made at high resolution $(\sim 2.8 \AA)$ for horse methaemoglobin (i.e. haemoglobin with the iron atoms in the ferric state with water molecules as haem ligands) and for horse and human deoxyhaemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1968a, 1968b; Bolton and Perutz, 1970; Muirhead and Greer, 1970; Arnone et al., 1975). With the aid
of the amino acid sequences of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-polypeptide chains, which have been determined for both horse and human haemoglobin (see Dayhoff, 1973) atomic models of the structures have been built from the electron density maps. The accuracy of the latest models is such that from the better determined regions of the maps, for example the polypeptide backbone in helical regions and the internal side chains, the atoms, except for hydrogens, can be positioned to within $0.5 \AA$. The surface side chains and some parts of the structure that are ill defined in the maps are positioned less well (McLachlan and Fermi, 1975). The following sections will discuss briefly those aspects of the structures of deoxy and liganded haemoglobin that are important in the present understanding of haemoglobin function.

\subsection*{3.1. The Structure of Haem Groups}

Oxygen and other ligands bind to haemoglobin at the four haem groups. The haem group in myoglobin and haemoglobin is iron protoporphyrin IX, a member of a large class of metallo-porphyrins whose stereochemistry has been reviewed by Hoard (1971). The shape of the porphyrin ring is illustrated in Fig. 5, and for iron porphyrins the

\begin{figure}

\caption{FIG. 5. Schematic diagram of the haem group, iron protoporphyrin IX. The distance from the centre of the ring to the pyrrole nitrogens is $2.01 \AA$, and the iron atom lies in the plane of the ring or above it, depending on its valency and spin state. In haemoglobin, the propionate side chains, $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{COO}^{-}$, are on the surface of the molecule and the haem groups are enclosed in hydrophobic pockets formed by the polypeptide chains.}
\end{figure}
distance from the centre of the ring to the four pyrrole nitrogens is about $2.01 \AA$. The distance varies slightly if the porphyrin is domed or puckered into a non-planar configuration, which can happen very easily. Iron porphyrins are of four types, determined by the spectroscopic ground state, either high spin or low spin, and the valency of the iron atom, either ferrous or ferric.

In liganded haemoglobin and myoglobin the iron atom is octahedrally coordinated, being bonded to the four pyrrole nitrogens of the porphyrin, to the imidazole of the haem-linked histidine residue on the polypeptide chain and to the haem ligand. In the deoxygenated form of the structures there is no sixth bond to the iron atom. The valency and spin state of the iron depend on the haem ligand. Table 4 gives the valency, spin and measured magnetic moment of the haem group when various ligands are in the sixth coordination position. From the table it can be seen that alkaline methaemoglobin has a magnetic moment intermediate between the values for the high and low spin ferric iron atom. This has been shown to be due to the existence of a thermal equilibrium between the high and low spin forms (George et al., 1961).

The effective radius of the iron atom depends on its valency and spin state. In low spin ferrous or ferric porphyrins the iron atom is small enough to fit in the plane of the four nitrogens, whereas in high spin ferric and in high spin ferrous porphyrins, the iron atom must lie out of the plane of the four nitrogens. The distance of the iron atom from the plane of the nitrogens has been determined very accurately from crystallographic studies of some small iron-porphyrin complexes. The iron atom is in the plane for the

For haem groups in protein molecules, the resolution of the X-ray studies is insufficient to determine the position of the four pyrrole nitrogens, and only the distance of the iron atom from the mean plane of the whole porphyrin ring can be estimated. In Table 5 some of the available data on the position of the iron atom relative to the plane of the porphyrin ring is given for the haem proteins. Where relevant the distance of the imidazole nitrogen of the proximal histidine to the plane of the porphyrin ring is also given. Hoard (1966) suggested that the movement of the ferrous iron atom consequent on its change of spin state when a deoxy haem group combined with oxygen would necessitate changes in tertiary structure of the protein part of the subunit to which the iron was attached. He also suggested that in the case of haemoglobin these changes in the protein structure consequent on the movement of the iron atom might be the starting point for a mechanism that would account for the co-operative interactions in haemoglobin. As will be seen later, this idea is now incorporated in the present understanding of co-operativity in haemoglobin, and the position of the iron atom plays an important role in the function of haemoglobin.

\subsection*{3.2. The Structure of Subunits}

Although there are differences in amino acid sequence between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains of haemoglobin, erythrocruorin and myoglobin, the polypeptide chains fold around the haem groups to give a very similar tertiary structure in each case, whether the chains are liganded or not. The haem group is situated in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the polypeptide chain. Comparison of the sequences of different mammalian species show that all but one of the amino acids in contact with the $\alpha$-haem group are invariant and all but two in contact with the $\beta$-haem group (Perutz et al., 1968b).

Figure 6 illustrates the tertiary structure of a subunit and shows the conventional labelling of the $\alpha$-helical segments of the structure. The $\alpha$-chains of haemoglobin contain 141 residues each, compared to 153 in myoglobin. Six of the missing residues are from the D-helix which is absent in the $\alpha$-chain, and the other six are at the carboxyl end of the chain (Perutz et al., 1968b). The $\beta$-chains contain 146 residues each and compared to myoglobin they contain one extra residue in the NA segment, two fewer in the AB corner and six fewer at the C terminus.

The structure of free subunits. Since the isolated $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits of haemoglobin have not been studied by X-ray analysis, the structures of sperm-whale myoglobin (Kendrew et al., 1961) and the insect haemoglobin erythrocruorin (Huber et al., 1970), which is also monomeric, can be used to discuss the structural features of single subunits, and the changes in structure seen when the ligand at the haem group changes. Erythrocruorin has been studied in the met, deoxy and carbonmonoxy forms at $2.5 \AA$ resolution, whilst myoglobin has been studied in the met form to $2.0 \AA$ resolution and in the azide, met and deoxy forms.

In meterythrocruorin, the iron atom lies $0.3 \AA$ from the plane defined by the centres of the four pyrrole rings. As the atoms of the porphyrin are not resolved, the puckering of the haem group was assumed to be the same as that in the ferric porphyrin complex studied by Hoard et al. (1965). The iron atom is out of the plane towards the haem-linked histidine, whilst the water molecule that is the haem ligand in aquomethaemoglobin is on the other side of the haem group, $1.9 \AA$ from the iron atom. In sperm-whale myoglobin, the iron atom lies $0.42 \AA$ out of the mean plane of the porphyrin ring (Takano, 1975).

Differences in tertiary structure between the met and deoxy forms have not been seen at the resolution of published X-ray studies. In a structural comparison of deoxymyoglobin with aquometmyoglobin at $2.8 \AA$ resolution, the water molecule that is the ligand in aquomet was absent in deoxy but no conformation changes at the haem could be seen (Nobbs et al., 1966). Similar conclusions were drawn from the structural comparison of deoxy and meterythrocruorin at $2.5 \AA$ resolution, where again the water

molecule was absent in deoxy and there was no indication of change in the haem group or the haem pocket (Huber et al., 1970). As seen in Table 5, very little change in position of the iron atom is expected between high spin ferric and high spin ferrous haems in the protein structures if they are like the small molecule complexes that have been studied at atomic resolution. Preliminary results of a reinvestigation of differences between met and deoxymyoglobin at $2.0 \AA$ resolution show a small difference in the position of the iron atom and the haem-linked histidine (T. Takano, personal communication).

Differences in tertiary structure between met and azidemet myoglobin were studied by Stryer et al. (1964). At $2.0 \AA$ resolution the azide ion could be seen to have replaced the water molecule but the structure seemed entirely unaffected by the binding of azide, except for the release of a sulphate ion bound to the protein about $9.0 \AA$ away from the haem. The change in spin state of the ferric iron atom did not appear to be accompanied by a movement of the iron atom relative to the plane of the porphyrin ring. In a later study of a low spin ferric globin, that of lamprey cyanomet haemoglobin, the iron atom was seen to be in the plane of the haem group (Hendrickson et al., 1973) as expected from the result for the small molecule complex (A) (Table 5).

Differences in tertiary structure between met and low spin ferrous forms were not seen in a study of oxymyoglobin at $2.8 \AA$ resolution (Watson and Nobbs, 1968). In a later study at $2.5 \AA$ resolution of the differences between met and carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin (Huber et al., 1970) changes in structure were seen. The carbon monoxide molecule replacing the water molecule could be positioned by a peak in the electron
density inclined to the haem plane. The haem group appeared more planar and was further into the haem pocket. Isoleucine E11, which is a haem contact residue on the same side of the haem group as the binding site for ligand, had shifted by $0.4 \AA$ to avoid close contact with the carbon monoxide molecule. The iron atom moved by a total of $0.2 \AA$ but not in a direction perpendicular to the haem plane. The component of the shift of the iron towards the haem group combined with the movement of the pyrrole rings that makes the haem more planar brings the iron atom very nearly coplanar with the haem group. Thus the stereochemistry of the haem group predicted from the results of atomic resolution studies of porphyrin complexes appears to apply to carbon monoxide binding to deoxy-erythrocruorin. No movement of the imidazole of the proximal histidine that attaches the iron atom to the protein was detectable although the iron had moved by $0.2 \AA$. In other regions of the structure specific changes could not be identified but Huber et al. suggest that the change in lattice constant of the crystals between deoxy and carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin shows that structural changes near the haem group are transmitted to some region of the molecular surface. There was no difference in lattice constant between the deoxy and met forms.

The differences of tertiary structure between deoxy-erythrocruorin and carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin can be taken as an indication of the tertiary structure changes that would be induced by the combination of an isolated deoxy subunit of haemoglobin with a ligand that changes the iron to a low spin state. The study of erythrocruorin indicates that very little tertiary structure change occurs when an isolated deoxy subunit combines with a ligand that leaves the iron atom in a high spin state.

Spectral differences associated with different ligands at the haem. Changes in the electronic absorption spectrum from the haem groups occur on ligation of the free subunits and myoglobin. Deoxy chains have an absorption spectrum characterized by a single broad and asymmetrical band in the visible region and a band known as the Soret band in the near ultraviolet. Also in the ultraviolet and the near-infrared region the absorption spectrum shows specific features. On oxygenation or combination with other ligands there are changes in the absorption spectrum in both the visible and Soret bands. For details of the deoxy spectra and the changes with different ligands the reader is referred to the recent book by van Assendelft (1970).

\subsection*{3.3. The Structure of Liganded Haemoglobin}

The arrangement of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits in liganded haemoglobin is illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows the model of the structure built from the low resolution electron density map (Cullis et al., 1962). The structure of aquomethaemoglobin has now been studied to $2.8 \AA$ resolution and an atomic model built (Perutz et al., 1968a, b). The tertiary structures of subunits in the haemoglobin tetramer are very similar to the tertiary structure of myoglobin, although both the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains have some differences in detail. The iron atom is estimated to be out of the mean plane of the porphyrin ring towards the proximal histidine by $0.1 \AA$ in the $\alpha$-chains and by $0.2 \AA$ in the $\beta$-chains, whilst the porphyrin ring itself is slightly bent. The distance of the imidazole nitrogen of the haem-linked histidine from the mean porphyrin plane is $2.4 \AA$ in the $\alpha$-chains and $2.5 \AA$ in the $\beta$-chains (Heidner et al., 1975).

Contacts between the subunits are of four possible kinds, $\alpha_{1} \alpha_{2}, \beta_{1} \beta_{2}, \alpha_{1} \beta_{1}, \alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$. No contacts between like chains are visible in the electron density map, but there may possibly be a few polar contacts involving the terminal residues of the subunits (see Table 7). Both the carboxyl terminal and amino terminal residues of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains appear to be free and delocalized in the structure. Also the penultimate residues at the C-termini, tyrosines HC2(140) $\alpha$ and HC2(145) $\beta$, appear only partially localized since the electron density corresponding to them is very low.

The contact $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ is the most extensive intersubunit contact in the tetramer, with 34 residues in contact involving 110 atoms coming within a distance of $4 \AA$ of each other. The majority of these interactions are non-polar with a few probable hydrogen bonds. The contact $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ is made up of 19 residues contributing about 80 atoms within a
distance of $4 \AA$ of each other. Again, most of the interactions are non-polar but there is one clear hydrogen bond between aspartate $\mathrm{G} 1(94) \alpha$ and asparagine $\mathrm{G} 4(102) \beta$. Table 6a lists the interatomic contacts between $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$.

Comparison of the structure of carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin with that of aquomethaemoglobin has shown that the arrangement of the subunits in the tetramer is the same although there are small differences in the tertiary structure of the subunits in the region of the haem groups and at the C-termini of the chains (Heidner et al., 1975). The position of the iron atom in the low spin ferrous derivative is closer to the plane of the porphyrin ring, and there is a change in position of the distal histidine. Associated with the difference in position of the iron atom closer to the plane of the haem there appeared to be a rotation of the F helix such that in the $\beta$-chains the sulphydryl group of cysteine $\mathrm{F9}(93) \beta$ was moved from an exposed position in methaemoglobin to a more shielded one in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin. The -SH group moves into the pocket partially occupied by Tyr $145 \beta$ in methaemoglobin so that in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin the penultimate tyrosine must be even more delocalized than in methaemoglobin.

\subsection*{3.4. The Structure of Deoxyhaemoglobin and its Comparison with Liganded Haemoglobin}

There is a difference in quaternary structure, i.e. the arrangement of the four subunits in the tetramer, between liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin. The geometry of the rearrangement of the subunits was originally determined from the low resolution electron density maps of horse met and horse and human deoxyhaemoglobin (Muirhead et al., 1967; Bolton et al., 1968). In this rearrangement there is relatively little change within the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ pair of subunits, but a large movement between the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ pairs of subunits. The structures of horse and human deoxyhaemoglobin have now been studied to $2.8 \AA$ and $2.5 \AA$ resolution, respectively, and atomic models have been built (Bolton and Perutz, 1970; Arnone et al., 1975; McLachlan and Fermi, 1975). The differences in tertiary structure of the subunits between liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin are small but they are significant in the region of the haem groups and the intersubunit contacts.

The haem groups in deoxyhaemoglobin are in contact with the same residues as in methaemoglobin but the details of the contacts have changed since the haem group appears to tilt slightly in the haem pocket when there is no ligand in it. The iron atom is estimated to be $0.60 \AA$ and $0.63 \AA$ out of the plane of the flat porphyrin ring towards the
proximal histidine in the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains respectively of human deoxyhaemoglobin. The distance of the imidazole nitrogen of the haem-linked histidine from the mean porphyrin plane is estimated to be $2.6 \AA$ in the $\alpha$-chains and $2.8 \AA$ in the $\beta$-chains (Fermi, 1975). The size of the haem ligand pocket is noticeably smaller in the $\beta$-chains of deoxyhaemoglobin relative to liganded $\beta$-chains, whereas the ligand pocket appears to be the same width in deoxy and met $\alpha$-chains.

Contacts between the $\alpha_{1}$ - and $\alpha_{2}$-chains are seen in deoxyhaemoglobin in contrast to liganded haemoglobin where there were none (Muirhead and Greer, 1970; Bolton and Perutz, 1970). The $\alpha$-carboxyl group of arginine $\mathrm{HC} 3(141) \alpha_{2}$ is in contact with the $\epsilon$-amino group of lysine $\mathrm{H} 10(127) \alpha_{1}$. Also the guanidinium group of $\operatorname{Arg} 141 \alpha_{2}$ forms a salt bridge with aspartate $\mathrm{H} 9(126) \alpha_{1}$. In the electron density maps of Muirhead and Greer (1970) and Bolton and Perutz (1970), the $\alpha$-amino group of valine $1 \alpha_{1}$ appeared to make a contact with the $\alpha$-carboxyl of Arg $141 \alpha_{2}$. In a later map at higher resolution (Arnone et al., 1975) Val $1 \alpha_{1}$ is too far away from the $\alpha$-carboxyl to be a contact and there may be a water molecule between the two groups. Figure 7 illustrates the arrangement of the charged groups in the region of the N -terminus of $\alpha_{1}$ and the C-terminus of $\alpha_{2}$ as determined from the latest map of human deoxyhaemoglobin. The penultimate tyrosine $\mathrm{HC} 2(140) \alpha$ is clearly defined in the deoxy structure in a pocket between the $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ helices, in contrast again to the situation in liganded haemoglobin.

There are no contacts between the $\beta_{1}$ - and $\beta_{2}$-chains in deoxyhaemoglobin and the central cavity on the dyad axis of the molecule is larger in deoxy than in liganded haemoglobin.

The contact $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ differs only slightly between liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin. Except for a few changes the same residues are in contact in deoxyhaemoglobin as in methaemoglobin (Bolton and Perutz, 1970). There seem to be 32 residues or 98 atoms in contact in deoxy as opposed to 34 and 110 in the liganded form with four or five hydrogen bonds in each structure. The only significant change is linked to the stabilized conformation in deoxy of the carboxyl termini of the $\alpha$ chains.

The contact $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ undergoes drastic changes between the liganded and deoxy forms. Table 6b gives a list of the residues in contact in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface for comparison with Table 6a of the contacts in methaemoglobin. The hydrogen bond between Asp G1(94) $\alpha_{1}$ and Asn G4(102) $\beta_{2}$ present in liganded haemoglobin is absent, and there is a new hydrogen bond between Tyr C7(42) $\alpha_{1}$ and Asp G1(99) $\beta_{2}$ (see Fig. 8). There are 20 residues or 69 atoms in contact in deoxy as opposed to 19 and 80 in oxy. There is also a polar contact between $\alpha_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ present in deoxyhaemoglobin that is absent in liganded haemoglobin, the $\alpha$-carboxyl of histidine $\mathrm{HC} 3(146) \beta_{1}$ being linked to the $\in$-amino group of lysine $\mathbf{C 5 ( 4 0 ) \alpha _ { 2 }}$ (Muirhead and Greer, 1970). In addition, the imidazole of the histidine is linked to aspartate $\operatorname{FG1}(94) \beta_{1}$ of its own chain so that the C-terminal histidine is well localized in this structure. Tyrosine $\mathrm{HC2}(145) \beta$ is firmly anchored in a pocket between the F and H helices by van der Waals contacts and a hydrogen bond between the - OH group and the carboxyl group of valine FGS(98)B.

\end{figure}

Comparison of the two structures. From the brief description of the structures of fully liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin given in section 3.3 and above, a summary of the main differences between the two structures is as follows.

The C-terminal residues Arg HC3(141) $\alpha$, Tyr HC2(140) $\alpha$ and His HC3(146) $\beta$, Tyr $\mathrm{HC} 2(145) \beta$ in liganded haemoglobin are relatively free and may take up several alternative positions but are well localized and bonded to other residues in deoxyhaemoglobin. In the latter structure, the C-terminus of $\alpha_{1}$ forms links with the other $\alpha$-chain, and the C -terminus of $\beta_{1}$ forms links with the $\alpha_{2}$-chain. In deoxyhaemoglobin the penultimate tyrosine of each chain is hydrogen bonded by its- OH group to a main chain carboxyl group in a pocket between the F and H helices, whereas in liganded haemoglobin the pockets between helices F and H are narrower by about $2.0 \AA$ and the tyrosines are unstable in the pockets. The stabilizing interactions involving the C-terminal residues are listed in Table 7.

The accessibility of the reactive sulphydryl group of cysteine $93 \beta$ is very different in deoxy and liganded haemoglobin. In deoxyhaemoglobin the -SH group is shielded from solution by His $146 \beta$ which is salt bridged to Asp $94 \beta$. In liganded haemoglobin it is accessible to the solution and, as described in section 3.3, is slightly more exposed in aquomethaemoglobin than in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin.

The contacts between subunits excluding the salt bridges listed in Table 7 are greater in number in liganded haemoglobin than in deoxyhaemoglobin. The stabilization energy, however, is not easily predicted from the number of contacts. As discussed in section 2.5 , the deoxy tetramer is more stable relative to the deoxy free chains than the liganded tetramer relative to liganded free chains. This results both from changes in tertiary structures as well as differences in the intersubunit contacts.

The largest change in arrangement of the subunits on ligation occurs at the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface, the changes in which are illustrated in Fig. 8. The hydrogen bonds in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface that differ in liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin are included in Table 7.

The interactions enclosed in brackets are probable weak interactions that are not seen directly in the electron density map.

The haem groups differ most noticeably in the position of the iron atom relative to the plane of the porphyrin ring. The structure of the haem groups will be discussed further in section 3.6 when they will be compared to the structure of haem groups in isolated subunits.

\subsection*{3.5. Conformation Differences Between Liganded and Unliganded Haemoglobin in Solution}

Many techniques have been used to study the conformation differences between liganded and unliganded haemoglobin in solution. Most of the differences detected by these methods can be interpreted in terms of the three-dimensional structures derived from crystallographic studies described above, and suggest that these structures are the same as those of liganded and unliganded haemoglobin in solution.

The difference in affinity for ligands such as protons and organic phosphates between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin, discussed in section 2.6 in relation to the consequent effect on the oxygen affinity, is an indication of conformation differences in the vicinity of the binding sites for these ligands. The interaction of haemoglobin with protons, and organic phosphates will be discussed in detail in section 4.

The rate of reaction of the sulphydryl group of Cys F9(93)B with the reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was shown by Riggs (1961) to differ in liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin. Table 8 shows recent data on the second order rate constants for the reaction of the -SH group with $p$-mercuribenzoate (PMB) in liganded and deoxyhaemoglobins. Oxyhaemoglobin has a higher rate constant than deoxyhaemoglobin by a factor of 45. The liganded haemoglobins all have higher rates than deoxyhaemoglobin that differ from each other only by small factors.

The structural explanation of the difference in rate constants can be seen from a

comparison of the environment of the - SH groups in the liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin structures described above. In deoxyhaemoglobin the-SH group is screened by His HC3(146) $\beta$, which is joined by salt bridges to Asp FG1(94) $\beta$ and to Lys C5(40) $\alpha$, whilst in liganded haemoglobin it is in an exposed position accessible to the solvent (Perutz, 1970). The observation of Geraci and Sada (1972) that enzymatic digestion of the C -terminal $\mathrm{His} 146 \beta$ removes the difference in reactivity between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin is in agreement with this explanation. The difference in reactivity of carbonmonoxy- and methaemoglobin has been interpreted by Heidner et al. (1975). Small changes in tertiary structure in the vicinity of the haem, which include a slight rotation of the F helix, move the - SH group from an exposed position in methaemoglobin to a more shielded one in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin. The rotation-appears to be the result of the movement of the haem-linked histidine closer to the plane of the porphyrin ring. The position of the histidine depends on the type of ligand (section 3.1), so that among liganded derivatives the - SH reactivity is expected to be lowest for low spin carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin and highest for high spin fluoromethaemoglobin. The data of Perutz et al. (1974b) in Table 8 show that this is so.

Conformation differences in the vicinity of $\beta 93$ have also been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of spin-labelled reagents attached to $\beta 93$ (McConnell et al., 1969). The EPR spectrum of liganded haemoglobin shows evidence for a conformational equilibrium between two orientations of the spin-label relative to the protein. The EPR spectra of haemoglobin liganded with carbon monoxide, azide, cyanide, oxygen, water and fluoride all show this conformational equilibrium but have small differences between their spectra suggesting structural differences in the liganded forms linked to the spin state of the iron atoms. The EPR spectrum of deoxyhaemoglobin, however, shows only one orientation of the spin-label corresponding to one of the orientations in liganded haemoglobin. Moffat (1971a) has given a structural interpretation of these EPR spectra. From an X-ray study of methaemoglobin with the spin-label bound, the two orientations between which the spin-label is oscillating could be identified. One position is free in solution on the outside of the protein, the other displaces Tyr $145 \beta$ and the C-terminus of the $\beta$-chain. The EPR spectra show that there is a very small energy barrier between the two positions for the spin-label, which shows that Tyr $145 \beta$ is easily displaced and is itself in a state of conformational equilibrium between different positions. This delocalization of $\operatorname{Tyr} 145 \beta$ was indicated by the poor definition in this region of the electron density map of methaemoglobin (section 3.3). In deoxyhaemoglobin, where $\operatorname{Tyr} 145 \beta$ is stabilized in one position by its hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of Val $98 \beta$, only one orientation of the spin-label is seen corresponding to the position free on the surface of the molecule.

The EPR spectrum differences seen between the low spin ferrous or ferric derivatives (carbonmonoxy, azide, cyanide, oxy) and the high spin derivatives (met below pH 7.0 and fluoromet) indicate, in the light of Moffat's interpretation, that in high spin derivatives Tyr $145 \beta$ is more localized than in the low spin derivatives. This is consistent with the X-ray results of Heidner et al. (1975), which show that in low spin carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin the Tyr $145 \beta$ is displaced more out of the tyrosine pocket relative to methaemoglobin because Cys $93 \beta$ has moved into its pocket.

Huestis and Raftery (1972a) have also demonstrated conformation differences in the vicinity of $\beta 93$. They have used a reagent labelled with ${ }^{19} \mathrm{~F}$ attached to $\beta 93$ and studied the difference in the NMR spectrum in liganded and unliganded haemoglobins. The ${ }^{19} \mathrm{~F}$ NMR spectrum consists of a single absorption whose chemical shift changes with ligation state. The NMR spectra show that the environment of the probe is similar for the ligands oxygen, carbon monoxide and cyanide, although small differences indicate that the structures are not identical. The deoxyhaemoglobin spectrum is quite different. The ${ }^{19} \mathrm{~F}$ NMR spectrum of aquomethaemoglobin shows significant differences from oxyhaemoglobin which may correlate with the differences seen between the structures of carbonmonoxy- and methaemoglobin in this region.

The differences in the UV circular dichroism spectra of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin are due to changes in the environment of the haems and aromatic residues. From a
comparison of the circular dichroism (CD) difference spectra of normal haemoglobin and a chemically modified haemoglobin known not to change its quaternary structure on oxygenation, Simon and Cantor (1969) showed that one region of the spectrum, around 260 nm is chiefly sensitive to the state of the haems, and another region, around 285 nm is associated with the change of quaternary structure. Tyr C7(42) $\alpha$ whose environment changes considerably between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin may contribute to the part associated with the quaternary structure change (Perutz et al., 1974a). In oxyhaemoglobin the side chain of the tyrosine makes several contacts with Arg C6(40) $\beta$ and is hydrogen bonded to the amide group of Asn G4(97) $\alpha$. In deoxyhaemoglobin it makes fewer contacts with the arginine and is hydrogen bonded to Asp G1(99)β. From a comparison of the CD spectrum of normal haemoglobin with that of Hb Hirose, in which $\operatorname{Trp} \mathrm{C} 3(37) \beta$ is replaced by Ser (Yanase et al., 1968), it has been shown that the region of the spectrum at 387 nm is mainly due to $\operatorname{Trp} 37 \beta$ (Perutz, personal communication).

Differences in the UV absorption spectrum between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin are due to changed environments of the haems and aromatic residues. The UV spectra of oxy-, met- and cyanomethaemoglobin are similar, showing small differences for each ligand, but deoxyhaemoglobin has a quite different spectrum. The spectrum of liganded haemoglobin also varies with pH (Briehl and Hobbs, 1970). A tentative identification of the aromatic residues contributing to the change between the liganded and deoxyhaemoglobin spectra suggested $\operatorname{Trp} \operatorname{C3(37)} \beta$ and $\operatorname{Tyr} \operatorname{C7(42)\alpha }$ in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ contact (Briehl and Hobbs, 1970). From a comparison of the spectra between normal haemoglobin and haemoglobin Hirose, it has now been shown that Trp C3(37) $\beta$ makes only a minor contribution to the difference spectrum (Perutz, personal communication).

NMR spectroscopy has been used to detect conformational differences between liganded and unliganded haemoglobin, probably the changed environment of aromatic residues in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ contacts (Ho et al., 1970; Patel et al., 1970). ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ NMR differences between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin indicate that several lysines are immobilized in deoxyhaemoglobin. At physiological pH methaemoglobin seems to have ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ NMR properties intermediate between those of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin (Moon and Richards, 1972).

The rate of digestion of the $C$-terminal residues is greater for liganded haemoglobin than for deoxyhaemoglobin (Zito et al., 1964). This is to be expected from the three-dimensional structures which show the C-terminal residues of both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains to be free in liganded haemoglobin and salt bridged in deoxyhaemoglobin.

All this evidence confirms the view that the structure in solution and in the crystal are the same.

\subsection*{3.6. Structural Comparison of Tertiary Structures of Isolated Subunits with Subunits in Haemoglobin}

In section 2.5 the following two conclusions were drawn from the comparison of the ligand binding properties of haemoglobin and free chains. Firstly, that association of free deoxy subunits into the deoxy tetramer forces them into a conformation in which they have lowered affinity for the first ligand. Secondly, that the last stage of binding the ligands oxygen, carbon monoxide or $n$-butyl isocyanide to haemoglobin is similar to binding these ligands to free chains. Now from a structural comparison of the tertiary structures of the subunits when free and when in the tetramer, one can hope to see the reason why binding the first ligand to haemoglobin is different from binding to free chains, whereas binding the last ligand to haemoglobin is similar.

Comparison of deoxyhaemoglobin and deoxy free chains. Crystallographic studies of the deoxy forms of two monomeric globins have been described in section 3.2. Whilst not having identical ligand binding properties to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains they have similar high affinity and kinetic constants. Data for myoglobin was included in Tables 1 and 3 for comparison. There is a slightly greater difference in properties between myoglobin and $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the case of carbon monoxide binding (Brunori and Shuster, 1969; Brunori et al., 1966). In myoglobin and erythrocruorin, the deoxy form has the iron
atom positioned about $0.3 / 0.4 \AA$ from the plane of the porphyrin ring (Table 5). In contrast, in deoxyhaemoglobin subunits the distance of the iron atom from the porphyrin plane is greater, being about $0.6 \AA$ for the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains.

Spectroscopic studies of the haem environment have also shown differences between free deoxy subunits and those in the tetramer. The electronic absorption spectrum in the visible region and in the near-ultraviolet region known as the Soret band differs between isolated subunits and deoxyhaemoglobin. The spectral difference consists of a decrease in the extinction coefficient at 430 nm and a broadening of the Soret band in isolated subunits as compared to deoxyhaemoglobin (Benesch et al., 1964; Antonini et al., 1965a; Brunori et al., 1968b). Also the NMR spectrum of the paramagnetically shifted proton resonances in the downfield region for human deoxyhaemoglobin is different from the spectrum that would result from a superposition of the resonance spectra of the isolated $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains (Perutz et al., 1974a).

Perutz et al. (1974c) have correlated the electron absorption spectrum difference and the NMR spectral differences with structural differences in the region of the haem groups between deoxy free subunits and deoxy subunits in the tetramer. They have given an interpretation of the spectral changes between the tetramer and free subunits as due to lengthening of the iron-nitrogen bonds to the porphyrin ring and to the proximal histidine. This is consistent with the iron atom and the proximal histidine being further from the mean plane of the porphyrin in deoxyhaemoglobin than in monomeric globins but, as the porphyrins in these structures are probably domed or puckered, the positions of the pyrrole nitrogen atoms are not known accurately enough to determine bond lengths. Perutz et al. suggest that the lowered rate constant and lowered affinity of the first ligand to bind to haemoglobin compared to binding to free chains may be associated with the spectral changes and the position of the iron.

Comparison of "rapid" haemoglobin with deoxy free chains. Gibson (1959) showed that "rapid" haemoglobin, formed by flash photolysis of fully liganded haemoglobin, had an electronic absorption spectrum that differed from that of normal "slow" deoxyhaemoglobin. It is in fact that corresponding to free deoxy chains. In other words, the intersubunit contacts in "rapid" haemoglobin do not produce constraints on the subunits that either lower the rate constant or alter the absorption spectrum. The correlation of absorption spectrum with iron position proposed by Perutz et al. implies that the deoxy subunit in "rapid" haemoglobin has its iron atom in the normal position for a high spin ferrous iron atom in a free subunit.

Comparison of liganded haemoglobin and liganded free chains. Crystallographic studies of the liganded forms of myoglobin and erythrocuorin were described in section 3.2. In both monomeric globins, the met form has the iron atom positioned $0.3 / 0.4 \AA$ from the plane of the porphyrin (see Table 5), whilst in methaemoglobin the iron atom is positioned $0.1 / 0.2 \AA$ from the mean plane. The studies of erythrocruorin showed the iron atom to be in the plane of the porphyrin for the carbonmonoxy form and in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin the iron atom is closer to the mean plane than in methaemoglobin. In all these structures, however, the iron-nitrogen bond lengths are not known accurately.

Spectroscopic studies of the haem environments have shown only small differences between liganded subunits and liganded tetramers, except in the case of the aquomet derivative. The electronic absorption spectrum of oxy- and carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin in the visible and Soret regions is the same as that of the isolated subunit spectra (Brunori et al., 1968b). No dependence on pH has been reported. On the other hand, a change in the electronic absorption spectrum has been observed on association of isolated met subunits into methaemoglobin. Although the spectrum of free met $\alpha$-chains is like that of the $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ tetramer, that of the $\beta_{4}$ tetramer changes on association (Banerjee and Cassoly, 1969a).

The paramagnetically shifted NMR resonance of cyanoferric isolated chains have been compared with those of cyanoferric haemoglobin (Ogawa et al., $1972 \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$ ). The comparison shows that the $\alpha^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ and the $\beta^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ spectra can be distinguished in the tetramer spectrum, although the association of subunits to tetramer has altered the
haem environments slightly. The tetramer spectrum alters with pH and changes in ionic strength much more than the spectra of free chains do, and the authors suggest that the pH dependence is due to the titration of a histidine in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ contact region.

The proton NMR spectra of the ring current shifted resonances of carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin indicate that the tertiary structure of the haem pockets are not significantly affected by the association of carbonmonoxy subunits into the tetramer. The contributions of the spectra of the isolated subunits can be added to give a close approximation of the intact tetramer spectrum (Lindstrom et al., 1972b). A difference in the liganded tetramer spectrum with pH change or change in anion concentration is also found, and is interpreted as a change in conformation of valines E11 relative to the haem plane (Lindstrom and Ho, 1973).

So association of liganded $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits into the tetramer, except in the case of aquomet subunits, is accompanied by only small changes in the haem environment as detected by spectral methods. The haem environments in the tetramer are altered slightly by pH changes and ionic strength in a way not seen in the isolated subunits. If these alterations affect the subunit affinity, then the last binding step to the tetramer cannot be exactly the same as binding to free chains. This point will be discussed again in section 4.

Implications for the origin of co-operativity. In section 2.5 it was seen from thermodynamic arguments that since the assembly of $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits into the deoxy tetramer lowers the affinity of the subunits for the first ligand, the favourable subunit contacts must produce some conformation changes in the subunits that lower their ligand affinity. In addition, since the last step in ligand binding is very like that for free chains, the oxy arrangement of the subunits is not associated with these constraints. Cooperativity is associated with the non-uniform release of the constraints of the deoxyhaemoglobin structure with ligation of the subunits.

The association between the normal deoxyhaemoglobin absorption spectrum and the existence of co-operativity was suggested by Brunori et al. (1968b). They noted that abnormal deoxyhaemoglobins whose co-operativity and related conformational changes had been lost, had the spectrum of isolated deoxy chains rather than the normal spectrum. Perutz et al. (1974c) have now interpreted this characteristic absorption spectrum of deoxyhaemoglobin, which is correlated with low affinity for the first ligand, in structural terms. It is associated with the position of the iron atom further from the plane of the porphyrin ring than is normal for a high spin ferrous iron atom. The iron is held in position as a result of tertiary structure changes resulting from the exceptionally stable contacts between subunits made in the deoxyhaemoglobin tetramer. On the other hand, the spectra of normal deoxy free chains is associated with the normal position of the iron and high affinity, and this is the situation for the last binding step in oxygen, carbon monoxide or $n$-butyl isocyanide to normal haemoglobin. The structures are not known accurately enough, however, to provide a test of the proposed correlation between the iron-nitrogen bond lengths and the spectra.

The preceding discussion has shown that there is some understanding of the origin of the difference in affinity of normal haemoglobin for its first and last ligand. How the change in quaternary structure is brought about and the connection between it and the changing constraints on the subunits in the tetramer will be the subject of later discussions. Section 4 will describe the effect of $\mathbf{p H}$ and anions on the affinity and co-operativity of normal haemoglobin and section 5 will describe the properties of abnormal haemoglobins. These give information on the nature of the intermediate states, an understanding of which is required for an understanding of co-operativity. Before moving on to this discussion some brief comments on the properties of haemoglobin dimers will be made.

\subsection*{3.7. Dissociation of Haemoglobin and the Necessity of the Tetramer for Normal Co-operativity}

Liganded haemoglobin dissociates into dimers which are easily detected in moderate salt concentration and at neutral $\mathbf{p H}$. Table 9 gives some recent data on the dissociation

constants of various liganded haemoglobins. Rosemeyer and Huehns (1967) showed that dissociation to dimers is increased by reacting haemoglobin with PMB at the -SH groups of $\beta 93$ which is in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface. From this result and structural considerations, it was deduced that the first contacts to be broken in the normal tetramer are in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface, i.e. the dimers formed are ( $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ ). The formation of ( $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ ) dimers rather than any other subunit pair is expected from the structure described in section 3.3 since the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ interface has the most residues and atoms in contact. Further dissociation of the ( $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ ) dimer into monomers is not detectable at neutral pH and moderate ionic strength (Kellett and Schachman, 1971).

Deoxyhaemoglobin does not dissociate detectably at pH 7.0 even in strong salt solution (Kellett and Gutfreund, 1970; Kellett, 1971b). At very high pH , deoxyhaemoglobin can be made to dissociate into an ( $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}$ ) dimer which has an absorption spectrum like that of free chains and fast carbon monoxide binding kinetics (Anderson et al., 1971). Kellett (1971b) also showed that the deoxy dimer formed in 2 m NaI possesses properties similar to isolated chains. Deoxyhaemoglobin digested with carboxypeptidase B which removes the C-terminal arginines $141 \alpha$ can be made to form dimers in strong salt ( $1 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$ ) and these deoxy dimers also have absorption spectra like free chains and are non-cooperative in ligand binding (Hewitt et al., 1972). The measured value of $p_{50}$ for oxygen binding to des(Arg) dimers is 0.4 mm Hg , very similar to the value for free chains shown in Table 1. Thus the free $\alpha \beta$ dimer has been shown to be non-cooperative and to have ligand binding properties and absorption spectra like those of free chains. The tetramer is the co-operative unit in haemoglobin as was suggested from kinetic evidence by Gibson and Parkhurst (1968). Structural reasons why the tetramer is essential for co-operativity were first discussed by Perutz et al. (1968b) and recent theories of haemoglobin function are based on the tetramer as the functional unit.

The affinities of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the dimer. The macromolecule haptoglobin has been shown to bind only to the $\alpha \beta$ dimer (Nagel and Gibson, 1971). It binds much more strongly to liganded haemoglobin, which forms dimers in a significant amount, than to deoxyhaemoglobin which does not. Haptoglobin binding to deoxyhaemoglobin is too small to be detected in the presence of phosphates but can just be detected for haemoglobin stripped of phosphates (Nagel and Gibson, 1972). As expected from the linkage between dissociation and oxygen affinity (section 2.5) the haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex has very much higher affinity than has normal haemoglobin. In addition homo- and heterotropic interactions are absent in the complex with one mole haptoglobin per mole dimer. The absorption spectrum from the haem groups, the rate of carbon monoxide binding and the oxygen equilibrium properties are like those of free chains with $n=1$ and $p_{s o}=0.45 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Nagel et al., 1965; Chiancone et al., 1973). Since $n=1$, the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the dimer cannot be very different in regards their oxygen affinities and are therefore like the free subunits. The oxidation of haemoglobin bound to haptoglobin also shows the similarity in properties of free chains and the $\alpha \beta$ dimer. In this case there is slight negative co-operativity, consistent with the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the dimer having the different oxidationreduction potentials characteristic of the free subunits (Brunori et al., 1968a). At pH 7.0 in 0.1 m phosphate, the oxidation-reduction potentials of the two components in the dimer are $E_{1}=0.106$ and $E_{2}=0.050$, whereas at pH 9.15 they are 0.044 and 0.022 . These oxidation-reduction potentials, multiplied by $(F / 2.3 \mathrm{RT})=16.65$, are equivalent to log $p_{50}$ values (see section 2.5) and show an equivalent difference in affinity between the
chains in the dimer of a factor 8.5 at pH 7.0 and about 2.5 at pH 9.0 . These relative affinities of the chains in the dimer can be compared to those for the isolated chains determined by Banerjee and Cassoly (1969a), who found the $\beta$-chains to be less easily oxidized than the $\alpha$-chains by a factor of about 10 at pH 7.0 , but equally easily oxidized at pH 8.0 . The two sets of results are sufficiently consistent to indicate that the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chain properties are not altered by association into the dimer.

Estimation of tetramer-dimer dissociation constant for deoxyhaemoglobin. The liganded structure is expected to dissociate to subunits more easily than the deoxy structure from the considerations discussed in section 2.5. As it has now been shown both that the free dimer is non-cooperative and has chain-like ligand binding properties, and that the dissociation of dimer to monomer does not take place in moderate ionic strength, the argument of section 2.5 can be used to estimate the dissociation constant of deoxyhaemoglobin to dimers. Let $p_{d}$ denote the median ligand activity of the dimer, and $p_{m}$, as before, that of the tetramer. The association constants of subunits to tetramers are related to those of dimers to tetramers by
$$K S_{0}=\frac{1}{K_{T, D(\text { deoxy })}\left(K_{D, M}\right)^{2}}$$
and
$$K S_{4}=\frac{1}{K_{T, D(\mathrm{oxy})}\left(K_{D, M}\right)^{2}}$$
where $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{T}, \boldsymbol{D}}$ denotes the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant and $\boldsymbol{K}_{D, M}$ the dimer-monomer dissociation constant which is independent of the state of oxygenation. Equation (2.15) becomes
$$\ln p_{m}=\ln p_{d}+\frac{1}{4} \ln \frac{K_{T, D(\mathrm{oxy})}}{K_{T, D(\mathrm{deoxy})}} .$$

Using the data previously taken as an example, that of Tyuma et al. (1973a) where log $p_{m}=0.737$ in 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7.4 , and taking $\log p_{d}=-0.4$ similar to the free chains value
$$\frac{K_{T, D(\text { oxy })}}{K_{T, D(\text { deoxy })}}=3.5 \times 10^{4} .$$

Taking the value of $K_{T, D(\text { oxy })}$ from Table 9, $K_{T, D(\text { deoxy })}$ is estimated to be $10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ in 0.1 M NaCl at pH 7.4. Thomas and Edelstein (1972) have estimated $K_{T, D(\text { deoxy })}$ to be $4 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~m}$ by the same method, approximating the median ligand activity by the value of $p_{50}$. The value of $K_{T, D(d e o x y)}$ depends on pH and organic phosphate concentration since $p_{m}$ depends on these as discussed in section 2.6.2.

\section*{4. THE INTERACTION WITH PROTONS AND ORGANIC PHOSPHATES}

This section will discuss the extent to which the three-dimensional structures of deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin, described in section 3, account for the differences in their binding constants for protons and organic phosphates, and hence for their altered oxygen affinities ( $p_{m}$ ) in the presence of these ligands. The evidence on the binding of these ligands to partially oxygenated haemoglobin will also be examined in preparation for later discussion of the conformation of the intermediate structures.

Carbon dioxide binding to haemoglobin will not be included in the discussion here although it is another example of heterotropic interaction in haemoglobin. For information on the interaction of haemoglobin with this ligand the reader is referred to the section on this topic in the recent review by Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardi (1973).

\subsection*{4.1. The Interaction of Haemoglobin with Protons. The Bohr Effect}

As mentioned in the introduction, the Bohr effect is responsible for the influence of dissolved carbon dioxide on the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin. The effect was first noticed by Bohr et al. (1904). The phenomenon that oxygenated blood dissolved less carbon dioxide than deoxygenated blood was noticed later (Christiansen et al., 1914).

Henderson (1920) showed that these effects could be accounted for by an interaction between haemoglobin and hydrogen ions in such a way that deoxyhaemoglobin binds more hydrogen ions at physiological pH than does oxyhaemoglobin.

\subsection*{4.1.1. Direct measurement of proton binding to oxy-, met- and deoxyhaemoglobin}

The number of protons released per subunit of haemoglobin on oxygenation is illustrated in Fig. 9a. This differential titration curve shows that below pH 6.0 oxygenated haemoglobin binds more protons than deoxyhaemoglobin, and above pH 6.0 , in the physiological range of pH , deoxyhaemoglobin binds more protons than oxyhaemoglobin. These phenomena are the acid and alkaline Bohr effects respectively. The related dependence of $\log p_{50}$ on pH is shown in Fig. 12, curve a.

\end{figure}

The differential titration curve for the oxidation of haemoglobin is illustrated in Fig. 9b. The main difference between the two differential titration curves is due to the ionization of the water molecule which is the haem ligand in methaemoglobin. The $\mathrm{p} K$ for the water molecule ionization is about 8.0 , and if the contribution from this is subtracted, the curve for oxidation is nearly the same as that for oxygenation.

\end{figure}

The expressions for the dependence of oxygen affinity on pH and for the release of protons on oxygenation can be obtained from the general expressions discussed in section 2.6. Writing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$for the ligand $X$ and $h$ as its concentration, eqs. (2.25) and (2.28) become
$$\log p_{m h}=\log p_{m}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\log \phi_{0}(h)-\log \phi_{4}(h)\right),$$
where $p_{m}$ is the value at very high pH
and
$$\frac{\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+}}{4}=\frac{d \log p_{m h}}{d \log h}=-\frac{d \log p_{m h}}{d \mathrm{pH}} .$$

Wyman (1939) showed that the differential titration curve for oxygenation (Fig. 9a) could be accounted for by a model in which there were two oxygen-linked ionizing groups per subunit of haemoglobin, one accounting for the effect at acid pH and the other for the effect at alkaline pH . In this model it is assumed there is no interaction between ionizable groups, either within the same subunit or in different subunits, and that $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits are equivalent. For non-interacting groups, eqs. (2.30) and (2.31) can be used. Writing the constants $Q_{i j}$ in terms of the ionization constants $\mathrm{K}_{i j}$ of the groups
$$Q_{0 j}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{~K}_{0 j}}=10^{\mathrm{p} K_{0 j}} ; \quad Q_{4 j}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{~K}_{4 j}}=10^{\mathrm{p} K_{4 j}}$$
then from (2.30), if $q$ is the number of ionizing groups contributing,
$$\log p_{m h}=\log p_{m}+\frac{1}{4} \sum_{j=1}^{q}\left(\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{0 j}}\right)-\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{4 j}}\right)\right)$$
and from (4.2) and (2.31)
$$\frac{d \log p_{m h}}{d \mathrm{pH}}=-\frac{\Delta H^{+}}{4}=-\frac{1}{4} \sum_{i=1}^{q} \Delta H_{j}^{+}$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{j}^{+} & =\frac{d}{d \log h}\left(\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{0 j}}\right)-\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{4 j}}\right)\right) \\
& =\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{0 j}+h}-\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{4 j}+h}
\end{aligned}$$

In Wyman's model $q=8$, and there are four identical pairs of two groups. This model fits the data with the acid Bohr group changing its pK from 5.25 to 5.75 on oxygenation and the alkaline Bohr group changing its pK from 7.81 to 6.80 .

It has been shown that the oxidation Bohr effect can be accounted for approximately by the same ionizing groups as those responsible for the oxygenation Bohr effect, when allowance is made for the water molecule ionization (Wyman and Ingalls, 1941). There is a small residual oxidation Bohr effect, not accounted for in this way, from one or more additional ionizing groups contributing in the pH region 6.4 to 7.4 (Antonini et al., 1964).

It has been shown more recently that the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits have different ionizing groups contributing to the alkaline Bohr effect, but so far there is no evidence on the separate contributions of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits to the acid Bohr effect. A model in which the proton binding sites are essentially non-interacting accounts for the Bohr effect of normal haemoglobin. This point will be discussed further in section 7 , in the light of later models of haemoglobin function.

\subsection*{4.1.2. Identification of ionizing groups contributing to the Bohr effect}

Experiments to identify groups contributing to the Bohr effect have involved modified haemoglobins whose Bohr effects are altered. These haemoglobins may have abnormal Bohr effects for either or both of two reasons. Firstly, one of the ionizing groups contributing to the Bohr effect may have been removed. Alternatively, the modification may have altered the $\mathbf{p K}$ 's of the normal groups. Identification of Bohr groups therefore requires a structural interpretation of the difference in $\mathbf{p K}$ of the group between normal oxy-and deoxyhaemoglobin as well as evidence that removal of the group changes the Bohr effect (Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardi, 1973).

Two groups that change their $\mathbf{p K}$ between oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin in the alkaline pH range have now been clearly identified. One of these is histidine $\mathrm{HC} 3(146) \beta$ and the other is the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chains, valine $1 \alpha$.

Histidine $H C 3(146) \beta$ was suggested as a possible ionizing group contributing to the Bohr effect from the results of a low resolution X-ray study of NES haemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1969). NES haemoglobin is the derivative formed by blocking the reactive sulphydryl groups, cysteine $93 \beta$, with N-ethylmaleimide and it had previously been shown to have a reduced Bohr effect (Riggs, 1961; Benesch and Benesch, 1961, 1962). The electron density difference map of NES haemoglobin showed the NES bound to the cysteine and structural changes in the vicinity of the C-terminal His $146 \beta$ which was displaced from its normal position. Later, the structure of deoxyhaemoglobin determined from the high resolution maps of horse and human haemoglobin (Bolton and Perutz, 1970; Muirhead and Greer, 1970; Arnone et al., 1975) showed the presence of a salt bridge between the imidazole group of His $146 \beta$ and the carboxyl group of Asp $94 \beta$ which raises the pK of the imidazole group. In the structure determined from the high resolution map of horse methaemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1968b), His $146 \beta$ is free and would have a normal $\mathbf{p} \boldsymbol{K}$. The contribution of this salt bridge to the Bohr effect was demonstrated by removal of His $146 \beta$ by enzymatic modification, when the expected reduction in the alkaline Bohr effect was found (Kilmartin and Wootton, 1970). An X-ray study of des(His) showed that this modification had produced no change in tertiary structure other than the removal of the histidine (Perutz and TenEyck, 1971). The exact $\mathbf{p} \boldsymbol{K}$ values of His $146 \beta$ in deoxy-and carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin have now been measured from the proton NMR spectrum of normal haemoglobin at different pH values, the resonance due to His $146 \beta$ having been identified by comparison of the NMR spectra of normal and des(His). The experimental results could be accounted for if His $146 \beta$ has a pK of 7.2 in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin and 8.1 in deoxyhaemoglobin at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Kilmartin et al., 1973b).

The $\alpha$-amino group of Valine $1 \alpha$ has been shown by experiments on chemically modified haemoglobin (Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardi, 1969, 1971) to contribute to the alkaline Bohr effect. The $\alpha$-amino groups of the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains were reacted with cyanate to give carbamylated amino groups which are unable to ionize in the normal pH range. It was found that if the $\beta$-chains only were carbamylated the Bohr effect was normal, but if the $\alpha$-chains are carbamylated the alkaline Bohr effect is reduced by $25 \%$ at pH 7.4 . Since X-ray analysis of the crystals of the modified haemoglobins showed no evidence of large structural changes in either the oxy or deoxy forms it was concluded that the reduced Bohr effect was the consequence of the blocking of one of the Bohr groups. An estimate of the $\mathbf{p K}$ change of the group from 7.3 in oxyhaemoglobin to 7.7 in deoxyhaemoglobin was obtained by subtracting the differential titration curve of carbamylated haemoglobin from that of normal haemoglobin. This procedure is valid provided there is negligible interaction between the normal ionizing groups.

The recently determined $2.5 \AA$ resolution Fourier map of human deoxyhaemoglobin (Arnone et al., 1975) does not provide a simple explanation of a raised pK of the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chains. In lower resolution maps, $2.8 \AA$ for horse deoxyhaemoglobin (Bolton and Perutz, 1970) and $3.5 \AA$ for human deoxyhaemoglobin (Muirhead and Greer, 1970), a salt bridge between the C-terminal carboxyl group of one $\alpha$-chain and the $\alpha$-amino group of the opposite $\alpha$-chain seemed possible, but this is not confirmed by the later map. The two groups are separated by $5 \AA$, and there may be a water molecule bound between them. There is a cluster of charged groups in the vicinity of the $\alpha$-amino group, illustrated in Fig. 7, which may have some effect on its pK. Thus it is unclear whether the contribution of the $\alpha$-amino group to the Bohr effect comes from a raising of its $\mathbf{p K}$ in the deoxy structure, perhaps due to a weak interaction through a water molecule with this cluster of charges or from a lowering of its pK in the oxy structure due to the proximity of the positively charged side chains of Arg $141 \alpha$. The involvement of an $\alpha$-amino group having an abnormally low pK in oxyhaemoglobin was suggested by Tanford and Nozaki (1966). Also, a direct measurement of the $\mathbf{p K}$ of the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chain in carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin gave a value of 6.72 (Hill and Davis, 1967), which is about one pH unit lower than the normal value to be expected for such a group. The suggested explanation for this low value was the proximity of positively charged group.

The remainder of the alkaline Bohr effect has no firm structural interpretation. The possibility of His G19(122) $\alpha$ being a Bohr group has been suggested (Perutz, 1970), and the interaction of bound chloride ions with certain residues in deoxyhaemoglobin leading to a change in their $\mathbf{p K}$ values is another possibility (Kilmartin and RossiBernardi, 1973). Table 10 shows the contribution to the total Bohr effect of the tetramer made by the identified groups just described. Using a model in which there is negligible interaction between different ionizing groups, the remainder of the Bohr effect could arise from one pair of ionizing groups with the pK change shown in the table, or several pairs of groups with smaller pK differences (Kilmartin et al., 1973b).

The acid Bohr effect is believed to be due to different ionization constants of carboxyl groups in oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin (Antonini et al., 1965c) but it is not known yet which particular groups contribute. Perutz (1970) has suggested that the acid Bohr effect is connected with a further quaternary structure change that takes place at about pH 6.0 .

The residual oxidation Bohr effect has not been interpreted structurally. Its constancy under different conditions, and its presence in myoglobin suggests that it is a direct effect from a local conformational change in the neighbourhood of the haem (Brunori et al., 1969).

\subsection*{4.1.3. The binding of protons to partially oxygenated haemoglobin}

The shape of the equilibrium curves as a function of pH , and the release of protons at successive steps in oxygenation. As discussed in section 2.6, eq. (2.27), the difference in number of protons bound at successive stages of partial oxygenation is related to the dependence of the Adair constants on pH . Writing $x=h$ and $\Delta X_{i}=\Delta H_{i}^{+}$, the release of protons at each stage of ligation is given by
$$\Delta H_{i}^{+}=-\frac{d \log A_{i}^{\prime}}{d \log h}=\frac{d \log A_{i}^{\prime}}{d \mathrm{pH}} .$$

That is, the number of protons released at each stage is related to the variation of shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve with pH . If the shape is invariant with pH , the Bohr effect and co-operativity are independent phenomena, whereas if the shape changes with pH they are interdependent or coupled.

For some time the experimental evidence was believed to support invariance of shape of the equilibrium curves with pH (Antonini et al., 1963) although there was some evidence that the shape varied at very high or very low saturations (see Roughton, 1964). The evidence supporting invariance of shape included the apparent linearity of the fractional release of protons as a function of oxygen saturation, which as seen in section 2.6 is a corollary of shape invariance, and the agreement of the two methods of determining the Bohr effect. Experimentally the Bohr effect is measured either by the release of bound hydrogen ions on oxygenation, $\Delta H^{+}$, or by the change in $\log p_{50}$ with pH. Since
$$\frac{\Delta H^{+}}{4}=-\frac{d \log p_{m}}{d \mathrm{pH}} \quad \text { from (4.2) }$$
the two experimental measures,
$$\frac{\Delta H^{+}}{4} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{-d \log p_{50}}{d \mathrm{pH}}$$
will give exactly the same results only if $p_{m}=p_{50}$ at all pH , i.e. the Hill plots are always symmetrical, or if the Hill plots are exactly the same shape at all pH . The evidence was interpreted as showing that the release of protons is equivalent for the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains and is entirely associated with tertiary structure changes induced by ligation within each subunit, quite independently of the state of ligation of other subunits.

Later results have shown that the slope of the Hill plot varies slightly with pH (Bunn and Guidotti, 1972; Tyuma et al., 1973b; Imai and Yonetani, 1975), and recent comparisons of the two measures of the Bohr effect have revealed a small difference of about 5\% (Siggaard-Anderson et al., 1972). The Adair constants of the oxygen equilibrium curves measured at several pH values by Imai and Yonetani are shown in Table 11, where it can be seen that the successive Adair constants are not all altered by the same factor when the pH is changed. The release of protons at successive steps in oxygenation can be estimated from this data.

From eq. (4.6) the release of protons at each step is
$$\Delta H_{i}^{+}=\frac{d \log A_{i}^{\prime}}{d \mathrm{pH}} .$$

Using the data of Table 11 and approximating
$$\frac{d \log A_{i}^{\prime}}{d \mathrm{pH}} \approx \frac{\Delta \log A_{i}^{\prime}}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}}$$
estimates can be made of the release of protons at each stage of ligation at the mean pH of two experiments. The estimates of $\Delta H_{i}^{+}$are shown alongside the Adair constants in Table 11 for three mean pH values. Too much reliance cannot be placed on the actual Adair constants fitted to the data, but these calculations make it clear that rather few protons are released in the later stages of ligation in these particular conditions, and that the number of protons released in the first stage is about a quarter of the total, with a larger number being released in the middle two steps. These results indicate that release of protons is not entirely linked to tertiary structure changes within each subunit, independently of other subunits, or a difference in behaviour of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains.

Kinetic studies of the release of protons with ligand uptake have shown that for carbon monoxide binding there is a linear relationship between the number of protons released and the number of carbon monoxide molecules bound. Antonini et al. (1965b) have demonstrated this in the pH range 7.0 to 7.8 , and Gray (1970), Gray and Gibson (1971a) and Olson and Gibson (1973b) confirm this result. The linear relationship is not seen, however, in the case of binding $n$-butyl isocyanide (nBIC) to haemoglobin. This ligand has been shown to bind more rapidly to the $\beta$-chains than to the $\alpha$-chains of deoxyhaemoglobin (Olson and Gibson, 1972a), in contrast to the binding of carbon
monoxide which binds with equal rates to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains (Gray and Gibson, 1971a). Heterogeneity in binding other isocyanides has also been found (Brunori et al., 1972). Olson and Gibson (1973a) have found that both proton release and n -BIC binding are biphasic, with $20 \%$ of the protons being released with the faster phase of $n$-BIC uptake and $80 \%$ with the slower phase, showing that with this ligand less protons are associated with ligating $\beta$-chains than with ligating $\alpha$-chains.

The kinetics of the last step in ligand binding and the first step in ligand dissociation show that proton release in the last ligation step is smaller than the average per ligation step. For the ligand n -BIC, the kinetic constants of the last n -BIC molecule to bind to haemoglobin and for the first n-BIC molecule to leave fully liganded haemoglobin show very little pH variation for either the $\alpha$ - or the $\beta$-chains (Olson and Gibson, 1971). Proton release with this ligand therefore seems to be complete by the stage when three ligands are bound to haemoglobin. For oxygen binding, however, there is some pH dependence of the rate constants for dissociation of the first oxygen molecule from fully oxygenated haemoglobin (see Table 12). There is a factor of about 2.5 between the "off" constant at pH 6.0 and pH 9.0 , it being larger at lower pH . Olson et al. (1971) have measured the separate constants within the tetramer for the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains and the $\alpha$-chains appear to have slightly more pH variation than the $\beta$ 's. If the fourth "on" constants for oxygenation do not vary with pH in the same way as the "off" constants, then the affinity for the fourth oxygen to bind to haemoglobin will have significant pH variation. It would correspond to a proton release of about a third of the average number of protons per subunit.

Since the "off" constant for oxygen dissociation from free chains does not have the same pH dependence as that observed in the tetramer (McDonald and Noble, 1972) the last step in binding to haemoglobin is not exactly equivalent to binding to free chains. Nevertheless the last step in binding to haemoglobin is much more like binding to free chains than is the first step. Indications of structural changes at the haems in liganded haemoglobin associated with changes in pH were mentioned in section 3.6. No change in the electronic absorption spectrum of oxyhaemoglobin is noticeable with change of pH, but changes in the haem environment can be detected by NMR methods. Cyanomet haemoglobin shows more change in NMR resonances from the haems with pH change than do the free cyano met subunits, and pH affects the ring current shifted resonance of carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin. These spectral changes may be associated with the different effect of pH change on the ligand binding properties at the last step in haemoglobin binding and in free chains.

The conclusions for proton release with ligand binding are that, in the early stages, proton release is directly linked to ligand binding although unequal numbers of protons may be released from the $\alpha$-and $\beta$-subunits. Most of the proton release is complete by the time the third ligand is bound to normal haemoglobin with less than $10 \%$ of the total release occurring in the last step.

\subsection*{4.1.4. The binding of protons to partially oxidized haemoglobin}

The shape of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curves shows a clear variation with pH and non-linearity of proton release with percentage oxidation is observed (Brunori
et al., 1965). There is a decrease in $n$ with decreasing pH , as illustrated in Fig. 13, and the lag in proton release is more noticeable at lower pH than at pH 8.0 . Brunori et al. (1968a) have suggested that the variation in $n$ with pH is due to the heterogeneity between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains being more marked at low pH than at high pH (see section 3.7).

Heterogeneity between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the oxidation of normal haemoglobin has been observed (MacQuarrie and Gibson, 1971) and at partial oxidation there are less oxidized $\beta$-chains than oxidized $\alpha$-chains. This effect is observed at both pH 6.0 and pH 8.7 and therefore does not seem to be connected with the change in $n$ values between these two pH (Fig. 13). Also the fact that the proportion of oxidized $\alpha$-chains to that of oxidized $\beta$-chains is the same at the two pH values, does not parallel the relative oxidation-reduction potentials of the free $\beta_{4^{-}}$and $\alpha$-subunits at these pH values. Banerjee and Cassoly (1969a) find that $\beta_{4}$ has a higher half-reduction potential than $\alpha$-chains at low pH but an equal half-reduction potential to that of $\alpha$-chains at pH 8.0 . The explanation of the difference in behaviour in oxidation and oxygenation is therefore not simply the greater heterogeneity between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in oxidation as opposed to oxygenation.

\subsection*{4.2. The Interaction of Haemoglobin with Organic Phosphates and Other Salts}

The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is influenced by the presence of salts (Antonini et al., 1962) and the presence of organic phosphates, in particular 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) (Benesch and Benesch, 1967; Chanutin and Curnish, 1967). Figure 10a illustrates the dependence of the oxygen equilibrium curve on the presence of NaCl , and the addition of DPG and IHP. The data are taken from Tyuma et al. (1973a) and Imai (1974) and the Adair constants of the equilibrium curves are given in Table 14. The effect on the oxygen equilibrium shows that deoxyhaemoglobin has a higher affinity for salts and organic phosphates than has oxyhaemoglobin.

\subsection*{4.2.1. Direct measurement of the binding of organic phosphate and salts}

2,3-Diphosphoglycerate binding to deoxyhaemoglobin has been shown to have a stoichiometry of one mole per mole tetramer in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl and at haemoglobin concentrations of about $10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$. The association constant for DPG binding to deoxyhaemoglobin is pH dependent and is about $10^{5} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$. At higher NaCl concentrations, the binding of DPG to deoxyhaemoglobin is decreased, suggesting competition between NaCl and DPG for the same binding site. At low ionic strength the binding of DPG to deoxyhaemoglobin is increased and more than one mole per mole tetramer may be bound. The value of the association constant for DPG binding at several pH's is shown in Table 13a (Benesch et al., 1969; Benesch et al., 1971). Under conditions when the haemoglobin concentration is as low as $10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$, binding to oxyhaemoglobin cannot be detected directly. However, both oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin show measurable binding of DPG in conditions corresponding to those in the red cell (Berger et al., 1973). The association constants obtained by Berger et al. are shown in Table 13b for comparison with those obtained at lower haemoglobin concentrations.

Inositol hexaphosphate has been shown to have an association constant for oxyhaemoglobin of about $10^{6} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ at pH 7.0 in 0.11 m NaCl . The stoichiometry of binding is one mole IHP per mole haemoglobin (Gray and Gibson, 1971b). A very similar association constant is found for the binding of IHP to methaemoglobin at pH 6.0 in 0.2 m bis-tris buffer, where the stoichiometry is also one mole IHP per mole tetramer (Perutz et al., 1974b). The binding of IHP to deoxyhaemoglobin is too great for the association constant to be measured.

Sodium chloride binding to oxy-, carbonmonoxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin has been studied by NMR quadrupole relaxation methods (Chiancone et al., 1972). Chloride binds to many sites and the high affinity binding sites have been shown to be oxygen linked, with deoxyhaemoglobin binding more at these sites than oxyhaemoglobin. Chloride and organic phosphates compete for the same high affinity binding site.

DPG binding to isolated subunits has been investigated by Benesch et al. (1968).

There is no binding to the monomeric $\alpha$-chains, whereas the $\beta_{4}$-tetramer binds DPG with equal affinity in its oxy and deoxy forms with a stoichiometry of one mole per mole tetramer.

\subsection*{4.2.2. Indirect estimates of organic phosphate binding}

As discussed in section 2.6.2, the effect of organic phosphates on the median ligand activity of oxygen binding is related to the binding constants for the phosphates to oxyand deoxyhaemoglobin. Therefore, if a direct measurement of organic phosphate binding to either oxy- or deoxyhaemoglobin is not obtainable experimentally, the binding constant can be estimated from the effect on the median ligand activity or value of $p_{50}$.

An estimate of the association constant for DPG binding to oxyhaemoglobin can be made from the dependence of $\log p_{m}$ on DPG concentration studied by Tyuma et al. (1973a). The data are illustrated in Fig. 10b and the Adair constants fitted to the equilibrium curves are shown in Table 14 together with the values of $\log p_{50}$ and $\log p_{m}$. From eq. (2.19) writing $x=[\mathrm{DPG}], B_{0}$ as the association constant of DPG to deoxyhaemoglobin, and $B_{4}$ that to oxyhaemoglobin

This equation applies if the stoichiometry of binding to oxyhaemoglobin is also one mole per tetramer of haemoglobin, and if the concentration of free DPG is effectively constant during oxygenation. The latter is true for the data of Tyuma et al. in Table 14 since DPG is in large excess over haemoglobin. The value for $B_{0}$ at $\mathrm{pH} 7.4,25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, is $3.6 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ as deduced by Tyuma et al. (1973a) from the data of Benesch et al. (1971) and Benesch et al. (1969). $B_{4}$ is then estimated to be $2.2 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ from the above equation and the data corresponding to the largest excess of DPG. Thus, although binding to oxyhaemoglobin cannot be measured directly in these conditions its association constant can be estimated to be about $2.2 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, if the stoichiometry of binding is one mole per mole oxyhaemoglobin. This can be compared with the value of $2.5 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of Berger et al. (1973) given in Table 13b.

An estimate of the association constant of IHP to deoxyhaemoglobin can be made by the same method. From the change in $\log p_{50}$ at pH 7.0 in the presence and absence of IHP taken from Fig. 12 and using the binding constant of IHP to oxyhaemoglobin measured by Gray and Gibson (1971b), $10^{6} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$, the association constant of IHP to deoxyhaemoglobin is estimated to be $10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$.

\subsection*{4.2.3. The binding sites for DPG, IHP and salts}

DPG binds to deoxyhaemoglobin with a stoichiometry of one mole per tetramer indicating the probability of a binding site on the dyad axis of the molecule, and it also binds to the $\beta_{4}$ tetramer suggesting a site between the $\beta$-chains (Benesch et al., 1968). DPG has a much smaller effect on the oxygen equilibrium of those haemoglobins which lack the free N -terminal amino group of the $\beta$-chains (Bunn and Briehl, 1970). From model building studies, Perutz (1970) showed that it is possible for DPG to bind between the $N$-terminal amino groups of the $\beta$-chains on the dyad axis of the molecule in the deoxyhaemoglobin structure, but that the space between the $\beta$-chains at the same site is too small in oxyhaemoglobin.

The exact position of DPG in this binding site has now been found by X-ray analysis of the human deoxyhaemoglobin structure with DPG bound (Arnone, 1972). The anionic groups of DPG form salt bridges with seven cationic groups of the $\beta$-chains which include the $\alpha$-amino group of valine $1 \beta$, histidine $2 \beta$ and histidine $143 \beta$ of both chains and lysine $82 \beta$ of one chain (see Fig. 11a). In addition to binding at this site, DPG produces small changes in tertiary structure in the $\beta$-chains including the pulling of the $\alpha$-amino groups together, resulting in a movement of the A helices. This work also revealed that the binding of DPG displaces an inorganic anion from a position between Lys $82 \beta$ and the N-terminus, giving a structural interpretation of the competition between DPG and NaCl binding. Yet further confirmation of the phosphate binding site in deoxyhaemoglobin is provided by the study of the binding of pyridoxal phosphate. This was shown to bind to the N -terminus of the $\beta$-chains (Benesch et al., 1972).

The binding site for DPG in oxyhaemoglobin has not yet been identified. DPG cannot bind in exactly the same site in oxyhaemoglobin as in deoxyhaemoglobin as the space between the $\beta$-chains is narrower and there would not be room for it. It has been shown that pyridoxal phosphate and other pyridoxal derivatives bind to oxyhaemoglobin at the N -terminus of the $\alpha$-chains indicating that this site is a possibility (Benesch et al., 1972, 1973).

IHP has been shown to bind to the same binding site in deoxyhaemoglobin as that for DPG (Arnone and Perutz, 1974) with the six phosphates coordinated to the same basic groups that bind DPG (see Fig. 11b). In addition to these eight basic groups the amino groups of the asparagines $139 \beta$ may form hydrogen bonds with two of the phosphate groups of IHP. IHP produces tertiary structure changes in the $\beta$-chains similar to those produced when DPG is bound. These changes may be associated with the difference in affinity of haemoglobin for its first ligand in the presence and absence of DPG and IHP (see section 4.2.4). The binding site for IHP in oxyhaemoglobin has not yet been

identified, but in methaemoglobin it is believed to bind to the same site as in deoxyhaemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1974b).

\subsection*{4.2.4. The binding of organic phosphates to partially oxygenated haemoglobin}

The change of shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve in the presence of organic phosphates is illustrated by the data of Tyuma et al. (1973a) (Fig. 10 a,b and Table 14). A change of shape with type of salt and to a lesser extent with change in DPG concentration is seen. In the case of Fig. 10b, the change of shape is small and the value of Hill's constant hardly changes with DPG concentration, but differences show up in the Adair constants in Table 14. As discussed in section 2.6, this change of shape implies non-uniform release of bound anions and organic phosphates with oxygenation.

Very little bound chloride or DPG is released from haemoglobin in the final ligation step with oxygen as shown by the almost unaltered values of $A_{4}^{\prime}$ in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl and DPG. The constancy of $A_{4}^{\prime}$ in these conditions is consistent with kinetic findings. Gibson (1970) has shown that the kinetic constants for the last step in oxygenation are the same in low ionic strength buffer as in the presence of phosphate. Olson and Gibson (1971) have shown that the kinetic constants for the last step in n-BIC binding are not affected by DPG. Salhany et al. (1972) have shown that the rate of oxygen dissociation from fully liganded haemoglobin is not affected by DPG. All the results indicate that in the presence of DPG, $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3}$ has the oxy quaternary structure as it also has in the absence of DPG.

The difference in $A_{4}^{\prime}$ caused by the presence of IHP combined with the evidence that IHP does not bind to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-monomers shows that some IHP is released from haemoglobin in the final step of oxygenation. The change in $A_{4}^{\prime}$ with IHP is consistent with kinetic findings. IHP affects the kinetic constants of the last binding step for carbon monoxide binding (Gray and Gibson, 1971b).

The difference in $A_{1}^{\prime}$ when organic phosphates are present indicate that organic phosphates and salts are released from haemoglobin in the first oxygenation step. Kinetic findings are again consistent with the equilibrium results. Gibson (1970) showed the kinetic constants for the first oxygenation step to be different in the presence and absence of phosphates, the greatest difference being in the "off" constant. Gray and Gibson (1971a, b) have found a decrease in the rate of ligand uptake in the presence of IHP.

From the change in $A_{1}^{\prime}$ with type of organic phosphate, estimates can be made of the change in the free energy of binding the first ligand, RT $\ln A_{1}^{\prime}$, produced by bound salt.

The presence of 0.1 m NaCl increases the free energy of ligand binding by 0.65 kcal per mole haem over its value in low ionic strength buffer. The presence of 2 mm DPG or IHP in addition to 0.1 m NaCl further increases the free energy of ligand binding by 0.5 and 0.75 kcal per mole haem, respectively. Structural changes that could be associated with the differences in $A_{1}^{\prime}$ in the presence and absence of salts and organic phosphates have been suggested by Arnone and Perutz (1974) (section 4.2.3.). Small tertiary structure changes in the $\beta$-subunits are seen when DPG and IHP are bound to deoxyhaemoglobin, suggesting that the effect of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ may result from a changed affinity of the $\beta$-subunit for the first ligand. Olson and Gibson (1972a, 1973a) and Gray and Gibson (1971a) have reported, however, that the $\alpha$-chains are more affected by DPG and IHP than the $\beta$-chains in regard to binding the first ligand.

The release of DPG as a function of ligand saturation has been studied by Huestis and Raftery (1972c) using ${ }^{31} \mathrm{P}$ NMR spectroscopy, and their results show that the fraction of DPG released is less than the fraction of ligand bound at intermediate saturation. Tyuma et al. (1973a) show that their equilibrium results imply a lag in DPG release behind oxygen saturation. Kinetic studies also show that DPG release lags behind ligand uptake. MacQuarrie and Gibson (1972) have used a fluorescent analogue of DPG and followed its release with carbon monoxide uptake.

Release of DPG is therefore not equally linked to each of the four ligation steps. Since no DPG release is associated with the last ligation step which is probably taking place in the oxy quaternary structure, DPG has been released to its full extent by the time this quaternary structure has formed. This conclusion is to be expected from structural considerations since DPG and IHP cannot bind in exactly the same sites in deoxy and in liganded haemoglobin.

\subsection*{4.2.5. The effect of DPG and IHP on the oxygenation Bohr effect}

The presence of DPG alters both the alkaline Bohr effect (Benesch et al., 1969; Bailey et al., 1970; Tomita and Riggs, 1971) and the acid Bohr effect (de Bruin et al., 1971; Riggs and Imamura, 1972). A complete structural interpretation of the altered Bohr effect cannot be given since the binding site for DPG in oxyhaemoglobin is not known, and is certainly different in some way from the binding site in deoxyhaemoglobin. Kilmartin (1974a) has shown that the pH dependence of DPG binding to oxyhaemoglobin differs from that of binding to deoxyhaemoglobin. The binding site for DPG and IHP to deoxyhaemoglobin indicates a structural interpretation of the altered binding of protons to this structure. When DPG or IHP bind, three pairs of positively charged

groups might have their pK's raised, the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\beta$-chains, the histidines $2 \beta$ and the histidines $143 \beta$. The phosphate groups on DPG and IHP would have their pK's lowered on binding to haemoglobin. Figure 12 illustrates the effect of DPG and IHP on the alkaline oxygenation Bohr effect as measured by the dependence of $\log p_{50}$ on pH .

The effect of DPG on the Bohr effect has also been studied by Siggaard-Anderson et al. (1972) who have found a greater difference between the two measures of the Bohr effect when DPG is present than when it is absent. This implies greater non-linearity of proton release with fractional saturation in the presence of DPG than the small non-linearity in its absence. Tyuma et al. (1973b) have also studied the complete oxygen saturation curve at two pH values in the presence and absence of DPG, and their results confirm that the Bohr effect is increased in the presence of DPG. Also very few protons are released at the last binding step in the presence as well as in the absence of DPG, which is consistent with greater non-linearity of proton release with fractional saturation in the presence of DPG.

The extra protons bound to deoxyhaemoglobin when DPG is bound are expected to be released when DPG itself is released, and as DPG shows a lag the fact that the extra protons also do is consistent. The lag in proton release accompanying ligation of haemoglobin in the presence of IHP has been observed in kinetic studies on the binding of carbon monoxide (Olson and Gibson, 1973b).

\subsection*{4.2.6. The effect of organic phosphates on preferential binding of ligands to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains}

Gray and Gibson (1971a, b) have shown that the presence of IHP decreases the rate constant for uptake of carbon monoxide by haemoglobin, and that it produces a large difference in rate constant between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains. This difference in rate for $\alpha$ and $\beta$-chains is not observed in haemoglobin stripped of phosphates, and is not very marked in the presence of inorganic phosphate or DPG. Gray and Gibson suggest that the $\beta$-chains take up carbon monoxide faster than $\alpha$-chains, by analogy with the results with n-BIC, which shows heterogeneity in the absence of phosphates which is amplified by the presence of IHP (Olson and Gibson, 1970). This heterogeneity with n-BIC is observed by NMR methods (Lindstrom et al., 1971) and preferential binding to the $\beta$-chains has been shown. NMR studies have also shown that heterogeneity between $\alpha$ and $\beta$-chains for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding is amplified by the presence of organic phosphates (Johnson and Ho, 1974). Carbon monoxide binds equally to $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in stripped haemoglobin, shows a very slight preference for $\alpha$-chains in the presence of DPG, and a greater preference for $\alpha$-chains in the presence of IHP. Oxygen binding shows a slight preference for $\alpha$-chains in stripped haemoglobin, a marked preference in the presence of DPG and a very marked preference in the presence of IHP, the affinity of the $\alpha$-chain then being greater than that for $\beta$-chains by a factor of 10. Gibson (1973a) also finds differences in the kinetic aspects of carbon monoxide and oxygen binding. These results show that the assumption usually made that carbon monoxide and oxygen binding are equivalent except for a scale factor altering the affinity is not correct in detail, although the overall shape of equilibrium curves and kinetic progress curves appears to be the same.

\subsection*{4.2.7. The decrease in co-operativity for oxidation in the presence of IHP}

The shape of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curves for haemoglobin is sensitive to ionic strength. Brunori et al. (1969) found that the value of $n$ at pH 8.0 was reduced from 2.5 in low ionic strength to 2.0 in high ionic strength. A striking change of shape of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curves has been found in the presence of IHP by Kilmartin (1973). The results are illustrated in Fig. 13 where it can be seen that $n$ is reduced to 1.0 below pH 7.5 . Kilmartin also finds that below pH 7.0 the oxidation Bohr effect is reduced to half the value characteristic of oxidation in the absence of IHP.

Perutz et al. (1974b) have presented evidence that at low pH , in the presence of IHP,

\end{figure}
methaemoglobin has some properties more similar to those of normal deoxyhaemoglobin, than to normal liganded haemoglobin. They find that the circular dichroism spectrum from the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface is that characteristic of deoxyhaemoglobin (section 3.5). Also, the rate of reaction of the -SH group of $\beta 93$ is similar to that of deoxy rather than normal methaemoglobin, being $4.1 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ which can be compared with the normal values given in Table 8. Perutz et al. conclude that the presence of IHP influences methaemoglobin to take up the normal deoxy arrangement of subunits, in other words IHP has prevented the quaternary structure change that normally occurs on oxidation. The $n$ value of 1 , and the reduced Bohr effect are therefore associated with the absence of the quaternary structure change.

Conformation differences at the haem groups between methaemoglobin in the presence and absence of IHP have also been found (Perutz et al., 1974b). There are differences in the electronic absorption spectrum of the haem groups, in the NMR spectra from haem contact residues, and in the paramagnetic susceptibility. Methaemoglobin has a higher susceptibility in the presence of IHP, showing that the spin equilibrium of the ferric iron (section 3.1) has been influenced towards higher spin. Perutz et al. suggest an interpretation for the spectral changes and for the change in spin equilibrium. They attribute them to the iron atom being held further out of the plane of the porphyrin ring with consequent lengthening of the iron-nitrogen bonds when the subunits are in the deoxy quaternary structure in the presence of IHP, than when the subunits are in the oxy quaternary structure in the absence of IHP.

In section 3.6, evidence that the deoxyhaemoglobin quaternary structure imposes constraints on the position of the iron atom in deoxy subunits was discussed in connection with the electronic absorption spectrum differences between deoxyhaemoglobin and deoxy free chains. On the same interpretation, the constraints of the deoxyhaemoglobin quaternary structure have not been removed by the time the four haems are oxidized when IHP is present. In oxidation in the presence of IHP the deoxy arrangement of subunits is preserved and there is no co-operativity whilst in oxygenation in the presence of IHP or in oxidation in the absence of IHP, there is a change in quaternary structure and significant co-operativity. These important results on the abolition of co-operativity and the reduction of the Bohr effect by stabilizing the deoxy arrangement of subunits, and on the association of changes in absorption spectrum with changes in quaternary structure in methaemoglobin, will be discussed again in sections 6 and 7 when the model of haemoglobin function that these and other results support will be discussed.

\section*{5. MUTANT AND CHEMICALLY MODIFIED HAEMOGLOBINS}

The oxygen affinity and co-operativity of haemoglobin are altered by changes in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chains. The substitution of a different amino acid in an important position, in contact with one of the haem groups or in one of the regions of contact between subunits, has a drastic effect on the oxygen equilibrium properties (Perutz and Lehmann, 1968) as does the removal of the C-terminal residues by chemical modification (Antonini et al., 1961; Kilmartin and Hewitt, 1971). Haemoglobins that are abnormal due to a mutation or chemical modification can be discussed in

two groups. The first group comprises those in which all four subunits can combine reversibly with oxygen even though normal function is impaired. The second group comprises those in which the abnormality keeps the iron atoms of one type of subunit permanently in the ferric state, so that reversible combination with oxygen is possible only for the two normal subunits.

\subsection*{5.1. Abnormal Haemoglobins with Four Binding Sites for Oxygen}

A particularly interesting group of abnormal haemoglobins will be discussed here. These are mutants and chemically modified haemoglobins where the replacement residue or modification affects the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface or the C-terminal residues whose polar contacts contribute to the stability of deoxyhaemoglobin. The three-dimensional structures of many of these haemoglobins have been studied, as well as their functional properties. Table 15 collects together published data on their structure and properties. Equilibrium data taken under similar conditions have been selected where available, and the haemoglobins are listed in order of decreasing $\Delta \log p_{50}$, where
$$\Delta \log p_{50}=\log p_{50}(\text { abnormal } \mathrm{Hb})-\log p_{50}(\mathrm{HbA} \text { control })$$
$\Delta \log p_{50}$ has been used to list the haemoglobins in order of their oxygen affinities to allow for the difference in temperature and conditions at which the different haemoglobins have been studied.

At the beginning and end of the list of abnormal haemoglobin properties in Table 15 are the values of $\log p_{50}$ that correspond to the affinities of normal haemoglobin for its first and last oxygen molecule, i.e. $-\log A_{i}^{\prime}$ and $-\log A_{4}^{\prime}$, respectively. The values of $A_{i}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ are taken from data of Tyuma et al. (1973a) and Imai (1974). The affinities of the abnormal haemoglobins lie in the range between these values. At one end of the list Hb Kansas has low oxygen affinity and low co-operativity, at the other end of the list are haemoglobins with very high affinity and no co-operativity, whilst in between are haemoglobins with intermediate affinity and significant co-operativity.

\subsection*{5.1.1. The oxygen binding properties in relation to structure}

In section 2.4 it was shown that the median ligand activity of a haemoglobin was related to that of the free subunits by the eq. (2.15)
$$\log p_{m}=\log p_{s}+\frac{1}{4} \log \frac{K S_{0}}{K S_{4}}$$
where $K S_{0}$ and $K S_{4}$ are the association constants of subunits to tetramers in the haemoglobin. If the free subunits are not equivalent
$$\log p_{s}=\frac{1}{2} \log p_{\alpha}+\frac{1}{2} \log p_{\beta}$$

For an abnormal haemoglobin, the intrinsic affinity of the free subunits or the association constants of subunits to tetramers may be altered. Data for the oxygen affinity of normal free $\alpha$ and $\beta$-chains were given in Table 1. Kilmartin et al. (1974) have studied the oxygen affinity of a number of modified isolated chains, and these data are shown in Table 16. Included also in Table 16 are two measurements of the affinities of mutant $\beta$-chains, from Hb Rainier (Stamatoyannopoulos and Yoshida, 1969) and Hb

Table 17 compares the $\log p_{50}$ values of abnormal haemoglobins with their corresponding values of $\log p_{s}$. The latter values were calculated for each haemoglobin on the assumption that the affinity of $\beta_{4}$ is a reasonable estimate of that for the $\beta$-monomer, and taking the appropriate values for the modified chains from Table 16. For three of the abnormal haemoglobins, NES des(Arg), des(Arg.His), des(Arg.Tyr) the actual $\log p_{50}$ of the haemoglobin is almost exactly equal to $\log p_{5}$. So from equation (5.1) $K S_{0} \approx K S_{4}$. These three haemoglobins are not co-operative in oxygen binding. All the co-operative haemoglobins in Table 17 have lower oxygen affinities than the corresponding $\log p_{s}$, including Hb Rainier which, in spite of having very high affinity, is slightly co-operative.

High affinity non-cooperative haemoglobins, such as NES des(Arg) and des(Arg. His) which have $\log p_{50}$ values essentially equal to the values for their free chains, have been studied by X-ray analysis and are known to have the oxy quaternary structure for both their oxy and deoxy forms (Perutz et al., 1974a), which may be the structural reason why $K S_{0} \approx K S_{4}$ for these haemoglobins. Two other high affinity, noncooperative haemoglobins, whose isolated chain affinities are not available for comparison, also have the oxy quaternary structure for both their oxy and deoxy forms. These are BME Hb, that is haemoglobin reacted with bis(N-maleimidomethyl)ether (Simon et al., 1967) and Hb Kempsey (Perutz et al., 1974a). All of these haemoglobins lack at least one of the stabilizing interactions that are present in the normal deoxyhaemoglobin structure. These were listed in Table 7. Another distinctive property of the deoxy forms of high affinity haemoglobins is that they have electron absorption spectra from the haems similar to those of free chains rather than that of normal deoxyhaemoglobin (Antonini and Brunori, 1971). This property is possessed by several of these haemoglobins in low ionic strength buffer, including des(His.Tyr) (Antonini

and Brunori, 1971), BME Hb (Simon et al., 1971), Hb Bethesda (Olson and Gibson, 1972b), NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr), and Hb Kempsey (Perutz et al., 1974a). Put together, this evidence suggests that in these haemoglobins the free chains associate into tetramers that have the oxy quaternary arrangement whatever the state of ligation, and that in this arrangement the structure of the subunits is not modified in a way that alters either their oxygen affinities or their absorption spectra. This conclusion parallels that in section 3.6 where it was shown that for binding the last oxygen to normal haemoglobin the affinity and the absorption spectrum are the same as those for free chains while the haemoglobin molecule has the oxy quaternary structure at this stage of ligation.

The co-operative haemoglobins listed in Tables 15 and 17 have been shown by X-ray analysis to have the normal quaternary structures in their oxy and deoxy forms. The deoxy forms also give the same absorption spectrum as normal deoxyhaemoglobin. As discussed in section 2.6.1, differences in $\log p_{50}\left(\right.$ or $\left.\log p_{m}\right)$ between these haemoglobins must be associated with structural differences altering the stabilities of their oxy or deoxy forms relative to those of normal oxy and deoxyhaemoglobin, either due to altered intrinsic affinities of the free subunits or to the altered association constants of the subunits to the tetramer. Column 3 of Table 15 gives where possible a description of the structural interpretation of differences of the stability of the oxy or deoxy form from their normal values.

As discussed in section 2.5, the affinity of the last molecule of oxygen to bind to normal haemoglobin is similar to the free chains affinity. This has also been demonstrated for a few abnormal haemoglobins whose equilibrium curves have been studied over the complete saturation range. Table 17 includes the values of $-\log A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $-\log A_{4}^{\prime}$ determined by Imai (1973) for the modified haemoglobins NES Hb and des(His.Tyr) in the presence of DPG. In both cases $-\log A_{4}^{\prime}$ is nearly the same as $-\log A_{4}$, defined by eq. (2.18). As with normal haemoglobin, the co-operativity of abnormal haemoglobins is associated with a lowered affinity for the first oxygen to bind, and an affinity for the last ligand like the free chains value.

The difference in $n$ values between the abnormal haemoglobins can be explained only by an understanding of how the modifications alter the stability of the partially liganded states. These $n$ values will be discussed later when a model of the intermediate structures has been introduced.

\subsection*{5.1.2. The effect of ionic strength changes and the presence of organic phosphates on the affinity and co-operativity}

High affinity haemoglobins. In common with the other high affinity non-cooperative haemoglobins, des(His.Tyr) in low ionic strength buffer has a deoxy absorption spectrum like free chains which is characteristic of deoxyhaemoglobins in the oxy quaternary structure. The same haemoglobin crystallizes in the deoxy quaternary structure (Perutz and TenEyck, 1971). So deoxy des(His.Tyr) appears to be in either quaternary structure depending on solution conditions. It has also been shown to regain co-operativity and to regain the deoxy absorption spectrum normally associated with co-operative haemoglobins, when IHP is present (Bonaventura et al., 1972).

There are other high affinity, normally non-cooperative haemoglobins, whose properties are altered by change in ionic strength, in particular by the presence of IHP. Hb Bethesda and Hb Rainier become more co-operative and have lowered affinity in the presence of DPG (Hayashi and Stamatoyannopoulos, 1972). Hb Bethesda is fast reacting towards ligand and has a chain-like absorption spectrum in the absence of IHP, but is slowly reacting and has an absorption spectrum like deoxyhaemoglobin on the addition of IHP (Olson and Gibson, 1972b). Also the haemoglobins NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr) (Kilmartin et al., 1974) and Hb Kempsey (Bunn et al., 1974) have lowered affinity and increased co-operativity in the presence of DPG and IHP. Table 18 shows the effect on $\log p_{50}$ and $n$ that is produced by adding DPG or IHP to these and other haemoglobins. The value of $\log p_{50}$ in stripped conditions is given, and $\Delta \log p_{50}$ produced by adding DPG or IHP. By equation (2.19), in section 2.6.2, $\Delta \log p_{m}$ the
change in $\log p_{m}$ in the presence of DPG is
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta \log p_{m} & =\log p_{m, \mathrm{dpg}}-\log p_{m, 0} \\
& =\frac{1}{4}\left[\log \left(1+B_{0}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)-\log \left(1+B_{4}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)\right]
\end{aligned}$$
where $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{0}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_{4}$ are the association constants for DPG binding to deoxy and fully liganded haemoglobin. If the association constants $\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_{4}$ are unaltered by modifications to the protein, $\Delta \log p_{m}$ would be the same for abnormal haemoglobins in the presence of the same concentration of DPG. Only for Hb Chesapeake, des(Arg), NES Hb and Hb Hiroshima is this approximately true (see Table 18).

Perutz et al. (1974a) discuss evidence that the restoration of co-operativity by IHP for the haemoglobins NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr) and Hb Kempsey is correlated with the restored ability of the deoxy forms to take up the deoxy quaternary structure. There is evidence from changes in the spectra from aromatic residues in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface and from the reactivity of the - SH groups of $\beta 93$, that the deoxy forms of these haemoglobins have the normal deoxy quaternary arrangement in the presence of IHP whereas they have the oxy quaternary arrangement in its absence. Also in these and other high affinity haemoglobins, the absorption spectrum from the deoxy haem groups becomes like that of normal deoxyhaemoglobin when co-operativity is restored in the presence of organic phosphates whereas it was like that of free deoxy chains in their absence. Organic phosphates can therefore stabilize abnormal haemoglobins in the deoxy quaternary structure, and with the restoration of this structure with its associated absorption spectrum, co-operativity is restored. This conclusion will appear later as an important factor in suggesting a model of haemoglobin function.

Haemoglobins with low values of $n$ and fairly high affinity in the absence of organic phosphates such as des(Arg) and Hb Chesapeake, NES Hb and Hb Hiroshima have their $\log p_{50}$ values increased and their co-operativity increased in the presence of DPG and IHP (see Table 18). Deoxy des(Arg) haemoglobin also shows evidence of both the deoxy and oxy quaternary structures being present together in solution in some conditions. The deoxy form of human des(Arg) crystallizes isomorphously with normal human deoxy haemoglobin. The deoxy form of horse des(Arg), however, crystallizes isomorphously with normal horse oxyhaemoglobin, in spite of the fact that the functional properties of the two species are very similar. This suggests that in solution, the structure of des(Arg) of both species is a mixture of the two quaternary structures, and that the crystal form obtained is determined by the relative solubilities of the two quaternary structures for each species. The solubility of human deoxyhaemoglobin is less than that of human oxy, whereas the solubility of horse deoxyhaemoglobin is greater than that of horse oxy (Perutz and TenEyck, 1971).

Haemoglobin Kansas with low value of $n$ and low affinity shows no noticeable change in $n$ in the presence of DPG at pH 7.0 (Gibson et al., 1973). The effect of DPG on the oxygen affinity of Hb Kansas is much smaller than its affect on HbA . Ogawa et al. (1972c) present NMR evidence that in the presence of organic phosphates Hb Kansas has its oxygenated form in the deoxy quaternary structure.

\subsection*{5.1.3. The Bohr effects}

The Bohr effects included in Table 15 are estimated as a percentage of the normal value of ( $\Delta \log p_{50} / \Delta \mathrm{pH}$ ) between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 . For the significantly co-operative haemoglobins (from $\alpha_{2}^{c} \beta_{2}$ to Hb Chesapeake in Table 15) the Bohr effect is $100 \%$ of the normal value except in those cases where a known Bohr group (section 4.1.2) has been perturbed or removed. For example, des(His), NES Hb and Hb Hiroshima all have the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge missing, and cyanate-blocked haemoglobin has the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chains blocked. The non-cooperative haemoglobins which have the quaternary structure of normal oxyhaemoglobin and do not change it whatever the state of ligation, all have reduced or negligible Bohr effects. The significance of the Bohr effects of abnormal haemoglobins will be discussed further in section 7 in the light of the model of haemoglobin function. The Bohr effects of des(Arg), NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr), Hb Kempsey and des(His.Tyr) are all increased
in the presence of IHP (Table 18) and the significance of this will also be discussed in section 7.

\subsection*{5.2. The M Mutants and the Mixed-valency Hybrids}

The M mutants are the class of haemoglobins in which the iron atoms of one type of chain are permanently oxidized as a result of the replacement of a haem contact residue. Related to the M mutants are the artificially produced mixed-valency hybrids, which are obtained by reassembling free $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains after one type of chain has been oxidized (Banerjee and Cassoly, 1969b; Haber and Koshland, 1969; Brunori et al., 1970). The mixed-valency hybrids are possible analogues of the intermediate structures formed during the ligation of normal haemoglobin and as such are particularly interesting.

Data on the oxygen equilibrium properties of M mutants and mixed-valency hybrids are shown in Table 19, where it can be seen that their $\log p_{50}$ values lie in the range between $-\log A_{1}^{\prime}$ for normal haemoglobin and $\log p_{50}$ of the free ferrous $\alpha$-or $\beta$-chain.

When only two chains can bind oxygen, the analogous expression to eq. (5.1) for the relation between $\log p_{m}$ and $\log p_{s}$ is
$$\log p_{m}=\log p_{s}+\frac{1}{2} \log \frac{K_{M 0}}{K_{M 2}}$$
where $p_{s}$ denotes the median ligand activity of the free ferrous subunit, and $K_{M 0}$ and $K_{M 2}$ are the association constants of subunits to tetramers when there are 0 or 2 oxygen molecules bound to the ferrous subunits.

The change in oxygen affinity produced by the binding of organic phosphates is given by the analogous equation to (5.2)
$$\begin{aligned}
\Delta \log p_{m} & =\log p_{m, D P G}-\log p_{m, 0} \\
& =\frac{1}{2}\left[\log \left(1+B_{M 0}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)-\log \left(1+B_{M 2}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)\right]
\end{aligned}$$
where $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{M} \mathbf{0}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{M 2}}$ denote the association constants for organic phosphate to the abnormal haemoglobin with 0 and 2 oxygen molecules bound to the normal ferrous subunits. Table 20 shows the change in oxygen affinity produced by the presence of organic phosphates for those M mutants and hybrids for which this has been determined.

The low affinity, non-cooperative haemoglobins M Iwate and M Boston, both of which have normal $\beta$-chains, have oxygen affinities very similar to that of normal haemoglobin for its first ligand (Table 19). The structures of these haemoglobins have been studied by X-ray techniques. Greer (1971b) determined the structure of fully reduced Hb Iwate (i.e. the structure with the normal $\beta$-chains and the abnormal met $\alpha$-chains both reduced). This structure had the same quaternary arrangement of subunits as in normal deoxyhaemoglobin, and it could be oxidized in the crystals without them breaking up, showing that met Hb Iwate could exist in the deoxy quaternary structure. Two other forms of Hb Iwate have now been crystallized (Perutz and Frier, personal communication). One is the form of deoxy Hb Iwate in which the abnormal $\alpha$-chains are still in the met form. Its crystals differ from those of the fully reduced form and the quaternary structure is still unknown, although the unit cell dimensions suggest the deoxy quaternary structure. The other form that has been crystallized is carbonmonoxy Hb Iwate in which the $\alpha$-chains are still met and the normal $\beta$-chains combined with carbon monoxide. These crystals are similar to those of normal carbonmonoxyhaemoglobin. Hb Iwate therefore has the deoxy quaternary structure if the normal $\beta$-chains are deoxy or met but the oxy quaternary structure if they are combined with carbon monoxide. Slightly different properties have been found for Hb Boston which crystallizes in the normal deoxy form when deoxygenated but in a form isomorphous with carbonmonoxy Hb Iwate when its normal $\beta$-chains are met (Pulsinelli et al., 1973).

The oxygen affinity of Hb Iwate is altered very little by the presence of DPG (Table 20), showing that the association constants for DPG of its oxy and deoxy forms are very alike.

This may be connected with the result that in some conditions liganded Hb Iwate seems to have the deoxy quaternary structure.

The $M$ mutants with some co-operativity and near normal values of $\log p_{50}$ (Table 19) probably all have the normal deoxy quaternary structure for their deoxygenated forms and change quaternary structure on ligation to that of normal met haemoglobin. The deoxy forms of both M Hyde Park and M Milwaukee have been studied by X-ray analysis and have normal deoxy quaternary structures (Greer, 1971b; Perutz et al., 1972) and their met forms are isomorphous with normal met haemoglobin.

The oxygen-binding properties of Hb Milwaukee are greatly influenced by organic phosphates (Table 20). The oxygen affinity is decreased and the co-operativity is abolished. As mentioned above, Hb Milwaukee is in the normal quaternary structures in its oxy and deoxy forms. This explains the large effect of DPG on its oxygen affinity since in eq. (5.4) $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{M 0}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{M 2}}$ will have similar values to $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbf{0}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_{4}$ for normal haemoglobin and the factor $\frac{1}{2}$ in eq. (5.4) as compared to $\frac{1}{4}$ in eq. (5.2) leads to an approximately doubled effect on $\Delta \log p_{50}$ (see Table 18 for $\Delta \log p_{50}$ of normal HbA ). The lack of co-operativity in the presence of DPG or IHP has been correlated with the absence of certain spectral changes at the abnormal haems when the normal haems bind ligand in these conditions (Perutz et al., 1972; Lindstrom et al., 1972a). Normally in this haemoglobin, ligation of the $\alpha$-chains influences the abnormal $\beta$-chain haems as shown by changes in their optical absorption and NMR spectra. In the presence of IHP when co-operativity is absent, these spectral changes are also absent. Other experimental results related to this effect come from the studies of Hayashi et al. (1967) on the change in EPR spectrum of the abnormal met haems of $M$ haemoglobins caused by change of ligation state of the normal ferrous haems. In Hb Hyde Park, which changes quaternary structure on ligation and is co-operative like Hb Milwaukee, spectral differences are seen from the abnormal $\beta$-haems when the ligation state of the $\alpha$-chains is altered. On the other hand, in Hb Boston, which is non-cooperative like Hb Milwaukee in the presence of DPG, spectral differences are not seen at the abnormal $\alpha$-haems when the ligation state at the normal $\beta$-haems is changed. This important result will be discussed again when the model of haemoglobin function is considered in section 6.

The artificial mixed-valency hybrids with either chain in the met form have higher oxygen affinities than the M mutants. With azide or cyanide bound to the ferric haem, when the iron atom is low spin, the oxygen affinity of the ferrous chains is quite like that of the corresponding isolated subunits, whilst with fluoride or the water molecule as ligand on the ferric haem, the oxygen affinity is lower. The measured $n$ values are all quite small (Banerjee and Cassoly, 1969b; Banerjee et al., 1973). Preliminary X-ray studies of the deoxy/cyanomet hybrid $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ have shown that it crystallizes in the same crystal form as deoxy Hb Iwate, the quaternary structure of which is not yet
known but is probably that of deoxyhaemoglobin (Perutz and Kilmartin, personal communication).

The oxygen binding properties of the cyanomet hybrids are influenced by the presence of DPG (Table 20). The properties of $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ are only very slightly altered, whereas those of $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ are altered more, with $n$ changing from 1.2 to 1.5 . The effect of organic phosphates on the ligand binding properties of these hybrids has also been studied kinetically (Cassoly et al., 1971; Cassoly and Gibson, 1972). Table 21 shows the kinetic constants for uptake of carbon monoxide by the hybrids in the presence and absence of DPG and IHP. Cassoly and Gibson find that for both hybrids stripped of phosphates, and for $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ in the presence of DPG, ligand uptake is biphasic, the fast rate being similar to the rate shown by free chains and the slow rate similar to that seen in normal deoxyhaemoglobin. The table shows the percentages of fast and slow phases in each case. The fast phase is absent for the hybrid $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ in the presence of DPG and for both hybrids in the presence of IHP. The presence of these two phases, in proportions influenced by the presence of organic phosphates, one with ligand binding properties similar to free chains and the other with ligand binding properties similar to deoxyhaemoglobin, have been interpreted as indicating the presence in solution of two conformations of the haemoglobin molecule. If this interpretation is made the two

forms cannot be in rapid equilibrium, and the half-time for conversion between them would be greater than 50 msec . This half-time is much longer than that associated with the conformation changes that accompany ligation. For example, quickly reacting haemoglobin obtained by flash photolysis decays to the normal slowly reacting form with a half-time of the order of 2 msec at $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Gibson, 1959). Also the speed of liberation of protons (Antonini et al., 1965b) and the shape of the kinetic oxygenation curve (Berger et al., 1967) indicates that conformation changes occur rapidly in comparison with the rate of reaction with ligand, with half-times estimated to be lower than 1 msec . Also conformation changes occurring at -SH group of $\beta 93$ associated with ligation occur in less than 1 msec (Antonini and Brunori, 1969).

NMR studies of the cyanomet hybrids also show the presence of an equilibrium between two conformations of the deoxy hybrids that is influenced by organic phosphates (Ogawa and Shulman, 1971, 1972). When the deoxy hybrids are stripped of phosphates, the conformation of the cyanomet haems as deduced from their NMR spectra is like that in fully cyanomet haemoglobin, whereas in the presence of. IHP, the conformation of the cyanomet haem is different. For the hybrid $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ the addition of DPG does not affect the spectrum from the $\beta$-cyanomet haems whereas for the hybrid $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ the addition of DPG has the same effect as IHP on the spectrum from the $\alpha$-cyanomet haem. Ogawa and Shulman interpret their results as showing that in the absence of organic phosphates, deoxy/cyanomet hybrids have a quaternary conformation like that of fully liganded haemoglobin, correlating with the fast ligand binding
kinetics, high affinity and no co-operativity seen in the studies of ligand binding to the normal ferrous haems. In contrast, in the presence of DPG or IHP, the interpretation is that the deoxy hybrids, with their altered NMR spectrum from the cyanomet haems, have the normal deoxy quaternary structure, correlating with slow ligand binding kinetics, slightly lower affinity and some co-operativity. When the concentration of IHP is less than one mole per mole tetramer, the two separate conformations are present together, the NMR spectrum being a superposition of the spectra seen in the absence of IHP and in the presence of excess IHP. The fact that the two separate spectra are seen superimposed shows that the equilibrium between the two forms is slow.

The experimental results on the properties of the cyanomet hybrids which suggest that two conformations with different ligand binding properties are present together in solution and that the equilibrium between the two conformations is influenced by the presence of organic phosphates give a strong indication of the type of mechanism that is involved in the function of haemoglobin (Ogawa and Shulman, 1971; Cassoly et al., 1971). The model that these and other results suggest will be discussed in the following section.

\section*{6. A MODEL FOR CO-OPERATIVE AND HETEROTROPIC INTERACTIONS IN HAEMOGLOBIN}

Some of the results discussed in the previous sections, including the properties of the cyanomet hybrids (section 5.2) and the effect of organic phosphates on the cooperativity of haemoglobin (sections 4.2 .7 and 5.1.2), give a strong indication that the type of model that describes the nature of the intermediate structures for haemoglobin and explains how co-operativity arises is that proposed by Monod et al. (1965). The basic idea of their allosteric model is outlined below.

Monod et al. (1965) proposed the following explanation for the origin of homotropic and heterotropic interactions in multi-subunit proteins. The subunits can associate in two different quaternary structures which are in equilibrium with each other at all stages of ligation. These structures differ in their inter-subunits bonds, and the quaternary constraints produced by these bonds alter the conformation of the subunits so that in one quaternary state the affinity of the subunits for ligand is higher than in the other. In the absence of ligand, the low affinity structure, the $T$ state, is the more stable. Binding ligand to the protein necessarily shifts the equilibrium towards the high affinity structure, the $R$ state, resulting in an increased affinity for ligand as ligation proceeds. Symmetry is conserved in that all subunits within one quaternary structure have the same affinity for ligand, and the affinity of a subunit is not influenced directly by the state of ligation of its neighbouring subunits. This model predicts that modifications to the protein will influence co-operative interactions through their effect on the affinities of the $R$ and $T$ states and on the equilibrium between the two quaternary structures. In particular, molecules that bind more strongly to one or other form will affect the allosteric equilibrium and such molecules are known as allosteric effectors. A property of the allosteric model, shown by Rubin and Changeux (1966), is that as the equilibrium between $R$ and $T$ in the absence of ligand is altered, either by changing the concentration of an allosteric effector, or by modification to the protein, the cooperativity as measured by $n$ is altered. The maximum co-operativity is obtained when the equilibrium is as far towards $T$ in unliganded haemoglobin as it is towards $R$ in fully liganded haemoglobin. If the equilibrium is either very far towards $T$ or towards $R$, there is no quaternary change on ligation and no co-operativity.

The allosteric model for haemoglobin. Monod et al. showed that their model was capable of accounting for the sigmoid oxygen equilibrium curve of haemoglobin, and it explains naturally the absence of co-operativity when there is no quaternary structure change. The necessity of the quaternary structure change for co-operativity in haemoglobin is well established (Perutz, 1970). All co-operative haemoglobins that have been investigated take up both the normal deoxy and the normal oxy quaternary structure, even though abnormal haemoglobins may have changes in detailed structure
at the contacts between subunits. In contrast, some non-cooperative haemoglobins, such as the high affinity haemoglobins discussed in section 5.1, have been shown not to change quaternary structure on oxygenation.

In principle the allosteric model can account for the heterotropic interactions of haemoglobin and the properties of abnormal haemoglobins by changes either in the intrinsic affinities for oxygen of the $R$ and $T$ states, or in the allosteric equilibrium between the $\mathbf{R}$ and $T$ forms. The allosteric model provides a framework in which many different phenomena in haemoglobin can be accounted for by the variation of a few parameters which are simply related to structural features in liganded and unliganded haemoglobin (Perutz, 1970).

The kinetic properties of the cyanomet hybrids show that two conformations of the hybrids, with different ligand binding properties exist together in solution in proportions that can be influenced by the presence of DPG and IHP. This has a simple interpretation in the allosteric model, with DPG and IHP as allosteric effectors (Ogawa and Shulman, 1971, 1972) although the equilibrium between the $R$ and $T$ forms in this case is slow (Cassoly and Gibson, 1972). The other experimental results on the properties of haemoglobin in the presence and absence of DPG and IHP also indicate that the mechanism proposed in the allosteric model contributes to the functional properties of haemoglobin, with DPG and IHP as allosteric effectors (Perutz, 1972; Perutz et al., 1974a, b, c).

The structural basis of the allosteric model for haemoglobin has been discussed by Perutz (1970). The model proposes the existence of an equilibrium between two quaternary structures at all stages of ligation. The structural information available for haemoglobin suggests that this is likely, with the two structures being those observed in fully liganded and unliganded haemoglobin. The tertiary structures of the subunits in the oxy and deoxy forms are sufficiently similar for the oxy subunits to associate in the deoxy quaternary structure, and for the deoxy subunits to associate in the oxy quaternary structure to a small extent. Indeed for modified haemoglobins this has been observed by X-ray techniques. The fact that all the mutant and modified haemoglobins so far studied by X-ray methods have been found to crystallize in one or other of the two normal quaternary structures is a strong indication that these two arrangements of subunits are especially stable, and that other quaternary structures are much less stable. ${ }^{3}$ Perutz $(1970,1972)$ and Perutz et al. $(1974 \mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c})$ have discussed the stereochemical basis of co-operativity in the framework of the allosteric model. In section 7 there will be a detailed discussion of the incorporation of structural and other information into the allosteric model.

The possible role of direct interaction between subunits must be considered. An alternative model that could account for co-operative interactions in a multi-subunit protein like haemoglobin is the model developed by Koshland et al. (1966), elaborating an earlier model of Pauling (1935). In this type of model, the sequential model, the protein starts in a conformation that has low affinity for the first ligand. Binding ligand to one subunit of the protein produces conformation changes which directly influence the ligand binding properties of neighbouring subunits so that their affinities are either increased or decreased. Binding ligand to successive binding sites produces further conformation changes so that the protein is in a high affinity conformation for binding the last ligand. For haemoglobin the change in quaternary structure would be linked to the conformation changes that produce increasing affinity in such a way that the phenomena of co-operativity and the quaternary structure change always occurred together. This type of model is very general, and predicts the possibility of both co-operative and anti-cooperative behaviour. The equations for ligand binding in special cases where the direct interactions between subunits have particular geometries, for example the square and tetrahedral models, have been developed. A purely sequential model is capable of describing the sigmoid oxygen equilibrium curve of haemoglobin. It has the flexibility to describe the oxygen equilibrium in various conditions by adjusting its parameters, but these parameters are not easily related to structural features of the molecule. Such a model lacks the ability to account for many
properties of haemoglobin in a unified way, which is the great advantage of the allosteric model.

Direct interaction between subunits, along the lines of a sequential model, can be inqorporated into the allosteric model if it proves necessary to account for some properties of haemoglobin. An extension of this kind has been formulated by Szabo and Karplus (1975a). At present it seems that the simple allosteric model, with no interaction between subunits within the same quaternary structure but allowing for the difference between $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains, combined with the understanding of its parameters provided by structural evidence can give a qualitative explanation of many features of co-operative and heterotropic interactions in haemoglobin. Many authors have interpreted experimental results in terms of this model and their results will be discussed in section 7.

\section*{7. THE ALLOSTERIC THEORY OF LIGAND BINDING TO HAEMOGLOBIN}

This section will outline the development of the allosteric model for haemoglobin and show how it provides a unified way of describing and understanding many different aspects of haemoglobin function.

\subsection*{7.1. The Two Quaternary Structures and the Origin of Co-operativity}

Using the notation of Monod et al. (MWC), (1965), $\boldsymbol{R}$ denotes the relaxed or high affinity quaternary structure and $T$ denotes the tense or low affinity quaternary structure. Binding four oxygen molecules to haemoglobin is represented by the equilibrium diagram,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/9c4fb845-b642-478c-a1b0-967f43a9cd99-230.jpg?height=269&width=945&top_left_y=1203&top_left_x=417)
$L$ is the equilibrium constant for the conformational equilibrium between $T_{0}$ and $R_{0}$, where $L=\left[T_{0}\right] /\left[R_{0}\right] . K_{T}$ is the oxygen dissociation constant for a subunit in the $T$ conformation, $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R}}$ is that for a subunit in the $\boldsymbol{R}$ conformation, and the ratio $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R}} / \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T}}$ is denoted $c . \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R}}$ are dependent only on the quaternary state, and not on the state of oxygenation of other subunits.

The intrinsic Adair constants (section 2.1) for the binding of oxygen at the four successive steps can be written in terms of the MWC parameters
$$A_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{1(L c+1)}{K_{R}(L+1)}, A_{2}^{\prime}=\frac{1\left(L c^{2}+1\right)}{K_{R}(L c+1)}, A_{3}^{\prime}=\frac{1\left(L c^{3}+1\right)}{K_{R}\left(L c^{2}+1\right)}, A_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{1\left(L c^{4}+1\right)}{K_{R}\left(L c^{3}+1\right)} .$$

It can easily be shown from (7.1) that if $c<1$, the successive intrinsic Adair constants must increase and therefore that the model gives co-operative binding.

For haemoglobin, the low affinity $T$ structure has the arrangement of subunits seen in normal deoxyhaemoglobin, which is the structure $T_{0}$. The high affinity $R$ structure has the arrangement of subunits seen in normal liganded haemoglobin, which is the structure $\boldsymbol{R}_{4}$. The allosteric equilibrium constant, $L$, for normal haemoglobin is such that in the absence of oxygen the $T$ conformation is more stable than the $R$, and when four oxygens are bound, the $R$ structure is the more stable. Two features of the previous thermodynamic description of ligand binding to normal haemoglobin (sections 2.4 and 2.5) have immediate parallels in the allosteric model. They are illustrated in Fig. 14. Firstly, to the extent that the last binding step to haemoglobin is like binding to free chains, the $\boldsymbol{R}$ state has chain-like properties. Secondly, the structural interpretation given to the origin of low affinity of normal haemoglobin for its first ligand will apply to the origin of low affinity of the $T$ state in the allosteric model.

Small structural changes are linked to ligation of the subunits within each quaternary

structure, so that intermediate states, i.e. the $T$ state with ligands bound or the $R$ state with less than four ligands bound, will have different structures in detail from those of $T_{0}$ and $R_{4}$. These structural differences are an essential feature of the MWC model in which ligand can bind to both the $R$ and $T$ forms, and they explain why the equilibrium between the $R$ and $T$ forms changes with the number of ligands bound. The assumption made by the allosteric model is that these tertiary structure differences, which will be described below, are not transmitted to neighbouring subunits to alter their ligand binding affinity, but only affect the relative stability of the $R$ and $T$ forms.

The $R$ structure does not constrain the subunits to have greatly altered ligand binding properties from those of free subunits. This is known since the last step in oxygen binding to haemoglobin is like oxygen binding to free chains (section 2.5). If the currently available data on the association constant $A_{4}^{\prime}$ to normal haemoglobin are accurate, the $R$ state has a slightly higher affinity than that of free chains. As discussed in section 3.6, the absorption spectrum of oxyhaemoglobin and of "rapid" deoxyhaemoglobin is like that of free chains. In the allosteric model this property is taken to be characteristic of the $R$ quaternary structure (Perutz et al., 1974a, b, c). If there are constraints in $R$ that alter the subunit affinities slightly, they do not affect the electronic absorption spectrum from the haem.

Experimental results that appear inconsistent with the view that the $R$ structure is associated with an electronic absorption spectrum like free chains have been reported by Banerjee and Cassoly (1969a). The association of free met subunits into the tetramer altered the absorption spectrum of the $\beta$-subunits. Perutz et al. (1974c) suggest that this result is caused by a slight denaturation of the subunits in the free $\beta_{4}$-tetramer which is removed on their association into the haemoglobin tetramer.

The $T$ structure has intersubunit contacts that constrain the subunits to have lower oxygen affinity than free subunits. This lowered affinity is associated with the position of the iron atom further out of the plane of the porphyrin ring in a subunit in the $T$ state than in a free subunit (section 3.6). The iron-nitrogen bonds are longer and give rise to a characteristic absorption spectrum that differs from that of free chains (Perutz et al., 1974c). In the $\beta$-chains, the low affinity is also associated with the small size of the haem ligand pocket which has to widen to accommodate the ligand. The stability of $T_{0}$ is contributed to by the polar contacts within and between subunits involving the C -terminal residues of both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains (section 3.4, Table 7).

Tertiary structure changes induced by removal of ligand from subunits in the $R$ state were inferred from those seen in horse BME Hb (see Table 15) which has high affinity and stays in the $R$ quaternary structure when deoxygenated (Perutz, 1970). The most striking changes occurred at the C-terminal regions of the $\alpha$-chains where in liganded
haemoglobin the residues Arg $141 \alpha$ and Tyr $140 \alpha$ are delocalized (see section 3.3). In deoxy BME Hb both these residues are more localized, with Tyr $140 \alpha$ stabilized in a pocket between the F and H helices. This change in conformation must be related to the different position of the iron atom (not seen at the resolution of the electron density map) and the absence of ligand in the haem pocket. There is also a noticeable change in tilt of the haem group relative to the protein part of a subunit which corresponds to the change seen in erythrocruorin (section 3.2) and between deoxy and met subunits in normal haemoglobin. The $\beta$-haems lose their ligand more easily than the $\alpha$-chains suggesting that they are less easily oxidized, in agreement with the relative oxidationreduction potentials of free $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits to which the $R$ state is believed to be similar. Also because the $R$ state affinity is like that of free subunits, the stability of the liganded $R$ state relative to free liganded subunits is almost the same as the stability of the unliganded $R$ state relative to free deoxy subunits. So structural indications of instability at the contacts between subunits in the met versus deoxy BME map are not expected if this abnormal haemoglobin is a good model for the $R$ state. In this connection it should be noticed that the affinity of BME Hb (Table 15) is somewhat lower than that expected for the normal $R$ state, that human deoxy BME Hb crystallizes in the deoxyquaternary structure although horse deoxy BME Hb crystallizes in $R$, and that deoxy BME Hb in the presence of phosphate has a normal deoxyhaemoglobin absorption spectrum rather than the spectrum of free subunits (Simon, S.R., unpublished).

Tertiary structure changes induced by ligation of subunits in the $T$ state were inferred from those seen when normal deoxy haemoglobin was oxidized in crystals containing acrylamide when the quaternary structure change did not occur (Anderson, 1973). When ligand binds to a haem group in the $T$ state, tertiary structure changes accompanying the changed radius of the iron atom must destabilize some of the inter-subunit contacts that hold the iron atom $0.2 / 0.3 \AA$ further out of the plane of the porphyrin ring in the $T$ state than in a free deoxy subunit. Ligation of successive subunits will increase the destabilization of the inter-subunit contacts and at some stage in ligation the $R$ quaternary structure becomes more stable than the $T$.

From Anderson's results there are indications of where the instability of the contacts occurs when the iron atom changes its position from that of the high spin ferrous state of deoxyhaemoglobin to that of the high spin ferric state of aquomet haemoglobin at pH 6.5. The iron atom was closer to the plane of the porphyrin ring in the met form, the haem pocket was wider and the haem group had the same orientation in the pocket as in liganded BME Hb and normal haemoglobin. The different position of the iron atom was associated with the loosening of several hydrogen bonds within and between subunits at the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface, but the C -terminal salt bridges of both the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains appeared intact and His $146 \beta$ remained salt bridged to Asp $94 \beta$. The ionizing groups responsible for some of the normal oxidation Bohr effect were therefore unperturbed. The electron density in the map was less for the $\beta$-haem ligand than for the $\alpha$-haem ligand, showing that oxidation was not complete and that the $\alpha$-chains were more easily oxidized than the $\beta$-chains. This latter result is consistent with the results of MacQuarrie and Gibson (1971) (see section 4.1.4) and with the suggestion of Perutz (1970) that the $\beta$-haems in deoxyhaemoglobin would combine less easily than the $\alpha$-chains with a ligand because of the smaller size of the $\beta$-haems pocket.

Ligation in the $T$ state with different ligands is expected to destabilize the $T$ structure to different extents. As discussed in section 3.1, the radius of the iron atom depends on its valency and spin state. The unstrained position of the iron atom when a free subunit is combined with a ligand for which the iron atom is in a low spin ferrous or ferric state is in the plane of the porphyrin ring. For a ligand like the water molecule at low pH , the iron atom is in a high spin ferric state and its unstrained position is $0.4 \AA$ out of the plane. Thus tertiary structure changes following ligation of subunits would be expected to be larger for oxygenation than for oxidation at pH 6.5 , and the destabilization of the $T$ structure would be greater (Szabo and Karplus, 1972; Hopfield, 1973; Perutz et al., 1974b). For an oxidized haem at high pH , when the water molecule is ionized, the spin of the ferric iron is less, due to the existence of an equilibrium between the high and low
spin states (Table 4, section 3.1). The radius of the iron atom, the unstrained position of the iron atom in a free subunit, the tertiary structure changes accompanying ligation and the destabilization of the $T$ state will all therefore be intermediate between the corresponding properties for oxygenated haemoglobin and haemoglobin oxidized at low pH .

Both the structural comparisons described in preceding paragraphs were of the aquomet and the deoxy forms. The tertiary structures of the oxy and deoxy forms are expected to differ more. In particular, the C-terminal salt bridges may be broken and the ionizing groups contributing to the Bohr effect may be perturbed. The latter result is expected from the experimental results on linearity of proton release with carbon monoxide uptake described in section 4.1.3. The lag in the fraction of protons released as a function of percentage oxidation at pH 6.5 (see section 4.1.4) is consistent with the crystallographic results that in this case some of the Bohr groups are not perturbed in the $T$ state.

Since ligation in the $R$ state does not introduce instability in the intersubunit contacts as there are almost no constraints in $R$, oxidation and oxygenation are as easy in the $R$ state as in free chains. In the $T$ state, however, oxygenation is more difficult relative to oxygenation of free chains than is oxidation relative to oxidation of free chains because of the larger movement required of the iron atom. Hopfield (1973) has estimated from a linear theory of the energy distribution in haemoglobin that the difference between the free energy of ligand binding in the $T$ state and that of binding to free chains is only 2.1 kcal per haem in the case of oxidation at low pH , compared to about 3.6 kcal per haem for oxygenation. These free energy differences correspond to $c$ being about 0.03 for oxidation at low pH , and 0.003 for oxygenation. $c$ for oxidation at high pH will have some intermediate value. Another method of estimating relative $c$ values for different ligands will be discussed in section 7.3.

\subsection*{7.2. The Allosteric Model with Four Equivalent Subunits}

Many of the features generally used to describe oxygen equilibrium curves can be given simple algebraic expressions in terms of the allosteric model parameters.

The median ligand activity is easily obtained from its definition
$$p_{m}^{4}=\frac{1}{A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime}} \quad(\text { section 2.2) }$$

Substituting for the Adair constants from (7.1)
$$\begin{gathered}
p_{m}^{4}=K_{R}^{4}\left(\frac{1+L}{1+L c^{4}}\right) \\
\text { or } \log p_{m}=\log K_{R}+\frac{1}{4} \log \left(\frac{1+L}{1+L c^{4}}\right) .
\end{gathered}$$

The difference in free energy of binding the first and last ligand $\Delta F_{I}$ can be obtained by substituting the values of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ from (7.1) into its definition (eq. (2.12))
$$\Delta F_{I}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{1}^{\prime}+\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{4}^{\prime}=\mathrm{RT} \ln \frac{\left(1+L c^{4}\right)}{\left(1+L C^{3}\right)} \frac{(1+L)}{(1+L c)} .$$

The value of $p_{50}$ is given by the expression
$$L=\frac{\left(\gamma_{50}-1\right)\left(1+\gamma_{50}\right)^{3}}{\left(1-\gamma_{50} c\right)\left(1+\gamma_{50} c\right)^{3}}$$
where $y_{50}=p_{50} / K_{R}$. This can be shown by substituting the expressions for the Adair constants (7.1) in the definition of $p_{50}$ given in section 2.3 (eq. (2.13)).

The slope of the Hill plot at $p_{50}$ is
$$n=1+\frac{3\left(1-c \gamma_{50}\right)\left(\gamma_{50}-1\right)}{\left(1+c \gamma_{50}\right)\left(\gamma_{50}+1\right)}$$

This can be shown from the definition of $n$ given in eq. (2.14) expressing ( $\bar{Y} / 1-\bar{Y}$ ) (eq. (2.11)) in terms of the allosteric model parameters. Bunn and Guidotti (1972) give this expression for $n$.

The effect of variation of $L$ on the form of the Hill plot is illustrated in Fig. 15. Five Hill plots are shown corresponding to $L$ equal to $1,1 / c, 1 / c^{2}, 1 / c^{3}, 1 / c^{4}$, respectively, with fixed values of $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T}}$. With $\boldsymbol{L}=1$, the affinity is high and the co-operativity low, $L=1 / c^{2}$ gives the maximum co-operativity and with $L=1 / c^{4}$ both the affinity and co-operativity are low.

$L$ will be altered by any modification to the protein that changes the stability of either the $R$ or $T$ form. Mutations and chemical modifications that produce changes in the intersubunit contacts will affect the allosteric equilibrium. Some extreme modifications, such as the removal of the salt bridges or hydrogen bonds that stabilize the $T_{0}$ structure results in $L<1$, so that the $T$ state is less stable than $R$ even when no oxygens are bound. This is the case for haemoglobins NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr) and Hb Kempsey (see Table 15) all of which have no co-operativity and have deoxy absorption spectra like free chains.

Also, as discussed by Rubin and Changeux (1966), a molecule that binds more strongly to either the $T$ or $R$ form, known as an allosteric effector, will influence the allosteric equilibrium. DPG and IHP, both of which have higher affinity for $T_{0}$ than for $\boldsymbol{R}_{4}$, are probably allosteric effectors that bind more strongly to all $T$ states than to all $R$ states. This is expected from structural considerations since the binding site between the $\beta$-chains is altered when the quaternary structure changes, but is altered only to a small extent when the $T$ state is ligated. In the following discussion, organic phosphates will be treated as simple allosteric effectors, but the possibility that organic phosphate binding depends also on the state of ligation in $T$ and $R$ will be discussed in section 7.7.

If $\boldsymbol{B}_{T}$ is the binding constant for DPG to the $T$ structure, the total concentration of
molecules in the $T$ state, $\left[T_{0}\right]^{\prime}$, is
$$\left[T_{0}\right]^{\prime}=\left[T_{0}\right]\left(1+B_{T} x\right)$$
where $\left[T_{0}\right]=$ concentration of $T_{0}$ with no bound DPG and where $x$ is the concentration of free DPG.

Similarly the total concentration of molecules in the $R$ state is
$$\left[R_{0}\right]^{\prime}=\left[R_{0}\right]\left(1+B_{R} x\right) .$$

The allosteric equilibrium constant in the presence of DPG, L', is
$$\begin{gathered}
L^{\prime}=\frac{\left[T_{0}\right]^{\prime}}{\left[R_{0}\right]^{\prime}}=L \times \frac{\left(1+B_{T} x\right)}{\left(1+B_{R} x\right)} \\
\text { or } \log L^{\prime}=\log L+\left[\log \left(1+B_{T} x\right)-\log \left(1+B_{R} x\right)\right]
\end{gathered}$$

Figure 16 illustrates the variation with $\log L$ of the features used to describe Hill plots, $n, \log p_{50}, \log p_{m}, \log A_{1}^{\prime}, \log A_{4}^{\prime}, \Delta F_{r}$.

When $L$ is very small, the molecule will be in the $R$ quaternary structure even when deoxygenated. In this case, from equations (7.1) to (7.6),
$$\begin{array}{clc}
n \rightarrow 1 ; & p_{50} \rightarrow K_{R} ; & p_{m} \rightarrow K_{R} ; \\
A_{1}^{\prime} \rightarrow 1 / K_{R} ; & A_{4}^{\prime} \rightarrow 1 / K_{R} ; & \Delta F_{I} \rightarrow 0 .
\end{array}$$

When $L$ is very large, so large that the $L c^{4}$ is also large, the molecule will be in the $T$

A_{1}^{\prime} \rightarrow 1 / K_{T} ; & A_{4}^{\prime} \rightarrow 1 / K_{T} ; & \Delta F_{I} \rightarrow 0 .
\end{array}$$

When $L=1 / c^{2}$, so that the equilibrium constant between $T_{0}$ and $R_{0}$ is the reciprocal of that between $T_{4}$ and $R_{4}$, or the equilibrium is as far towards $T$ in deoxyhaemoglobin as it is towards $R$ in oxyhaemoglobin
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
n_{\max } & =1+\frac{3(1-\sqrt{c})^{2}}{(1+\sqrt{c})^{2}} ; & p_{50}=\left(K_{R} K_{T}\right)^{1 / 2} ; & p_{m}=\left(K_{R} K_{T}\right)^{1 / 2} ; \\

\end{array}$$

The value of $c$ must be at least as small as 0.01 to give the value of $n$ characteristic of the oxygenation of normal haemoglobin. Substitution of this value of $c$ in the expression for $n_{\text {max }}$ gives a maximum $n$ of 3.01 . With $c$ having this order of magnitude the expressions for $\Delta F_{1}, A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ when $L=1 / c^{2}$, can be approximated by
$$A_{1}^{\prime}=1 / K_{T} ; \quad A_{4}^{\prime}=1 / K_{R} ; \quad \Delta F_{I}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln c .$$

Figure 16 illustrates the range of values of $\log L$ over which $\Delta F_{1}, A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ are constant at these values.

Approximate expressions for $\log p_{m}$ and $\log p_{50}$ can be used for values of $L$ in a fairly wide range about $L=1 / c^{2}$. From Fig. 16, $\log p_{50}$ and $\log p_{m}$ are almost linear functions of $\log L$ in the central region on either side of the point where $p_{m}=p_{50}$. From (7.3), if $c$ is small and $L$ large,
$$\log p_{m} \approx \log K_{R}+\frac{1}{4} \log L .$$

Since $\log p_{m}$ and $\log p_{50}$ differ very little in this region of $\log L$
$$\log p_{50} \approx \log K_{R}+\frac{1}{4} \log L .$$

This approximate expression for $\log p_{50}$ was used by Edelstein (1971).
Comparison of oxygen equilibrium properties with these simple predictions of the allosteric model. Edelstein (1971) compared the oxygen equilibrium properties of several co-operative haemoglobins with the prediction given by the allosteric model of the relationship between $n$ and $\log p_{50}$. On the assumption that $K_{R}$ was the same for all the haemoglobins that he analyzed, and that it was equal to the $p_{50}$ value of free chains, he showed that the values of $n$ and $\log p_{50}$ varied together in the way illustrated in Fig. 16. Shulman et al. (1972) have also demonstrated that these simple assumptions give a good first-order fit to the equilibrium properties of normal and some abnormal haemoglobins. Examination of the values of $n$ and $\log p_{50}$ of the abnormal haemoglobins listed in Table 15 shows that they follow the general trend indicated by Fig. 16. Hb Kansas has low affinity and low $n$, corresponding to a large value of $L$ on the right-hand side of the figure. The high affinity haemoglobins at the other end of the list have small values of $L$ and low co-operativity.

The effect of DPG and IHP on the oxygen equilibrium properties of haemoglobin is mainly the result of $L^{\prime}$ being different from $L$ as given by eq. (7.7). From the approximate expression (7.9) and the value of $\log K_{R}$ equal to $\log p_{50}$ of free chains ( -0.4 from Table 17), estimates of $\log L$ in low ionic strength buffer and in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl , DPG and IHP can be made from the $\log p_{m}$ values determined by Tyuma et al. (1973a) and Imai (1974) given in Table 14. These estimates are given in Table 22 and will be useful in later qualitative discussions.

Herzfeld and Stanley (1972) have shown that the allosteric model in which $L^{\prime}$ changes with DPG concentration according to eq. (7.7) is capable of fitting the oxygen equilibrium data of Benesch and Benesch (1969) and of fitting the biphasic equilibrium curves obtained when the concentration of DPG is less than one mole per tetramer.

The results described in section 5.1.2 on the restoration of the deoxyquaternary structure and co-operativity in oxygenation to the haemoglobins NES des(Arg), des(Arg.Tyr), Hb Kempsey by the presence of IHP are explained by the allosteric

model as due to $L^{\prime}$ being greater than $L$ according to eq. (7.7), a consequence of the much greater affinity of the $T$ state than of the $R$ state for IHP. Table 22 shows that for normal haemoglobin $L^{\prime} \approx 10^{4} L$ in an excess of IHP. The restoration of co-operativity to these haemoglobins by the presence of IHP, shows that none of the salt bridges and hydrogen bonds modified in these abnormal haemoglobins are individually essential for the expression of co-operativity.

Comparison of model predictions and experiments on conformation changes as a function of ligand saturation. If a conformational probe, such as those described in section 3.5, detects changes in quaternary structure only, the percentage change of the probe will not be a linear function of ligand saturation. If the probe detects changes in tertiary structure only, independently of whether the subunit is in $R$ or $T$, the percentage change of the probe will be an exactly linear function of ligand saturation. The former conformation change at the probe is described as being quaternary linked, the latter as tertiary linked in both $R$ and $T$, and there are other possibilities such as being quaternary linked and also tertiary linked in $T$.

Figure 17 illustrates the percentage of molecules in the various intermediate states as a function of ligand saturation $\bar{Y}$ for two sets of parameters, one with $L c^{2}=10$ (a) and the other with $L c^{2}=1 / 10(b)$. When $L c^{2}=1 / 10$ the concentration of $R_{3}$ is greater than that of $T_{1}$ for quite low fractional saturations, whereas for $L c^{2}=10$ the concentration of $T_{1}$ remains higher than that of $R_{3}$ until quite high fractional saturation. In both cases the concentrations of $T_{2}, T_{3}, T_{4}, R_{0}, R_{1}, R_{2}$ are always small. From such a figure the percentage change of a probe which is sensitive to structural changes at specified stages in ligation can be predicted. For example, if the probe is only sensitive to the quaternary structure change its percentage change with fractional saturation $\bar{Y}$ will follow the curve of total $R$ (or total $T$ ), and in the two cases illustrated the deviation from being a linear function is quite small. It is therefore difficult experimentally to distinguish quaternary linkage from tertiary linkage in a co-operative system.

Local conformation changes in the vicinity of the -SH group of $\beta 93$ have been studied by several investigators. In equilibrium studies Ogawa and McConnell (1967) found a linear relationship between conformation change at $\beta 93$ and ligand saturation but Huestis and Raftery (1972b, d, 1973) found that the conformation change lagged behind ligand saturation. In kinetic studies on the increase in rate of reaction of the -SH group with ligand uptake Antonini and Brunori (1969) found a linear relationship, but in a more recent study Gibson (1973b) finds that the increase in reaction rate lagged behind ligand uptake. Gibson's result suggests that the major change in - SH reactivity occurs when the quaternary structure changes. As discussed in section 3.5, conformation changes in the vicinity of the - SH group result from the transition from high to low spin of the iron atom as well as from the quaternary structure change. Conformation changes in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ interface, which might structurally be expected to reflect the quaternary structure change, have been studied by Simon and Cantor (1969) and Imai and Yonetani (1973). The former authors found that the conformation change was proportional to ligand saturation and the latter authors that it lagged behind. Conformation changes in the vicinity of the haem group have been studied by Asakura (1972) who found that the conformation change lagged behind ligand saturation.

Other indicators of conformation change are the release of protons and organic phosphates, and experiments investigating these will be discussed in more detail later.

The effect of different values of $c$, the ratio of ligand dissociation constants in $R$ and $T$. The dependence of $\log p_{m}$ and $n$ on $\log L$ for several values of the ratio $c$ is shown in Fig. 18. The peaks of the bell-shaped curves occur when $L c^{2}=1$ for each value of $c$. The curves for $n$ depend only on the value of $c$ and not on the individual values of $K_{R}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T}}$. In the illustration $\boldsymbol{c}$ has in fact been altered by varying $\boldsymbol{K}_{T}$, and it can be seen that for lower values of $\log L, \log p_{m}$ and $n$ are practically independent of $K_{T}$.

Minton (1971) showed that the simple relationship between $n$ and $\log p_{s_{0}}$ expected if only the parameter $L$ changes in abnormal haemoglobins was not obeyed in all cases. Imai (1973) has obtained parameters $K_{R}, K_{T}$ and $L$ that fit his complete oxygen saturation curves of normal and several abnormal haemoglobins, and found small differences in the values of $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{R}}$, and decreased $\boldsymbol{K}_{T}$ values for certain modifications. So $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T}}$, and therefore $\boldsymbol{c}$, are expected to differ for the oxygenation of abnormal haemoglobins. From structural considerations, the affinity of the $T$ state is expected to be altered by modifications to the inter-subunit contacts that are constraining the subunits to have lowered affinity. Although the electronic absorption spectra of all abnormal deoxyhaemoglobins that form the $T$ structure are the same, the iron atom is expected to be in a slightly less strained position in abnormal haemoglobins, where the constraints of the $T$ state have been reduced.

abnormal deoxyhaemoglobins show that there are small changes transmitted to the haem regions from the altered inter-subunit contacts (Davis et al., 1971).

The ratio of $K_{R}$ to $K_{T}$ is also expected to be different for binding different ligands to normal haemoglobin (see section 7.1), and $c$ for oxygenation is smaller than $c$ for oxidation at low pH.

Comparison of the effect of IHP on the co-operativity of oxygenation and oxidation. The abolition of co-operativity in the oxidation of haemoglobin by the presence of IHP at low pH (Kilmartin, 1973) was described in section 4.2.7. This evidence, combined with the results of Perutz et al. (1974b) on the quaternary structure of methaemoglobin in the presence of IHP, is some of the most convincing in favour of the allosteric model of haemoglobin (see section 6). An excess of IHP has been estimated to increase $L$ by a factor of about $5 \times 10^{3}$ at pH 7.4 above its value in 0.1 m NaCl (Table 22). Curve (2) in Fig. 18, calculated with $c=0.003$, qualitatively represents the variation of $n$ with $\log L$ for the oxygenation of haemoglobin and if $\log L$ varies between the values given in Table 22 for the presence and absence of IHP in $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}, n$ will vary between 3.3 and 2.4 as indicated by the filled circles marked on the curve. Curve (4), calculated with $c=0.018$, qualitatively represents the variation of $n$ with $\log L$ for oxidation at alkaline pH and in this case $n$ will fall from 2.4 to 1.0 . These variations in $n$ approximate the observed effects of IHP on $n$ at pH 7.4 , for oxygenation (Table 4.5) and for oxidation
(Fig. 13). At high $\mathbf{p H}$ where IHP has less effect on $L$ as shown by its smaller effect on $\log p_{50}$ (Fig. 12) the value of $n$ for oxidation is affected less.

Interpretation of the different spin equilibrium of the ferric iron atoms in methaemoglobin in the presence and absence of IHP. Perutz et al. (1974b) have found an increased paramagnetic susceptibility in methaemoglobin stabilized in the $T$ state by the presence of IHP. They attribute the increased susceptibility to the increased length of the iron-nitrogen bonds that is characteristic of the $T$ state. The free energy change associated with the increased susceptibility is estimated to be 0.9 kcal per haem at pH 6.7 which is interpreted as a measure of the free energy difference between iron-nitrogen bonds in the $T$ and $R$ states. This free energy difference amounts to about a quarter of the difference, $\Delta F_{I}$, in free energy of ligand binding to the $T$ and $R$ states which is about 3.6 kcal per haem. The conclusion drawn is therefore that about a quarter of $\Delta F_{I}$ is stored in the iron-nitrogen bonds, the remainder being stored in the inter-subunit contacts and the protein part of the subunits, as discussed by Hopfield (1973).

\subsection*{7.3. The Allosteric Model of M Haemoglobins and Mixed-valency Hybrids}

The M haemoglobins and the mixed-valency hybrids, whose properties were described in section 5.2, have only two sites for oxygen ligand. The algebraic expressions for the parameters used to characterize the oxygen equilibrium curves are easily obtained by analogy with the results already given for the case of four binding sites.

The Adair constants become
$$\begin{aligned}
& A_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{K_{R}}\left(\frac{L_{M} c+1}{L_{M}+1}\right), \\
& A_{2}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{K_{R}}\left(\frac{L_{M} c^{2}+1}{L_{M} c+1}\right)
\end{aligned}$$
where $L_{M}=[T] /[R]$ for the modified haemoglobin or hybrid with no oxygen bound and $c=K_{R} / K_{T}$ for the type of chain free to bind ligand.

The median ligand activity is given by
$$p_{m}^{2}=\frac{1}{A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime}} .$$

Substituting the values of the Adair constants from (7.11)
$$p_{m}^{2}=K_{R}^{2}\left(\frac{L_{M}+1}{L_{M} c^{2}+1}\right)$$
or
$$\log p_{m}=\log K_{R}+\frac{1}{2} \log \left(\frac{L_{M}+1}{L_{M} c^{2}+1}\right) .$$

The value of $p_{50}$ is always equal to the value of $p_{m}$ when there are only two binding sites which implies that the oxygen equilibrium curves are symmetrical (Wyman, 1967; Szabo and Karplus, 1975c).

The slope of the Hill plot at $p_{50}$ can easily be shown to be
$$n_{50}=\left[\frac{2}{1+\frac{L_{M} C+1}{\left[\left(L_{M} C^{2}+1\right)\left(L_{M}+1\right)\right]^{1 / 2}}}\right] .$$

The dependence of Hill plot parameters on the value of $L_{M}$. When $L_{M}$ is very small,
$$\begin{aligned}
p_{50}=p_{m} & \longrightarrow K_{R}, \\
n & \longrightarrow 1 .
\end{aligned}$$

When $L_{M}$ is very high, such that $L_{M} C^{2}$ is also high,
$$\begin{aligned}
p_{50}=p_{m} & \longrightarrow K_{T}, \\
n & \longrightarrow 1 .
\end{aligned}$$

When $L_{M} C=1$,
$$\begin{aligned}
p_{50} & =p_{m}=\left(K_{R} K_{T}\right)^{1 / 2} \\
n & =\frac{2}{1+\frac{2 \sqrt{c}}{(1+c)}} .
\end{aligned}$$

A plot of $n_{50}$ versus $\log L_{M}$ is a bell-shaped curve with maximum $n$ at the point $L_{M}=1 / c$, falling to 1 for large and small $L_{M}$. For $c=0.003$, which is the order of magnitude appropriate for haemoglobin, the maximum $n$ will be 1.8 . Figure 19 illustrates the variation of $\left(\log p_{50}-\log K_{R}\right)$ and the variation of $n$ with $\log L_{M}$ for $c=0.003$. As in the case of four binding sites, the slope of $\log p_{50}$ versus $\log L_{M}$ is constant over the middle range of $L_{M}$, the slope in this case being approximately $\frac{1}{2}$. In this range of $L_{M}$ the following approximate expression can be used to estimate values of $\log L_{M}$ :
$$\log p_{50}=\log K_{R}+\frac{1}{2} \log L_{M} .$$

For the mixed-valency hybrids, $L_{M}$ will be of the form
$$L_{M}=L c_{M}^{2}$$
where $L$ is the allosteric equilibrium constant for normal deoxyhaemoglobin and $c_{M}$ the value of $c$ corresponding to the ligand bound to the ferric subunits.

\end{figure}

Comparison of properties of $M$ mutants and hybrids with predictions of the model. The model gives a simple interpretation of some properties of the M mutants and hybrids described in section 5.2. Haemoglobins M Iwate and M Boston, with low affinity and no co-operativity, only just change quaternary structure from the $T$ state on oxygenation of the two normal subunits. Their oxygen affinities therefore give an estimate of $K_{T}$ for the $\beta$-chains, and their lack of a Bohr effect shows that $K_{T}$ is not pH
dependent for these haemoglobins. M Hyde Park, M Saskatoon and M Milwaukee are co-operative and change quaternary structure from $T$ to $R$ on ligation of the normal $\alpha$-chains. Figure 19 shows the $\log p_{50}$ values of some of these haemoglobins marked on the theoretical $\left(\log p_{50}-\log K_{R}\right)$ versus $\log L_{M}$ line, and their $n$ values are plotted at the corresponding values of $\log L_{M}$. The assumption that $K_{R}$ equals the value of $p_{50}$ for the appropriate free chain has been made.

The spectral changes from the abnormal $\beta$-haems of Hb Milwaukee seen when the normal $\alpha$-chains are ligated have been correlated with the change in iron-nitrogen bond lengths that is associated with all $T$ to $R$ transitions (Perutz, 1972; Perutz et al., 1974c). In the presence of DPG, these spectral changes are no longer seen and Hb Milwaukee is non-cooperative, consistent with the quaternary structure no longer changing from $T$ to $R$ due to the value of $L_{M}$ being increased by a factor $\sim 10^{2}$ (see Table 23).

The properties of the cyanomet hybrids have also been interpreted in terms of the allosteric model (Ogawa and Shulman, 1971, 1972; Ogata and McConnell, 1971) and as discussed in section 6 were an early indication that haemoglobin function could be described by this model. Deoxy $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ and $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$, stripped of phosphates, are in the $R$ quaternary structure, whilst in the presence of the allosteric effector IHP both hybrids are in T. DPG can stabilize $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ in the $T$ state but not $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$, showing that the allosteric equilibrium is further towards $R$ when two $\beta$-chains are combined with CN than when two $\alpha$-chains are. This implies that $c_{\alpha}>c_{\beta}$ for the CN ligand, a conclusion which has also been indicated by other experiments. Ogata and McConnell (1971) have measured the binding of a DPG analogue to the hybrids, and find it binds more strongly to $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ than to $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$ consistent with $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$ being further towards the $T$ state. Other measurements of the binding constants of DPG to hybrids (Bauer et al., 1973; Caldwell and Nagel, 1973) and of the reactivity of the - SH groups of $\beta 93$ (Maeda and Ohnishi, 1971; Brunori et al., 1970) are also consistent with this interpretation, as are the oxygen affinity measurements for the hybrids in the presence and absence of DPG (Maeda et al., 1972). DPG slightly lowers the affinity and produces slight co-operativity in the hybrid $\alpha_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN}) \beta_{2}$, but hardly alters the properties of $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}^{+}(\mathrm{CN})$. These oxygen equilibrium data are included in Fig. 19 again assuming that $K_{R}$ equals the $p_{50}$ of the free ferrous subunit. The results of kinetic experiments on ligand binding to the hybrids in the presence and absence of organic phosphates (see section 5.2, Table 21) are also consistent with the relative allosteric equilibrium constants for the deoxy hybrids discussed above. One surprising result for the allosteric model interpretation of the properties of the cyanomet hybrids is the very slow equilibrium between $R$ and $T$ forms of the stripped hybrids demonstrated by both the kinetic and NMR studies. Also surprisingly, this slow equilibrium is not detected when IHP and carbon monoxide are added to stripped deoxy hybrids at the same time. If the equilibrium between $R$ and $T$ is slow, a fast phase corresponding to the combination of the $R$ form with carbon monoxide before it had time to change to $T$ would be expected but this is not seen.

The oxygen equilibrium measurements of Banerjee et al. (1973) for other mixedvalency hybrids with various spin states of the ferric iron were given in Table 19. These $\log p_{50}$ and $n$ values are included in Fig. 19, where it can be seen that for some hybrids, most noticeably the fluoro and aquomet hybrids, the $n$ values appear to be lower than the predictions of the model with $K_{R}$ equal to $p_{50}$ of the ferrous chain. From a theoretical point of view, the comparison of predicted and experimental $n$ values for these hybrids provide a clear test of the allosteric model and its structural interpretation. Szabo and Karplus (1975c) have pointed out that the discrepancies between predictions and experiment may be related to the absence of symmetry in the oxygen equilibrium curves. For molecules with two binding sites only, the oxygen equilibrium curves are necessarily symmetrical if the hybrid preparations are pure. The fact that the actual curves are asymmetrical emphasizes the experimental difficulties in studying the hybrids.

The relative $c$ values for different ligands can be estimated from the $\log p_{s o}$ value for mixed-valency hybrids. On the assumption that $K_{R}$ is the $p_{50}$ value of the free ferrous subunit, $\log L_{M}$ for each hybrid can be estimated from eq. (7.14) provided $\log p_{50}$ is not
very close to $\log K_{R}$ so that the approximation holds. Since $L_{M}=L c_{M}^{2}$ (eq. (7.15)) the relative $L_{M}$ values for the hybrids are related to the $c_{M}$ values for the different ligands on the ferric subunit which are expected to depend on the spin state of the ferric iron (section 3.1). From the data in Table 19, $c_{M}$ for fluoride or the water molecule, for which the ferric iron is high spin, is greater than $c_{M}$ for azide, for which the ferric iron is low spin, by a factor of about 4 at pH 7.5 . Hopfield (section 7.1) has estimated that $c$ for the water molecule ligand at pH 6.0 is greater by a factor of 10 than c for the low spin ferrous ligand oxygen.

The oxygen equilibrium properties of the mixed-valency hybrids would provide data for a quantitative test of the allosteric model, if the experimental difficulties associated with their preparation and study could be overcome. The hybrids have a normal protein structure and the only parameter that varies with the ligand on the ferric haem is $L_{M}=L c_{M}^{2}$. A study of how $n$ and $\log p_{50}$ vary with the ferric ligand for the two types of hybrid, and how they vary with pH and in the presence and absence of organic phosphates, would provide a set of data for testing the consistency of the assumptions made to account for their properties in terms of the model.

\subsection*{7.4 The Kinetics of Ligand Binding in the Allosteric Model}

There is no unique kinetic scheme that corresponds to the allosteric model of equilibrium binding properties, and the following diagram illustrates the kinetic parameters involved:
$$\begin{aligned}
& T_{0}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{T 1}}{\stackrel{k_{T 1}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} T_{1}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{T 2}}{\stackrel{k_{T 2}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} T_{2}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{T 3}}{\stackrel{k_{T 3}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} T_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{T 4}}{\stackrel{k_{T 4}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} T_{4} \\
& q_{0}\left\|q_{0}^{\prime} \quad q_{1}\right\| q_{1}^{\prime} \quad q_{2}\left\|q_{2}^{\prime} \quad q_{3}\right\| q_{3}^{\prime} \quad q_{4} \| q_{4}^{\prime} \\
& R_{0}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{R 1}}{\stackrel{k_{R 1}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} R_{1}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{R 2}}{\stackrel{k_{R 2}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} R_{2}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{R 3}}{\stackrel{k_{R 3}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} R_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \underset{k_{R 4}}{\stackrel{k_{R 4}^{\prime}}{\rightleftharpoons}} R_{4}
\end{aligned}$$

The ratio of the "off" to the "on" constant for each ligation step in one quaternary state equals the equilibrium constant for ligand binding in that state, for example
$$K_{R}=\frac{k_{R 1}}{k_{R 1}^{\prime}}=\frac{k_{R 2}}{k_{R 2}^{\prime}}=\frac{k_{R 3}}{k_{R 3}^{\prime}}=\frac{k_{R 4}}{k_{R 4}^{\prime}} .$$

In general, although the equilibrium constant for each quaternary structure is independent of ligation step, the kinetic constants could alter at each step, provided both alter by the same factor. This would correspond to interaction between the subunits within one quaternary structure, not apparent in the equilibrium constant but altering the rate constants, and emphasizes the fact that kinetic constants are more closely related to mechanism than are equilibrium constants.

Hopfield et al. (1971) have discussed the kinetic scheme in which the kinetic constants as well as the equilibrium constants are independent of the state of ligation of other subunits within $R$ and $T$, so that
$$K_{R}=\frac{k_{R}}{k_{R}^{\prime}} \quad \text { and } \quad K_{T}=\frac{k_{T}}{k_{T}^{\prime}} .$$

The rate constants for the conformational transitions from $T$ to $R$ must satisfy the relationships $q_{i} / q_{i}^{\prime}=L c^{i}$ where $i$ is the number of ligands bound. Hopfield et al. set up the equations for the rate constants for binding successive ligands on the assumption that the conformational transitions between $T$ and $R$ were fast compared to the rate of ligand binding at all stages of ligation and treating the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains as equivalent. In these circumstances the successive rate constants for ligand uptake must increase, and, for example, it is not possible for the third step to be slower than the second step. If the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains are not equivalent or if $T$ to $R$ transitions are not fast compared to ligand binding at all stages, the situation is more complicated. Hopfield et al. (1971, 1972) have shown that their simple model can account for many features of the kinetics of ligand binding to haemoglobin, but evidence on the different kinetic properties of $\alpha$ and $\beta$-chains (Gray and Gibson, 1971b; MacQuarrie and Gibson, 1971; Olson and

Gibson, 1971 a,b, 1973 a,b; Gibson, 1973a), shows that a model must take these differences into account. It must also allow abnormal haemoglobins to have altered parameters (Hewitt and Gibson, 1973). Even allowing for $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains to have different constants, some kinetic properties of abnormal haemoglobins do not have an obvious interpretation in terms of the allosteric model (Moffat et al., 1973; Olson et al., 1972; Tan et al., 1973). Other experiments can be interpreted in terms of the model only if $T$ to $R$ transitions are slow (Cassoly et al., 1971; Cassoly and Gibson, 1972).

\subsection*{7.5. The Allosteric Model allowing for Differences between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains}

Although many qualitative discussions can make use of the simple allosteric model described in sections 7.1 and 7.2, the known differences between the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits in haemoglobin necessitate the introduction of this feature into the model for the discussion of some results. The NMR studies described in section 4.2.6, and the kinetic studies described in sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.6 have shown that in some circumstances there are significant differences between $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in their ligand binding properties. The free chains have slightly different oxygen affinities which will be reflected in the values of $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\alpha}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\beta}}$, and the discussion in section 7.3 has shown that $c_{\alpha}$ differs from $c_{\beta}$. Also some abnormal isolated chains have considerably altered oxygen affinities (see Table 16), which increases the difference between $K_{R a}$ and $K_{R \beta}$ for abnormal haemoglobins. $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{\tau} \boldsymbol{\alpha}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{\tau} \boldsymbol{\beta}}$ are different for normal haemoglobin as the constraints of the $T$ structure affect the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits unequally, and they will also be altered differently by some modifications to the protein and by changes in pH (Perutz, 1970).

Ogata and McConnell (1971) have extended the MWC model to allow the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits to have different oxygen dissociation constants from each other in both the $R$ and $T$ states. Let $K_{T \alpha}, K_{T \beta}, K_{R \alpha}, K_{R \beta}$ denote these dissociation constants. With this extension it is easily shown that the Adair constants $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ are the following expressions in terms of the model parameters:
$$\begin{aligned}
& A_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{K_{R \beta}\left(L c_{\alpha}+1\right)+K_{R \alpha}\left(L c_{\beta}+1\right)}{2(L+1) K_{R \alpha} K_{R \beta}} \\
& A_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{2\left(L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}+1\right) / K_{R \alpha} K_{R \beta}}{\left(L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}+1\right) / K_{R \alpha}+\left(L c_{\alpha} c_{\beta}^{2}+1\right) / K_{R \beta}}
\end{aligned}$$
where $c_{\alpha}=\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\alpha}} / \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\alpha}} ; c_{\beta}=\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\beta}} / \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\beta}}$.
The form of the ligand equilibrium curves as a function of model parameters. The median ligand activity when the subunits have different affinities is given by
$$p_{m}^{4}=\frac{1}{A_{1}^{\prime} A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime} A_{4}^{\prime}} \quad \text { from (2.8) }$$
which from (7.16), realizing that the numerator of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and the denominator of $A_{4}^{\prime}$ will cancel with $A_{2}^{\prime} A_{3}^{\prime}$, gives
$$p_{m}^{4}=\frac{(L+1) K_{R \alpha}^{2} K_{R \beta}^{2}}{\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}$$
or
$$\log p_{m}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\log K_{R \alpha}+\log K_{R \beta}\right)+\frac{1}{4} \log \frac{(L+1)}{\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)} .$$

The difference in free energy of binding the first and last ligand, $\Delta F_{I}$, is obtained by substituting the expressions for $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ from (7.16) in
$$\Delta F_{I}=-\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{1}^{\prime}+\mathrm{RT} \ln A_{4}^{\prime} .$$

The change in co-operativity when the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits have different parameters is illustrated in Fig. 20. The bell-shaped curve of $n$ versus $\log L$ is given for three different sets of values of the equilibrium constants. In each case $\left(K_{R_{\alpha}} K_{R B}\right)^{1 / 2}$, being the $p_{p_{0}}$ value of the $R$ state, $p_{R}$, and $\left(K_{T \alpha} K_{T \beta}\right)^{1 / 2}$ being the $p_{50}$ value of the $T$ state, $p_{T}$, are the same, but the ratios $\left(K_{\mathrm{R} \alpha} / K_{\mathrm{R} \beta}\right)$ and $\left(K_{\mathrm{T} \beta} / K_{\mathrm{T} \alpha}\right)$ are taken to be 2,5 and 10 , respectively. A factor 2 changes $n$ very little, whilst a factor of 10 leads to $n \sim 0.75$ when the system is
predictions of the model becomes difficult since it is structurally reasonable that most changes in the structure will affect several parameters. Nevertheless, the qualitative variation of $n$ and $\log p_{50}$ together (Fig. 16) remains the most crucial test that the model accurately describes the intermediate structures in the ligation of haemoglobin. It is worth stressing again that changes in $\log p_{m}$ for modified haemoglobins are explained by changes in the structures of deoxy- and fully liganded haemoglobin, and do not depend on the structures of the intermediate states. It is only the joint variation of $p_{m}$ ( $\approx p_{50}$ ) and $n$ with conditions that tests the model in respect of the intermediate structures and therefore in respect of the mechanism of co-operativity.

Szabo and Karplus (1972) have examined the oxygen equilibrium properties of several modified haemoglobins where one or other chain had a modified C-terminal residue. They allowed $K_{T_{\alpha}}$ and $K_{T \beta}$ to alter in ways suggested by the stereochemical proposals of Perutz (1970) and found that the $n$ and $\log p_{50}$ values for these haemoglobins could then be qualitatively accounted for with the allosteric model.

Figure 21 has been compiled to illustrate the qualitative agreement of oxygen equilibrium data for abnormal haemoglobins with the allosteric model predictions. The plausible assumption has been made that $K_{R \alpha}$ and $K_{R \beta}$ are the same as the $p_{50}$ values of the free chains that comprise the abnormal haemoglobins. The $\log p_{50}$ values of abnormal haemoglobin from Tables 17 and 18 have been expressed relative to the measured $\log p_{R}$ (i.e. $\frac{1}{2} \log p_{\alpha}+\frac{1}{2} \log p_{\beta}$ ) of their appropriate free chains, and only

entirely in $T$ or in $R$, and $n_{\text {max }}$ drops from 3.1 to 2.7. The variation of $\log p_{m}$ with $\log L$ when the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains have these differences, is indistinguishable from the $\log p_{m}$ versus $\log L$ plot of Fig. 16.

When $L$ is very small, and the molecule is in the $R$ structure even when deoxygenated, from equations (7.16) and (7.17),
$$\begin{gathered}
p_{m} \rightarrow\left(K_{R \alpha} K_{R \beta}\right)^{1 / 2} \\
A_{1}^{\prime} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{K_{R \alpha}}+\frac{1}{K_{R \beta}}\right) \\
A_{4}^{\prime} \rightarrow \frac{2}{\left(K_{R \alpha}+K_{R \beta}\right)}, \\
\Delta F_{I} \rightarrow \mathrm{RT} \ln \frac{4 K_{R \alpha} K_{R \beta}}{\left(K_{R \alpha}+K_{R \beta}\right)^{2}} \\
n<1 .
\end{gathered}$$

When $L$ is very large, so large that $L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}$ is also large, the molecule will be in the $T$ state even when oxygenated and
$$\begin{gathered}
p_{m} \rightarrow\left(K_{\mathrm{T} \alpha} K_{\mathrm{T} \beta}\right)^{1 / 2} \\
A_{1}^{\prime} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{K_{\mathrm{T} \alpha}}+\frac{1}{K_{\mathrm{T} \beta}}\right) \\
A_{4}^{\prime} \rightarrow \frac{2}{\left(K_{T \alpha}+K_{\mathrm{T} \beta}\right)} \\
\Delta F_{\mathrm{I}} \rightarrow \mathrm{RT} \ln \frac{4 K_{\mathrm{T} \alpha} K_{\mathrm{T} \beta}}{\left(K_{T \alpha}+K_{\mathrm{T} \beta}\right)^{2}} \\
n<1
\end{gathered}$$

An approximate expression for $\log p_{m}$ can be used in an analogous way to that shown for the model with equivalent $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains. From (7.17) when $L$ is large and $L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}$ is small
$$\log p_{m} \approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\log K_{R \alpha}+\log K_{R \beta}\right)+\frac{1}{4} \log L .$$

Comparison of oxygen equilibrium data with the model. The variation in $n$ values among the abnormal haemoglobins such as those described in section 5.1 is accounted for by alterations in the constants $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\alpha}}, \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\beta}}, \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\alpha}}, \boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{\beta}}$ and $\boldsymbol{L}$. Comparison of data with
those haemoglobins for which this information is known are included in the figure. $\Delta \log p_{50}\left(=\log p_{50}-\log p_{R}\right)$ is plotted along the theoretical $\Delta \log p_{m}$ versus $\log L$ line and the corresponding $n$ values plotted at the appropriate value of $L$. The figure shows that the model is capable of a qualitative explanation of the equilibrium properties. Only by measuring $A_{1}^{\prime}$ from the lower asymptote of a complete saturation curve for each haemoglobin could a quantitative test of the model be attempted, since structurally it is plausible that $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \beta}$ are different for each haemoglobin so that the $n$ values are not expected to all lie on the same bell-shaped curve. Also the assumption of no constraints in the $R$ state may be invalid and can only be checked by measuring $A_{4}^{\prime}$ from the upper asymptote of the complete saturation curves.

If the $\alpha$-and $\beta$-chains have different affinities from each other in the $R$ and $T$ states the values of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ determined from the oxygen equilibrium curves are related to the separate oxygen dissociation constants by eqs. (7.16). For a co-operative haemoglobin the following simpler expressions are valid approximations:
$$A_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{K_{T \alpha}}+\frac{1}{K_{T \beta}}\right) ; \quad A_{4}^{\prime}=\frac{2}{\left(K_{R \alpha}+K_{R \beta}\right)} .$$

Since only four independent constants are given by each equilibrium curve it is not possible to determine $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-parameters separately without knowing other relationships between the parameters.

The relative concentrations of liganded $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains as a function of total ligand saturation. Experiments such as those of Johnson and Ho (1974), described in section 4.2.6, give a method of measuring the relative concentration of liganded $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits from the NMR spectral changes produced by ligation. In some cases, this information in conjunction with the values of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ could enable the separate $\alpha$ -

and $\beta$-parameters to be obtained. Figure 22 illustrates the relative concentrations of liganded $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains at partial saturation for a particular case where
$$K_{R \alpha}=2 K_{R \beta} \text { and } K_{T \alpha}=\frac{1}{2} K_{T \beta},$$
chosen since the first relationship is approximately that seen in free chains and the second relationship gives $c_{a}>c_{\beta}$ which is known from studies of the cyanomet hybrids. The percentage of chains that are liganded $\alpha$ 's or liganded $\beta$ 's are plotted as a function of the percentage of all chains that are liganded, for three values of $L$. The difference between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affinities shows up when $L$ is small or large, but when $L=10^{5}$ and the co-operativity is high, the difference is not apparent.

The measured relative concentration of liganded $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains is influenced by allosteric effectors like DPG and IHP (see section 4.2.6). In addition to any direct effect the organic phosphates may have on the subunit affinities in the $T$ state, the increase in $L$ due to their presence gives the type of effect illustrated in Fig. 22.

\subsection*{7.6. The Interaction with Protons in the Allosteric Model}

The structural understanding of the difference in proton binding to deoxy and to fully liganded haemoglobin was discussed in section 4.1. All the intermediate structures formed during ligation may bind protons differently, implying that the five parameters of the allosteric model are pH dependent. The general equations for the allosteric model with pH -dependent parameters, and the structural and other evidence on proton binding to the intermediate structures will be discussed in this section.

In the following discussion $\mathrm{H}^{+}$denotes the hydrogen ion and $h$ the concentration of hydrogen ions.

If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$binds differently to liganded and unliganded subunits, then by analogy with the discussion of section 2.6.2, the following results hold. Let $\phi_{s 0}(h)$ be the binding polynomial for protons to an unliganded subunit and $\phi_{s 1}(h)$ that for the liganded subunits. These polynomials involve the ionization constants of the groups whose $\mathbf{p K}$ values are perturbed on ligation of the subunit. If $K$ is the oxygen dissociation constant for a subunit when the proton concentration is very low (i.e. high $\mathbf{p H}$ ) and if $\boldsymbol{K}_{h}$ is the value when the proton concentration is $h$
$$K_{h}=K \frac{\phi_{s 0}(h)}{\phi_{s_{1}}(h)}$$
and the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$released when a subunit is ligated is $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{s}^{+}$in
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{s}^{+}=\frac{d \log \phi_{S 0}(h)}{d \log h}-\frac{d \log \phi_{S 1}(h)}{d \log h}$$
or
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{S}^{+}=\frac{d \log K_{h}}{d \log h}=-\frac{d \log K_{h}}{d \mathrm{pH}} .$$

Thus for $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits in the $R$ and $T$ states
$$\Delta H_{\mathrm{T} \alpha}^{+}=\frac{-d \log K_{\mathrm{T} \alpha}}{d \mathrm{pH}} ; \Delta H_{R \alpha}^{+}=\frac{-d \log K_{\mathrm{R} \alpha}}{d \mathrm{pH}}, \text { etc. }$$

If the subunit has only one binding site for protons $\phi_{S 0}(h)$ and $\phi_{S 1}(h)$ have the simple form
$$\phi_{S 0}(h)=\left(1+B_{S 0} h\right)=\left(1+\frac{h}{K_{S 0}}\right)=\left(1+10^{p^{\mathbf{p}} \mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{s 0}}-\mathbf{p H}}\right)$$
where $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{s o}}=10^{-p K_{\mathbf{s o}}}$ is the ionization constant of the proton binding site in a deoxy subunit.

Similarly,
$$\phi_{S 1}(h)=\left(1-10^{p K_{s 1}-\mathrm{pH}}\right)$$
and
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{s}^{+}=\frac{10^{\mathrm{p} K_{s o}}}{1+10^{\mathrm{p} K_{s o}-\mathrm{pH}}}-\frac{10^{\mathrm{p} K_{s 1}}}{1+10^{\mathrm{pK} K_{s 1}-\mathrm{pH}}} .$$

In general there may be more than one proton binding site per subunit whose ionization constant changes on ligation of the subunit, and $\phi_{s 0}(h)$ and $\phi_{s 1}(h)$ are longer polynomials. If the proton binding sites within a subunit are independent $\phi_{s o}(h)$ can be written as a product of terms (see section 2.6.2)
and
$$\Delta \mathbf{H}_{s}^{+}=\sum_{i=1}^{q} \Delta \mathbf{H}_{3 i}^{+}$$

A complete formulation of the allosteric model requires specification of $\phi_{s o}(h)$ and $\phi_{s_{1}}(h)$ for the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in the $R$ and $T$ states in terms of the $\mathbf{p} K$ changes of identified Bohr groups. It is possible that a particular Bohr group has a different $\mathbf{p K}$ in intermediate states from the pK it has in either deoxy-or oxyhaemoglobin.

If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$binds differently to the $R$ and $T$ states, and if $\phi_{T}(h)$ and $\phi_{R}(h)$ are the binding polynomials for the $T$ and $R$ states respectively, then
$$L_{h}=L \frac{\phi_{T}(h)}{\phi_{R}(h)}$$
and
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}=\frac{d \log L_{h}}{d \log h}=-\frac{d \log L_{h}}{d \mathrm{pH}}$$
where $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}$is the number of protons released when the quaternary structure changes irrespective of the state of ligation of the subunits.

If there are several binding sites for protons in $R$ and $T$ which from structural considerations are not expected to interact directly with each other,
$$\phi_{T}(h)=\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{T 1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{T 2}}\right) \cdots\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{T q}}\right)$$
and
$$\phi_{R}(h)=\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{R 1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{R 2}}\right) \cdots\left(1+\frac{h}{\mathbf{K}_{R q}}\right)$$
where $\mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{T} 1}, \mathbf{K}_{\mathbf{R} 1}$, etc., denote the ionization constants of the Bohr groups. Then
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}=\sum_{i=1}^{q} \frac{-d \log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{TI}}}\right)}{d \mathrm{pH}}+\frac{d \log \left(1+\frac{d}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{Ri}}}\right)}{d \mathrm{pH}} .$$

Also,
$$\log L_{h}=\log L+\sum_{i=i}^{q}\left[\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{TI}}}\right)-\log \left(1+\frac{h}{\mathrm{~K}_{\mathrm{RI}}}\right)\right]$$
which expresses the pH dependence of the parameter $L_{n}$. Again the complete formulation of the model requires specification of identified Bohr groups whose $\mathbf{p} \boldsymbol{K}$ 's change between $R$ and $T$.

The expression for the total release of protons on ligation is
$$\frac{\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+}}{4}=-\frac{d \log p_{m}}{d \mathrm{pH}} \quad(\text { see eq. (4.2)) }$$

From eq. (7.17),
$$\log p_{m}=\frac{1}{2} \log K_{R \alpha}+\frac{1}{2} \log K_{R \beta}+\frac{1}{4} \log \frac{(L+1)}{\left(L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}+1\right)} .$$

Differentiating the above equation,
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{d \log p_{m}}{d \mathrm{pH}}= & \frac{1}{2\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}\left(\frac{d \log K_{\mathrm{R} \alpha}}{d \mathrm{pH}}+\frac{d \log K_{\mathrm{R} \beta}}{d \mathrm{pH}}\right) \\
& +\frac{L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}}{2\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}\left(\frac{d \log K_{\mathrm{r} \alpha}}{d \mathrm{pH}}+\frac{d \log K_{\mathrm{r} \beta}}{d \mathrm{pH}}\right) \\
& +\frac{1}{4} \frac{L\left(1-c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}{(L+1)\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)} \times \frac{d \log L}{d \mathrm{pH}}
\end{aligned}$$
or substituting from eqs. (7.19) and (7.20)
$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+}}{4}=\frac{1}{2\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}\left(\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \alpha}^{+}+\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \beta}^{+}\right)+\frac{L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}}{2\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}\left(\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T \alpha}^{+}+\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T \beta}^{+}\right) \\
+\frac{1}{4} \frac{L\left(1-c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)}{(L+1)\left(1+L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2}\right)} \Delta \mathrm{H}_{Q}^{+}
\end{gathered}$$

So the total release of bound protons is made up of the contributions from five possible terms.

The terms $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{Q}^{+}, \Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \alpha}^{+}$, etc., will be the sums of contributions from independent binding sites if there is no interaction between sites within subunits or within quaternary structures, which is reasonable if the ionizing groups are far apart. In general $\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+} / 4$, given by eq. (7.23), reflects the interaction between the binding sites that occurs because of the quaternary structure change. In some simple cases the binding sites are actually or effectively independent of each other. Firstly, if the quaternary structure does not change from either $R$ or $T$ with change in ligation state, $\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+} / 4$ involves only sums of independent terms, which is also the case if proton binding is entirely linked to tertiary structure changes so that $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}=0$, with $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{R} \alpha}^{+}=\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{T} \alpha}^{+}$and $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{R} \beta}^{+}=\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{T} \beta}^{+}$. Secondly, if $L \geqslant 1$ and $L c_{\alpha}^{2} c_{\beta}^{2} \ll 1$, corresponding to the quaternary structure changing completely from $T$ to $R$ during oxygenation, $\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+} / 4$ can be approximated by
$$\frac{\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+}}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{R} \alpha}^{+}+\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{R} \beta}^{+}\right)+\frac{1}{4} \Delta \mathrm{H}_{Q}^{+}$$
which is again a sum of independent contributions. This condition on $L$ applies to normal haemoglobin so that protons bind to effectively independent sites, even if proton binding is not independent of the quaternary structure change. For values of $L$ not satisfying the above condition, the interaction between binding sites due to any quaternary linkage of proton binding will be apparent.

The release of protons at each stage of ligation will be an exactly linear function of the fractional saturation with ligand, $\bar{Y}$, only if
$$\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \alpha}^{+}=\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \beta}^{+}=\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T \alpha}^{+}=\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T \beta}^{+} \text {and } \Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}=0$$

Otherwise there will be a non-linear relationship. In a co-operative haemoglobin, however, the deviation from linearity will not be very great even if the change in number of bound protons is entirely linked to the quaternary structure change. For example, in Fig. 17 the change in fraction of molecules in the $R$ and $T$ structures is shown as a function of $\bar{Y}$ for two cases where the co-operativity is high and the deviation of the fraction in $R$ from being a linear function of the fraction $\bar{Y}$ is quite small. In practice for the oxygenation of normal haemoglobin the release of protons is apparently linear with ligand saturation although it is known from other considerations that it cannot be strictly so. For oxidation at pH 6.5 the release of protons lags behind ligand saturation showing that some protons in this case must be released when the quaternary structure changes.

Experimental evidence relating to the stage at which various Bohr groups contribute their protons. Proton release in carbon monoxide and oxygen binding. As discussed in section 4.1.3, equilibrium results on oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to haemoglobin at different pH values and kinetic measurements of proton release on uptake of these ligands indicate that at alkaline pH proton release is proportional to the amount of ligand bound in the early stages of ligation. This strict proportionality does not apply for the last binding step and the equilibrium and kinetic results give a less clear indication of how much proton release is associated with this step. Proportionality in the early stages, when normal haemoglobin is in the $T$ state, implies that all the alkaline Bohr groups contribute to the pH dependence of either $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T \alpha}}$ or $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T \beta}}$. Since proton release comes from the ionizing groups whose $\mathbf{p} \boldsymbol{K}$ 's are raised as a result of the groups being involved in salt bridges, the latter must be broken on oxygenation in the $T$ state. This conclusion was incorporated
into the proposal of Perutz (1970). Since $A_{4}^{\prime}$ depends very little on pH , tertiary structure changes in $R$ cannot release many protons, i.e. $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \alpha}^{+}$and $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{R \beta}^{+}$are smaller than $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{T}_{\alpha}}^{+}$ and $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{T} \beta}^{+}$. This implies that $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{Q}}^{+}$, the number of protons that would be released on the quaternary structure change, whatever the state of ligation of the subunits, is significant and consequently L is pH dependent. Since $K_{R \alpha}$ and $K_{R \beta}$ are less pH dependent than $K_{T \alpha}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{T} \boldsymbol{\beta}}, \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}$ and $\boldsymbol{c}_{\beta}$ are also pH dependent.

The dependence of $n$ on pH . Bunn and Guidotti (1972) investigated the pH dependence of $n$ and $\log p_{s o}$ for oxygenation in various salt concentrations. They found that at low ionic strength when the affinity of haemoglobin is quite high, $n$ increases slightly with decreasing pH. At high ionic strength, in the presence of DPG and IHP when the oxygen affinity is lower, $n$ increases slightly with increasing pH . This type of variation of $n$ is qualitatively to be expected from the allosteric model if $L$ is to some extent pH dependent (see Fig. 16). The small degree of variation of $n$ with pH suggests that proton release is not entirely linked to the quaternary structure change, and is consistent with $c_{\alpha}$ and $c_{\beta}$ being pH dependent, as concluded above. The pH dependent $n$ values of cat haemoglobin and of Hb Milwaukee are consistent with a pH dependent value of $L$ (Hamilton and Edelstein, 1972) and many equilibrium properties of carp haemoglobin, which shows a very large variation in properties with pH , have been accounted for quite successfully with a pH -dependent $L$ in the allosteric model (Tan et al., 1973; Tan and Noble, 1973). Also the pH dependent $n$ values of $\operatorname{des}(\operatorname{Arg})$ and Hb Chesapeake are explained by the low values of $L$ for these haemoglobins (see Fig. 21) which makes their $n$ values very sensitive to small changes of $L$ with pH .

Proton release from $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains in $n$-BIC binding. In contrast to the proportionality of proton release with carbon monoxide uptake, there is a lag in proton release with uptake of the ligand n-BIC (see section 4.1.3). Olson and Gibson (1973a) estimate that $20 \%$ of the proton release associated with n-BIC binding occurs with the fast phase of ligand binding, which has been shown to correspond to ligation of the $\beta$-chains. In the allosteric model this implies that ligation of the $\beta$-chains in the $T$ state with n -BIC releases protons, presumably from perturbation of the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge. The remaining protons released with the slower phase include all protons released from the $\alpha$-chains and with the quaternary structure change. At the pH of the experiment ( pH 7.0 ) the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge has been shown to contribute about $30 \%$ of the total protons released on oxygenation (Kilmartin et al., 1973). Olson and Gibson's finding of $20 \%$ of the protons associated with the $\beta$-chains can be taken to indicate that with the ligand n-BIC the tertiary structure changes induced by ligation of the $\beta$-chains only perturb the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge and no other ionizing groups. The unidentified Bohr group must therefore release its protons on ligation of the $\alpha$-chains or when the quaternary structure changes. If the tertiary structure changes induced by binding n-BIC are the same as those for binding carbon monoxide, for which case there is no lag in proton release, the unidentified ionizing groups must release protons on ligation of the $\alpha$-chains in the $T$ state.

The binding of protons to partially oxidized haemoglobin. As discussed in section 4.1.4, in the oxidation-reduction equilibrium of haemoglobin, $n$ varies with pH and the release of protons is non-linear with fractional oxidation. At pH 6.5 there is a clear lag in release of protons with percentage oxidation whereas at high pH the lag is much less. In section 7.1 it was discussed that at pH 6.5 the salt bridges responsible for part of the oxidation Bohr effect are not perturbed when oxidation occurs in the $T$ state. The salt bridge between His $146 \beta$ and Asp $94 \beta$ and the environment of the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chains were not altered. As mentioned in section 4.2.7, Kilmartin (1973) has shown that when the quaternary structure change on oxidation is prevented by the presence of IHP, half the normal number of protons are released on oxidation, which must be the contribution of the unidentified Bohr groups since the two identified Bohr groups do not contribute in the T state. At pH 6.5 , therefore, the two identified Bohr groups do not contribute to $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T_{\alpha}}^{+}$and $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{T \beta}^{+}$whereas the other group does, and protons will be released from the identified Bohr groups only on the quaternary structure change. The release of protons from met $\beta$ subunits when the quaternary structure
changes is observed in Hb Milwaukee, for which the number of protons released per tetramer on oxygenation is almost equal to that for normal haemoglobin although the $\beta$-chains stay in the met form.

Comparison of oxidation and oxygenation. The decrease in $n$ with decreasing pH for the oxidation of haemoglobin compared to the almost constant $n$ for oxygenation can be explained by the allosteric model as a consequence of $L$ being pH dependent and $c$ for oxidation being greater than $c$ for oxygenation (Hopfield, 1973; Perutz et al., 1974c; Szabo and Karplus, 1975c). This latter difference is to be expected as explained in section 7.1.

The qualitative explanation of the difference in dependence of $n$ on pH for oxidation and oxygenation can be seen from Fig. 18. The parameter $c$ for oxygenation depends on pH because the breaking of pH -dependent salt bridges is linked to tertiary structure changes on ligation in $T$. $c$ for oxidation is different at pH 6.5 and pH 8.0 because in the first case the ferric iron atom has high spin and in the second case it has lower spin. If $c$ for oxygenation at pH 6.5 gives the curve (1) and at pH 8.0 gives the curve (3) then, since $L$ is pH dependent varying between about $10^{6}$ and $10^{4}, n$ for oxygenation will be fairly constant at about 3 , as shown by the open circles marked on the curves. If curve (5) corresponds to oxidation at pH 6.5 and curve (4) to oxidation at pH 8.0 where $c$ is smaller, then $n$ will vary from 1.2 to 2.6 for the same change in $L$. This is qualitatively the variation of $n$ seen in oxidation as pH is changed. The free $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains of haemoglobin are known to differ more in their oxidation-reduction potentials than in their oxygen affinities, by a factor of about 10 as opposed to a factor of 2 , and these differences are probably retained in the tetramer. Figure 20 illustrated the decrease in $n$ produced by a difference in affinity of a factor of 10 between the subunits. This effect will also contribute to the lower $n$ values in oxidation than in oxygenation.

The effect of IHP on the Bohr effects of abnormal haemoglobins. Kilmartin et al. (1975) have studied the Bohr effects of modified haemoglobins in the presence and absence of IHP. Table 18 gave the number of protons released by these abnormal haemoglobins on oxygenation at pH 7.4 , expressed as a percentage of the number of protons released by HbA . The negligible Bohr effect of des(Arg.Tyr) in the absence of phosphates and its restoration to $75 \%$ in the presence of IHP imply that the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge cannot form in deoxy $\beta$-subunits in the $R$ state whereas it does in the $T$ state. This is consistent with the results of an X-ray study of an abnormal deoxyhaemoglobin in the $R$ state, horse des(Arg), in which the His $146 \beta$-Asp $94 \beta$ salt bridge was seen to be broken (Perutz, unpublished). The negligible Bohr effect of NES des(Arg) in the absence of phosphates and its restoration to $60 \%$ in the presence of IHP implies that the $\alpha$-amino group of the $\alpha$-chains and some other ionizing group can only contribute to the Bohr effect if the deoxyhaemoglobin is in the $T$ state.

Table 18 shows that the Bohr effect of des(Arg) and Hb Kempsey are increased from about 40 to $100 \%$ of normal by the addition of IHP. Also the Bohr effect of des(His.Tyr) is increased by the addition of IHP. No known Bohr group is expected to be directly perturbed either in Hb Kempsey or in $\operatorname{des}(\mathrm{Arg})$, and $\operatorname{des}(\mathrm{His} . \mathrm{Tyr})$ would have a $50 \%$ Bohr effect if all ionizing groups except His $146 \beta$ were contributing as normal. The probable explanation of the reduced but not negligible Bohr effects for these three haemoglobins in the absence of IHP is that $L$ is small. Equation (7.23) shows that the exact number of protons released is extremely sensitive to the value of $L$ when $L$ is small. For example, if $L=1,50 \%$ of the quaternary linked Bohr will be present and if $L=2,66 \%$. When $L$ is increased to a large value by the addition of IHP, $\Delta \mathrm{H}^{+}$would be restored to the normal value.

Summary of the evidence on the stage at which particular ionizing groups release their protons. From the preceding discussion several conclusions on the role of protons in the allosteric model can be drawn. These are summarized in Table 23 which shows the collected evidence on the state of the ionizing groups that contribute to the alkaline Bohr effect when subunits in the $T$ and $R$ quaternary structures are in the deoxy, met or oxy forms.

Although the stage at which each Bohr group is perturbed is not fully specified yet, and although it is not known with which chain the unidentified Bohr group or groups are

\subsection*{7.7. The Interaction with Organic Phosphates}

The role of DPG and IHP as simple allosteric effectors, binding more strongly to $T$ than to $\boldsymbol{R}$, has already been considered in previous sections. The possibility has to be considered, however, that DPG and IHP bind slightly differently to the $T$ and $R$ states, depending on the state of ligation of the subunits within $T$ and $R$. The complete specification of the model for haemoglobin requires a knowledge of the binding of organic phosphates to the intermediate states.

Experimental evidence on organic phosphate binding. Many results confirm the view that organic phosphates are mainly released when the quaternary structure changes.

Release of DPG as a function of ligand saturation. As mentioned in section 4.2, Huestis and Raftery (1972c) observed a lag in fractional release of DPG as a function of fractional saturation with ligand. A lag in DPG release is expected if the binding of DPG is quaternary linked, and if $L c^{2}>1$ the fraction of DPG released will be less than $50 \%$ when the ligand saturation is $50 \%$. The experiments showed that the lag was greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4 which is consistent with $L$ being greater at the lower pH . The authors, however, give an alternative interpretation of their results not in terms of the allosteric model.

When $L c^{2}>1$, Fig. 17 shows that the fractional release of DPG would be expected to be greater than $50 \%$ when the ligand saturation is $50 \%$, if DPG release is mainly linked to the quaternary structure change. Experiments that might have demonstrated this property of the allosteric model are those of Ogata and McConnell (1972) and Ogata et al. (1972) who used their spin-label technique to study the release of an analogue of DPG from two abnormal haemoglobins which have high affinity and therefore low expected values of $L$. They found, however, that for both Hb Chesapeake and Hb Kempsey the release of organic phosphate did not show this effect. These results are consistent with the allosteric model if in each case the affinity of one type of subunits in the $T$ state is almost equal to that in the $R$ state, so that combination of the haemoglobin with the first two ligands does not alter the allosteric equilibrium or release organic phosphate. Hb Chesapeake and Hb Kempsey have both been studied by NMR techniques and ligands bind preferentially to the $\alpha$-chains in Hb Chesapeake (Davis et al., 1971) to the $\beta$-chains in Hb Kempsey (Lindstrom et al., 1973). Since the
modifications alter $L$, two effects may contribute to the results of preferential binding experiments. Firstly, heterogeneity between $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains that is present even in normal haemoglobin may become apparent (see section 7.5) and secondly, the difference between the affinity of the $\alpha$-and $\beta$-chains may have been increased by the modification.

Kinetic studies of the release of DPG with ligand uptake. The results of MacQuarrie and Gibson (1972), mentioned in section 4.2.4, showed a kinetic lag between carbon monoxide uptake and DPG release in normal haemoglobin. This lag was greater at pH 6.0 than at pH 7.5 , which is consistent with $L$ being larger at the lower pH . The authors also studied abnormal haemoglobins that have increased affinity, including des(His), Hb Hiroshima, Hb Chesapeake, HbA treated with $p$-mercuribenzoate, all of which showed less lag than normal HbA , consistent with their having lower values of $L$ and changing quaternary structure earlier in the course of ligation. The increased lag in proton release behind ligand uptake found in the presence of organic phosphates (see section 4.2.5) is consistent with the release of organic phosphates (and the extra protons associated with their binding to deoxyhaemoglobin) being mainly linked to the quaternary structure change.

Evidence from the change in shape of oxygen equilibrium curves in the presence of chloride and organic phosphates. If organic phosphate binding is only quaternary linked, the allosteric model predicts a variation in $n$ value with type of salt and with salt concentration, although if $L$ is such that $n$ is near its maximum there will be only a small variation in $n$ (see Fig. 16). Also $K_{T}$ and $K_{R}$ are invariant and when co-operativity is high $A_{1}^{\prime}$ is effectively $1 / K_{T}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ is effectively $1 / K_{R}$. But if organic phosphate binding depends on the number of ligated subunits in the $T$ or $R$ states, $A_{1}^{\prime}$ and $A_{4}^{\prime}$ will alter with type and concentration of organic phosphates.

The values of $A_{4}^{\prime}$ for oxygen equilibrium curves are almost the same in low ionic strength buffer and when chloride or DPG is present (Table 14). In the presence of IHP $A_{4}^{\prime}$ is smaller, but is consistent with the prediction of the allosteric model for a large value of $L$ when both the affinity and co-operativity are lower than normal (to the right-hand side of Fig. 16). The available data on $A_{4}^{\prime}$ are therefore consistent with a value of $K_{R}$ that varies by a factor of about 2 depending on the ionic strength of the solution.

The values of $A_{1}^{\prime}$ for oxygen equilibrium curves are not invariant with type and concentration of salts (see Table 14). The large change in $A_{\prime}^{\prime}$ resulting from the presence of chloride or organic phosphates shows that chloride and phosphates must be released on ligation of a subunit in the $T$ state (see the discussion in section 2.6.2). In low ionic strength buffer, organic phosphates do not bind with stoichiometry one mole per tetramer, and in these conditions they may be binding to many sites on the separate subunits.

In the presence of 0.1 m NaCl , organic phosphates bind with stoichiometry one mole per tetramer to a specific site between the $\beta$-chains in deoxyhaemoglobin and to an unknown site in oxyhaemoglobin (see section 4.2.3). The variation in $A_{1}^{\prime}$ with the presence of organic phosphates is smaller in these conditions and may be within experimental error. In the presence of IHP, $A_{1}^{\prime}$ decreases by a factor 3.5, and in the presence of DPG by a factor of 2 . If these changes are real, then to some extent IHP and DPG are released on ligation of a subunit in the $T$ structure. Structural changes at the $\beta$-haems that could be associated with the effect of organic phosphates on the ligand affinity in the $T$ state were described in section 4.2.3.

The implication of a dependence of organic phosphate binding on the state of ligation in the $T$ state in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl when there is one mole per tetramer bound to a specific site, is that there is interaction between subunits within one quaternary structure in respect of ligand binding. From structural considerations it is reasonable that the binding constant of DPG to the $T$ state would be affected by ligation of the $\beta$-chains only. In this case, by analogy with equations (2.19) in section 2.6.2,
$$K_{T \beta 1}=K_{T \beta} \times \frac{\left(1+B_{0}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)}{\left(1+B_{\beta 1}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)}$$
$$K_{T \beta 2}=K_{T \beta} \times \frac{\left(1+B_{\beta 1}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)}{\left(1+B_{\beta 2}[\mathrm{DPG}]\right)}$$
where $K_{T \beta}$ is the oxygen dissociation constant of the $\beta$-chains in the absence of DPG, and $K_{T \beta 1}$ and $K_{T \beta 2}$ are the constants for the first and second oxygen to bind to the $\beta$-chains when DPG is present. $\boldsymbol{B}_{0}, \boldsymbol{B}_{\beta 1}, \boldsymbol{B}_{\beta 2}$ denote the binding constants of DPG to the $T$ state when 0,1 , or 2 chains are oxygenated. In general $K_{T \beta 1}$ differs from $K_{T \beta 2}$, which is a case of interaction between subunits in the $T$ state. The structural reason for the interaction is that DPG or IHP is bound between two subunits. In the formulation of the allosteric model for proton binding (section 7.5) it was assumed that proton release in the $T$ state is the result of tertiary structure changes in one subunit only. However, if some of the protons associated with the pH -dependent intersubunit salt bridges were released by tertiary structure changes in either of the subunits to which the salt bridging residues belong, then direct interaction between the subunits would arise.

This emphasizes how little difference there is in structural terms between a model in which there is no direct interaction between subunits and one in which such interactions occur, and shows that direct interactions are very likely to occur to some extent. Nevertheless, the major difference in affinity for the first and last ligand to bind to haemoglobin would still result from the change in quaternary structure when many constraints on the subunits are removed together.

\section*{8. CONCLUSIONS}

The allosteric model, combined with the structural understanding of its parameters, has been shown to describe qualitatively many of the functional properties of haemoglobin. In this model, two quaternary conformations with different oxygen affinities exist in equilibrium at all stages of oxygenation. The low affinity conformation, $T$, has the quaternary structure of deoxyhaemoglobin, whereas the high affinity conformation, $R$, has the quaternary structure of oxyhaemoglobin. A subunit in the $R$ form has an oxygen affinity and an absorption spectrum like those of isolated subunits, whereas a subunit in the $T$ form has a lower oxygen affinity and an altered spectrum due to structural differences in the vicinity of the haem group. The bonds from the iron atom to the nitrogens of the haem group and of the haem-linked histidine are longer, with the iron atom lying further out of the plane of the haem group in a subunit in the $T$ state than in a free subunit. This tertiary structure is stabilized by the intersubunit contacts of the $T$ form, particularly by the salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed by the last two residues at the C -termini of both the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-chains.

When the high spin ferrous iron atom of a deoxy subunit combines with a ligand, its radius changes as a consequence of its changed valency or spin state and it moves further into the plane of the porphyrin ring of the haem group accompanied by changes in tertiary structure of the subunit. In the $T$ state these tertiary structure changes destabilize the intersubunit contacts, decreasing the stability of the $T$ form relative to the $R$ form. When several ligands are bound, the $R$ form becomes more stable than the $T$ form. The movement of the iron atom, and hence the extent to which the $T$ state is destabilized, is greater if the iron atom is low spin ferrous or low spin ferric after it has combined with ligand, as in oxygenation, than if the iron atom is high spin ferric, as in oxidation to the aquomet form.

The altered oxygen affinities of many abnormal haemoglobins are understood, independently of the allosteric model of the intermediate states, in terms of the altered structures of either their oxy or deoxy forms. The differences in co-operativity among abnormal haemoglobins are qualitatively explained by the allosteric model in which the structural changes are seen as altering the relative stability of the $R$ and $T$ forms at all stages of oxygenation. This allosteric equilibrium is altered particularly by modifications to the C -terminal residues of either chain or to residues in the $\alpha_{1} \beta_{2}$ contact. In addition to their effect on the allosteric equilibrium, some modifications alter the affinity of the subunits in the T state and affect the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-subunits unequally.

The dependence of oxygen affinity on pH is largely understood, again independently of the allosteric model, in terms of altered ionization constants of identified Bohr
groups in oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. The Bohr groups contributing to the acid Bohr effect and to part of the alkaline Bohr effect are not identified yet. The dependence of co-operativity on pH can be described by the allosteric model. In the alkaline pH range, the equilibrium between the $R$ and $T$ forms of deoxyhaemoglobin is influenced towards $T$ by lower pH , whereas the equilibrium for fully oxygenated haemoglobin is nearly independent of $\mathbf{p H}$. The oxygen affinity of subunits in the $T$ state is lower at low $\mathbf{p H}$ because some $\mathbf{p H}$-dependent salt bridges are broken on oxygenation of subunits in the $T$ state, but the stage in oxygenation at which each of the ionizing groups is perturbed is not yet fully described.

The effect of organic phosphates on the oxygen equilibrium properties of normal, abnormal and hybrid haemoglobins is well described by the allosteric model, with organic phosphates influencing the allosteric equilibrium towards the $T$ form. The binding site for organic phosphates in deoxyhaemoglobin is established whereas that in oxyhaemoglobin is not yet known.

The allosteric model with structural evidence for changes in its parameters provides a framework in which many properties of haemoglobin can be described in a unified way. Detailed quantitative tests of the model are complicated by the number of parameters that can vary either if the conditions are changed or if the structure is modified. The most promising system for a quantitative test of some aspects of the model is provided by the artificial mixed-valency hybrids in which only two subunits can combine with oxygen while the protein structure is normal.
