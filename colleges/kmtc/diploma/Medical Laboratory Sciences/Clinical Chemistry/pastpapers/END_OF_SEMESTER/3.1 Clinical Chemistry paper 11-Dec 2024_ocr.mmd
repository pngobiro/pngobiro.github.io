\section*{SECTION B}
21. List the precautions to be taken during the collection of blood for Arterial Blood gas analysis (5 marks)

Avoid pain and anxiety in the patient, which will lead to hyperventilation.
1. Hyperventilation due to any cause leads to decreased CO2 and increased pH.
2. Keep blood cool during transit.
3. Don't clench your finger or fist. This will lead to lower $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and increased acid metabolites.
4. $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ values are lower in the sitting or standing position than in the supine position.
5. Don't delay the performance of the test.
6. Avoid air bubbles in the syringe.
7. Excess of heparin decreases the $\mathrm{pCO}_{2 \text { by }}$ maybe $40 \%$ less.
8. Not mixing the blood properly before the test may give a false result.
9. A prolonged tourniquet or muscular activity decreases venous $\mathrm{pO}_{2}$ and pH .
10. The best way to collect arterial or venous blood is anaerobic.
11. Arterial blood precautions:

✓ Only syringe and needle, no tourniquet, no pull on the plunger.
12. Venous blood precautions:
1. The needle and syringe of the heparinized evacuated tube filled, drawn a few seconds after the tourniquet.
2. Liquid heparin is the only suitable anticoagulant with the proper amount.
1. Less amount will lead to clot formation.
2. The increased amount will lead to increased CO2 and a decrease in pH .
3. This will lead to a dilutional error.
3. Glass collection devices are better than plastic.
13. Avoid in patients with coagulopathy.
14. Avoid in a patient with AV fistula.

\end{tabular}
- This is a case of metabolic acidosis without compensation ( 1 mark)
-The kidney has lost significant $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$of approximately $3 \mathrm{mmEq} / \mathrm{L}$ and the lungs has not compensated for that loss thus remains normal (I mark)
26. Write the principles of manomatric and gasometric determination of total $\mathrm{Co}_{2}$
(5marks)
Manometric: The carbon dioxide in the sample is bound with 10 M sodium hydroxide. An Erlenmeyer flask with a side arm is connected to a manometer and the carbon dioxide is released with sulphuric acid from the prepared sample. The resultant increase in pressure is measured. It allows quantifying carbon dioxide content

Gasometric: Gasometric assays involve measuring the volume of gas liberated or absorbed under specified conditions. Assay procedures involve passing a gas sample through an apparatus like a Hempel burette, where the gas is exposed to a reagent that selectively absorbs the component being assayed.
27. List the controllable and non-controllable risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic plaque (5 marks)

Risk factors for atherosclerosis can be controllable or uncontrollable:

\section*{Controllable risk factors}

These factors can be improved through lifestyle changes:
Smoking: Smoking is a leading preventable risk factor for atherosclerosis. The risk of a heart attack is increased threefold in men and sixfold in women who smoke 20 or more cigarettes per day.

Diet: Eating foods high in trans and saturated fats, like red meat, fried foods, and baked goods, can increase cholesterol levels. Eating lean proteins like chicken, turkey, or oily fish can help reduce bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol.

Physical activity: Being inactive can lead to unhealthy cholesterol levels. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week.

\section*{Uncontrollable risk factors}

These factors cannot be controlled:
Family history: A family history of early atherosclerosis can increase your risk.

Age: Plaque buildup usually starts in childhood and worsens with age.
Gender: Being male can increase your risk.
Other risk factors for atherosclerosis include: High blood pressure, Diabetes, Inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, Obesity, and High cholesterol and triglyceride levels
28. List the functions of the various buffer systems of the body (5marks).

\section*{SECTION C}
29. Using a well labeled illustration, discuss the role of the kidneys in the regulation of Acid-Base balance ( $\mathbf{2 0}$ mks)

\section*{Renal buffering system:}
1. The distle tubule of the kidneys regulates acid-base balance by secreting the $\mathrm{H}+$ ions in the urine and reabsorbing the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$.
2. Dibasic phosphate ( $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}{ }^{-}$) and ammonia ( $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ) are two important renal buffers.
3. The renal buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions requires $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ to form the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$.
4. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reaction.
5. $\mathrm{H}+$ ions are secreted from the tubular cells and buffer in the lumen by $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}=\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{3}{ }^{-}+\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$.
6. The rest of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$is reabsorbed.

\section*{Acid-base balance and role of kidneys}
1. If a respiratory Disease causes acidosis or alkalosis, the kidney becomes active and responds by changing $\mathrm{H}+$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions to return the pH to normal.
1. Renal compensation starts in hours to days after respiratory alteration in the pH .
2. There is a delay, but the renal buffer system is powerful.
3. In academia (acidosis) Kidney excrete an excess of the $\mathrm{H}+$ ions, and these may combine with $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ (phosphate) or $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia) to form titratable acids in the urine.
4. The net outcome is to raise the concentration of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions in the ECF and restore the acid-base balance.
5. In alkalemia (alkalosis), kidneys excrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions, usually with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions.
6. The net result is to decrease the concentration of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions in the ECF and restore the acid-base balance

30 (I) Describe, with the aid of appropriate diagrams the concept of "feedback mechanism" in the control of Hormone secretion (10 marks).

A feedback mechanism is a loop that regulates the production of hormones by using the hormone's effect on other organs to control its own release. There are two types of feedback mechanisms:

\section*{Negative feedback}

Keeps hormone concentrations within a narrow range and maintains homeostasis. For example, when blood glucose levels rise, the pancreas releases insulin to cause cells to absorb more glucose, which lowers blood glucose levels.

\section*{Positive feedback}

Increases the concentration of a hormone. For example, when a baby suckles, the nerve signals from the nipple stimulate the pituitary gland to secrete prolactin, which triggers the mammary glands to secrete milk. The more the baby suckles, the more milk is produced.

\section*{Hormone Regulation: Feedback Mechanisms}

Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis. But what controls the hormones themselves? Most hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms. A feedback mechanism is a loop in which a product feeds back to control its own production. Most hormone feedback
mechanisms involve negative feedback loops. Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow range.

\section*{Negative Feedback}

Negative feedback occurs when a product feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme. The thyroid gland is a good example of this type of regulation. It is controlled by the negative feedback loop shown in Figure below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/8e63b39c-223f-46f9-8acc-58ed762e3c59-12.jpg?height=1310&width=1266&top_left_y=977&top_left_x=445)

The thyroid gland is regulated by a negative feedback loop. The loop includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in addition to the thyroid.

Here's how thyroid regulation works. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropinreleasing hormone, or TRH. TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce
thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones. When the level of thyroid hormones is high enough, the hormones feedback to stop the hypothalamus from secreting TRH and the pituitary from secreting TSH. Without the stimulation of TSH, the thyroid gland stops secreting its hormones. Soon, the level of thyroid hormone starts to fall too low.

\section*{Positive feedback}

Positive feedback occurs when a product feeds back to increase its own production. This causes conditions to become increasingly extreme. An example of positive feedback is milk production by a mother for her baby. As the baby suckles, nerve messages from the nipple cause the pituitary gland to secrete prolactin. Prolactin, in turn, stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk, so the baby suckles more. This causes more prolactin to be secreted and more milk to be produced. This example is one of the few positive feedback mechanisms in the human body.

\section*{Summary}
- Most hormones are controlled by negative feedback, in which the hormone feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme.
- Positive feedback is much less common because it causes conditions to become increasingly extreme.

\section*{30(ii). Give an account of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and the physiological factors that influence secretions of anterior pituitary hormones (10 marks)}

The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is responsible for regulating growth, metabolism, and reproduction through the hormones it produces. The anterior lobe makes up about $80 \%$ of the pituitary gland.

Here are some hormones produced by the anterior pituitary gland and their functions:

\section*{Growth hormone (GH)}

Stimulates growth in children and helps maintain healthy bones and muscles in adults.

\section*{Prolactin (PRL)}

Stimulates the production of breast milk after giving birth. It also contributes to the development of mammary glands during pregnancy.

\section*{Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)}

Plays a role in sexual development and reproduction by affecting the function of the ovaries and testicles.

\section*{Luteinizing hormone (LH)}

Stimulates ovulation in people assigned female at birth and testosterone production in people assigned male at birth.

\section*{Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)}

Triggers the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, the "stress hormone," and androgens.

\section*{Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)}

Stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormones that manage metabolism, energy levels, and the nervous system.

The hypothalamus sends chemical messages to the pituitary to stimulate or inhibit the production of these hormones

\section*{physiological factors that influence secretions of anterior pituitary hormones}

The hypothalamus and feedback loops from target organs are the primary physiological factors that influence the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland:

\section*{Hypothalamus}

The hypothalamus releases hormones that either stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones. For example, the hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to control the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

\section*{Feedback loops}

Target organs send feedback signals to modulate the activity of the anterior pituitary gland. For example, the thyroid gland sends feedback signals to inhibit the secretion of TSH.

The secretion of prolactin by the anterior pituitary is tonically inhibited by dopamine from the tuberoinfundibular pathway of the hypothalamus and stimulated by thyrotropinreleasing hormone (TRH), estrogen, dopamine antagonist (antipsychotics), and multiple factors including suckling, stress, and sleep.
