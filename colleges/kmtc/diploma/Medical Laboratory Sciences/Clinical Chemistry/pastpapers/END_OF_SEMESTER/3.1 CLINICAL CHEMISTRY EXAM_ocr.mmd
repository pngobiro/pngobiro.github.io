25. Write short notes on atherosclerosis (5 marks)
- it is the formation of liquid plaques on the inside walls of arteries causing narrowing and hardening of arteries. This plaque can affect the coronary arteries leading to heart attack (MI).
- in atherosclerosis, the endothelium is damaged and substances travelling in blood (cholesterol, fats and cellular waste material) accumulate in the damaged area of the arterial wall.
- Chemical reactions occurring within the buildup material cause cholesterol molecules to oxidize and initiate inflammatory response in which the endothelial cells at the damage site release chemicals that signal molecules to move to the site and the macrophages which phagocytize the cholesterol.
- The macrophages change and accumulate to form plaque. As plaque increases size, arterial wall thickens and hardens.
- Smooth muscle cells move to the surface of the plaque and contribute to the formation of a firm fibrous scam covering the plaque and reduce blood flow and oxygen received. The plaque erodes and release plaque into blood stream leading to blockage. this leads to death of neighbouring tissues

30. Differentiate the two types of feedback loops that control hormone secretion (20 marks) Negative feedback loops
- A regulated variable (stimulus) is outside its normal range
- That information(stimulus) is picked up by a receptor/sensor
- Receptor sends this information(stimulus) to the control center
- Control center determines if the variable is out of normal range.
- If Control center determines if the variable is out of normal range and sends signals to cells or organs (effector)
- Effectors cause physiological response that will return the variable back to its normal homeostatic range
- Variable returns to normal and stimulus is no longer present.
- Control center allows effector to return back to normal activity until another change is detected.
Positive feedback loops
- Reinforce initial change in variable
- Increase in output
- Result in more of the product
- Occur when something needs to happen quickly
- Bring body further away from normal variable
- Stopped by negative feedbacks once the process that it was used for is complete
