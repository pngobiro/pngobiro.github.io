Q22. Compare and contrast direct and indirect bilirubin
-Direct bilirubin ----------------Indirect bilirubin
- Water soluble ----------------Water insoluble
-Nontoxic -----------------Toxic
-Conjugated -----------------Unconjugated
-Reacts with diazo directly----Does not react with diazo directly
-Not albumin bound ----------Albumin bound (5 marks)
Q23.Endocrine function of the pancreas produces hormones such as - Insulin
- Glucagon
- Epinephrine
- Adrenocortcoid (cortisol and corticosterone)

Exocrine function of the pancreas produces enzymes
such as:
-amylase
-lipase
-trypsin

Q24. Phenolphthalein test for occult blood: Principle:
Hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase yields oxygen which oxidizes phenolphthalein reagent to form a red colour. (5 marks)

Q25. Acute pancreatitis is a disease condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time producing a severe upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
(5 marks)
Q26.Disorders of bilirubin metabolism resulting to jaundice are:
1.) Excessive load of bilirubin represented to the liver to conjugate. This occurs when there is excessive destruction of red blood cells. This causes pre-hepatic jaundice.
2.) Disturbance in the excretion of bilirubin. This occurs when there is an impairment in the bile passage. This causes obstructive jaundice.
3.) Diminished function of the liver cells to conjugate. This causes hepatic jaundice.
(5 marks)
Q27.Causes of acute pancreatitis:
-Blockage of bile duct by gallstones
-Alcoholism
-Certain medicine
-High triglyceride levels in the blood
-High sodium levels in the blood
- Pancreas cancer
(5 marks)
Q28. Hypertensive heart disease is a systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg and diastolic pressure greater than 95 mmHg . (5 marks)

\section*{SECTION 3 LAQ (40 MARKS)}

Q29.Factors influencing glucose tolerance test:
-Dose of glucose given.
WHO recommends 75 g glucose in $250---350 \mathrm{ml}$ of water or 50 g glucose in $150---200 \mathrm{ml}$ of water.
(4 marks)
-Venous or capillary blood.
Capillary blood is recommended because there is an increase utilization of glucose.
(4 marks)
-Age effect.
Glucose tolerance decrease with increasing age.

Random blood glucose level may exceed $10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$ with increasing age.
(4
marks)
-Effect of previous diet
The response to carbohydrate load depends upon the previous meal and the amount of glucose ingested. (4marks)
-Time of the day.
Glucose tolerance test should be done in the morning after fasting over the night because concentration of the hormone level is high.
(4marks)

Q30. Formation of bilirubin begins with the destruction of red blood cells by the cells of reticulo-endothelial system mainly the liver and spleen.

As a result, free haemoglobin is released which is then subjected to a series of enzyme catalyzed degradation metabolic reactions.
(4 marks)
The degradation process of haemoglobin involves the splitting of protein moiety(globin) followed by the opening of iron-photo porphyrin(haem). marks)

This results in the formation of a straightened chain molecule known as biliverdin, a green pigment. marks)

Biliverdin is quickly reduced by tissue enzymes to become bilirubin, a yellow pigment. marks)

This bilirubin is then carried to specialized cells of the liver where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid, a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme known as uridyl diphosphate transferase. (2 marks)
