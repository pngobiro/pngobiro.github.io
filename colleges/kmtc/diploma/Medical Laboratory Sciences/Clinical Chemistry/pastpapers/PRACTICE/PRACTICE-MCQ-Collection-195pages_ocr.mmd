\section*{SECTION B: answer all questions 30 mks}
1. Write short notes on $(10 \mathrm{mks})$
a)india ink Cryptococcus neoformans, because of its large polysaccharide capsule, can be visualized by the India stain. Organisms that possess a polysaccharide capsule exhibit a halo around the cell against the black background created by the India. Specimens should be collected in sterile containers or with sterile swabs and transported immediately to the laboratory. This product is used in conjunction with other biochemical and serological tests to identify cultures of isolated organisms
b)capsule staining

The capsule stain employs an acidic stain and a basic stain to detect capsule production.
Capsules are formed by organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae . Most capsules are composed of polysaccharides, but some are composed of polypeptides. The capsule differs from the slime layer that most bacterial cells produce in that it is a thick, detectable, discrete layer outside the cell wall. Some capsules have well-defined boundaries, and some have fuzzy, trailing edges. Capsules protect bacteria from the phagocytic action of leukocytes and allow pathogens to invade the body. If a pathogen loses its ability to form capsules, it can become avirulent.
Bacterial capsules are non-ionic, so neither acidic nor basic stains will adhere to their surfaces. Therefore, the best way to visualize them is to stain the background using an acidic stain and to stain the cell itself using a basic stain. We use India ink and Gram crystal violet. This leaves the capsule as a clear halo surrounding a purple cell in a field of black.
The medium in which the culture is grown as well as the temperature at which it is grown and the age of the culture will affect capsule formation.Â Older cultures are more likely to exhibit capsule production. When performing a capsule stain on your unknown, be sure the culture you take your sample from is at least five days old
c)cytochrome oxidase test

The oxidase test identifies organisms that produce the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Cytochrome oxidase participates in the electron transport chain by transferring electrons from a donor molecule to oxygen.
The oxidase reagent contains a chromogenic reducing agent (phenylenediamine dihydrochloride), which is a compound that changes color when it becomes oxidized. If the test organism produces cytochrome oxidase, the oxidase reagent will turn blue or purple within 15 seconds.
d)sheep blood agar

Blood Agar is a general purpose enriched medium often used to grow fastidious organisms and to differentiate bacteria based on their hemolytic properties.
"Blood Agar" is not a consistently defined medium. The term "blood agar" generally refers to an enriched base medium to which defibrinated mammalian blood has been added.

In the US "blood agar" is usually prepared from Tryptic Soy Agar or Columbia Agar base with $5 \%$ Sheep blood. Rabbit or horse blood may be used for growth of NAD-requiring organisms, such asHaemophilus species, but the hemolytic patterns may be inconsistent with those on sheep blood.
2. With the aid of a diagram, differentiate a gram positive bacteria cell wall from a gramnegative one(10mks).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Gram positive cell wall & Gram negative cell wall \\
\hline Has a thick peptidoglycan layer & Has a thin peptidoglycan layer \\
\hline Has techoic acid & No techoic acid \\
\hline No periplasm & Has periplasm \\
\hline No LPS & Has LPS \\
\hline

3. Name and explain the phases of bacterial growth curve ( 10 mks )

\section*{BACTERIAL GROWTH CURVE}

\section*{Lag Phase}
- Lag: occurs when organisms are transferred to new medium
- Little increase in cell number
- Bacteria are transporting nutrients inside cell from new medium
- Cells are preparing for replication and division

\section*{Exponential/Log phase}

Bacterial cell division increase
Proceeds as geometric progression
Cell numbers increase as an exponential function of time

\section*{Stationary phase}
-not net increase in cell numbers. Growth rate=death rate

4. Discuss the formation of ketone bodies.

Ketone bodies are produced mainly in the mitochondria of liver cells, and synthesis can occur in response to an unavailability of blood glucose, such as during fasting
Ketogenesis takes place in the setting of low glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of other cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. It can also take place when there is insufficient insulin e.g. in diabetes
The production of ketone bodies is then initiated to make available energy that is stored as fatty acids.

Fatty acids are enzymatically broken down in $\beta$-oxidation to form acetyl-CoA. Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized by the citric acid cycle (TCA/Krebs cycle) and then by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to release energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid $\beta$-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle; i.e. if activity in TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacyl-CoA and $\beta$-hydroxy- $\beta$-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA).

\section*{Steps in ketogenesis:}
1. Catalyzed by enzyme thiolase, 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA condense to form acatoacetylCoA.
2. Catalyzed by enzyme HMG-CoA synthase, acetoacetyl-CoA combines with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to produce HMG-CoA ( $\beta$-hydroxy $\beta$-methyl glutaryl-CoA).
3. HMG-CoA lyase cleaves HMG-CoA to produce acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA.
4. Acetoacetate can undergo spontaneous decarboxylation to form acetone.
5. Acetoacetate can be reduced by a dehydrogenase to $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate.

\section*{i. Uricase}

Used for serum uric acid estimation. Uricase enzyme digests uric acid to form allantoin, hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide. The decrease of absorption at 293 nm is monitored and is related to the uric acid present.
