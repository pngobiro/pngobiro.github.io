                                    <p>The primary prevention strategy for pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) is frequent turning (usually every 2 hours) to relieve pressure. Topical antibiotics are generally not effective for deep ulcers. A white base often indicates slough or necrosis, not healing (which appears as pink granulation tissue).</p>

                                    <p>During the early stages of starvation (e.g., preoperative fasting), insulin levels drop, and glucagon levels rise to facilitate glycogenolysis and lipolysis.

                                    <p>Darkening (blackening) and loss of sensation with a clear line of demarcation typically indicates dry gangrene, usually resulting from ischemia. However, if there was a dirty wound, Gas Gangrene (wet) is a risk, but that usually presents with crepitus, severe pain, and systemic toxicity. Darkening and loss of sensation alone suggests gangrenous change.</p>

                                        <li><strong>IV Fluids:</strong> Rehydration (e.g., Ringer's Lactate) to correct dehydration from vomiting.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Analgesia:</strong> NSAIDs (e.g., Diclofenac) or Opioids (e.g., Pethidine) for pain control.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole) to cover enteric bacteria.</li>
                                        <li>Nasogastric tube if severe vomiting/distension is present.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Cholecystectomy:</strong> Surgical removal of the gallbladder. Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is preferred (usually within 72 hours of onset).</li>
                                    </ul>
