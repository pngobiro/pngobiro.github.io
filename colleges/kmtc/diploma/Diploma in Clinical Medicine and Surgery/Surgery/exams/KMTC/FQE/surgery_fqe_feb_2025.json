        { "id": "c", "text": "Vertical mattress ventrally, horizontal mattress dorsally, and simple interrupted in between", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Simple interrupted dorsally, horizontal mattress ventrally and vertical mattress in between", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Standard practice often involves a horizontal mattress suture at the frenulum (ventral side) to ensure hemostasis of the frenular artery, and simple interrupted sutures elsewhere. Some variations use vertical mattress dorsally to align the skin and mucosa.",
      "hint": "Focus on the ventral side (frenulum) where hemostasis is critical."

        { "id": "d", "text": "An ulcer with white base shows sign of healing", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The primary prevention strategy for pressure sores (decubitus ulcers) is frequent turning to relieve pressure. While '4 hourly' is stated in the option, standard care is often 2-hourly, but A is the only clinically viable preventative option listed. A white base often indicates slough/necrosis, not healing.",
      "hint": "Think about prevention strategies for immobilized patients."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Urgent surgical intervention is required", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Note: Both B and D are clinically correct in this scenario. Circumferential burns lead to eschar formation and compartment syndrome (B), which requires urgent escharotomy (D). In multiple choice logic, identifying the condition (Compartment Syndrome) is often the diagnostic step.",
      "hint": "Circumferential burns act like a tourniquet."
