\section*{Surgery Questions + Answers 2}

\section*{Clinical medicine (Kenya Medical Training College)}

Scan to open on Studocu

Discuss the specific factors affecting operative risks ( 5 mks )
1.Patient's health status

Pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes,heart diseases or obesity increases complications.
2.Type of surgery.

Minor surgeries carry lower risks compared to major surgeries like organ transplant.
3.Surgical Team Expertise.

The skill and experience of surgical team affects the outcome.Complications are less likely with experienced professionals
4.Blood loss and Transmission.

Blood loss during surgery may require transfusions which require their own set of risks e.g blood type compatibility and infection.
5.Complication management plan.

Having a comprehensive plan to address potential complications during and after surgery reduces risks.

\section*{SHOCK}

Briefly describe the types of shock giving clinical features of each(5 marks)
1.HYPOVOLAEMIC SHOCK:

Occurs from inadequate blood volume due to hemorrhage., trauma, burns or dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting leading to decrease in cardiac output and decreased tissue perfusion.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
-Pale and cool skin
-Increases heart rate
-Oliguria
-Hypotension,
-Tachypnea,
- Restlessness due to hypoperfusion,
- Cold extremities,
- Altered mental status,
- Decreased pulse pressure

\section*{2.CARDIOGENIC SHOCK:}

This is acute circulatory failure with sudden with sudden fall in cardiac output from acute disease of the heart without actual reduction in blood volume.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Shortness of breath, Hypotension, Tachycardia, Tachypnea, Oliguria ,Distended neck veins, Lower limb oedema, Basal crepitation, Raised JVP

\section*{3.DISTRIBUTIVE SHOCK :}

Occurs due to abnormal distribution of blood flow .This type is further divided into three subtypes .They include :

✓ SEPTIC SHOCK:
It is induced by severe bacterial infections or septicemia. It may result from either gram negative or gram positive bacteria which release toxins which results to activation of macrophages and monocytes and vasodilation leading to hypotension and decrease in tissue perfusion.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Fever, Hypothermia, Rapid heart rate, Warm or cold skin, Altered mental status, Hypotension, Oliguria

✓ NEUROGENIC SHOCK:
Results from a high spinal cord injury resulting to loss of sympathetic tone leading to Vasodilation hence decrease in venous return.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Hypotension, Bradycardia, Warm, dry skin
✓ ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK:
Results from an antigen - antibody reaction that rapidly occurs after an antigen to which the person is sensitive to enters into the circulation leading to peripheral vasodilation,increased capillary permeability,decrease in cardiac output and decrease In atrial pressure leading to hypoperfusion.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Difficulty in breathing, swelling, Itching, Rapid pulse, Hypotension, Hives.

\section*{4:OBSTRUCTIVE SHOCK;}

Occurs due to physical obstruction of blood flow i. e Obstruction of venous return and circulatory obstruction eg in Constructive pericarditis Cardiac tamponade, Tension pneumothorax and Pulmonary embolism. This leads to reduced blood to the lungs hence resulting into decreased cardiac output and hypotension

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Low BP, Distended neck veins. Difficult in breathing. Tracheal deviation, Muffled heart sounds

\section*{WOUND}
A.Explain local factors that influence wound healing*( 5 mks )
(a) Local infections; they produce tissue destruction, delaying healing
(b)Structures involved; delay in the formation of granulation tissue
(c) Impaired blood supply; slows healing, inhibits fibroblasts and weakens the defence against infection
(d) Loss of tissue ; a large tissue defect leaves a large gap to bridge
(e) Inaccurate skin apposition and the type of suture used
(f) Presence of foreign bodies (contamination)or blood clot in the wound
((g) Mechanism of wounding ; incision , crush ,with avulsion
B.Describe the Complications of wound healing* ( 5 mrks )
1. **Infection**: One of the most common complications, infections can delay healing and lead to more serious issues.
2. **Delayed healing**: Factors such as poor circulation, diabetes, or malnutrition can impede the body's ability to heal wounds in a timely manner.
3. **Excessive scarring**: Sometimes wounds heal with excessive scar tissue, leading to hypertrophic or keloid scars.
4. **Dehiscence**: This refers to the partial or complete separation of the wound edges, which can occur in surgical wounds.
5. **Adhesions**: Abnormal bands of tissue may form between internal organs or tissues, causing pain and restricting movement.
6. **Contractures**: In certain cases, especially with burns, the wound may heal with tight, painful, and restricting scar tissue, limiting movement.
7. **Fistulas**: Abnormal connections between organs or tissues may develop during the healing process.
8. **Chronic wounds**: Some wounds may become chronic, failing to heal within a typical timeframe due to underlying health conditions or other factors.
9. **Necrosis**: Tissue death can occur if blood supply to the wound is compromised, leading to further complications.
10. **Compromised function**: Depending on the location and severity of the wound, there may be long-term functional impairments even after healing.
C. Discuss the difference between a keloid scar and hypertrophic scar*
1.hypertrophic scar remains within the confines of the wound while a keloid scar projects beyond original wound margin
2. Hypertrophic scar usually regresses over a period of time while keloid scar do not regress over time
3. Hypertrophic scar improves with surgical intervention whereas in keloid scar outcome worsen with surgical intervention
4.Hypertrophic scar has no association with skin color while keloid scar is associated with individuals with a darker skin tone
5.hypertrophic scar develops soon after injury while keloid scar may develop several months after injury
6. Hypertrophic scar does not form spontaneously whereas a keloid scar may form spontaneously without prior injury

\section*{CHEST INJURIES}

Briefly discuss on flail chest
It is an injury that is characterized by fracture of two or more consecutive ribs, with each rib having two or more fracture sites.There are paradoxical chest movements, hypoventilation and mediastinal flutter.The fractures may not be seen in chest $X$ ray.

Diagnosis is clinical.
Managed by analgesics, oxygen and fluid therapy or surgery(rarely indicated)

BREAST
What are the different subtypes of breast cancer, and how do they influence treatment decisions?(5mks)

Breast cancer is classified into various subtypes based on specific characteristics of the tumor cells. The main subtypes include:

Hormone Receptor- Positive (HR+): This subtype includes cancers that have receptors for estrogen (ER+) and/or progesterone (PR+). These cancers often respond well to hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, which block the effects of hormones on the cancer cells.

HER2-Positive: These cancers have an overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein, which promotes the growth of cancer cells. Targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta) are effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer.

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC): This subtype lacks receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2. TNBC is more aggressive and has fewer targeted treatment options, making chemotherapy the primary treatment. Recent advancements include the use of immunotherapy for certain cases.

Luminal A and Luminal B: These are subcategories of hormone receptor-positive cancers. Luminal A tumors are slower growing and have a better prognosis, often treated with hormone therapy alone. Luminal B tumors grow faster and may require a combination of hormone therapy and chemotherapy.

Basal-like: Often overlapping with TNBC, basal-like breast cancer is characterized by its molecular profile and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Treatment primarily involves chemotherapy.The subtype of breast cancer influences treatment decisions by determining the most effective therapeutic approach, such as the use of hormone therapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination

\section*{ULCERS}

Describe wargners classification of ulcers ( 5 mks )
Wagner's classification is a grading system used to assess the severity of diabetic foot ulcers. It helps in guiding treatment and predicting outcomes. The classification is divided into six grades, ranging from 0 to 5:

Grade 0: No open lesions, but there may be pre-ulcerative lesions such as healed ulcers or bony deformities.

Grade 1: Superficial ulcer without penetration to deeper layers. The ulcer is confined to the skin.
Grade 2: Deeper ulcer extending to involve tendon, bone, or joint capsule, but without osteomyelitis (bone infection) or abscess.

Grade 3: Deep ulcer with osteomyelitis or abscess. There is an infection of the bone or a localized collection of pus.

Grade 4: Localized gangrene of a part of the foot, such as toes or the heel.
Grade 5: Extensive gangrene involving the whole foot, necessitating major amputation

\section*{BURNS}

Monitoring fluid therapy in burn injuries ( 5 mks )
Adequate resuscitation is measured by urine output: Adults; $30-50 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{hr}$, children; $0.5-2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.Increase the rate of infusion if the urine is less than20 mls$/ \mathrm{hr}$ and decrease the rate of infusion if the urine output is more $60 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{hr}$ because of the risk of pulmonary oedema especially in inhalational injury.

In electrical burns,aim for $100 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{hr}$ to flush the kidney.Hemaglobinuria suggest deep burn hence flush the kidney with increased fluid.

Decrease in BP and urine output suggest need for colloids but a decrease in urine output and but normal BP suggest need for crystalloids and mannitol.

Frequent chest auscultation to detect pulmonary oedema.If possible,CVP line,is the best guide for avoiding over infusion.

Evaluate treatment every 3-4hours.

\section*{SHOCK}

Briefly describe treatment of Hypovolaemic shock (5mks)

After the shock has been identified,effectively manage airway and breathing by administration of oxygen.

Establish iv/io access.
Give $20 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ bolus of fluid in $>15 \mathrm{mins}$
Re-assess clinical signs of shock if signs persists continue to administer fluids
Intra-osseus should be used if iv has not been established within 1 min
Assess the response if no improvement repeat the cycle, a total of 4 bolus can safely be given.
If Severe anaemia is a problem then blood can be used as a bolus fluid as soon as it is available.
Fluids can literally need to be given by hand using a large syringe to get them in fast enough if only a small cannula is available.

Briefly discuss the stages of shock ( 5 mks )
There are three stages:
1. Nonprogressive stage/compensated stage.
2. Progressive stage
3. Irreversible stage

Nonprogressive stage/compensated stage
In the initial stage of shock the body experiences a reduced cardiac output.
The cells switches from aerobic to anaerobic respiration.
The sympathetic reflexes and other factors compensate enough to prevent further deterioration.

The factors causing recovery are all negative feedback control mechanisms of circulation that attempt to return cardiac output and arterial pressure back to normal.

In this stage the body has lost compensatory mechanisms which have maintained tissue perfusion up to this time. This decrease in perfusion results in metabolic acidosis,electrolyte imbalance.

Some positive feedback mechanisms further depress cardiac output in shock, thus causing shock to become progressive.

They include:
-cardiac depression
-vasomotor failure
-blockage of very small vessels-sludged blood
-increased capillary permeability
-release of toxins by ischaemic tissue
-cardiac depression caused by endotoxin
-generalised cellular deterioration
-tissue necrosis in severe shock.

Irreversible shock
This is whereby shock has progressed to a certain stage that transfusion or any other therapy becomes incapable of saving the persons life.

Loss of peripheral vascular resistance
Confusion, slowed speech, unconscious
Slow, irregular, thready pulse
Falling BP (diastolic is zero)
Cold, clammy cyanotic skin
Slow, shallow, irregular respirations
Dilated, sluggish pupils
Severely decreased body temperature
Briefly describe the pathophysiology and management of shock?
Shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation

Pathophysiology of Shock
The pathophysiology of shock involves a series of complex physiological responses:
1.Reduced Perfusion: Regardless of the cause, shock leads to inadequate blood flow to tissues.
2.Cellular Hypoxia: Lack of oxygen impairs cellular metabolism, shifting from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, causing lactic acidosis.
3.Inflammatory Response: The body's response to cellular injury includes the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.
4.Organ Dysfunction: Prolonged hypoperfusion and inflammation lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, characterized by the failure of vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart.

Management of Shock
Effective management of shock focuses on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, along with supportive measures to restore and maintain adequate tissue perfusion:
1.Fluid Resuscitation: Administration of intravenous fluids (crystalloids or colloids) to restore intravascular volume, especially in hypovolemic shock.
2.Vasopressors and Inotropes: Medications like dopamine and dobutamine to support blood pressure and improve cardiac output, primarily used in septic and cardiogenic shock.
3.Oxygen Therapy: Ensuring adequate oxygenation to support cellular metabolism.
4.Treating the Underlying Cause:
(A) *Hypovolemic Shock* : Stopping bleeding, Restoration of blood volume - 1 litre of normal saline in 10 minutes

And transfuse packed Red blood cells
(B) *Cardiogenic Shock* : Treating myocardial infarction, optimizing heart function.
(C) *Distributive Shock:* Administering antibiotics for sepsis, epinephrine is given immediately and IV fluids and vasopressors for hypotension
(D) *Obstructive Shock:* Relieving the obstruction, such as thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism or drainage for cardiac tamponade.
(E) *Monitoring and Support:* Continuous monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and blood gases.
