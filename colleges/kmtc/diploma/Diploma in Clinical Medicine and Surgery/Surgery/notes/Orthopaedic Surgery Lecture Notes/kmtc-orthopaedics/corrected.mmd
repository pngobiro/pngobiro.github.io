ORTHOPAEDICS is a branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system like musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF ORTHOPAEDICS}
- What is valgus ? > <

Is outward angulation of the distal segment of a bone or joint.
- What is varus ? <>

Is medial deviation of the distal bone.
* the condition termed by latin word according to bone or joint affected:
hip $=$ coxa,$\quad$ knee $=$ genu,$\quad$ ankle $=$ talipes,$\quad$ foot $=$ pes,
elbow $=$ cubitus.
e.g. coxa valgus , coxa varus ...
- What is dislocation?

Is complete disruption of the joint, while subluxation is partial dislocation.
- What are fractures ?

Is a break in the structural continuity of bone
- TYPES OF FRACTURE .

According to
1.Mechanism of injury
2.Integrity of the skin
3.Complete or incomplete
4.Configuration of fracture
5.displacement
- CAUSES OF FRACTURES

TRAUMATIC
1-DIRECT
2-INDIRECT
STRESS
PARTHOLOGICAL
1- GENERALIZED BONE DISEASE
2- LOCALIZED BONE DISEASE
- MECHANISM OF INJURY

1- TRAUMATIC INCIDENT
DIRECT FORCE
-The bone breaks at the point of impact
-Causes transverse fracture
-Damage to the overlying skin

\section*{INDIRECT FORCE}
-The bone breaks at a distance from where force is applied
-Soft tissue damage at the fracture site is not inevitable.
- Indirect injury:

Twisting causes $=$ a spiral fracture
Compression $=$ a short oblique
Bending = butterfly fragment
Tension = transverse=avulsion

\section*{2- STRESS FRACTURE}
- A stress fracture is an overuse injury.
- It occurs when muscles become fatigued and are unable to absorb added shock. Eventually, the fatigued muscle transfers the overload of stress to the bone causing a tiny crack called a stress fracture.
- This most often seen in tibia, fibula and metatarsals in athletes, dancers and army recruits.

\section*{3-PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURE}

Abnormal weakening of the bone results in fracture with normal stresses.
* Causes are :
a.Generalized bone diseases
1.Osteogenesis imperfecta
2.Postmenopausal osteoporosis
3.Metabolic bone disease
4.Myelomatosis
5.Polyosteotic fibrous dysplasia
6.paget's disease

\section*{b.Local benign conditions}
1.Chronic infection
2.Solitary bone cyst
3.Fibrous cortical defect
4.Chondromyxiod fibroma
5.Aneurysmal bone cyst
6.Chondroma c.Primary
7.Monostotic fibrous dysplasia

\section*{c.Malignant tumours}
1.Chondrosarcoma
2.Osteosarcoma
3.ewing's sarcoma

\section*{d.Metastatic tumours}

Ca breast, lung, kidney ,thyroid, colon and prostate
- INTIGRITY OF THE SKIN
1. CLOSED OR SIMPLE

If the overlying skin remains intact
2. OPEN OR COMPOUND

If the skin or one of the body cavities is breached, fracture liable to contamination and infection
- COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE

COMPLETE FRACTURE :
The bone is completely broken into two or more fragments.
Transverse $=$ stable after reduction
Oblique or spiral = unstable
Impacted = the fracture line indistinct
Comminuted $=$ is one in which there are more than two fragments $=$ unstable
INCOMPLETE:
the bone is incompletely divided and the periosteum remains in continuity
Example :
Greenstick fracture=the bone is buckled or bent.this is seen in children Compression fracture =cancellous bone
- DISPLACED OR UNDISPLACED

Causes of displacement :
1.The force of the injury
2.The gravity
3.The pull of muscles

\section*{Description of displacement:}
1.Translation or shift-backwards, forwards ,sideways or longiudinally with impaction or overlap.
2.Alignment or angulation - sideways ,backwards or forwards
3.Rotation or twist in any direction.
4.Length

Open Displaced
Through the skin
Not aligned
Can have displaced fx that do not come through the skin
- FRACTURE HEALING:

1-Tissue damage and haematoma formation.
2- Inflammation and cellular proliferation.
3- Callus formation.
4- Consolidation.
5- Remodeling
- Gap healing or contact healing less than 2ooum
- Clinical Symptoms:

Injury.
Inability to use the affected limb.
Pain.
Swelling.
Deformity and crepitation
Weakness
- History :

You should write patient story of presenting illness to know mechanism of injury and analyse the symptoms and complete detail hstory (systemic review , drug history ...).
- Examination:

Exclude vital injuries.
Examine the limb for the fractures and dislocation .
Examine for nerve, vascular or tendon damage.
- O/E
(Look , feel, move)

Look ;
Wound, Bruises, Swelling, Deformity, Shortening, Abnormal posture.
Feel:
Tenderness.
Feel the distal part to exclude nerve or vascular injury.
Move:
Crepitation.
Abnormal movement.
- Description of the fracture

1- closed or open.
2- Which bone is broken and where.
3- Anatomical location-joint
4- Articular involvement.
By x-ray describe fracture shape or configuration- simple or comminuted
5- Stability.
6- Any complications and secondary injury.
- X-ray

Remember the rule of twos:
Two views-AP/LAT
TWO JOINTS, esp in forearm and leg
TWO LIMB, in children for comparison
TWO INJURY, severe force often causes injury more than one level
TWO OCCASION, some Fx are notoriously difficult to detect soon after injury
- Read the x-ray :

1- Name of patient
2- when and where (date and place)
3- film projection
4- quality of x-ray
5- describe the bone ( anatomical site , bone cortex, medullary canal, bone density, if there break in the continuity of bone describe it - Don't say fracture -, if there articular loss - Don't say dislocation - )
6- your diagnosis ( fracture type and site in the bone / dislocation bilateral or unilateral anterior or posterior , anatomical position ).
- SPECIAL IMAGING:

TOMOGRAPHY.
COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY-CT
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING -MRI
RADIOISOTOPE SCANNING

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF FRACTURE MANAGEMENT}
- General Treatment of injured patients

First aid at the scene of accident
Transport to a hospital
Resuscitation : Airway, Breathing \& Circulation
- Specific treatment of fractures

1- Reduce
2- Immobilise
3- Rehabilitate
- REDUCE

Can be closed or open reduction.
Closed reduction or manipulation under anaesthesia for
1.Minimally displaced fractures.
2.Fractures in children.
3.Fractures that are stable after reduction.

Open reduction for
1.Failure of closed reduction.
2.Displaced intra articular fractures.

4.Traction fractures
- FRACTURE IMMOBILIZATION

1-CONTINUOUS TRACTION
2-CAST SPLINTAGE
3-FUNCTIONAL BRACING
4-INTERNAL FIXATION
5-EXETERNAL FIXATION

\section*{- 1.Continuous traction}
is applied to the limb distal to the fracture to exert continuous pull in the long axis of the bone.

\section*{TYPES;}
1. skin traction. 2.skeletal

\section*{SKIN TRACTION}
-Two adhesive strips are stuck on to either side of the leg \& weights are attatched to these strips by arope (for femoral shaft fractures in children). Indications :
1- for children
2- Temporary management of femur neck fracture or intertrochanteric fracture preoperatively.
3- Undisplaced fracture of acetabulum.
4- After reduction of dislocation of hip .
Contraindication :
Skin damaged or sepsis in the area.

\section*{Complications;}

1- Allergic reaction
2- Pressure sore
3- Excoriation of skin

\section*{SKELETAL TRACTION}
through a pin placed in the tibia for femoral shaft fractures in adults. This can be fixed or balanced by gravity-a hanging cast for displaced fractures of the humeral shaft.
complications :
1- Infection
2- Incorrect placement of pin
3- Stiffness of joint
- 2.Cast splintage

Can be plaster of Paris or synthetic casts.
A posterior slab is usually used initially followed by a complete plaster when the swelling subsides.
Adequate padding must be used over bony prominences.
The joint above and below the fractured bone must be immobilised.
The limb must be elevated \& circulation distally should be checked.

Complications are: tight cast, pressure sore, ulcerations, infections, rashes, itching, burns, and allergic contact dermatitis...

\section*{uses of plaster of paris :}
1- Fracture.
2-dislocations .
3- correcting deformities.

\section*{- 3. functional bracing}

Is one way of preventing joint stiffness
Applied only after 3-6 weeks of traction or conventional plaster
Using either pop or one of the ligher materials

\section*{- 4. Internal fixation}

- Compartment Syndrome : Increased interstitial pressure in compartment exceed capillary perfusion pressure which leads to muscle necrosis and eventually nerve necrosis.
- Intracompartmental pressure over $\mathbf{3 0 m m H g}$ usually requires intervention
- Causes :

1-Fracture-dislocation
2-Soft tissue damage and muscle swelling
3-Crush injury
4-Venous obstruction

5- Increased venous pressure
6-Constrictive cast or splint
- Usually it is present in the tibia and forearm

Flexor compartment → Volkmann’s ischemic contracture
When intracompartmental pressure rises to $10-30 \mathrm{mmHg}$ of pt's diastolic pressure, in adequate perfusion and ischemia results.
- C/F:
- Pain out of proportion to injury
- Pain with passive motion
- Paralysis, Parasthesia, Pallor, Poikilothermia, Pulselessness
- Treatment :

Remove constrictive dressings
Place the limb at the level of the heart
Emergency fasciotomy to release compartments if the intracompartmental pressure rises to $40-45 \mathrm{mmHg}$ within $4-6$ hours from onset of symptoms and signs.

\section*{Fractures \& Dislocations of the Upper Limb}
- Mechanism of Injuries of the Upper Limb:

Mostly Indirect
Commonly described as " a fall on outstretched hand "
Type of injury depends on position of the upper limb at the time of
impact: Flexed, Extended, adducted, abducted, pronated or supinated
- Fracture of the clavicle in Adults:

Common especially in children and elderly
Commonest site is the middle one third
Mainly due to indirect injury
Direct injury leads to comminuted fracture
- Treatment : Conservative by an arm sling or figure of eight bandage

Operative fixation is indicated if there is an open fracture, neurovascular injury or nonunion
- Dislocation of the Shoulder :

Mostly Anterior > $95 \%$ of dislocations
Posterior Dislocation occurs < 5 \%
True Inferior dislocation (luxatio erecta) occurs < 1\%

Habitual Non traumatic dislocation may present as Multi directional dislocation due to generalized ligamentous laxity and is Painless.
- Mechanism of anterior shoulder dislocation:

Usually Indirect fall on Abducted and extended shoulder
May be direct when there is a blow on the shoulder from behind
- Anterior Shoulder dislocation :

Usually also inferior
Bankart's Lesion : detachment of the anterioiferior glenoid labrum and damage to humral head .
- C/F :

1- Patient is in pain
Holds the injured limb with other hand close to the trunk
The shoulder is adducted and the elbow is kept flexed
There is loss of the normal contour of the shoulder
2-Loss of the contour of the shoulder may appear as a step
3- Anterior bulge of head of humerus may be visible or palpable
A gap can be palpated above the dislocated head of the humerus
- Associated injuries of anterior Shoulder Dislocation:

Injury to the neuro vascular bundle in axilla ( rare )
Injury of the Axillary or Circumflex Nerve ( Usually stretching leading to temporary neuropraxia )
Associated fracture
- Axillary Nerve Injury:

Also called circumflex nerve
It is a branch from posterior cord of Brachial plexus
It hooks close round neck of humerus from posterior to anterior
It pierces the deep surface of deltoid and supply it and the part of skin over it.
- Management of Anterior Shoulder Dislocation:

Is an Emergency
It should be reduced in less than 24 hours or there may be Avascular
Necrosis of head of humerus
Following reduction the shoulder should be immobilised strapped to the trunk for 3-4 weeks and rested in a collar and cuff.

\section*{Methods of Reduction of anterior shoulder Dislocation : \\ Hippocrates Method :}
(A form of anesthesia or pain abolishing is required)
Stimpson's technique:
( some sedation and analgesia are used but No anesthesia is required)
Kocher's technique:
is the method used in hospitals under general anesthesia and muscle relaxation
- Complications of anterior Shoulder Dislocation : Early:

Neuro vascular injury ( rare )
Axillary nerve injury
Associated Fracture of neck of humerus or greater or lesser tuberosities

\section*{Late :}

Avascular necrosis of the head of the Humerus (high risk with delayed reduction)
Heterotopic calcification ( used to be called Myositis Ossificans )
Recurrent dislocation
- Fractures of The Humerus:

Proximal Humerus (includes surgical and anatomical neck )
Shaft of Humerus
Distal humerus ( includes Supra Condylar fracture in children )
Fractures Shaft of the Humerus:
Commonly Indirect injury
Indirect injury results in Spiral or Oblique fractures
Direct injuries results in transverse or comminuted fracture
May be associated with Radial Nerve injury
- Radial Nerve Injury:

Results in Wrist drop
Associated with fracture humerus in up to $12 \%$ of fractures
2/3 ( 8\%) of Radial injury are Neuropraxia
$1 / 3$ ( $4 \%$ ) are nerve lacerations or transection
- Management of Radial Nerve Injury:

When present in open fractures ; immediate exploration and ± repair
In closed injuries treated conservatively ; initial management is doing Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography ( EMG ) and awaiting for spontaneous recovery.

Recovery usually starts after few days but may take up to 9 months for full recovery
If No spontaneous recovery occurs in 12 weeks confirmed by NCS and EMG ; then exploration of the nerve should be carried out
- Management of Fracture Shaft of the Humerus :

Most of the time is Conservative
Closed Reduction in upright position followed by application of U shaped Slab of POP or Cylinder cast
Few weeks later or initially in stable fractures Functional Brace may be used
- Indications for ORIF Fracture Shaft of Humerus:

1- Failure to reduce fracture conservatively
2- Bilateral humeral fractures
3- Open fracture with radial nerve Injury
4- Unconscious patient
5- Delayed-Union, Non-Union and Mal-Union
- Reduction of supra-condylar Fracture:

Absolute Emergency
Should be done under general anesthesia by experienced doctor as soon as possible
In the past the arm was held in flexed elbow position in back-slab POP after reduction
At present time Percutaneous K wire fixation is ALWAYS carried out after reduction
- Complications Supra-Condylar Fractures :

Early $\boldsymbol{=}$ Compartment syndrome
Brachial Artery injury ( Acute Volkmann's Ischemia )
Nerve Injury : Median, Ulnar or Radial
Late $=$ Stiffness
Volkmann's Ischemic contracture
Heterotopic Calcification
Mal-Union ( Cubitus Valgus or varus)
- malunion of supra-codylar fracture Most commonly results in Cubitus Varus Less common is Cubitus Valgus or Cubitus Recurvatum
Management is by Corrective Supra-Condylar Osteotomy.

\section*{Intra- Articular fractures of Elbow:}

Are sometimes difficult to diagnose exactly
-X ray of the other shoulder is helpful in diagnosis
-CT may be required in some cases
Non displaced intra- articular fractures can be managed by immobilisation in functional position till union
Displaced fractures require ORIF.

\section*{Displaced Fracture Head of Radius:}

Displaced fractures Head of Radius require ORIF if possible
When unable to reconstruct articular surface Anatomically we carry out excision of the Head.

\section*{Pulled elbow}

X rays may be read as normal or a wrong diagnosis of non displaced fracture is made . The serious mistake is to put elbow in POP cast whilst head of radius is not reduced

Urgent reduction without anaesthesia by pulling on the hand whilst supinating the elbow, doctor will feel a click and immediately pain stops and child is ready to move elbow.
Collar \& cuff may applied and parents are very appreciative to the treating doctor ,the child usually waves Good-bye whilst leaving .

\section*{MONTEGGIA FRACTURE-DISLOCATION :}

It is a fracture of the proximal $1 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of the Ulna with dislocation of head of radius anteriorly, Posterirly or laterally
Head of Radius dislocates same direction as fracture
It requires ORIF or it will redisplace

\section*{GALEAZZI FRACTURE-DISLOCATION :}

\section*{It is a fracture of distal Radius and dislocation of inferior Radio-Ulnar joint}

Like Montegia fracture if treated conservatively it will redisplace
This fracture appeared in acceptable position after reduction and POP but also will redisplaced.
It required ORIF

\section*{Fractures Around the Wrist:}

\section*{A . Extra-Articular :}

Greenstick fracture distal radius in children
Colle's fracture
Smith fracture

\section*{B. Intra-Articular :}

Barton's fracture= volar and dorsal
Comminuted Intra-articular fracture

\section*{Colles fracture}

Most common fracture in Osteoporotic bones
Extra-Articular : $\underline{1}$ inch of distal Radius
Results from a fall on dorsi flexed wrist
Typical deformity : Dinner Fork
Deformity is : Impaction, dorsal displacement and angulation, radial displacement and angulation and avulsion of ulnar styloid process
Management is usually conservative : Manipulation Under Anasthesia and forearm POP ( colles cast ) .

\section*{Smith fracture}

Almost the opposite of Colles' fracture
Much less common compared to colles'
Results from a fall on palmer flexed wrist
Typical deformity : Garden Spade
Management is conservative : MUA and Above Elbow POP

\section*{Volar Barton's Fracture Dislocation}

It is Intra-Articular with volar displacement which looks like smith fracture There is dorsal type which looks like Colles' fracture Management is by ORIF.

\section*{Scaphoid Bone Fractures :}

Most common fracture in the wrist joint and affect vascularity of it lead to vascular necrosis .
Treatment by compression Screw Fixation.

\section*{Fractures \& Dislocations of the Lower Limb}

\section*{Differential Diagnosis of Hip Pain in Adults;}

- displaced (Garden 3,4) - depends on patient
- older patient, poor health --> unipolar hemiarthroplasty
- younger patient with higher demand lifestyle -- bipolar hemiarthroplasty vs. total hip replacement vs. reduction and internal fixation
- younger patient with OA of hip -> total hip replacement

\section*{Complications}
- AVN
- non-union
*non union because of : callus and haematoma are not forming .
- Garden Classification:

\section*{1. Subcapital Fractures}
- fracture between femoral head and intertrochanteric line
main vascular supply to femoral head from distal arterial ring to proximal head through femoral neck
- fracture interrupts blood supply
- articular surface restricts blood supply to femoral head
- AVN risk depends on degree of displacement

\section*{2. Intertrochanteric Fracture}
extra-capsular fracture, therefore good femoral head viability
- fracture stability determined by amount of compromise to calcar femorale (medial cortex at neck/shaft junction)
greater and lesser trochanters may be separate fragments
- posterior fragment may be avascular, therefore possible delayed union

\section*{Classification}

□ 2 part - stable, trochanter intact
- 3 part - one trochanter separated, unstable if large calcar fragment
- 4 part - unstable, both trochanters separated

\section*{Treatment}
- ORFF (sliding hip screw) to preserve femoral head

\section*{3-Subtrochanteric fracture:}
- Fracture line 5 cm below the lesser trochanter.
- Highly unstable.
- Common in young.
- Treated by intramedullary nail (PFN).
- Fracture of the Femoral Shaft:
- High-energy it can bleed 2 litre due: to gunshot or falling from a height.

Low - energy spiral fracture in children.
High morbidity and mortality (Hemorrhage, fat embolism and ARDS).
* Blood replacement is essential.

There is soft tissue injury.
May be there is displacement .
Advantages of thomas splint.
In children high energy less commonly low energy.
In elderly due to pathological fracture May present with shock.
In children ( <10 yrs ) you can do hip spika cast .
Releife pain.
In child gallop fix
In Adult intra medullary nail good with weight bearing.
You can take off the plate after 6 month.

\section*{Treatment;}
$1-\mathrm{ABCs}$.
2- Analgesia.
3- Intramedullary nail.
4-Plate and screws.

\section*{Supracondylar fractures of the femur}

High injury common in adulty, associated with multiple trauma and knee ligamentous injury.
Poor prognosis, Usually comminuted
Treatment by: DCS or retrograde nailing DHS for femur neck .
* Evulsion force or extansion depend on age:

Elderly rapture a quadreceps tendon .
$\mathbf{4 0 ~ y r}$ fracture of patella.
$\mathbf{2 0 y r}$ they have avulsion of tibial tuberosity.
Children rapture of pateller tendon.
* Treat by: k wire and screw .
- Tibila fracture (mostly open)
avoid weight bearing Until 6 weaks then after 6 weak we should bear weight (Wolf bear)
Some times angulation can be accepted up to 7 Shortening 1 cm .
- Treatment :

ABC then ORIF ,
if open fracture manage it .
elastic nails above knee cast .
bony walking cast injury can be open or closed fracture.
- The knee :

Common knee symptoms;
Locking
Pseudo-locking, Instability - "giving out", Traumatic knee swelling,
Non-traumatic knee swelling.
History:
Ligamental injuries → high-energy force .
Meniscal injury: Moderate force in young person Mild force in older person.
Examination:
Look: alignment Feel: crepitus, effusion Move: gait, strength.
- Special tests of the knee:

Anterior and Posterior Draw tests - torn ACL and PCL.
Lachmann test - torn ACL .
Posterior Sag sign - torn PCL.
Pivot Shift sign - torn ACL
Collateral Ligament stress test - for collateral ligament .
Test for meniscal tear: Crouch compression + McMurray's test.
- X-Rays of the Knee:

AP standing, lateral.
Skyline view.
Obliques for intra-articular fractures .
3 foot standing view.
- Ligamentous Injuries to the knee:

Hemarthrosis and/or effusion in acute phase.
Decelaration or pivoting injury.
- 1.Anterior cruciate ligament tear:

Indirect varus blow to the knee, inability to continue activity.
Positive: Lachmann, pivot shift, anterior draw.
Treatment: according to activity and functional impairment.
Stable: early mobilization, physiotherapy .
Instability: (ACL) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
- 2.Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear

Less common.
Positive posterior sag sign, positive posterior draw, reverse pivot shift sign.
Treatment: non-operative vs. surgical PCL reconstruction.

\section*{- Conditions of the foot :}

Achilles Tendonitis : Chronic inflammation from running and shoe-wear.
May develop heel bumps.
Diagnosis: pain, crepitus on plantar flexion.
Treatment: rest, NSAIDs, proper footwear, do NOT inject steroids.
- Pathology :

The pathological picture depends on ;
1-the patients age
2-site of infection
3-the virulence of organism and the host resistance.
Stages are:
a\Inflammation
b \Necrosis
c\Reactive new bone formation
d \Resolution.
The inflammation start with vascular congestion → exudation of fluid and infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocyte → increase entra-osseus pressure → causing:
1- Pain 2-obstruction of blood flow 3-intravascular thrombosis.
- by the second or third day pus is formed within the bone and forces its way along the Valkmann's canals to the surface raising the perioteam
causing sub periosteal abscess with very severe pain. The pus spreads sub periosteally along the shaft to enter the bone at another level or burst in the surrounding soft tissue and push its way along the parts of least resistance to collect under the skin, later it may burst through the skin to open as a discharging sinus.
- In infants infection may spread through the physis to the epiphysis and hence to the joint.
- In older children the formed physis is a barrier to this intra articular spread, but in places where the metaphysis is intra capsular .
→ the pus may dicharge through the periosteum to the joint cavity. In adults pus is likely to spread with in the medullary canal. Vertebral infection may spread through the end plate and inter vertebral disc to vertebral body .
- Causes of bone death ( by compromising blood supply ):

1 - increase intra-osseus pressure. 2 -vascular stasis.
3-infective thrombosis. 4-periosteal stripping.
5- Bacterial toxins and leukocytic enzymes .
- 2\Post Traumatic osteomyelitis

It is osteomyelitis complicating open fractures predisposing factors are:
1- tissue injury
2- vascular damage.
3- oedema.
4- haematoma.
5- open pathway through skin wound.
staph aureus is the most common pathogen.
Clinical picture:
1-Fever. 2-pain. 3-swelling. 4-discharge from the fracture site.
Blood shows ; raised ESR and TWBC.
Prophylaxis:
1- Good cleaning of open fractures.
2- Wound is left open.
3- Use of antibiotics.

\section*{Treatment:}

1- Regular dressing.
2 - antibiotics.
3- removal of dead tissue.
4- use of external fixator to fix the fracture.

\section*{3\Chronic osteomyelitis}

It is chronic bone infection.

\section*{Causative organism:}
usually mixed infection.

\section*{Pathology:}

The bone is destroyed at : the focus of infection. cavities containing pus and dead oeices of bone sequestrum.
Surrounded areas of sclerotic bone.
Pus traces it is way to the skin sinus, which eventually close to open in a new site.

\section*{Factors of chronicity:}

1- The rigid walls of cavities does not close and prevent antibiotics to reach the bacteria.
2- The sequestrum or implant act as adherent surface for bacteria until it is removed.

\section*{Clinical picture:}

1- pain.
3- tenderness recurs on flare up.
5- pathological fracture.
5- pathological fracture.

\section*{Investigations:}

1- X-ray ( show patchy bone resorbtion, cavitation, sequestrum and sclerosis of the surrounding bone).
2- CT. 3-MRI give more informations.
4- ESR , TWBC is raised.
5- Culture from the discharge repeatedly to identify the organism and it is sensitivity to antibiotics.

\section*{Treatment:}

Antibiotic alone does not eradicate chronic osteomyelitis but it may help to prevent spread to healthy bone. to control acute flare ups.

\section*{Initial treatment :}

1-give NSAIDs .
2-splint.

\section*{Local treatment:}

1 - dressing of sinus.
2- Abscess need drainage.

\section*{Operative treatment:}
this method is limited only when sequestrum is present or if abscess or cavity is found ( chorticotomy, sequestroctomy ).
By:
1- Removal of dead tissues under antibiotic cover.
2- Deroofing of cavities and saucerisation of walls of sclerotic bone.
3- Intermittent irrigation with antibiotic using double lumen tube.
4- Use of genta mycin beads.
- Papineaua technique which is deroofing and succerisation then the cavity is obliterated by muscle flap.
Complication : malignant change .

2- pyrexia.
4- sinus discharge.

\section*{Tuberclosis of bone and joint :}

\section*{Pathology :}
once the bacilli gain foot hold, they elicit chronic granulomatous reaction characterized by: collection of epithelioid multinucleated giant cells, surrounding an area of central necrosis and caseation, in the prephery round cells mainly lymphocytes.
In joint : The synovium is thickened and fibrosed giving marked effusion ( TB artheritis ) .
In spine : poats disease , paraplegia , quadriplagia .
In bone : destructed with cavitation giving pathological fracture ,and cavitation may open into a joint increased vascularity lead to hyperaemia reflected as decreased bone density (osteoporosis).
If unchecked the process may proceed to cold abscess if the resistance is good it may overcome the inflammation and the lesion become dormant.
Later if the resistance decreased the inflammation may flare up again.
Also TB affect lung or gut ( primary ) or miliary TB ( secondary ) , TB of bone and joint ( tertiary ).

\section*{Clinical picture:}

1-History of contact with T.B patient

2 - signs of chronic illness.
4- low grade fever.
6-local pain. synovial thickening.

3-loss of weight.
5- night sweating.
7- swelling of one of the large joints with

In the spine pain may be mild until the patient present with cold abscess and muscle wasting.

\section*{Investigations:}

1-X-ray show soft tissue swelling , periarticular osteoporosis - washed out bone - in children the epiphysis may be enlarged.
2-ESR, TWBC is raised with relative lymphocytosis.
3-Mantaux test is positive.
4-Synovial Aspirate is yellow, straw coloured, cloudy with increased cells
5-Synovial biopsy is more reliable and shows the characteristics of granuloma.

6- MRI.

\section*{Differential diagnosis:}

1- Transient synovitis.
2- Mono-articular rheumatoid arthritis .
3- Haemorhagic arthritis .
4-Pyogenic arthritis.

\section*{Diagnostic Criteria:}

1- Long history.
2- Involve only one joint.
3- Marked synovial thickening.
4- Marked muscle wasting.
5-Peri-articular osteo-porosis.
6- Positive mantaux test.

\section*{PREPHERAL NERVE INJURY}
- Prepheral nerves are : bundles of axons conducting efferent motor impulses from AHC (anterior horn cells) of spinal cord to the muscles.
afferent sensory impulses from prepheral receptors via dorsal root ganglia to the spinal cord.
some nerves are mainly motor, some are mainly sensory some are mixed nerves.

Nerve structure and functions :
- Myelination : increase speed of conduction of impulses.
- Bundle of axons make fascicles which make the nerve .
- Epineurium : cover group of nerves.
- Perineurium : cover group of fascicles.
- Endoneurium : layer directly cover the axon.

- Nerves can be injured by:
1-ischaemia.
2-compression.
4-laceration.
5- burning.

3-traction.
- According to Sedon nerve lesion are classified into:

1-Neurepraxia (it is reversible loss of nerve function).
2-Axonotemesis more sever injury;( its interruption of some axons, but the neural tube is intact).
3-Neuro temesis ( is division of nerve trunk).
- Clinical picture:

After any trauma you should take history and examine the patient for prephral nerve injury ( motor, sensory, and observe for abnormal position/ dysfunction) .
- Management :

Conservative : if closed injuries that recover spontaneously .
Operative : (exploration) indicated if:
(a) the nerve was seen to be divided.
(b) if it is a cut wound or high energy injury.
(c) if recovery is in appropriately delayed.
primary repair is best if it can be done safely or delayed repair may be indicated .
-Technique of repair:
(a) direct suture
(b) nerve graft
(c) nerve transfer.

- the injury in the forearm or wrist:

There will be paralysis of the small muscles of the thumb so that the thenar eminence is wasted.

The patient is unable to abduct the thumb.

\section*{carpal tunnel syndrome :}
(The median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel) .
This results in:
1- wasting of the thenar eminence.
2- diminished sensation .
3- unpleasant pain (characteristically at night).
4- paraesthesia (numbness and tingling) in the thumb and radial two fingers and sometimes paraesthesia extending up into the arm.
- Examinatons:

1- froments test or good test for weakness of interosii ( ulnar nerve )
2- ok sign test for( median nerve) also can be for all nerves of upper limb .
3- thumb up test for (radial nerve) .

\section*{- Lower limb nerves :}

1- sciatic nerve :
This nerve injured due to :
1-Penetrating injuries .
2-torn in posterior dislocation of the hip associated with fracture of the posterior lip of the acetabulum (which the nerve is closely related).
-Injury is followed by paralysis of the hamstrings and all the muscles of the leg and foot.
-There is loss of all movement below the knee joint with foot drop deformity.
-Sensory loss is complete below the knee, except for an area extending along the medial side of the leg over the medial malleolus to the base of the hallux, which is innervated by the saphenous branch of the femoral nerve.

2- Common peroneal nerve :
- It injured by direct trauma or compression, such as the pressure of atight plaster cast, or in severe adduction injuries to the knee.
- Damage is followed by foot drop (due to paralysis of the ankle and foot extensors) and inversion of the foot (due to paralysis of the peroneal muscles with unopposed action of the foot flexors and invertors).
- There is loss of sensation over the anterior surface of the leg and foot.

\section*{CONGENITAL DEFORMITIES}

\section*{Remember varus and valgus conditions with joints it also congenital deformitiesm, e.g. congenital coxa vara, genu varum ...}

\section*{Developmental dysplasia of the hip}

DDH defines the spectrum of hip instability ranging from the hip that is in joint but has a shallow (dysplastic) acetabulum and may be 'pushed out' (Barlow positive) to the dislocated hip that is irreducible (Ortolani negative).
- Presentation according to age :
neonatal hips may be unstable.
toddler may limp.
adolescents may experience exercise-induced pain .
adult may have pain secondary to degenerative arthritis.
- Aetiology of DDH
- Gender: F > M
- Breech presentation.
- Birth order: common in firstborns and in the left hip
- Oligohydramnios.
- Family history.

Diagnosis :
1- History and clinical assessment (galeazzi, Barlow and ortolani test).
2- X-ray ( von rosens view ).
3- arthrogram
4- Ultrasound ( antenatally for patient at risk ).

\section*{Management :}
( When diagnosed early, conservative treatment is usually successful, but after walking age surgery is required) .
in NEONATES:
Do not need treatment , most stabilize within first weeks of life .
IF remain unstable or dislocated at test treatment with :
harnesses (that allow controlled movement) or splints ( that maintain hip reduction in the position of abduction and flexion) .
IF the hips fail to relocate or stabilise then non-operative treatment should be discontinued.

In INFANTS ( $>6$ months) :
IF fails conservative treatment, an examination under anaesthetic may result in a closed reduction, then do arthrogram if not show concentric reduction, it will indicate which structures are blocking reduction.
A closed reduction will need to be held reduced with a hip spica cast for several months.
IF the hip is irreducible or can only be held reduced in an extreme position with a small safe zone, then treatment must be abandoned and an open reduction considered via a medial or anterior approach.
In YOUNG CHILD :
- open reduction .
- pelvic osteotomy (may be required).

In Adolescent and young adult
These hips are often subluxed rather than truly dislocated.
On investigation, the hip may be reducible and the joint can be recreated with a combination of pelvic and femoral osteotomies.
For the irreducible hip, acetabular augmentation may reduce symptoms and delay the onset of degenerative change .

\section*{Congenital talipes equinovarus (the 'clubfoot')}

The clubfoot is deformed in three planes .
In true congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) the deformity is fixed.
Components : ( CAVE )
C - cavus : increase planter arch.
A- adduction of forefoot.
V-varus : invertion of fore-mid-hind foot.
E-equinovarus : planter fextion of ankle.
Treatment:
1- By Ponseti method: ( specific series of manoeuvres, followed by a series of wellmoulded above knee plaster casts ).
- The standard sequence is elevation of the first ray, gradual forefront abduction to $60^{\circ}$ and, finally, dorsiflexion, usually following Achilles tenotomy.
- Tibialis anterior transfer can be used to correct dynamic supination in older children
Advanteges : less stiff, less likely to be painful and less subject to overcorrection . 2- surgical intervention required when conservative treatment fails. (ideally before walking age).

\section*{Slip of the upper (capital) femoral Epiphysis (SUFE )}

The physis connects the proximal femoral epiphysis (the femoral head) to the metaphysis (femoral neck).
There is painful limitation of hip movement.
Hilton's law, which states that a joint is supplied by the same nerves as the muscles that move the joint, explains why many children present with knee pain although the pathology is in the hip.

\section*{Treatment :}
-AVN risk so reduce by prompt screw fixation into the centre of the epiphysis that stabilises the 'fracture'.
-Realignment osteotomy(require if patient present with deformity leading to restriction of joint movement after healing).

\section*{Legg-Calvé-Perthes' disease}
- AVN leads to femoral head collapse, healing occurs with the return of the blood supply

\section*{-Factors implicated in the pathogenesis of Perthes' disease}

1- Low birth weight
2- High birth order
3- Delayed bone age
4- Low socioeconomic status
-Causes of avascular necrosis of the femoral head

1- Steroids
2- Infection
3- Perthes' disease
4- Sickle cell disease
5- Hypothyroidism
6- Skeletal dysplasia - classically multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
Management aims to maintain femoral head sphericity
Treatment:
-non-surgical (to maximise range of movement) .
-surgical (for containment or 'salvage')
* The prognosis is better in younger children who have more remodelling potential.
