\section*{Preoperative care including the high-risk surgical patient}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To be able to organise the preoperative care and the operating list
To understand preoperative preparation for surgery:
- Surgical, medical and anaesthetic aspects of assessment
- How to optimise the patient's condition
- How to identify and optimise the patient at higher risk
- Importance of critical care in management
- How to take consent
- How to organise an operating list

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

The stress of major surgery can lead to increased oxygen demand by about $40 \%$. Changes such as cytokine release-related inflammatory changes, endocrine responses, hypercoagulability and redistribution of fluid between compartments may last several postoperative days. The purpose of careful preoperative planning is to minimise the unwanted effects of these physiological changes.

Systematic history taking, examination and ordering of investigations at the preoperative clinic should include not only an assessment of functional reserve but also the formulation of advice on optimisation, to best cope with the anticipated operative stress. General practitioner (GP) records and hospital notes are useful sources of baseline information. GPs can help by monitoring chronic conditions, adjusting medications, and facilitating in weight reduction, exercise and the cessation of smoking.

A simple questionnaire, working within agreed guidelines, can identify high-risk patients undergoing high-risk surgery needing specific tests and optimisation (see later). Patients with severe comorbidities or undergoing high-risk surgery should be referred to specialists to quantify and to reduce perioperative risks. Risks of surgery, anaesthesia and the effects of comorbid conditions should be discussed so that the patient can make an informed decision. Patients should be given advice on 'nil by mouth' (NBM) and regular medication and premedication at the preoperative visit.

A plan for the operating list should be drawn-up and all those involved in making the list run smoothly should be informed. The World Health Organization (WHO) checklist, which is started just prior to induction of anaesthesia and continued during and after the surgery, aims to improve the safety of anaesthesia and surgery.

\section*{Summary box 17.1}

\section*{Preoperative plan for the best patient outcomes}
- Gather and record all relevant information
- Optimise patient condition
- Choose surgery that offers minimal risk and maximum benefit
- Anticipate and plan for adverse events
- Adequate hydration, nutrition and exercise are advised

\section*{PATIENT ASSESSMENT}

Evidence suggests that correction of anaemia, better diabetes control, preoperative exercises and better nutrition leads to better patient outcomes and fewer postoperative complications. Based on population statistics, associated comorbidities and the type of surgery, one can estimate risks for an individual undergoing surgery and various tools and scores (see later) can be used as risk predictors.

\section*{History taking}

Each organ system problem should be noted with dates, aetiology and treatment delivered (Table 17.1). Screening questions will reveal 'fitness' for surgery and anaesthesia. Patients with recent chest infections should be assessed for anaesthetic risks and postoperative surgical infection. Increasing severity of symptoms generally indicates worsening of the condition and possible need for a change in medication. Inability to achieve four metabolic equivalents, e.g. climbing a flight of stairs, increases cardiac risk after major surgery. Some factors leading to these findings may be amenable to treatment preoperatively such as anaemia, angina, palpitations or obesity.

\section*{Examination specific to surgery}

At preoperative assessment, the clinical findings, site, side, specific imaging or investigation findings related to the pathology for which the surgery is proposed should be noted. Suitability of the patient for the proposed surgical option and vice versa should also be assessed. For example, laparoscopic procedures are less invasive and are therefore preferred in most; however, not all patients can tolerate pneumoperitoneum and positioning.

The type of surgery along with patient comorbidities determine perioperative risks, for example perioperative mortality in major surgery such as that of open aortic aneurysm repair in the UK is $3 \%$ and that with endovascular repair is $1 \%$.

Sources of potential bacteraemia can compromise surgical results especially if artificial material is implanted, such as in joint replacement surgery or arterial grafting. Check for and treat infections in the preoperative period, e.g. infected toes, pressure sores, teeth and urine; screen the patients for methi-cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonisation.

\section*{Investigations}

The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, UK (NICE) guidelines lay out the investigations needed for various categories of surgery.

\section*{Summary box 17.4}

\section*{Investigations needed}
- Type of surgery. Major surgery can lead to organ system dysfunction needing most investigations
- Patient. For example, sickle cell test for patients of AfroCaribbean origin with family history of sickle cell disease
- Comorbidities. For example, peak flow rates for severe asthmatics
- Full blood count. A full blood count (FBC) is needed for major operations, in the elderly and in those with anaemia or pathology with ongoing blood loss and chronic disease. In case of suspicion or history of sickle crisis, a sickle cell test is needed in patients of Afro-Caribbean and Indian subcontinent origin.
- Urea and electrolytes. Urea and electrolytes (U\&Es) are needed before all major operations, in most patients over 65 years of age especially with cardiovascular, renal and endocrine disease, or if significant blood loss is anticipated. It is also needed in those on medications that affect electrolyte levels, e.g. steroids, diuretics, digoxin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous fluid or nutrition therapy and endocrine problems.
- Electrocardiography. Electrocardiography (ECG) is required for those patients over 65 years of age and symptomatic patients with a history of rheumatic fever, diabetes, cardiovascular, renal and cerebrovascular disease, with and without severe respiratory problems. It will also depend on if the surgery is minor/intermediate or major.
- Chest radiograph. Cost-effectiveness and risks of radiation
exposure mean that chest radiographs should be restricted to specific patients, such as those with cardiac failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory symptoms, pulmonary cancer, metastasis or effusions or those who are deemed to be at risk of active pulmonary tuberculosis.
- Clotting screen. If a patient has a history suggestive of a bleeding diathesis, liver disease, eclampsia, cholestasis or has a family history of bleeding disorder, or is on antithrombotic or anticoagulant agents then coagulation screening will be needed. However, the effects of antiplatelet agents, low molecular weight heparins and newer agents affecting factor Xa cannot be measured by routine laboratory tests.
- Urinalysis. Dipstick testing of urine should be performed on all patients to detect urinary infection, biliuria, glycosuria and inappropriate osmolality.
- $\beta$-Human chorionic gonadotrophin. Women of child-bearing age should be asked sensitively about their pregnancy status. If in doubt a laboratory test or a reliable pregnancy kit (low cost) can be used, after obtaining consent from the patient, to avoid danger of exposure to surgery and anaesthesia on the foetus.
- Blood glucose and HbA1c. Poor control of diabetes can lead to perioperative infection and slow recovery in patients with diabetes mellitus and endocrine problems. HbA 1 C indicates how well diabetes has been controlled over a longer duration. Early mobilisation, oral intake and return to routine medication should be the goals in management of diabetes.
- Arterial blood gases. A low-cost tool that can give quick and vital information in acute or chronic severe respiratory conditions, acid-base disturbances and conditions where there is changing milieu, e.g. immediately before kidney transplant.
- Liver function tests. These are indicated in patients with jaundice, known or suspected hepatitis, cirrhosis, malignancy or in patients with poor nutritional status.
- Other investigations. Specialist radiological views and recent imaging are sometimes required. If imaging is going to be needed during surgery, then this needs to be planned in advance.

\section*{SPECIFIC PREOPERATIVE PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT}

Specific medical problems encountered during preoperative assessment should be corrected to the best possible level. Many patients with severe disease (see later) will need to be referred to specialists; the referral letter should include all the details including history, examination and investigation results.

\section*{Cardiovascular disease}

Perioperative cardiovascular complications are frequent. Patients who can climb a flight of stairs without getting short of breath or chest pain or needing to stop are likely to

\section*{Summary box 17.5}

\section*{Preoperative management of patients with systemic disease}
- Capacity. Baseline organ function capacity should be assessed
- Optimisation. Medication, lifestyle changes, specialist referral will improve organ capacity
- Alternative. Minimally impacting procedure, appropriate postoperative care will improve outcomes
- Theatre preparations. Timing, teamwork, special instruments and equipment
tolerate a wide range of surgeries with an acceptable risk of perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, at preoperative assessment it is important to identify the patients who have a high perioperative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including myocardial infarction (MI), and make appropriate arrangements to reduce this risk. Patients at high risk are those with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), congestive cardiac failure (CCF), arrhythmias, severe peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or significant renal impairment, especially if they are undergoing major intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic surgery.

In patients with ischaemic heart disease the cardiac and coronary reserve can be evaluated using a stress test (stress ECG, stress echocardiogram, myocardial scintigraphy). The tests have a high negative predictive value but a relatively low positive predictive value. If the test is negative, the patient is unlikely to have IHD; conversely, if it is positive the chances of the patient actually having IHD is not necessarily very high, but there is a need for further investigation such as coronary angiography. Recently, measurement of the fractional coronary flow reserve (FFR) during coronary angiography using a pressure wire, has made it possible to identify coronary lesions that have the largest impact on myocardial perfusion.

In patients with any suggestion of valvular heart disease or poor left ventricular function, an echocardiogram should be obtained. Pressure gradients across the valves, dimensions of the chambers and contractility can be determined using echocardiography; an ejection fraction of less than $30 \%$ is associated with poor patient outcomes.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides a non-invasive assessment of combined pulmonary, cardiac and circulatory function.

The patient should be referred to a cardiologist if:
- A murmur is heard and the patient is symptomatic.
- The patient is known to have poor left ventricular function or cardiomegaly.
- Ischaemic changes can be seen on ECG even if the patient is not symptomatic (silent ischaemia, silent MIs are frequent).
- There is an abnormal rhythm on the ECG, for example tachy-/bradycardia or heart block.

\section*{Hypertension, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and coronary stents}

Prior to elective surgery blood pressure should be controlled to near $160 / 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$. If a new antihypertensive agent is introduced, a stabilisation period of at least 2 weeks should be allowed.

Patients with angina, that is not well controlled, should be investigated further by a cardiologist. The indications for coronary revascularisation in these patients before major surgery are the same as the medical indications. Pharmacological protection is indicated. Patients on $\beta$-blockers and on statins should be maintained on their medication. Initiating statins preoperatively should be considered. Most long-term cardiac medications should be continued over the perioperative period. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and receptor blockers are often omitted 24 hours prior to surgery and reintroduced gradually in the postoperative period.

After a proven myocardial infarction (Figure 17.1), elective surgery should be postponed for $3-6$ months to reduce the risk of perioperative reinfarction. As primary percutaneous intervention is the treatment of choice for acute coronary syndromes, many patients receive stents and are on dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months. If surgery is absolutely necessary within the period of dual antiplatelet therapy, the management strategy should be decided jointly by surgeon, cardiologist, anaesthetist and patient, as it is essential to consider the balance of risk of continuing antiplatelet agents (with the risk of increased bleeding) and stopping them (with the risk of stent thrombosis).

The risk of stent thrombosis with consequences of MI and death is reduced if elective surgery is delayed until after dual antiplatelet therapy is no longer needed (about 6 weeks after bare metal and 12 months after drug-eluting stent insertion, although with the newest drug-eluting stents 6 months dual antiplatelet therapy may be enough).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 17.1 Preoperative electrocardiogram of a patient who complained of chest pain the previous day, showing recent transmural rior myocardial infarction with Q waves and ST elevation.}
\end{figure}

If surgery cannot be postponed and the risk of significant perioperative bleeding is low, dual antiplatelet therapy can be continued during surgery. If the benefits of surgery can be negated by bleeding in closed cavities (spinal, intracranial, cardiac, posterior chamber of the eye and prostate surgery) clopidogrel or ticagrelor therapy may have to be stopped and, if possible, aspirin continued. However, a cardiology opinion should be sought.

\section*{Dysrhythmias}

In patients with atrial fibrillation, $\beta$-blockers, digoxin or calcium channel blockers should be started preoperatively (or continued if the patient is already on such medication) in order to control rate and possibly rhythm. Cardiac output can increase by $15 \%$ if sinus rhythm is restored. Warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) should be stopped 5 days preoperatively to achieve an international normalised ratio (INR) of 1.5 or less, which is safe for most surgery. The newer anticoagulants such as dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor) or rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban (direct factor Xa inhibitors) do not have antagonists and must be stopped preoperatively, generally for 2-3 days in patients with normal renal function and longer when renal function is impaired. Alternative anticoagulation is not required in the perioperative period unless the risk of stroke is high (high CHA2DS2VACs score). Bridging therapy with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended for patients with AF and a mechanical heart valve undergoing procedures that require interruption of warfarin. Decisions on bridging therapy should balance the risks of stroke and bleeding.

\section*{Implanted pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators}

Checks and appropriate reprogramming should be done preoperatively by specialists. Monopolar diathermy activity during surgery may be sensed by the pacemaker as ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, cardioversion and overpace modes must be turned off (and switched on after surgery) or converted to 'ventricle paced, not sensed with no response to sensing' (VOO) mode. Bipolar diathermy should be made available at surgery.

Symptomatic heart blocks and asymptomatic second(Mobitz II) and third-degree heart blocks, if discovered at preoperative assessment clinic, will need cardiology consultation and temporary or permanent pacemaker insertion.

Figures 17.2 and 17.3 illustrate ECGs from two cases requiring preoperative optimisation.

\section*{Valvular heart disease}

While anaesthetic management is altered to achieve haemodynamic stability in moderate valvular diseases, the patients with severe aortic and mitral stenosis may benefit from valvuloplasty before elective non-cardiac surgery. Appropriate referral to anaesthetist and cardiologist should be made.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 17.3 Atrial flutter.}
\end{figure}

In patients with mechanical heart valves, warfarin needs to be stopped for 5 days before surgery, and an infusion of unfractionated heparin started when the INR falls below 1.5. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), should be monitored to keep it at 1.5 times normal and the infusion is then stopped 2 hours before surgery. Heparin and warfarin should be started in the postoperative period, and heparin is stopped when the full effect of warfarin takes effect. Thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors are not licensed and should not be used in patients with mechanical valves.

\section*{Anaemia and blood transfusion}

Patients found to be anaemic at preoperative assessment should be investigated for the cause of their anaemia. They should be treated with iron and vitamin supplements. Chronic anaemia is well tolerated in the perioperative period; however, if the patient is undergoing a major procedure preoperative transfusion may be considered. If excessive bleeding is expected, then a preoperative 'group and save' should be performed and an appropriate number of units of blood crossmatched.

Some patients may refuse blood transfusion, for example a Jehovah's witness. In such a case, during the consent process (see later) discussion should include which blood product and/or device system (e.g. cell salvage, reinfusion from drains) is acceptable. The discussion should extend to other areas, for example whether refusal of transfusion would apply in life-threatening situations. As in all consent processes, the discussion and outcome should be clearly documented (see Further reading; RCS 2016).

\section*{Respiratory disease}

Postoperative respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially after major abdominal and thoracic surgery. A patient's current respiratory status should be compared with their 'normal state'. Make a note of the severity of the asthma and COPD, such as past hospital admissions for treatment of the condition, records of pulmonary function tests, use of oral steroids, home oxygen, non-invasive ventilation support and evidence of right heart failure.

A preoperative chest radiograph or scan is useful in a patient with known emphysematous bullae, pulmonary cancer, metastasis or effusions.

Patients on oral steroid treatment, oxygen therapy or who have a forced expiratory volume in the first second ( $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ ) less than $30 \%$ of predicted value (for age, weight and height), or $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ level of greater than 6 kPa , have severe disease and are at risk of pneumonia and respiratory failure in the postoperative period.

Patients should continue to use their regular inhalers until the start of anaesthesia. Brittle asthmatics may also need extra steroid cover. Encourage the patients to be compliant with the medications, take a balanced diet and stop smoking. Information should be provided to indicate perioperative risks associated with smoking. Stopping smoking reduces carbon monoxide levels and offers the patient a better ability to clear sputum. Evidence suggests that preoperative inspiratory muscle training significantly improves respiratory (muscle) function in the early postoperative period, reducing the risk of pulmonary complications.

Regional anaesthetic techniques and less invasive surgical options should be considered in severe cases. Elective surgery should be postponed until acute exacerbations are treated.

The patient should be referred to a respiratory physician if:
- There is a severe disease or significant deterioration.
- Major surgery is planned in a patient with significant respiratory comorbidities.
- Right heart failure is present - dyspnoea, fatigue, tricuspid regurgitation, hepatomegaly and oedematous feet.
- The patient is young and has severe respiratory problems (indicates a rare condition).

\section*{Gastrointestinal disease}

\section*{Nil by mouth and regular medications}

Patients are advised not to take solids within 6 hours and clear fluids (isotonic drinks and water) within 2 hours before anaesthesia to avoid the risk of acid aspiration syndrome. These restrictions are further reduced in infants, as keeping hydrated reduces discomfort and is known to improve postoperative outcomes.

If the surgery is delayed, oral intake of clear fluids should be allowed until 2 hours before surgery or intravenous fluids should be started, especially in vulnerable groups of patients, e.g. children, the elderly and diabetics.

Patients can continue to take their specified routine medications with sips of water in the NBM period.

\section*{Regurgitation risk}

Patients with hiatus hernia, obesity, pregnancy and diabetes are at high risk of pulmonary aspiration, even if they have been NBM before elective surgery. Clear antacids, H 2 -receptor blockers, e.g. ranitidine, or proton pump inhibitors, e.g. omeprazole, may be given at an appropriate time in the preoperative period.

\section*{Liver disease}

In patients with liver disease, the cause of the disease needs to be known, as well as any evidence of clotting problems, renal involvement and encephalopathy. Elective surgery should be postponed until any acute episode has settled (e.g. cholangitis). The blood tests that need to be performed include liver function tests, coagulation, blood glucose and U\&Es. The presence of ascites, oesophageal varices, hypoalbuminaemia and sodium and water retention should be noted, as all can influence the choice and outcome of anaesthesia and surgery.

\section*{Genitourinary disease}

\section*{Renal disease}

Underlying conditions leading to chronic renal failure such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, should be stabilised before elective surgery. Appropriate measures should be taken to treat acidosis, hypocalcaemia and hyperkalaemia of greater than $6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. Arrangements should be made to continue peritoneal or haemodialysis until a few hours before surgery. After the final dialysis before surgery, a blood sample should be sent for FBC and U\&Es.

Chronic renal failure patients often suffer chronic microcytic anaemia that is well tolerated; therefore, preoperative blood transfusion is often not necessary.

Acute kidney injury can present with an acute surgical problem, for example bowel obstruction needing emergency surgery. In these patients, medical treatment should be started at the earliest opportunity and carried on through surgery and through into the critical care unit.

\section*{Urinary tract infection}

Uncomplicated urinary infections are common in women, while outflow uropathy with chronically infected urine is common in men. These infections should be treated before embarking on elective surgery where infection carries dire consequences, e.g. joint replacement. For emergency procedures, antibiotics should be started and care taken to ensure that the patient maintains a good urine output before, during and after surgery.

\section*{Endocrine and metabolic disorders}

\section*{Malnutrition}

Body mass index (BMI) is weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared. A BMI of less than 18.5 indicates nutritional impairment and a BMI below 15 is associated with significant hospital mortality. Nutritional support for a minimum of 2 weeks before surgery is required to have any impact on subsequent morbidity.

If a patient is unlikely to be able to eat for a significant period, arrangements should be made by the preoperative assessment team to start nutritional support in the immediate postoperative phase.

\section*{Obesity}

Morbid obesity can be defined as BMI of more than 35 (other definitions exist) and is associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. Patients should be made aware of risks involved and advised on healthy eating and taking regular exercise.

Associated sleep apnoea can be predicted by using a clinical scoring system, the perioperative sleep apnoea prediction (P-SAP) score or sleep apnoea studies. There is evidence to suggest that patient outcomes improve with more than 6 weeks of use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device preoperatively, and cholesterol reducing agents in the perioperative phase.

If possible surgery should be delayed until the patient is more active and has lost weight. If this fails, prophylactic measures need to be taken (such as preventative measures for acid aspiration and DVT) and associated risks need to be explained prior to the surgery.

\section*{Diabetes mellitus}

Diabetes and associated cardiovascular and renal complications should be controlled to as near normal level as possible before embarking on elective surgery. Any history of hyper- and hypoglycaemic episodes, and hospital admissions, should be noted. HbA1c levels should be checked. For elective surgery, HBA1c of $<69 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{mol}$ is recommended. Lipid-lowering medication should be started in patients who are in a highrisk group for cardiovascular complications of diabetes.

Patients with diabetes should be first on the operating list and, if the operation is in the morning, advised to omit the morning dose of medication and breakfast. Though tight control of blood sugar is not needed, the patient's blood sugar
levels should be checked 2 hourly. For those on the afternoon list, breakfast can be given with half their regular dose of intermediate-acting insulin (or full dose oral antidiabetic agents) and then managed with regular blood sugar checks as above. An intravenous insulin sliding scale should be started for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients undergoing major surgery, or if blood sugar is difficult to control for other reasons.

\section*{Adrenocortical suppression}

Patients receiving oral adrenocortical steroids should be asked about the dose and duration of the medication in view of supplementation with extra doses of steroids perioperatively, to avoid an Addisonian crisis.

\section*{Coagulation disorders}

\section*{Thrombophilia}

Patients with a strong family history or previous personal history of thrombosis should be identified (Table 17.3). They will need thromboprophylaxis in the perioperative period.

The progesterone-only contraceptive pill should be continued; however, the risks of continuing the combined pill (slight increase risk of significant thrombosis) should be weighed against the risks of an unplanned pregnancy. Consider stopping oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before surgery (NICE guidance; see Further reading). The reader is advised to use an appropriate resource for precise formulation information and current guidance.

Patients with a low risk of thromboembolism can be given thromboembolism-deterrent stockings to wear during the perioperative period. High-risk patients with a history of recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and arterial thrombosis will be on warfarin. This should be stopped before surgery and replaced by low molecular weight heparin or factor Xa inhibitors. Local or national guidelines advise what type of DVT prophylaxis should be used for each type of surgery.

\section*{Neurological and psychiatric disorders}

In patients with a history of stroke, pre-existing neurological deficit should be recorded. These patients may be on anti-

\section*{TABLE 17.3 Risk factors for thrombosis.}
- Age $>60$ years
- Obesity BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$
- Trauma or surgery (especially of the abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs), anaesthesia >90 minutes
- Reduced mobility for more than 3 days
- Pregnancy/puerperium
- Varicose veins with phlebitis
- Drugs, e.g. oestrogen contraceptive, HRT, smoking
- Known active cancer or on treatment, significant medical comorbidities, critical care admission
- Family/personal history of thrombosis, e.g. deficiencies in antithrombin III, protein S and C

\footnotetext{
Thomas Addison, 1795-1860, physician, Guy's Hospital, London, UK, described the effects of disease of the suprarenal capsules in 1849.
}
platelet agents or anticoagulants. If it is felt that the neurological and cardiovascular thrombotic risks are low, antiplatelet agents should be withdrawn ( 7 days for aspirin, 10 days for clopidogrel). If the thrombotic risks are perceived to be high and the patient is undergoing surgery with a high risk of bleeding, aspirin alone should be continued.

Anticonvulsants and anti-Parkinson medication is continued perioperatively to help early mobilisation of the patient.

Lithium should be stopped 24 hours prior to surgery; blood levels should be measured to exclude toxicity. The anaesthetist should be informed if patients are on psychiatric medications such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as these may interact with anaesthetic drugs.

\section*{Musculoskeletal disorders}

Rheumatoid arthritis can lead to an unstable cervical spine with the possibility of spinal cord injury during intubation. Therefore, flexion and extension lateral cervical spine radiographs should be obtained in symptomatic patients (Figures 17.4 and 17.5).

Assessment of the severity of renal, cardiac valvular and pericardial involvement as well as restrictive lung disease, should be carried out. Rheumatologists will advise on steroids and disease-modifying drugs so as to balance immunosuppression (chance of infections) against the need to stabilise the disease perioperatively (stopping disease modifying drugs can lead to flare-up of the disease).

In ankylosing spondylitis patients, in addition to the problems discussed above, techniques of spinal or epidural anaesthesia are often challenging. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus may exhibit a hypercoagulable state along with airway difficulties.

With certain types of orthopaedic operations, such as joint replacement, antibiotic prophylaxis will be required, and will usually follow specific local or national guidelines.

\section*{Airway assessment}

The ability to intubate the trachea and oxygenate the patient are basic and crucial skills of the anaesthetist. The ease or difficulty encountered when performing airway manoeuvres can be predicted by simple examination findings of full mouth opening (modified Mallampati class), jaw protrusion, neck movement and thyromental distance. The anaesthetist should look for loose teeth, obvious tumours, scars, infections, obesity, thickness of the neck, etc., which will indicate difficulty in visualising the airway. When more than one of the above tests are positive, the chances of experiencing difficulty in obtaining and securing the airway become greater. To obtain the modified Mallampati class, the anaesthetist sits in front of the patient who is asked to open their mouth and protrude the tongue (Figure 17.6). The higher the grade, the higher the risk in obtaining and securing an airway (Table 17.4).

\section*{Preoperative assessment in emergency surgery}

In urgent or emergency surgery the principles of preoperative assessment should be the same as in elective surgery, except that the opportunity to optimise the condition is limited by time constraints. Medical assessment and treatments should be started (e.g. as per Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines) even if there is no time to complete them before the start of the surgical procedure. Some risks may be reduced but some may persist and, whenever possible, these need to be explained to the patient.

\section*{ASSESSMENT OF THE HIGHRISK PATIENT}

Despite higher-risk patients presenting for surgery, the perioperative mortality has decreased significantly over the last half a century, especially in resource-rich countries. In a published systematic review in The Lancet (Bainbridge et al., 2012), perioperative mortality has declined from 10603 per million ( $95 \%$ CI: 10 423-10784) in the 1970s to 1176 per million (1148-1205) in the 1990s-2000s ( $\mathrm{p}<0.0001$ ). However, there remains a subgroup of patients who are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery. By identifying high-risk patients in the preoperative phase and planning their perioperative management, morbidity and mortality can be reduced.

Patients who have a predicted mortality $\geq 5 \%$ should be considered as 'high risk'. It is estimated that although the high-risk group accounts for less than $15 \%$ of all surgical procedures, they contribute to more than $80 \%$ of all perioperative deaths in UK.

What causes these patients to be at a high risk of death and complications after surgery? After surgery tissue destruction, blood loss, fluid shifts, changes in temperature, pain and
anxiety result in increased demands for oxygen delivery to the tissues. This demand increases from an average of $110 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ at rest to $170 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ in the postoperative period. Most patients meet this increase in demand by increasing their cardiac output and tissue oxygen extraction. Patients who are unable to meet these demands, as a result of a limited cardiorespiratory reserve, are at a risk of oxygen debt.

Occult hypovolemia resulting from fluid shift or blood loss can further impair oxygen delivery. Splanchnic vasoconstriction to compensate for this may result in gut ischaemia. Those with coronary or cerebrovascular disease are also at a higher risk of myocardial ischaemia or stroke.

\section*{Factors contributing to risk}

Risk is a complex interaction of multiple factors that can be classified into patient and surgical factors. Patient factors are listed in Table 17.5. The elderly, though not independently at higher risk, not only suffer more cardiac, pulmonary and renal disease but also require surgery four times as often as the rest of the population. Around $10 \%$ of the population over 65 have frailty with increasing incidence with age. Frailty is a distinctive state that is related to ageing. Multiple body systems lose their in-built reserves in the elderly.

The type of surgery contributes independently and is listed in Table 17.6. This risk increases if the surgery is performed as an emergency. Often, the underlying condition necessitating surgery itself may be associated with an increased risk of complications. For example, a patient with severe peripheral vascular disease resulting from heavy smoking, may need a femoral-popliteal bypass graft and can be expected also to have significant COPD and IHD.

Moreover, when mortality by type of surgery is adjusted for patient risk factors, the apparent hierarchy of surgical risk may change. The average mortality risk for an individual patient undergoing thoracic surgery, for example, is likely to be higher than the average risk for that same patient undergoing vascular surgery. Complications associated with the latter are nevertheless more frequent because vascular patients have greater medical risk factors (Table 17.7).

In summary, the typical high-risk patient is the elderly patient with coexisting conditions such as IHD and/or COPD undergoing major surgery. The risk will increase if the surgery is performed as an emergency.

\section*{Management of risk}

The key to managing patients effectively is the identification and accurate quantification of the risk, and subsequent measures taken to minimise it.

Realistic estimates of risk are the cornerstone of informed patient consent and shared decision making. The patient and the surgeon may choose a less extensive or even a nonsurgical option where risks of the definitive procedure are deemed to be too high or unacceptable. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) of England has recommended that the patients who are predicted to have greater than $5 \%$ mortality risk should have active consultant input in all stages of their management.

Surgical procedures in those with predicted mortality of $>10 \%$ should be conducted under the direct supervision of consultant surgeon or anaesthetist, unless the consultants are satisfied with the seniority and competence of the staff managing these patients. Moreover, those with a mortality $>10 \%$ should be managed in the critical care facility.

Depending on particular comorbidities, it may be possible for a patient's underlying conditions to be improved by optimising their medical therapy. Additional physiological

This document is available on
optimisation may take the form of measures to minimise myocardial ischaemia or measures to improve oxygen delivery to the other major organs, depending on the prevailing risks.

Optimisation before surgery can be more effective in a critical care environment and patients may need to be admitted to a high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive therapy unit (ITU) preoperatively. The likelihood of the high-risk patient requiring postoperative critical care should be planned preoperatively and discussed with the duty critical care physician.

The identification of patients who will benefit the most from these interventions is important, not only for the improvement of outcomes but also the effective allocation of resources. As discussed above, emergency surgery is associated with higher risks because by its very nature there is less time and opportunity to organise these additional levels of care.

- Assess the level of risk
- Detailed preoperative assessment
- Adequate resusciatation

- Investigation to define the underlying surgical problem

\section*{Identification of the high-risk patient}

A number of scoring systems have been developed over the years with the aim of identifying high-risk patients (Table 17.8).

\section*{American Society of Anaesthesiologists system}

The American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) scoring system is widely used. Although not designed to be used as a risk prediction score, it has a quantitative association with the predicted percentage of postoperative mortality (Table 17.9). However, it does not account for age or nature of surgery and the term 'systemic disease' in ASA grading introduces an element of 'subjectivity'.

\section*{Metabolic equivalent}

As discussed earlier, overall functional physical fitness can be judged by the ability to tolerate metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) (Table 17.10). One MET is equivalent to the oxygen consumption of an adult at rest ( $\sim 3.5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ ). Different tasks are assigned a number of METs. If the patient is able to perform $>4$ METs (e.g. climbing at least one flight of stairs) they are considered suitable candidates for major surgery. However, once again this depends on a subjective assessment of the ability of a patient and may be overestimated by them.

Objective indices based on weighted scores pertaining to surgery and comorbidity, have been created to stratify cardiac . Examples include the Goldman cardiac risk index and

\section*{POSSUM score}

The POSSUM score (Physiologic and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity) and its modifications (P-POSSUM, CR-POSSUM) are used to predict all-cause mortality in postoperative critical care patients as well as non-cardiac morbidity.

\end{table}

\section*{ACS NSQIP score}

The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Programme (NSQIP) surgical risk score estimates the chance of a complication or death after surgery for more than a thousand different surgical procedures. It compares the patient's risk with an average person's risk. It is a web based tool done preoperatively. The risk is calculated based on surgical procedure and 19 patient-specific preoperative risk factors.

\section*{Cardiopulmonary exercise testing}

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can be used as a screening tool to identify high-risk patients. The oxygen ( $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) consumption and carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) production of the patient are measured while they undergo a 10 minute period of incrementally demanding exercise (usually on a cycle ergometer) up to their maximally tolerated level (Figure 17.7).

CPET is based on the principle that when a subject's delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to active tissues becomes inadequate, anaerobic metabolism begins; lactate is buffered by bicarbonate and the resulting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases out of proportion to the escalation in physical difficulty and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. The 'anaerobic threshold' (AT) is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ above

\end{figure}
which this occurs. Peak oxygen consumption ( $\mathrm{VO}_{2}$ ) is also measured. They are the end product of a subject's combined respiratory, cardiac, vascular and musculoskeletal fitness, and subjects with either an AT above a somewhat arbitrary cutoff of 11 and a $\mathrm{VO}_{2}$ below $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality after surgery.

When CPET is not available, a simple walk test, such as the 6 -minute walk test (6MWT) and the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), can be used to assess the functional capacity of the patient. They depend on the patient's ability to walk for a fixed 6 minute period or at increasing speed over a flat surface.

\section*{Optimisation of the high-risk patient}

As discussed above, all coexisting disease processes should be reviewed and optimised. Simple measures include stopping smoking (maximal benefit only seen if stopped for 8 weeks prior to surgery), reducing alcohol intake, losing weight, improving nutrition and/or haemoglobin levels.

In the high-risk group there may a need for more complex investigations, review of medication or even consideration of further surgery. Patients scheduled for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair surgery for example, frequently require carotid duplex scans. If the scans reveal a significant blockage and a high risk of perioperative stroke, a carotid endarterectomy may be indicated prior to AAA repair.

All high-risk patients benefit from multidisciplinary team care and the involvement of experienced physicians in the perioperative period. The impact and management of the comorbidities that commonly contribute to risk are outlined below.

\section*{Ischaemic heart disease}

Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with a high mortality (15-25\%). Ischaemia, and ultimately MI, occur when the supply of oxygen to the myocardium is exceeded by its demand. This situation can be precipitated by
hypotension, tachycardia and procoagulant states (of which the inflammatory response to surgery is an example).

Preparation of these patients for surgery should aim to optimise myocardial oxygen supply and demand ratio and so minimise the risk of myocardial ischaemia developing. This work may involve further investigations or even the decision to postpone non-cardiac surgery for 3-6 months after an MI. Some patients may require preoperative revascularisation, using either a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a stent or angioplasty.

\section*{Minimising myocardial ischaemia}

Anaesthesia techniques that dampen the stress response to surgery (especially minimising pain) and provide a good degree of cardiac stability should be used. Anaesthesia should avoid tachycardia, systolic hypertension and diastolic hypotension, and may be facilitated by the use of invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring. Blood loss must be accurately monitored and haemoglobin maintained at a level suitable for the patient's cardiac risk factors. Perioperative use of $\beta$-blockers may be considered but this is controversial.

Troponin testing allows early diagnosis of perioperative MIs, but there are limited reperfusion options due to risk of bleeding from the surgical site. Admission to HDU should be considered for patients with IHD and supplemental oxygen therapy continued for 3-4 days.

\section*{Cardiac failure}

Left ventricular failure is the end result of several conditions including IHD, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valve dysfunction. Decompensated heart failure puts the patient at risk of multiorgan failure. Those with ejection fractions of less than $35 \%$, and in whom the failure is undiagnosed or its severity underestimated, are at the highest risk. The patient's functional capacity needs to be assessed and surgery may have to be delayed for investigations such as an echocardiogram and/or for optimisation of medical therapy. Drugs used in chronic heart failure have significant implications for perioperative care, and $\beta$-blockers and probably ACE inhibitors (unless renal perfusion is to be significantly affected) should be continued. Anaesthesia should ensure minimal myocardial depression and change in afterload during surgery. Arrhythmias must be rapidly brought under control, particularly AF, and correcting any electrolyte imbalance is crucial in this respect. Invasive monitoring of trends in central venous and arterial pressure monitoring may help management, particularly when large fluid shifts are expected to occur.

\section*{Respiratory failure}

Around $1.5 \%$ of patients develop lower respiratory tract infection after surgery with a 30 -day mortality over $20 \%$. Surgery, particularly open abdominal procedures under general anaesthesia, result in changes to respiratory physiology. The functional residual capacity of the lungs is reduced. This combined with the respiratory depressant effect of residual anaesthetic agents, the patient's limited mobility and pain from surgery causes atelectasis (failure of gas exchange due to - olar collapse) and predisposes patients to postoperative - studocu
respiratory infection. Other complications including bronchospasm, pneumothorax and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) contribute as much to morbidity and length of hospital stay as cardiac complications. Respiratory failure defined as a $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}<8 \mathrm{kPa}$ in air, $\mathrm{PaO}_{2} / \mathrm{FiO}_{2}<40 \mathrm{kPa}$ or inability to extubate a patient 48 hours after surgery, is by far the most significant of these and is associated with a mortality of $27-40 \%$.

Again, as with cardiac risk management, it may be necessary to postpone surgery to allow medical optimisation or consider a non-operative option. Preoperatively, bronchodilator therapy will be required in those with reversible obstructive airway disease and steroids may need to be started or increased. Nutritional status should be optimised and albumin levels corrected. Physiotherapy for postural drainage, and deep breathing exercises or incentive spirometry should be considered for patients at increased risk of respiratory complications. General anaesthesia is associated with more respiratory complications and so regional techniques should be considered where possible in these patients. Hypoxemia and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ retention leading to the need for reintubation is better avoided in those at risk, by delaying extubation until analgesia, hydration and acid-base status have been corrected. Patients may benefit from ITU admission and this needs planning. Application of non-invasive respiratory support (Figure 17.8) may allow certain patients to be extubated earlier.

\section*{Other comorbidities}

Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and liver dysfunction are some of the medical conditions that contribute to risk and need to be optimised.

\section*{Sepsis}

Sepsis needs urgent identification and treatment, as if not treated early it can lead to either a prolonged admission to a critical care unit or death. Early resuscitative measures in sepsis include administering broad spectrum antibiotics and treating hypotension, hypovolemia and elevated lactate lev-

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
els with appropriate intravenous fluids. It is also important to deal with the source of sepsis as early as possible.

\section*{Minimising the impact of surgery in the high-risk patient}

There are situations where the selection of one surgical technique over another may be significantly influenced by patient risk factors. Some procedures are not primarily high-risk but may become so in unsuitable patients. Laparoscopic surgery, for example, has come of age as a preferred technique for patients predisposed to postoperative respiratory complications, but its effect on cardiac physiology means the same may not apply to patients at risk of cardiac complications. The expanding demand and indications for minimal access surgery are now pushing the boundaries of intraoperative physiological tolerance. Robotic prostatectomy and some laparoscopic colorectal procedures require a pneumoperitoneum with steep Trendelenburg (head down) positioning for several hours (Figure 17.9). This can be associated with adverse cardiovascular and neurological complications, such as myocardial ischaemia and increased intracranial pressure in the high risk group. This risk may be minimised by attention to patient selection.

\section*{Role of critical care and outreach services}

Optimal care in the high-risk group should be extended to include postoperative support, which for a majority of these patients means admission to a critical care bed. Reports from the National Confidential Enquiry into Surgical Deaths (NCEPOD) show that the majority of postoperative deaths

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2755b84f-7f32-46dd-8244-34194074b5a0-15.jpg?height=837&width=801&top_left_y=1715&top_left_x=1091}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 17.10 A high-risk patient admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively.}
\end{figure}
in the UK occur more than 5 days after surgery. Admission to a critical care unit allows for early intervention and a level of care that is difficult to deliver in the ward environment during this crucial period (Figure 17.10). The high-risk surgical population accounts for $80 \%$ of postoperative deaths but only about $15-30 \%$ of high-risk surgical patients are admitted to a critical care unit at any time following surgery. One study that compared surgical mortality in the UK and the USA found an observed mortality of $9.95 \%$ in the UK as compared to $2.1 \%$ in USA. It is suggested that the difference may be related to the provision of critical care services, with 8.6 critical care beds per 100000 population in the UK compared to 30.5 in the USA.

In the last decade, the role of critical care has been expanded to the concept of 'critical care without walls'. The intensive care outreach services (ICORS) grew from a recognition that there were many patients in the hospital who are at risk of being critically ill, and early identification of these patients using 'early warning scores' could allow for early intervention. The outreach team functions to bridge the gap between critical care unit and ward.

\section*{CONSENT}

Consent should be both voluntary and informed. The process of consent has evolved over the years and in the UK, following a recent legal judgement, new guidance has been published (see Further reading; RCS). This describes the importance of supported decision-making concerning a treatment or operation. The guidance outlines the key principles of consent and how the discussion should:
- give the patient the information required to make a decision;
- be tailored to the individual patient;
- explain all reasonable treatment options;
- discuss all material* risks.

Furthermore, the guide explains that consent:
- should be written and recorded on a form;
- the key points of the discussion should be recorded in the case notes.
*Material risk: "whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would likely attach significance to it" (Source RCS 2016).

Clearly in certain emergency situations, it may not be possible to follow all of the key principles. For consent to be given, the patient must have capacity, which includes the ability to understand the information provided, to retain and use the information to make a decision and to indicate what that decision is (see Further reading; RCS). The surgeon should presume the patient has capacity for consent (Mental Capacity Act, 2005) unless during the process it is demonstrated that this is not the case. Generally, children are presumed to have capacity at 16 and for those under that age, capacity can be assessed (GMC guidance, 2007).

The person obtaining consent must be appropriately experienced to do so.

\section*{Summary box 17.8}

\section*{Consent}
- Consent should be voluntary and informed
- Supported decision-making is considered good practice
- Explain all treatment options and material risks
- Capacity is needed for a patient to give their consent

\section*{ARRANGING THEATRE LIST}

The date, place and time of operation should be matched with availability of personnel. Appropriate equipment and instruments should be made available. The operating list should be distributed as early as possible to all staff who are involved in making the list run smoothly (Table 17.12). If this is done electronically, familiarity with the computer system is required.

Prioritise patients, e.g. children and diabetic patients should be placed at the beginning of the list; life- and limb-threatening surgery should take priority; cancer patients need to be treated early.

\section*{Anaesthesia and pain relief}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To gain an understanding of:
- Techniques of anaesthesia and airway maintenance
- Methods of providing pain relief
- Local and regional anaesthesia techniques
- The management of chronic pain and pain from malignant disease

\section*{HISTORY}

Anaesthesia, as we know it today, was first successfully demonstrated by William Morton, a local dentist, at the Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, USA on 16th October 1846 when he administered ether to Gilbert Abbot for operation on a vascular tumour on his neck. Earlier Horace Wells had successfully used nitrous oxide in 1844 for painless extraction of teeth.

Simpson at Edinburgh University overcame some of the technical difficulties of ether administration by introducing chloroform. The benefits of anaesthesia were then universally recognised and antagonism by religious leaders was countered when Queen Victoria accepted chloroform from John Snow during the birth of Prince Leopold in 1853.

\section*{KEY PRINCIPLES OF ANAESTHESIA}

Optimum patient care is dependent on a collaborative approach from anaesthetic and surgical teams, together with the other perioperative care providers. The importance of multidisciplinary collaboration has been clearly demonstrated by national audits such as the Confidential Enquiries in Perioperative Deaths (CEPOD) and Enquiries into Maternal Deaths UK. These audits have led to changes in clinical and non-clinical practice to improve morbidity and mortality.

The use of a set of safety checklists in the operating theatre in the form of the World Health Organisation's Surgical Safety Checklist has shown a reduction in incidence of perioperative untoward events.

The role of the modern anaesthetist has evolved from just being responsible for the patient in the operating suite into a 'perioperative physician' who optimises the patient for surgery, assessing and minimising risk, cares for them during the operation, and then manages both pain and homeostasis in the postoperative period (Table 18.1).

TABLE 18.1 Key features of commonly used intravenous anaesthetic agents.

Propofol (di-isopropyl phenol) Smooth induction, better haemodynamic stability, blunting of autonomic reflexes and ability to use as a continuous infusion

Thiopentone (barbiturate) Rapid induction, myocardial depression. Reduced metabolic rate and lowering of intracranial pressure is useful in neurosurgical patients but drop in blood pressure can give detrimental effects

Etomidate (steroid derivative) Good haemodynamic stability, brief duration of action, but concern over adrenocortical depression

Ketamine (phencyclidine derivative) Preservation of blood pressure and respiratory reflexes together with excellent analgesia makes it an ideal choice for field anaesthesia. Emergence delirium is associated with administration of ketamine

\section*{Summary box 18.1}

\section*{Ground rules for anaesthesia}
- Safe surgery is achieved by close teamwork between surgeon, anaesthetist and perioperative care providers
- Safety checklists make sure that things are not forgotten
- Risk assessments allow the best strategy to be chosen
- Anaesthetists are extending their care into the pre- and postoperative phase

\section*{PREPARATION FOR ANAESTHESIA}

In the previous chapter, the preoperative preparation for anaesthesia was discussed in detail, and its importance is emphasised (Chapter 17). Moreover, a careful preassessment, multidisciplinary approach, standardised care pathway with a carefully chosen anaesthetic and analgesic technique form the cornerstone of 'enhanced recovery programmes' being introduced recently across the surgical specialities (see Chapter 20).

\section*{GENERAL ANAESTHESIA}

General anaesthesia is commonly described as the triad of unconsciousness, analgesia and muscle relaxation.

\section*{Summary box 18.2}

\section*{The general anaesthetic triad}
- Amnesia: loss of awareness
- Analgesia: pain relief
- Muscle relaxation

Induction of general anaesthesia is most frequently done by intravenous agents. Propofol has replaced thiopentone as the most widely used induction agent and can be used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Other infrequently used intravenous agents include etomidate and ketamine. Newer agents based on benzodiazepine receptor agonists, etomidate derivatives and fospropofol are still in the experimental stage.

Inhalational induction using agents such as non-pungent sevoflurane is useful in children, needle-phobic adults and those in whom a difficult airway is anticipated. These patients will have a higher risk of developing airway obstruction (Figure 18.1).

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) using a predetermined dose of intravenous anaesthetic agent together with rapidly acting muscle relaxant is used in those with high risk of regurgitation in order to secure the airway quickly. Commonly needed in emergency surgery it is also a technique of choice in any non-emergency surgery in a patient with delayed emptying of stomach.

Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is becoming popular following the introduction of propofol and the ultra-shortacting opioid remifentanil. The lack of a cumulative effect,

\end{figure}
better haemodynamic stability, excellent recovery profile and concerns over environmental effects of inhalational agents have made TIVA an attractive choice. TIVA is routinely used in neurosurgery, airway laser surgery, during cardiopulmonary bypass and for day-case anaesthesia (Figure 18.2).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 18.2 Total intravenous anaesthesia pumps in use.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Summary box 18.3}

\section*{Special terms in anaesthesia}
- Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a technique that allows the airway to be rapidly secured. It is used when there is a high risk of regurgitation that may lead to pulmonary aspiration
- Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is becoming increasingly popular

Maintenance of anaesthesia, on the other hand, can be done using continuous infusion of intravenous agent (propofol) or inhaled vapour such as isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane.

The use of nitrous oxide is declining despite its analgesic and weak anaesthetic properties due to concerns over postoperative nausea and vomiting. It also increases the size of the air bubble causing adverse effects, for example in eye, ear and abdominal surgery. Finally, it is possibly mutagenic and is a powerful greenhouse gas.

\section*{Management of airway during anaesthesia}

Loss of muscle tone as a result of general anaesthesia means that the patient can no longer keep their airway open. Therefore, the patients need their airway maintained for them. The use of muscle relaxants will mean that they will also be unable to breathe for themselves and so will require artificial ventilation. Head tilt, chin lift and jaw thrust manoeuvres, along with adjuncts such as oropharyngeal airways, are used to facilitate bag-mask ventilation while induction agents exert full effect. Laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube are then inserted and the patient is allowed to breathe spontaneously or is ventilated during the procedure.

The addition of a cuff to the endotracheal tube facilitates positive pressure ventilation and protects the lungs from aspiration of regurgitated gastric contents.

\section*{Supraglottic airways}
- Laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Developed by Dr Archie Brain in the UK, the original LMA is a firstgeneration supraglottic airway. The mask with an inflatable cuff is inserted via the mouth and produces a seal around the glottic opening, providing a very reliable means of maintaining the airway. Its placement is less irritating and less traumatic to a patient's airway than endotracheal intubation. The technique can be easily taught to non-anaesthetists and paramedics and can be used as an emergency airway management tool. Several varieties of first generation LMAs are available, including the classic LMA and the flexible LMA. Further advancement has led to the development of second-generation supraglottic devices such as the ProSeal LMA, the i-Gel and LMA Supreme (Figure 18.3). These devices usually have an in-built 'bite-block' and an oesophageal drain tube; they can be used for ventilation of the lungs at higher inflation pressures and are more suitable for patients with a higher body mass index. There are also modified versions of the LMA including the intubating LMA (ILMA) that allow a blind technique in aiding insertion of a tracheal tube in difficult conditions. There is increasing evidence that second-generation devices have a good safety and efficacy profile and should be replacing all first-generation devices.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
- Difficult intubation. Endotracheal intubation is feasible in most patients, but in a certain proportion of patients this may be difficult or impossible; if compounded by inability to ventilate the patient by bag-mask, consequences can be catastrophic hypoxia. Many devices have been developed to aid intubation if difficulty is anticipated and protocols created by specialised societies to deal with such situations. One specialised method for intubation in difficult situations is the use of the fibreoptic intubating bronchoscope facilitated by topical local anaesthetic in awake patients or using general anaesthesia. The anaesthetist places the endotracheal tube in the trachea by threading the tube over the bronchoscope, and so places the tube in the trachea under direct bronchoscopic vision. An awake intubation requires careful patient selection, as it may not be a suitable technique for all patient groups (Figures 18.4, 18.5 and 18.6).

Double lumen tubes and endobronchial tubes are used in procedures such as thoracoscopic, pulmonary and oesophageal surgery to allow collapse of one lung (while ventilating the other) for ease of surgery. Their use is also essential to isolate the healthy lung in pyopneumothorax and in the case of a bronchopleural fistula.

Ventilating bronchoscopes and endobronchial catheters can be used to maintain oxygenation during laryngo-tracheal surgery or bronchoscopy by using intermittent jets of oxygen.

\section*{Summary box 18.4}

\section*{Techniques for maintaining an airway}
- Chin lift and jaw thrust: suitable for short term when no aid available
- Guedel airway: holds tongue forward but does not prevent aspiration
- Supraglottic device: easy insertion, reliable airway, allows ventilation
- Endotracheal intubation: secure and protected airway

\section*{Summary box 18.5}

\section*{Complications of intubation}
- Failed intubation
- Accidental bronchial intubation
- Trauma to teeth, pharynx, larynx
- Aspiration of gastric contents during intubation
- Disconnection, blockage, kinking of tube
- Delayed tracheal stenosis

\section*{Muscle relaxation and artificial ventilation}

Pharmacological blockade of neuromuscular transmission provides relaxation of muscles allowing easy surgical access, but the patient requires artificial ventilation.
Neuromuscular blocking agents are broadly classified into depolarising and non-depolarising groups according to their mode of action.

Suxamethonium is the most commonly used depolarising agent. It binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in opening of the cation channel leading to depolarisation and rapid relaxation of muscles. Despite its adverse effects such as hyperkalaemia, muscle pain, anaphylaxis and potentially life-threatening malignant hyperthermia, suxamethonium is still widely used because of its quick onset and short duration of action. These properties are useful where rapid endotracheal intubation is necessary to protect the patient's airway or short-duration surgery is performed.

Non-depolarising muscle relaxants act by competitive blockade of postsynaptic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. They provide longer, predictable activity, but require careful monitoring, appropriate timing and reversal of their action by agents such as neostigmine and sugammadex at the end of the procedure. A peripheral nerve stimulator is routinely used to monitor the depth of neuromuscular block and also to confirm satisfactory recovery of muscle power prior to extubation (Table 18.2). With the increasing availability and evidence of the use of sugammadex, the non-depolarising muscle relaxant rocuronium is an alternative to suxamethonium in the 'rapid-sequence' induction, as it allows reversal of its actions with sugammadex in a rapid manner.

\section*{Ventilation during anaesthesia}

Mechanical ventilation is required when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate or when the patient is not breathing because of the effects of the anaesthetic, analgesic agents or muscle relaxants.

In volume control ventilation, a preset volume is delivered by the machine irrespective of the airway pressure. The pressure generated will be in part dependent on the resistance and compliance of the airway. In laparoscopic surgery requiring the Trendelenburg position (the patient is positioned

head down), and in morbidly obese patients and those with lung disease, this may result in excessive pressures being developed, which may lead to barotrauma (pneumothorax).

In pressure control mode, the ventilator generates flow until a preset pressure is reached. The actual tidal volume delivered is variable and depends on airway resistance, intra-abdominal pressure and the degree of relaxation.

Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is often applied to help maintain functional residual capacity (FRC). This avoids lung collapse by opening collapsed alveoli, and maintains a greater area of gas exchange so reducing vascular shunting.

\section*{Summary box 18.6}

\section*{Intermittent positive pressure ventilation}
- Volume controlled, which ensures adequate gas entry but risks high pressure damage
- Pressure controlled, which avoids high pressure damage but risks inadequate ventilation
- Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) reduces alveolar collapse and reduces vascular shunting so improving perfusion

\section*{Monitoring and care during anaesthesia}

A minimum basic monitoring of cardiovascular parameters is required during surgery. This includes:
- Vascular:
- electrocardiogram (ECG);
- blood pressure;
- Adequacy of ventilation:
- inspired oxygen concentration;
- oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry;
- end tidal carbon dioxide concentration.

Monitors of temperature, ventilation parameters and delivery of anaesthetic agents are also routinely used, while measurement of urine output and central venous pressure are recommended for major surgery.

\section*{Anaesthesia for day case surgery}

This is discussed in Chapter 21.

\section*{LOCAL ANAESTHESIA}

Local anaesthetic drugs may be used to provide anaesthesia and analgesia as a sole agent or as adjuncts to general anaesthesia. Available techniques include topical anaesthesia, local infiltration, regional nerve blocks and central neuroaxial blocks (spinal and epidural anaesthesia) (Table 18.3).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{TABLE 18.3 The common local anaesthetic drugs.} \\
\hline Name & Maximum dose & Comments \\
\hline Lignocaine & $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}(7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ with adrenaline) & Early onset, short acting, good sensory block \\
\hline Bupivacaine & $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ & Long lasting, more cardiotoxic, must never be used intravenously \\
\hline Prilocaine & $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}(9 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ with adrenaline) & Least systemic toxicity, causes methaemoglobinaemia \\
\hline Ropivacaine & $3-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ & Less cardiotoxic, greater sensory-motor separation \\
\hline Levobupivaciane & $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ & Isomer of bupivacaine with fewer cardiotoxic properties \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Local anaesthesia techniques can lead to complications that may be local, such as infection or haematoma, or systemic due to overdose or accidental intravascular injection. The systemic effects of local anaesthetic agents are dose dependent and manifest as cardiovascular (cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest) or neurological (depressed consciousness, convulsions). Prilocaine overdose causes methaemoglobinaemia while bupivacaine overdose causes treatment-resistant ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest.

The addition of adrenaline to local anaesthetic solutions hastens onset, prolongs duration of action and permits a higher upper dose limit. The use of adrenaline is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, those taking tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors and in end-arterial locations.

Appropriately skilled personnel, resuscitation equipment and oxygen should always be available with local anaesthetic use because of the potential risks of life-threatening compli-

\section*{Regional anaesthesia}

Regional anaesthesia involves central neuroaxial or peripheral nerve or plexus blocks. It has a clear advantage where general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, such as in patients with debilitating respiratory and cardiovascular disease and obstetric cases. It also provides excellent pain relief in the postoperative period, reducing the need for analgesics such as opioids.

As with general anaesthesia obtaining venous access, monitoring vital parameters should be performed during regional anaesthesia.

Localising nerves using anatomical landmarks and eliciting paraesthesia alone carries a high risk of nerve damage, intravascular injection and has lower success rate. The use of nerve stimulators to localise nerves improves success rate and reduces risks. Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia allows the visualisation of nerves and the spread of local anaesthetics, enabling the use of a smaller dose of local anaesthetic agents, with improved success rates and safety.

\section*{Summary box 18.7}

\section*{Types of anaesthesia}
- General anaesthesia may be more acceptable to the patients
- Regional anaesthesia has major advantages in obstetrics and patients with respiratory compromise
- Local blocks have been transformed by nerve stimulators and ultrasound guidance
- All require full resuscitation and monitoring equipment to be available

\section*{Common local anaesthesia techniques}

\section*{Topical anaesthesia}
- EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics). This is a mixture of lignocaine and prilocaine for application to the skin for venepuncture in children.
- Cocaine. It may be called Mofatt's solution (with an added mixture of adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate) and used in nasal surgery for anaesthesia and vasoconstriction.
- Lignocaine $2 / 4 / 10 \%$. Spray to anaesthetise the airway during awake fibreoptic intubation.

\section*{Nerve blocks}
- Interscalene block for shoulder surgery produces excellent postoperative analgesia. Complications include phrenic nerve block, Horner's syndrome, as well as accidental intravascular and spinal injection.
- Axillary brachial plexus block can be used as the sole anaesthetic technique for upper limb surgery (Figure 18.7).
- Femoral and sciatic nerve blocks are often used for anaesthesia and analgesia for lower limb surgery.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Figure 18.7 (a, b) Ultrasound scans of brachial plexus block.}
\end{figure}

\section*{TRANSVERSUS ABDOMINIS PLANE BLOCK}

Transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) is growing rapidly in popularity. The technique has been shown to provide effective analgesia after a wide range of abdominal surgery. The T6-L1 segmental nerves enter the triangle of Petit just medial to the anterior axillary line. Injection of local anaesthetic into the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles allows a block of all these nerves, and excellent anaesthesia of the anterior abdominal wall (Figure 18.8).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2755b84f-7f32-46dd-8244-34194074b5a0-23.jpg?height=812&width=714&top_left_y=1708&top_left_x=1133}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 18.8 (a, b) Ultrasound scans of lateral abdominal wall and the spread of local anaesthetics.}
\end{figure}

\section*{INTRAVENOUS REGIONAL ANAESTHESIA (BIER'S BLOCK)}

Bier's block produces excellent anaesthesia for short surgery, particularly for the upper limb (e.g. carpal tunnel release). Exsanguination using an Esmarch bandage, inflation of proximal cuff of the double tourniquet is followed by intravenous injection of prilocaine into the vein on the back of the hand that is being operated on. After $5-10$ minutes the distal cuff of the tourniquet is inflated and then the proximal one deflated. Even if surgery is finished, the tourniquet should be left inflated until the local anaesthetic has bound to tissues ( 20 minutes), so that release of local anaesthetic into the systemic circulation does not occur. Lignocaine can be used with caution (consider safe dose and time of tourniquet inflation) but bupivacaine should never be used for Bier's block.

\section*{Spinal anaesthesia}

Spinal anaesthesia alone, and in combination with general anaesthesia or sedation is used extensively for lower limb, obstetric and pelvic surgery. Injection of a 'single shot' local anaesthetic agent intrathecally produces intense and rapid block for surgery. Addition of opioids provides prolonged postoperative analgesia but carries the risk of late respiratory depression.

Autonomic sympathetic blockade produces hypotension, particularly if the level of block is above T10. Caution is needed in patients with hypovolemia and cardiovascular disease.

The incidence of dural puncture headache can be minimised by limiting the number of punctures and use of fine bore pencil tip needles designed to split rather than cut the dura.

\section*{Epidural anaesthesia}

Epidural anaesthesia is slower in onset than spinal, but has the advantage of prolonged analgesia by multiple dosing or continuous infusion through a catheter placed in the epidural space. Being slower in onset, the resulting hypotension from sympathetic blockade can be better controlled and can reduce blood loss.

Continuous infusion (with a patient-controlled bolus) of weak local anaesthetic combined with opioids (such a fentanyl) is routinely used for postoperative analgesia. Placement of an epidural catheter in the high thoracic region provides

\section*{Summary box 18.8}

\section*{Local anaesthetics}
- EMLA cream for children needing injections
- Regional and nerve blocks for limb surgery
- Spinal anaesthesia offers quick onset and short duration of anaesthesia
- Epidurals are more difficult but can then be topped-up postoperatively and used as continuous infusion

excellent analgesia for a wide variety of upper abdominal and thoracic surgical operations, enabling early mobilisation and reducing respiratory complications.

Epidural anaesthesia is technically more difficult than spinal anaesthesia, with a higher failure rate and carries the risk of nerve damage, spinal injuries, accidental spinal injection of large volume of local anaesthetics and risk of infection and epidural haematoma (Figure 18.9).

\section*{Chronic pain management}

In surgical practice, the patient with chronic pain may present for treatment of the cause (e.g. pancreatitis, malignancy), or concomitant benign pathology. Acute pain after surgery may progress to chronic pain and is believed to be due to inadequate treatment of acute pain itself.

Chronic pain may be of several types:
- Nociceptive pain may result from musculoskeletal disorders or cancer activating cutaneous nociceptors (pain receptors). Prolonged ischaemic or inflammatory processes result in sensitisation of peripheral nociceptors and altered activity in the central nervous system, leading to exaggerated responses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The widened area of hyperalgesia and increased sensitivity (allodynia) has been attributed to the increased transmission in the central nervous system.
- Neuropathic (or neurogenic) pain is dysfunction in peripheral or central nerves (excluding the 'physiological' pain due to noxious stimulation of the nerve terminals). It is classically of a 'burning', 'shooting' or 'stabbing' type and may be associated with allodynia, numbness and diminished thermal sensation. It is poorly responsive to opioids. Examples include trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic and diabetic neuropathy. Monoaminergic, tricyclic inhibitors and anticonvulsant drugs are the mainstay of treatment.
- Psychogenic pain is associated with depressive illness; chronic pain and the illness may exacerbate each other.

\section*{Summary box 18.9}

\section*{Types of pain}
- Nociceptive pain arises from inflammation and ischaemia
- Neuropathic pain arises from a dysfunction in the central nervous system
- Psychogenic pain is modified by the mental state of the patient

\section*{Chronic pain control in benign disease}

Surgical patients may present with chronic persistent pain (more than 3 months' duration) from a variety of disorders including postoperative neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory disease, recurrent infection, degenerative bone or joint disease, nerve injury and sympathetic dystrophy. This may result from persistent excitation of the nociceptive pathways causing spontaneous firing of pain signals at N-methyl-Daspartate receptors in the ascending pathways. This pain does not respond to opiates or neuroablative surgery and would merit neuropathic pain management.

Amputation of limbs may result in phantom limb pain; the likelihood is increased if the limb was painful before surgery. Continuous regional local anaesthetic blockade (epidural or brachial plexus) established before operation and continued postoperatively for a few days, is believed to effectively reduce the risk of phantom limb pain.
- Local anaesthetic and steroid injections can be effective around an inflamed nerve and they reduce the cycle of constant pain transmission with consequent muscle spasm. Transforaminal selective root blocks in the epidural space are used for the pain of nerve root irritation associated with or without minor disc prolapse, followed by active physiotherapy and rehabilitation to promote mobility.
- Nerve stimulation procedures such as acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, increase the endorphin production in the central nervous system. Nerve decompression craniotomy rather than percutaneous coagulation of the ganglion is now performed for trigeminal neuralgia. Spinal cord stimulation by dorsal column stimulation is now a recognised and effective management of intractable neuropathic pain. This involves placement of electrodes in the posterior epidural space to allow dorsal column stimulation through an implantable pulse generator inserted in the body.

\section*{Summary box 18.10}

\section*{Pain control in benign disease}
- Bring pain under control before amputation to avoid phantom pain
- Local anaesthetic and steroid injected around a nerve may reduce muscle spasm
- Transcutaneous nerve stimulators (TNS) modifies pain by increasing endorphin production
- Trigeminal neuralgia responds to decompression of the nerve

\section*{Drugs in chronic non-malignant pain}

Paracetamol and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of musculoskeletal pain treatment. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs and anticonvulsant agents are often useful for the pain of nerve injury, although side effects can prove troublesome and reduce compliance. Both pregabalin and gabapentin reduce spontaneous neuronal activity by their action on the alpha-2-delta subunit of calcium channels, and are now used for managing neuropathic chronic pain. In more severe and debilitating non-malignant chronic pain, opioid analgesic drugs are used in slow release oral preparations of morphine and oxycodone, and transcutaneous patches delivering fentanyl and buprenorphine. Tapentadol with its dual action on opioid and noradrenaline selective reuptake inhibition pathways may provide relief in patients with pain of both neuropathic and nociceptive elements. Combinations of drugs often prove useful to achieve the optimum of efficacy with minimal side effects.

\section*{Treatment of pain dependent on sympathetic nervous system activity}

Even minor trauma and surgery, (often of a limb) can provoke chronic burning pain, allodynia, trophic changes and resultant disuse due to excessive sympathetic adrenergic activity inducing vasconstriction and abnormal nociceptive transmission.

Management includes antineuropathic pain medications (pregabalin, gabapentin, amitriptyline) as part of multimodal analgesia with a multidisciplinary pain management approach including considerable input of psychological, targeted physiotherapy and counselling. Interventional treatment may include local anaesthetic injection of stellate ganglion for upper limb symptoms. Percutaneous chemical lumbar sympathectomy with local anaesthetic is used for relief of rest pain in advanced ischaemic disease of the legs.

\section*{Pain control in malignant disease}

Pain is a common symptom associated with cancer, more so during the advanced stages. In intractable pain, the underlying principle of treatment is to encourage independence of the patient and an active life in spite of the symptom. The World Health Organisation's booklet advises use of a 'pain stepladder’:
- First step. Simple analgesics: aspirin, paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic drugs or anticonvulsant drugs.
- Second step. Intermediate strength opioids: codeine, tramadol or dextropropoxyphene.
- Third step. Strong opioids: morphine (pethidine has now been withdrawn).

Oral opiate analgesia is necessary when the less powerful analgesic agents no longer control pain on movement, or enable the patient to sleep. Fear that the patient may develop an addiction to opiates is usually not justified in malignant disease. It is also important to distinguish between the addiction and dependence; the former being a psychosocial
phenomenon while the latter is a pure physiological response to a given drug. Some patients experience 'breakthrough pain' (acute, excruciating and incapacitating), which occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger, experienced by patients who have relatively stable and adequately controlled background pain.

Oral morphine, often used for chronic pain, can be prescribed in short-acting liquid or tablet form and should be administered regularly every 4 hours until an adequate dose of drug has been titrated to control the pain over 24 hours. Once this is established, the daily dose can be divided into two separate administrations of enteric-coated, slow-release morphine tablets (MST morphine) every 12 hours. Additional short-acting opioids (morphine/fentanyl) can then be used to cover episodes of 'breakthrough pain'. Nausea treated using antiemetic agents does not usually persist, but constipation is frequently a persistent complication requiring regular prevention by laxatives.

\section*{Infusion of subcutaneous, intravenous, intrathecal or epidural opiate drugs}

The infusion of opiate is necessary if a patient is unable to take oral drugs. Subcutaneous infusion of diamorphine is simple and effective to administer. Epidural infusions of diamorphine with an external pump can be used on mobile patients. Intrathecal infusions with pumps programmed by external computers are used; however, there is a possibility of developing infection with catastrophic effects. Intravenous narcotic agents may be reserved for acute crises, such as pathological fractures.

\section*{Neurolytic techniques in cancer pain}

These should only be used if the life expectancy is limited and the diagnosis is certain. The useful procedures are:
- Subcostal phenol injection for a rib metastasis.
- Coeliac plexus neurolytic block with alcohol for pain of pancreatic, gastric or hepatic cancer.
- Intrathecal neurolytic injection of hyperbaric phenol.
- Percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy divides the spinothalamic ascending pain pathway. It is a highly effective technique in experienced hands, selectively eliminating pain and temperature sensation in a specific limited area.

Alternative strategies include:
- The development of antipituitary hormone drugs, such as tamoxifen and cyproterone, enables effective pharmacological therapy for the pain of widespread metastases instead of pituitary ablation surgery.
- Palliative radiotherapy can be most beneficial for the relief of pain in metastatic disease.
- Adjuvant drugs such as corticosteroids to reduce cerebral oedema or inflammation around a tumour may be useful in symptom control. Tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and flecainide are also used to reduce the pain of nerve injury.

In the management of chronic pain, a multidisciplinary approach by a team of medical and nursing staff working with psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists can often achieve much more benefit than the use of powerful drugs. 'Pain Management Programmes' lay out a logical structure for this.

\section*{Summary box 18.11}

\section*{Options for controlling severe pain in malignant disease}
- Oral morphine using slow-release enteric-coated tablets
- Slow infusion of opiates subcutaneously, by epidural or intrathecally
- Neurolysis for patients with limited life expectancy
- Palliative hormone, radiotherapy, or steroids control pain from swelling

\section*{Nutrition and fluid therapy}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
- The causes and consequences of malnutrition in the surgical patient
- Fluid and electrolyte requirements in the pre- and postoperative patient

- The different methods of providing nutritional support and their complications

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

Malnutrition is common. It occurs in about $30 \%$ of surgical patients with gastrointestinal disease and in up to $60 \%$ of those in whom hospital stay has been prolonged because of postoperative complications. It is frequently unrecognised and consequently patients often do not receive appropriate support. There is a substantial body of evidence to show that patients

\end{figure}
who suffer starvation or have signs of malnutrition have a higher risk of complications and an increased risk of death in comparison with patients who have adequate nutritional reserves.

Long-standing protein-calorie malnutrition as seen in cachexia or general frailty is easy to recognise (Figure 19.1). Short-term undernutrition, although less easily recognised, frequently occurs in association with critical illness, major trauma, burns or surgery, and also impacts on patient recovery. The aim of nutritional support is to identify those patients at risk of malnutrition and to ensure that their nutritional requirements are met by the most appropriate route and in a way that minimises complications.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY}

\section*{Metabolic response to starvation}

After a short fast, lasting 12 hours or less, most food from the last meal will have been absorbed. Plasma insulin levels fall and glucagon levels rise, which facilitates the conversion of liver glycogen (approximately 200 g ) into glucose. The liver, therefore, becomes an organ of glucose production under fasting conditions. Many organs, including brain tissue, red and white blood cells and the renal medulla, can initially utilise only glucose for their metabolic needs. Additional stores of glycogen exist in muscle ( 500 g ), but these cannot be utilised directly. Muscle glycogen is broken down (glycogenolysis) and converted to lactate, which is then exported to the liver where it is converted to glucose (Cori cycle). With increasing

In 1947, the Coris were awarded a share of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of how glycogen is catalytically converted.
}
duration of fasting ( $>24$ hours), glycogen stores are depleted and de novo glucose production from non-carbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis) takes place, predominantly in the liver. Most of this glucose is derived from the breakdown of amino acids, particularly glutamine and alanine as a result of catabolism of skeletal muscle (up to 75 g per day). This protein catabolism in simple starvation is readily reversed with the provision of exogenous glucose.

With more prolonged fasting, there is an increased reliance on fat oxidation to meet energy requirements. Increased breakdown of fat stores occurs, providing glycerol, which can be converted to glucose, and fatty acids, which can be used as a tissue fuel by almost all of the body's tissues. Hepatic production of ketones from fatty acids is facilitated by low insulin levels and, after $48-72$ hours of fasting, the central nervous system may adapt to using ketone bodies as their primary fuel source. This conversion to a 'fat fuel economy' reduces the need for muscle breakdown by up to 55 g per day.

Another important adaptive response to starvation is a significant reduction in the resting energy expenditure, possibly mediated by a decline in the conversion of inactive thyroxine (T4) to active tri-iodothyronine (T3). Despite these adaptive responses, there remains an obligatory glucose requirement of about 200 g per day, even under conditions of prolonged fasting.

\section*{Summary box 19.1}

\section*{Metabolic response to starvation}
- Low plasma insulin
- High plasma glucagon
- Hepatic glycogenolysis
- Protein catabolism
- Hepatic gluconeogenesis
- Lipolysis: mobilisation of fat stores (increased fat oxidation) overall decrease in protein and carbohydrate oxidation
- Adaptive ketogenesis
- Reduction in resting energy expenditure (from approximately $25-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day to $15-20 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day

\section*{Metabolic response to trauma and sepsis}

This is described in full in Chapter 1 and summarised in Summary box 19.2.

From a nutritional point of view, two factors deserve emphasis. First, in contrast to simple starvation, patients with trauma have impaired formation of ketones, and the breakdown of protein to synthesise glucose (gluconeogenesis) cannot be entirely prevented by the administration of glucose. Second, although it is generally accepted that the metabolic response to trauma and sepsis is always associated with 'hypermetabolism' or hypercatabolism', these terms are ill defined and do not indicate the need for very high-energy intakes. There is no evidence to show that the provision

\section*{Summary box 19.2}

\section*{Metabolic response to trauma and sepsis}
- Increased counter-regulatory hormones: adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone
- Increased energy requirements (up to $40 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day)
- Increased nitrogen requirements
- Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance
- Preferential oxidation of lipids
- Increased gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism
- Loss of adaptive ketogenesis
- Fluid retention with associated hypoalbuminaemia
of high-energy intake is associated with an amelioration of the catabolic process and it may indeed be harmful; there is mounting evidence for the benefits of permissive underfeeding in critically ill surgical patients.

\section*{NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT Laboratory techniques}

There is no single biochemical measurement that reliably identifies malnutrition. Albumin is not a measure of nutritional status, particularly in the acute setting. Although a low serum albumin level ( $<30 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ) is an indicator of poor prognosis, hypoalbuminaemia invariably occurs because of alterations in body fluid composition and because of increased capillary permeability related to ongoing sepsis. Malnutrition is associated with defective immune function, and measurement of lymphocyte count and skin testing for delayed hypersensitivity frequently reveal abnormalities in malnourished patients. Immunity is not, however, a precise or reliable indicator of nutritional status, nor is it a practical method in routine clinical practice.

\section*{Body weight and anthropometry}

A simple method of assessing nutritional status is to estimate weight loss. Measured body weight is compared with ideal body weight obtained from tables or from the patient's usual or premorbid weight. Unintentional weight loss of more than $10 \%$ of a patient's weight in the preceding 6 months is a good prognostic indicator of poor outcome. Body weight is frequently corrected for height, allowing calculation of the body mass index (BMI, defined as body weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared). A BMI of less than 18.5 indicates nutritional impairment and a BMI below 15 is associated with significant hospital mortality. Major changes in fluid balance, which are common in critically ill patients, may make body weight and BMI unreliable indicators of nutritional status.

Anthropometric techniques incorporating measurements of skinfold thicknesses and mid-arm circumference permit estimations of body fat and muscle mass, and these are indirect measures of energy and protein stores. These mea-
surements are, however, insufficiently accurate in individual patients to permit planning of nutritional support regimens. Similarly, use of bioelectrical impedence analysis (BIA) permits estimation of intra- and extracellular fluid volumes. These techniques are only useful if performed frequently on a sequential basis in individual patients; in this respect, trends are much more important than absolute impedance figures. All of these techniques are significantly impaired by the presence of oedema.

\section*{Clinical}

The possibility of malnutrition should form part of the workup of all patients. A clinical assessment of nutritional status involves a focused history and physical examination, an assessment of risk of malabsorption or inadequate dietary intake and selected laboratory tests aimed at detecting specific nutrient deficiencies. This is termed 'subjective global assessment' and encompasses historical, symptomatic and physical parameters. Recently, the British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition introduced a malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), which is a five-step screening tool to identify adults who are malnourished or at risk of undernutrition (Figure 19.2).

\section*{FLUID AND ELECTROLYTES}

Fluid intake is derived from both exogenous (consumed liquids) and endogenous (released during oxidation of solid foodstuffs) fluids. The average daily water balance of a healthy adult is shown in Table 19.1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{TABLE 19.1 Average daily water balance of a healthy adult in a temperate climate ( 70 kg ).}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Fluid losses occur by four routes:
1 Lungs. About 400 mL of water is lost in expired air each 24 hours. This is increased in dry atmospheres or in patients with a tracheostomy, emphasising the importance of humidification of inspired air.

2 Skin. In a temperate climate, skin (i.e. sweat) losses are between 600 and $1000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day.
3 Faeces. Between 60 and 150 mL of water are lost daily in patients with normal bowel function.
4 Urine. The normal urine output is approximately $1500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day and, provided that the kidneys are healthy, the specific gravity of urine bears a direct relationship to volume. A minimum urine output of $400 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day is required to excrete the end products of protein metabolism.

Maintenance fluid requirements are calculated approximately from an estimation of insensible and obligatory losses. Various formulae are available for calculating fluid replacement based on a patient's weight or surface area. For example, $30-40 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ gives an estimate of daily requirements.

The following are the approximate daily requirements of some electrolytes in adults:
- sodium: $50-90 \mathrm{mM} /$ day ;
- potassium: $50 \mathrm{mM} /$ day ;
- calcium: $5 \mathrm{mM} /$ day;
- magnesium: $1 \mathrm{mM} /$ day .

The nature and type of fluid replacement therapy will be determined by individual patient needs. The composition of some commonly used solutions is shown in Table 19.2.

Note that Hartmann's solution also contains lactate $29 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. Dextrose solutions are also commonly employed. These provide water replacement without any electrolytes and with modest calorie supplements ( 1 litre of 5\% dextrose contains 400 kcal ). A typical daily maintenance fluid regimen would consist of a combination of $5 \%$ dextrose with either Hartmann's or normal saline to a volume of 2 litres.

There has been much controversy in the literature regarding the respective merits of crystalloid versus colloid replacement. There is no consensus on this topic and the usual advice is to replace like with like. If the haematocrit is below $21 \%$, blood transfusion may be required. There is increasing recognition, however, that albumin infusions are of little value.

In addition to maintenance requirements, 'replacement' fluids are required to correct pre-existing deficiencies and ‘supplemental’ fluids are required to compensate for anticipated additional intestinal or other losses. The nature and volumes of these fluids are determined by:
- A careful assessment of the patient including pulse, blood pressure and central venous pressure, if available. Clinical
examination to assess hydration status (peripheries, skin turgor, urine output and specific gravity of urine), urine and serum electrolytes and haematocrit.
- Estimation of losses already incurred and their nature: for example, vomiting, ileus, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or fluid losses from burns or other serious inflammatory conditions.
- Estimation of supplemental fluids likely to be required in view of anticipated future losses from drains, fistulae, nasogastric tubes or abnormal urine or faecal losses.
- When an estimate of the volumes required has been made, the appropriate replacement fluid can be determined from a consideration of the electrolyte composition of gastrointestinal secretions. Most intestinal losses are adequately replaced with normal saline containing supplemental potassium (Table 19.3).

\section*{NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS}

Total enteral or parenteral nutrition necessitates the provision of the macronutrients, carbohydrate, fat and protein, together with vitamins, trace elements, electrolytes and water. When planning a feeding regime, the patient should be weighed and an assessment made of daily energy and protein requirements. Standard tables are available to permit these calculations.

Daily needs may change depending on the patient's condition. Overfeeding is the most common cause of complications, regardless of whether nutrition is provided enterally or parenterally. It is essential to monitor daily intake to provide an assessment of tolerance. In addition, regular biochemical monitoring is mandatory (Table 19.4).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}

\section*{Macronutrient requirements}

\section*{Energy}

The total energy requirement of a stable patient with a normal or moderately increased need is approximately $20-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day. Very few patients require energy intakes in excess of $2000 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day . Thus, in the majority of hospitalised patients in whom energy demands from activity are minimal, total energy requirements are approximately $1300-1800 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day.

\section*{Carbohydrate}

There is an obligatory glucose requirement to meet the needs of the central nervous system and certain haematopoietic cells, which is equivalent to about $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day. In addition, there is a physiological maximum to the amount of glucose that can be oxidised, which is approximately $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per minute (equivalent to about $1500 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{day}$ in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person), with the nonoxidised glucose being primarily converted to fat. However, optimal utilisation of energy during nutritional support is ensured by avoiding the infusion of glucose at rates approximating physiological maximums. Plasma glucose levels provide an indication of tolerance. Avoid hyperglycaemia. Provide energy as mixtures of glucose and fat. Glucose is the preferred carbohydrate source.

\section*{Fat}

Dietary fat is composed of triglycerides of predominantly four long-chain fatty acids. There are two saturated fatty acids (palmitic (C16) and stearic (C18)) and two unsaturated fatty acids (oleic (C18 with one double bond) and linoleic (C18 with two double bonds)). In addition, smaller amounts of linolenic acid (C18 with three double bonds) and medium-chain fatty acids (C6-C10) are contained in the diet.

The unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acid, are considered essential because they cannot be synthesised in vivo from non-dietary sources. Both soybean and sunflower
oil emulsions are rich sources of linoleic acid and provision of only 1 litre of emulsion per week avoids deficiency. Soybean emulsions contain approximately $7 \%$ alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid). The provision of fat as a soybean oil-based emulsion on a regular basis will obviate the risk of essential fatty acid deficiency.

Safe and non-toxic fat emulsions based upon long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) have been commercially available for over 30 years. These emulsions provide a calorically dense product ( $9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ ) and are now routinely used to supplement the provision of non-protein calories during parenteral nutrition. Energy during parenteral nutrition should be given as a mixture of fat together with glucose. There is no evidence to suggest that any particular ratio of glucose to fat is optimal, as long as under all conditions the basal requirements for glucose (100-200 g/day) and essential fatty acids (100-200 g/week) are met. This 'dual energy' supply minimises metabolic complications during parenteral nutrition, reduces fluid retention, enhances substrate utilisation (particularly in the septic patient) and is associated with reduced carbon dioxide production.

Concerns have been expressed about the possible immunosuppressive effects of LCT emulsions. These are more likely to occur if the recommended infusion rates ( $0.15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per hour) are exceeded. Nonetheless, these concerns have prompted the development of newer emulsions based upon medium-chain triglycerides, omega-3 fatty acids and, most recently, structured triglycerides, which combine long and medium-chain triglycerides in the same emulsion. The evidence of clinical benefit for these emulsions compared with conventional LCTs is tenuous, particularly if infusion rates are appropriate and hypertriglyceridaemia is avoided.

\section*{Protein}

The basic requirement for nitrogen in patients without pre-existing malnutrition and without metabolic stress is $0.10-0.15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day. In hypermetabolic patients the nitrogen requirements increase to $0.20-0.25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day. Although there may be a minority of patients in whom the requirements are higher, such as after acute weight loss when the objective of therapy is longterm repletion of lean body mass, there is little evidence that the provision of nitrogen in excess of $14 \mathrm{~g} /$ day is beneficial.

\section*{Vitamins, minerals and trace elements}

Whatever the method of feeding, these are all essential components of nutritional regimes. The water-soluble vitamins B and C act as coenzymes in collagen formation and wound healing. Postoperatively, the vitamin C requirement increases to $60-80 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Supplemental vitamin B12 is often indicated in patients who have undergone intestinal resection or gastric surgery and in those with a history of alcohol dependence. Absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K is reduced in steatorrhoea and the absence of bile.

Sodium, potassium and phosphate are all subject to significant losses, particularly in patients with diarrhoeal illness.

\footnotetext{
in vivo is Latin for 'in a living thing'.
}

Their levels need daily monitoring and appropriate replacement.

Trace elements may also act as cofactors for metabolic processes. Normally, trace element requirements are met by the delivery of food to the gut and so patients on longterm parenteral nutrition are at particular risk of depletion. Magnesium, zinc and iron levels may all be decreased as part of the inflammatory response. Supplementation is necessary to optimise utilisation of amino acids and to avoid refeeding syndrome.

\section*{FLUID AND NUTRITIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF INTESTINAL RESECTION}

Up to 50\% of the small intestine can be surgically removed or bypassed without permanent deleterious effects. With extensive resection ( $<150 \mathrm{~cm}$ of remaining small intestine), metabolic and nutritional consequences arise, resulting in the disease entity known as short bowel syndrome. The clinical presentation of patients with short bowel syndrome is dependent upon the site and extent of intestinal resection.

\section*{Small bowel motility}

Small bowel motility is three times slower in the ileum than in the jejunum. In addition, the ileocaecal valve may slow transit. The adult small bowel receives $5-6$ litres of endogenous secretions and 2-3 litres of exogenous fluids per day. Most of this is reabsorbed in the small bowel. In the jejunum, the cellular junctions are leaky and jejunal contents are always isotonic. Fluid absorption in this region of bowel is inefficient compared with the ileum. It has been estimated that the efficiency of water absorption is $44 \%$ and $70 \%$ of the ingested load in the jejunum and ileum, respectively. The corresponding figures for sodium are $13 \%$ and $72 \%$, respectively. It can be seen, therefore, that the ileum is critical in the conservation of fluid and electrolytes.

\section*{lleum}

The ileum is the only site of absorption of vitamin B12 and bile salts. Bile salts are essential for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. The enterohepatic circulation of bile salts is critical to maintain the bile salt pool. Following resection of the ileum, the loss of bile salts increases and is not met by an increase in synthesis. Depletion of the bile salt pool results in fat malabsorption. In addition, loss of bile salts into the colon affects colonic mucosa, causing a reduction in salt and water absorption, which increases stool losses.

\section*{Colon}

Transit times in the colon vary between 24 and 150 hours. The efficiency of water and salt absorption in the colon exceeds $90 \%$. Another important colonic function is the fermentation of carbohydrates to produce short-chain fatty acids. These have two important functions: first, they enhance

water and salt absorption from the colon and, second, they are trophic to the colonocyte.

\section*{Effects of resection}

Resection of proximal jejunum results in no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte levels as the ileum and colon can adapt to absorb the increased fluid and electrolyte load. Absorption of nutrients occurs throughout the small bowel, and resection of jejunum alone results in the ileum taking over this lost function. In this situation, there is no malabsorption.

Resection of ileum results in a significant enhancement of gastric motility and acceleration of intestinal transit. Following ileal resection, the colon receives a much larger volume of fluid and electrolytes and it also receives bile salts, which reduce its ability to absorb salt and water, resulting in diarrhoea. Even the loss of 100 cm of ileum may cause steatorrhoea, which can necessitate the administration of oral cholestyramine to bind bile salts. With larger resections ( $>100 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) dietary fat restriction may be necessary. Regular parenteral vitamin B12 is required.

The most challenging patients are those with short bowel syndrome who have had in excess of 200 cm of small bowel resected together with colectomy. These patients will usually have a jejunostomy. They are conveniently divided into two groups termed 'net absorbers' and 'net secretors'. Absorbers characteristically have more than 100 cm of residual jejunum and they absorb more water and sodium from the diet than passes through the stomach. These patients can be managed without supplementary parenteral fluids.

Secretors usually have less than 100 cm of residual jejunum and lose more water and sodium from their stoma than they take by mouth. These patients require supplements. Their usual daily jejunostomy output may exceed 4 litres per 24 hours. The sodium content of jejunostomy losses or other high-output fistulae is about $90 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. Jejunal mucosa is leaky and rapid sodium fluxes occur across it. If water or any solution with a sodium concentration of less than $90 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ is consumed, there is a net efflux of sodium from the plasma into the bowel lumen. It is therefore inappropriate to encourage patients with high-output jejunostomies (secretors) to drink large amounts of oral hypotonic solutions. Treatment begins with restricting the total amount of hypotonic fluids (water, tea, juices, etc.) consumed to less than 1 litre a day. Patients should be encouraged to take glucose and saline replacement solutions, which have a sodium concentration of at least $90 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. The World Health Organization (WHO) cholera solution has a sodium concentration of $90 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ and is commonly used.

Complications of short bowel syndrome include peptic ulceration related to gastric hypersecretion, cholelithiasis because of interruption of the enterohepatic cycle of bile salts and hyperoxaluria as a result of the increased absorption of oxalate in the colon predisposing to renal stones. Some patients with short bowel syndrome develop a syndrome of slurred speech, ataxia and altered affect. The cause of this syndrome is fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon to d-lactate and absorption of this metabolite. Treatment necessitates the use of a low carbohydrate diet.

Anti-secretory drugs reduce the amount of fluid secreted from the stomach, liver and pancreas. These include H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors and the somatostatin analogue octreotide. Octreotide also reduces gastrointestinal motility, while proton pump inhibitors lower gastric pH sufficiently to decrease the need for neutralisation of acid in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. This results in significant lowering of high jejunostomy outputs and dosage should be titrated against stoma effluent pH for optimal results. Anti-motility drugs include loperamide and codeine phosphate, which also decrease water and sodium output from the stoma by about $20 \%$.

\section*{ARTIFICIAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT}

The indications for nutritional support are simple. Any patient who has sustained 5 days of inadequate intake or who is anticipated to have no or inadequate intake for this period should be considered for nutritional support. The periods may be less in patients with pre-existing malnutrition. This concept is important because it emphasises that the provision of nutritional support is not specific to certain conditions or diseases. Although patients with Crohn's disease or pancreatitis, or those who have undergone gastrointestinal resections, may frequently require nutritional support, it is the fact that they have had inadequate intakes for defined periods that is the indication rather than the specific disease process.

\section*{Enteral nutrition}

The term 'enteral feeding' means delivery of nutrients into the gastrointestinal tract. The alimentary tract should be used whenever possible. This can be achieved with normal food, oral supplements (sip feeding) or with a variety of tubefeeding techniques delivering food into the stomach, duodenum or jejunum.

A variety of nutrient formulations are available for enteral feeding. These vary with respect to energy content, osmolarity, fat and nitrogen content and nutrient complexity; most contain up to $1-2 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mL}$ and up to $0.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ of protein. Polymeric feeds contain intact protein and hence require digestion, whereas monomeric/elemental feeds contain nitrogen in the form of either free amino acids or, in some cases, peptides. These are less palatable and are used much less frequently than in previous years. Newer feeding formulations are available that include glutamine and fibre to optimise intestinal nutrition, or immunonutrients such as arginine and fish oils, but these are expensive and their use is controversial.

\section*{Sip feeding}

Commercially available supplementary sip feeds are used in patients who can drink but whose appetites are impaired or in whom adequate intakes cannot be maintained with ad libitum intakes. These feeds typically provide 200 kcal and 2 g of nitrogen per 200 mL carton. There is good evidence to demonstrate that these sip-feeding techniques are associated with a significant overall increase in calorie and nitrogen intakes without detriment to spontaneous nutrition. The evidence that these techniques improve patient outcomes is less convincing.

\section*{Tube-feeding techniques}

Enteral nutrition can be achieved using conventional nasogastric tubes (Ryle's), fine-bore feeding tubes inserted into the stomach, surgical or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or, finally, postpyloric feeding utilising nasojejunal tubes or various types of jejunostomy (Figure 19.3). The choice of method will be determined by local circumstances and preference in many patients. Whichever method is adopted, it is important that tube feeding is supervised by an experienced dietician who will calculate the patient's requirements and aim to achieve these within $2-3$ days of the instigation of feeds. Conventionally, $20-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ are administered per hour initially, gradually increasing to goal rates within 48-72 hours. In most units, feeding is discontinued for 4-5 hours overnight to allow gastric pH to return to normal. There is some evidence that this might reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and aspiration. There is good evidence to confirm that feeding protocols optimise the tolerance of enteral nutrition. In these, aspirates are performed on a regular basis and if they exceed 200 mL in any 2-hour
ad libitum is Latin for 'freely or as much as you wish'.
John Alfred Ryle, 1889-1950, Regius Professor of Medicine, Cambridge University and later Professor of Social Medicine, Oxford University, Oxford, UK, introduced the Ryle's tube in 1921.
period, then feeding is temporarily discontinued or the rate of feed administration is diminished.

Tube blockage is common. All tubes should be flushed with water at least twice daily. If a buildup of solidified diet occurs, instillation into the tube of agents such as chymotrypsin may salvage a partially obstructed tube. Guidewires should not be used to clear blockages as these may perforate the tube and cause contiguous damage.

Nasogastric tubes are appropriate in a majority of patients. If feeding is maintained for more than a week or so, a finebore feeding tube is preferable and is likely to cause fewer gastric and oesophageal erosions. These are usually made from soft polyurethane or silicone elastomer and have an internal diameter of $<3 \mathrm{~mm}$.

\section*{Fine-bore tube insertion}

The patient should be semi-recumbent. The introducer wire is lubricated and inserted into the fine-bore tube (Figure 19.4). The tube is passed through the nose and into the stomach via the nasopharynx and oesophagus. The wire is withdrawn and the tube is taped to the patient. There is a small risk of malposition into a bronchus or of causing pneumothorax. The position of the tube should be checked using plain abdominal radiography (Figure 19.5). Confirmation of position by pH testing is possible but limited by the difficulty of obtaining a fluid aspirate with narrow lumen tubes.

\section*{Gastrostomy}

The placement of a tube through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach is termed 'gastrostomy'. Historically, these were created surgically at the time of laparotomy. Today, the majority are performed by percutaneous insertion under

\begin{figure}

\caption{Figure 19.6 Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.}

endoscopic control using local anaesthesia, known as PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tubes (Figure 19.6).

Two methods of PEG are commonly used. The first is called the 'direct-stab' technique in which the endoscope is passed and the stomach filled with air. The endoscopist then watches a cannula entering the stomach having been inserted directly through the anterior abdominal wall. A guidewire is then passed through the cannula into the stomach. A gastrostomy tube (commercially available) may then be introduced into the stomach through a 'peel away' sheath. The alternative technique is the transoral or push-through technique, whereby a guidewire or suture is brought out of the stomach by the endoscope after transabdominal percutaneous insertion and is either attached to a gastrostomy tube or the tube ushed over a guidewire. The abdominal end of the wire \& studocu
energy during parenteral nutrition should be a mixture of glucose and fat and that energy requirements are rarely in excess of $2000 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day $(25-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day $)$. These changes enabled the development of peripheral parenteral nutrition.

\section*{Peripheral}

Peripheral feeding is appropriate for short-term feeding of up to 2 weeks. Access can be achieved either by means of a dedicated catheter inserted into a peripheral vein and manoeuvred into the central venous system (peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) line) or by using a conventional short cannula in the wrist veins. The former method has the advantage of minimising inconvenience to the patient and clinician. PICC lines have a mean duration of survival of 7 days. The disadvantage is that when thrombophlebitis occurs, the vein is irrevocably destroyed. In the alternative approach, intravenous nutrients are administered through a short cannula in wrist veins, infusing the patient's nutritional requirements on a cyclical basis over 12 hours. The cannula is then removed and resited in the contralateral arm. Peripheral parenteral nutrition has the advantage that it avoids the complications associated with central venous administration, but suffers the disadvantage that it is limited by the development of thrombophlebitis (Figure 19.7). Peripheral feeding is not indicated if patients already have an indwelling central venous line or in those in whom long-term feeding is anticipated.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{Central}

When the central venous route is chosen, the catheter can be inserted via the subclavian or internal or external jugular vein. There is good evidence to show that the safest means of establishing central venous access is by insertion of lines

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2755b84f-7f32-46dd-8244-34194074b5a0-36.jpg?height=647&width=865&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=1078}

\caption{Figure 19.8 Infraclavicular subclavian line.}
\end{figure}
under ultrasound guidance; however, this will not be practicable for all cases. Most intensive care physicians and anaesthetists favour cannulation of internal or external jugular veins as these vessels are easily accessible. They suffer the disadvantage that the exit site is situated inconveniently on the side of the neck, where repeated movements result in disruption of the dressing with the attendant risk of sepsis. The infraclavicular subclavian approach is more suitable for feeding as the catheter then lies flat on the chest wall, which optimises nursing care (Figure 19.8).

For longer-term parenteral nutrition, Hickman lines are preferable. These are often inserted by a radiologist with fluoroscopic guidance or ultrasound. They incorporate a small cuff, which sits at the exit site of a subcutaneous tunnel. This is thought to minimise the possibility of line dislodgement and reduce the possibility of line sepsis. Whichever technique is employed, a postinsertion chest x-ray is essential before feeding is commenced to confirm the absence of pneumothorax and that the catheter tip lies in the distal superior vena cava, to minimise the risk of central venous or cardiac thrombosis. Multilumen catheters can be used for the administration of TPN; one port should be employed for that sole purpose and strict protocols of aseptic care employed.

An alternative technique for central intravenous access allows the PICC technique under ultrasound guidance to cannulate the cephalic vein in the arm, which facilitates passage of a catheter into the bracheocephalic vein or superior vena cava. This has many advantages as it minimises the risks of insertion and ensures distance between the site of skin entry and the tip of the catheter. Thrombophlebitis, however, can occur.

\section*{Complications of parenteral nutrition}

The commencement of TPN may precipitate or accentuate underlying nutrient deficiency by encouraging anabolism.
inadequate oral intake should be considered for nutritional support. This may be dietetic advice alone, sip feeding or enteral or parenteral nutrition. These are not mutually exclusive. The success or otherwise of nutritional support should be determined by tolerance to nutrients provided and nutritional end points, such as weight. It is unrealistic to expect nutritional support to alter the natural history of disease. It is imperative that nutrition-related morbidity is kept to a minimum. This necessitates the appropriate selection of feeding method, careful assessment of fluid, energy and protein requirements, which are regularly monitored, and the avoidance of overfeeding.

\section*{Postoperative care}

\section*{Learning objectives}

\section*{To understand:}
- What is required to deliver immediate postoperative care
- What are the common postoperative problems seen in the immediate postoperative period
- How to predict and prevent common postoperative complications
- How to recognise and treat common postoperative complications
- The principles of enhanced recovery
- A system for discharging patients

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

The aim of postoperative care is to provide the patient with as quick, painless and safe a recovery from surgery as possible. This requires the appropriate knowledge and skills to manage medical, as well as surgical, postoperative problems.

\section*{Standards of postanaesthesia care in the immediate postoperative period}

Both the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) and Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) have set standards for the provision of immediate postoperative care of patients who have undergone a procedure requiring a general anaesthetic or central neuraxial blockade. In brief, they both specify that care should be undertaken in a dedicated postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) with staff trained in the management of patients in the immediate postoperative care period. Standards for equipment (including resuscitation, difficult airway and monitoring), drugs and schedules of measurement of patient vital signs are described, as well as the discharge criteria each patient must satisfy prior to transfer out.

\section*{Immediate postoperative care}

In many settings around the world, the process starts with a 'sign out' as part of the World Health Organization check list. The theatre team should then formally hand over the care
of the patient to the PACU staff. The information provided should include the patient's name, age, the surgical procedure, existing medical problems, allergies, the anaesthetic and analgesics given, fluid replacement, blood loss, urine output, any surgical and anaesthetic problems encountered or expected and a plan for the management of pain and nausea or vomiting.

\section*{Postoperative observations}

The patient's vital signs (including pulse, blood pressure and pulse oximetry reading), level of consciousness, pain and hydration status are monitored in the recovery room and supportive treatment is given. In recent years, patient observations have been collated in recording systems designed to provide an early warning of clinical deterioration (Figure 20.1).

Surgery-specific observations such as Doppler flow for a free flap, regular neurological evaluation and laboratory tests, such as blood gas analysis, should also be performed when necessary.

The patient can be discharged from PACU when they fulfil the following criteria:
- Patient is fully conscious.
- Respiration and oxygenation are satisfactory.
- Patient is normothermic, not in pain and not nauseous.
- Cardiovascular parameters are stable.
- Oxygen, fluids and analgesics have been prescribed.
- There are no concerns related to the surgical procedure.

\section*{Postoperative period}
- All anaesthetised patients should be recovered in a dedicated PACU
- All vital parameters should be monitored and documented according to local protocols
- Treat pain and nausea/vomiting
- Observe for complications

\section*{SYSTEM-SPECIFIC POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS}

Postoperative complications are an important cause of morbidity, mortality, extended hospital stay and increased costs. Most patients at increased risk of developing postoperative complications can be identified prior to surgery at the preoperative assessment clinic using a variety of scoring systems (for example the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Programme risk stratification for perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest (NSQiP) surgical risk calculator, see Chapter 17). Early identification of risk allows for targeted, appropriate, anticipatory and supportive medical care, which will reduce both the incidence and severity of such complications when they occur.

\section*{Classification of postoperative complications}

There are three common approaches for the classification of postoperative complications of surgery:

1 Linked to time after surgery:
- immediate (within 6 h of procedure);
- early (6-72 h);
- late ( $>72 \mathrm{~h}$ ).

2 Generic and surgery specific.
3 Clavian-Dindo: this system relates to surgical complications only and is used to objectively and reproducibly measure the impact of the surgical complication on the outcome of the procedure. It is included here for completeness and will be discussed no further.

\section*{Respiratory system}

Early detection of respiratory complications is facilitated by periodic assessment of airway patency, respiratory rate and routine oxygen saturation measurement, performed during emergence and recovery as described earlier.

\section*{Immediate respiratory complications}

\section*{AIRWAY}

Upper airway obstruction is one of the commonest immediate postoperative complications and can be due to laryngospasm, persisting relaxation of airway muscles, soft tissue oedema, haematoma, vocal cord dysfunction or foreign body. Vigilance
and early intervention are necessary to prevent harm to the patient. Most interventions are simple and involve manual support of the jaw or insertion of an oral or nasal airway.

\section*{RESPIRATION}

The residual effects of anaesthetic drugs (neuromuscular blockers, anaesthetic agents, opioids) can contribute to reduced or impaired adequacy of ventilation postoperatively. Continuous pulse oximetry and respiratory rate evaluation can identify respiratory compromise and consequent hypoxia early. Supplemental oxygen should be given to all patients in PACU until adequate respiration and oxygenation are restored.

\section*{HYPOXAEMIA}

This may occur, in addition to the situations already described above, as a consequence of acute pulmonary oedema (fluid overload, cardiac failure, postobstructive), bronchospasm, pneumothorax (Figure 20.2), aspiration and, rarely, pulmonary embolism (Figure 20.3). De novo pneumonia is very

unusual in the immediate postoperative period. Hypoxaemia develops most quickly in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea, lung disease and obesity, who should therefore be closely observed.

Patients with hypoxaemia should be treated urgently. If the patient is breathing spontaneously, oxygen should be administered at $15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ using a non-rebreathing mask. A head tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust should relieve obstruction related to reduced muscle tone. Suctioning of any blood or secretions and insertion of an oropharyngeal airway may be needed. Early anaesthetic intervention may be required.

\section*{SURGERY-SPECIFIC}

Vocal cord palsy (as a consequence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury), neck haematoma and post-tonsillectomy bleeding are recognised and life-threatening complications of head and neck surgery, which need immediate medical attention for safe resolution.

\section*{Early and late respiratory complications}

Early and late postoperative pulmonary complications are a significant cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality (figures vary between 5\% and 70\%). Complications include fever (due to microatelectasis), cough, dyspnoea, bronchospasm, hypercapnoea, atelectasis (Figure 20.4), pneumonia (Figure 20.5), pleural effusion, pneumothorax and respiratory failure. The risk of each varies with the patient and the type of surgery being performed. Thoracic or abdominal surgery carries the highest risk. The majority of patients at risk (obese, smokers, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, poor nutritional status) can be identified preoperatively, facilitating the development of strategies that will reduce the impact of surgery on the individual patient.

\section*{Summary box 20.2}

\section*{Respiratory complications}
- Respiratory complications can occur either immediately or a few days later on the ward
- Obesity, smoking, chronic lung disease, poor nutritional status and obstructive sleep apnoea predispose to a higher risk of respiratory complications
- Early intervention and multidisciplinary involvement can prevent life-threatening respiratory complications

\section*{Cardiovascular system}

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death within 30 days after non-cardiac surgery. Recent trials, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, have identified ways to improve safety and therefore outcome (see Further reading).

Routine pulse, blood pressure, and electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring detect cardiovascular complications, reduce adverse outcomes and should be recorded during emergence from, and recovery after, anaesthesia. There are certain categories of patient and procedure for which routine cardiovascular monitoring may be required for upwards of 24 hours, usually in a PACU or high-dependency unit.

\section*{Immediate cardiovascular complications}

\section*{HYPOTENSION}

In the immediate postoperative period this is associated with adverse outcomes. Multivariable analysis from the POISE-2 theired showed that clinically important hypotension was an Q studocu
independent predictor of the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction (see Further reading).

Hypotension may be due to hypovolaemia, myocardial impairment or vasodilatation from subarachnoid and epidural anaesthesia. Other causes of hypotension such as surgical bleeding, sepsis, arrhythmias, tension pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade and anaphylaxis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Treatment should be aimed at the cause. Postoperative hypotension leading to end-organ dysfunction, (e.g. decreased urine output $<0.5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$, decreased level of consciousness, myocardial ischaemia, capillary refill $>2$ seconds) needs immediate management with fluid and may require the use of vasopressors and inotropes.

\section*{HYPERTENSION}

Hypertension is also common. It may be due to pain, agitation, anxiety, bladder spasm secondary to urinary catheterisation or pre-existing poorly-controlled hypertension. Consequences include bleeding from vascular suture lines, cerebrovascular haemorrhage and myocardial ischaemia or infarction.

\section*{MYOCARDIAL ISCHAEMIA}

Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or with known cardiac risk factors undergoing major surgery are at risk of major adverse cardiac events. This risk can be predicted preoperatively using the ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Programme (NSQIP) risk stratification for perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest (MICA). Symptoms can include retrosternal pain radiating into the neck, jaw or arms, nausea, dyspnoea or syncope, but many events in the perioperative period are silent.

ECG changes can include ST-elevation in two continuous leads, new left bundle branch block or an arrhythmia. In the case of a non-ST segment MI, only a rise in serial troponin levels will clarify the diagnosis. Cardiologists should be involved early and may start coronary reperfusion therapy in the form of primary percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis. These should be discussed with the surgical team due to the risk of bleeding after major surgery.

\section*{ARRHYTHMIAS}

When they occur in the postoperative period, arrhythmias can cause hypotension, myocardial ischaemia and cardiac arrest. Treatment should be guided by the Resuscitation Council periarrest guidelines.

Tachycardia (sinus or supraventricular) may occur due to anxiety, pain, myocardial ischaemia or infarction, hypovolaemia, sepsis or hypoxia in the postoperative period. Consideration should be given to correction of the underlying causes and rate controlled with $\beta$-blockers, amiodarone or cardioversion, depending on the state of the patient.

Sinus bradycardia may be normal in athletes but it may also be associated with hypoxia, preoperative $\beta$-blockers, digoxin and increased intracranial pressure. Pharmacological options include glycopyrrolate or atropine intravenously.

\section*{STROKE}

Stroke is a recognised complication of carotid endarterectomy surgery both early (secondary to emboli) and later (secondary to cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome). It is also a recognised consequence of both hypotension and hypertension. Thrombolysis may be indicated but the neurology and surgical teams must discuss together the risks and benefits of such a treatment plan.

\section*{Early and late cardiovascular complications}

Major postoperative cardiac complications account for at least one-third of postoperative deaths, resulting in substantial rates of complications, prolonged length of stay and increased medical costs.

MI, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and stroke need to be identified and treated early. Recent studies advocate shared postoperative care of patients at high risk, in order that the signs of deterioration may be identified early and treated (see Further reading).

\section*{Summary box 20.3}

\section*{Cardiovascular complications}
- Hypotension and hypertension in the postoperative period can be multifactorial and result in serious morbidity
- Arrhythmias can be prevented and corrected by treating hypotension and electrolyte imbalance
- Arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia/infarction and stroke will need management with the help of cardiologists and neurologists

\section*{Renal and urinary system}

\section*{Acute kidney injury}

About one-quarter of cases of hospital-acquired renal failure occur in the perioperative period and are associated with high mortality, especially after cardiac and major vascular surgery. Patients with known chronic renal disease, diabetes, liver failure, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac failure are at high risk (Table 20.1).

According to national guidance (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE) based on several definitions, acute kidney injury can be detected by the following criteria (see Further reading):
- a rise in serum creatinine of $26 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ or greater within 48 hours;

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{TABLE 20.1 Common causes of acute kidney injury.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Prerenal & Hypotension Hypovolaemia \\
\hline Renal & Nephrotoxic drugs (gentamicin, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) Surgery involving renal vessels Myoglobinuria Sepsis \\
\hline Postrenal & Ureteric injury Blocked urethral catheter \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
- a $\geq 50 \%$ rise in serum creatinine known or presumed to have occurred within the past 7 days;
- a fall in urine output to less than $0.5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ for more than 6 hours in adults and more than 8 hours in children and young people;
- a $\geq 25 \%$ fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate in children and young people within the past 7 days.

\section*{Urinary retention}

Inability to void after surgery is common with pelvic and perineal operations, or after procedures performed under spinal anaesthesia. Pain, hypovolaemia, problems with access to urinals and bed pans and a lack of privacy on wards may contribute to the problem of urine retention. The diagnosis of retention may be confirmed by clinical examination and by using ultrasound imaging. Catheterisation should be performed prophylactically when an operation is expected to last 3 hours or longer, or when large volumes of fluid are administered.

\section*{Urinary infection}

Urinary infection is one of the most commonly acquired infections in the postoperative period. Patients may present with dysuria and/or pyrexia. Immunocompromised patients, diabetics and those patients with a history of urinary retention are known to be at higher risk. Treatment involves adequate hydration, proper bladder drainage and antibiotics depending on the sensitivity of the microorganisms.

\section*{Summary box 20.4}

\section*{Renal and urinary complications}
- Postoperative renal failure is associated with high mortality
- Prophylactic measures to prevent renal failure should be taken in high-risk cases
- Urinary retention and infection are common problems postoperatively

\section*{Central nervous system}

\section*{Postoperative delirium}

With an increasingly frail and elderly population presenting for elective surgery, the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) is increasing. POD is frequently recognised late and has significant postoperative sequelae.

POD can occur during recovery from anaesthesia or a few days after surgery. The overall incidence of POD is $5-50 \%$. It occurs more frequently in the elderly orthopaedic patient and those undergoing emergency surgical procedures. Delirium is associated with increased all-cause morbidity, mortality and discharge to a nursing home. There are two types of delirium - hyperactive (restlessness, incoherent speech, agitation, hallucinations) and hypoactive (withdrawn, poorly responsive to the environment, depressed). Preoperative risk factors for POD include pre-existing cognitive impairment, dementia, frailty, Parkinson's disease, severe illness, renal impairment and depression. Precipitating factors include surgery,
intraoperative administration of narcotics and benzodiazepines, change of medications, electrolyte and fluid abnormalities, constipation, catheterisation and an unfamiliar environment (Table 20.2).

Correcting any reversible cause, involving relatives or friends whom the patient knows and pain control can all contribute to reducing the impact and duration of delirium. As a last option, haloperidol may be given in titrated doses according to local protocols.

\section*{GENERAL POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Bleeding}

Postoperative haemorrhage is most common in the immediate postoperative period. It may be caused by an arterial or venous leak, but also by a generalised ooze or a coagulopathy. Slow bleeds may go undetected for hours and then the patient suddenly decompensates. All patients must have their vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, oximetry, central venous pressure, if available, and urine output) monitored regularly. Dressings and drains should be inspected regularly in the first 24 hours after surgery. If haemorrhage is suspected, blood samples should be taken for a full blood count, coagulation profile and cross match. A large bore intravenous cannula should be sited
and fluid resuscitation commenced. If the source of bleeding is in doubt and the patient is stable, an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan may be required to determine the nature of the bleed (most commonly if a haematoma is suspected in the days following surgery). If the patient's cardiovascular system is unstable or compromised in any way (for example neck haematoma or bleeding tonsil) they should be taken back to the operating theatre immediately.

The treatment of haemorrhage is both to stop the bleeding and supportive. Supportive treatment includes oxygen and fluid resuscitation. It may require correction of coagulopathy. All patients will require close observation. Blood transfusion carries risks (acute haemolytic transfusion reaction, sensitisation, fluid overload, hyperkalaemia, transfusion-related lung injury and transmission of blood-borne infection). There is much published about what is the right transfusion trigger and how to balance the need for adequate tissue perfusion and the risks of transfusion. The decision about when to transfuse should be based on the individual patient; in general, however, the accepted transfusion trigger is $75 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ except in the presence of known or suspected coronary artery disease when a higher trigger is acceptable.

All hospitals should have a 'major haemorrhage protocol' in place. The consultant surgeon, anaesthetist and haematologist should all be involved early on in the care of unstable patients.

\section*{Summary box 20.5}

\section*{Postoperative bleeding}
- All hospitals should have a major haemorrhage protocol in place
- Need to transfuse blood in absence of continued bleeding in patients with haemoglobin $>75 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ should be weighed against the risks

\section*{Deep vein thrombosis}

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a well-known and, when complicated by pulmonary embolus, potentially fatal complication of surgery (Table 20.3). All hospitals must have a process for screening all surgical patients to identify those at risk and for implementing prophylactic measures. There is international agreement on risk and therapeutic options. Methods of prevention are guided by the risk score and include the use of compression stockings, calf pumps and pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin.

The symptoms and signs of DVT include calf pain, swelling, warmth, redness and engorged veins. However, most will show no physical signs. On palpation the muscle may be tender and there may be a positive Homans' sign (calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot), but this test is neither sensitive nor specific.

Duplex Doppler ultrasound and venography can be used to assess flow and the presence of a thrombosis. Other investigations include D-dimer. If a significant DVT is found (one that extends above the knee), treatment with parenteral

anticoagulation initially, followed by longer-term warfarin or new oral anticoagulant (refer to national guidance, e.g. NICE; see Further reading). In some patients with a large DVT, a caval filter may be required to decrease the possibility of pulmonary embolism.

\section*{Pulmonary embolus}

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is not usually an immediate complication, but can present in the early postoperative period. Thrombus can arise from DVT in the legs/pelvis, venae cavae or the right atrium. Signs and symptoms depend on the size of the embolus and may range from dyspnoea, cough, and pleuritic chest pain to sudden cardiovascular collapse. Diagnosis of PE begins with history (including risk factors and recent surgery) and physical examination (which may include signs of DVT). Investigations may include, depending on the presentation, ECG, chest radiograph, blood tests (arterial blood gas and d-dimer) and radiological tests (usually CT pulmonary angiography). If the presentation includes cardiovascular collapse, resuscitation will be needed. Thrombolysis can be considered with massive PE causing cardiovascular collapse, but this should include senior clinical opinion and would generally follow appropriate guidelines. The patient may need inotropes and admission to the intensive care unit. In less severe cases of PE, supportive measures include oxygen therapy and analgesia. After initial resuscitation, the patient will need anticoagulation, initially parenteral anticoagulation, followed by long-term oral anticoagulation (refer to national guidance, e.g. NICE; see Further reading). A vena cava filter may be needed if anticoagulation is not possible or if the patient has an embolism while anticoagulated (see Further reading).

\section*{Fever}

About $40 \%$ of patients develop pyrexia after major surgery; however, in most cases no cause is found. The inflammatory response to surgical trauma may manifest itself as fever, and so pyrexia does not necessarily imply sepsis. However, in all patients with a pyrexia, a focus of infection should be sought.

\footnotetext{
John Homans, 1877-1954, Professor of Clinical Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.
}

The causes of a raised temperature postoperatively include:
- atelectasis of the lung;
- superficial and deep wound infection;
- chest infection, urinary tract infection and thrombophlebitis;
- wound infection, anastomotic leakage, intracavitary collections and abscesses.

The possible causes of pyrexia of a non-infective origin include:
- DVT;
- transfusion reactions;
- wound haematomas;
- atelectasis;
- drug reactions.

Patients with a persistent pyrexia need a thorough review. Relevant investigations include full blood count, urine culture, sputum microscopy and blood cultures.

\section*{Summary box 20.6}

\section*{Fever}
- A very common problem postoperatively
- Consider infection in the lung, urine and wound

\section*{Wound dehiscence}

Wound dehiscence is disruption of any or all of the layers in a wound. Dehiscence may occur in up to $3 \%$ of abdominal wounds and is very distressing to the patient.

Wound dehiscence most commonly occurs from the fifth to the eighth postoperative day when the strength of the wound is at its weakest. It may herald an underlying abscess and usually presents with a serosanguinous discharge. The patient may have felt a popping sensation during straining or coughing. Most patients will need to return to the operating theatre for resuturing. In some patients it may be appropriate to leave the wound open and treat with dressings or vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) pumps.

\section*{Summary box 20.7}

\section*{Risk factors in wound dehiscence}

\section*{General}
- Malnourishment
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Renal failure
- Jaundice
- Sepsis
- Cancer
- Treatment with steroids

\section*{Local}
- Inadequate or poor closure of wound
- Poor local wound healing, e.g. because of infection, haematoma or seroma
- Increased intra-abdominal pressure, e.g. in postoperative patients suffering from chronic obstructive airway disease, during excessive coughing

\section*{Pressure sores}

Patients undergoing surgery for a prolonged period of time are vulnerable to the development of a pressure sore or to worsening of a pre-existing sore. Careful positioning and padding of the patient is standard practice intraoperatively to reduce risk. Pressure sores occur as a result of friction or persisting pressure on soft tissues. They particularly affect the pressure points of a recumbent patient, including the sacrum, greater trochanter and heels. Risk factors are poor nutritional status, dehydration and lack of mobility and nerve block anaesthesia technique. Early mobilisation prevents pressure sores. Highrisk patients may be nursed on an air mattress, which automatically relieves the pressure areas.

\section*{Summary box 20.8}

\section*{Preventing pressure sores}
- Recognise patients at risk
- Address nutritional status
- Keep patients mobile or regularly turned if bed-bound

\section*{SURGERY-SPECIFIC COMPLICATIONS Abdominal surgery}

The abdomen should be examined daily for excessive distension, tenderness or drainage from wounds or drain sites. In certain operations, such as those for intestinal obstruction, oesophageal and gastric procedures, a nasogastric tube may be required. It is of particular value in those patients suffering from ileus or a marked level of altered consciousness, who are therefore liable to aspirate.

\section*{Paralytic ileus}

Paralytic ileus may present with nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bowel distension and absence of flatus or bowel movements. Following laparotomy, gastrointestinal motility temporarily decreases. Treatment is usually supportive, with maintenance of adequate hydration and electrolyte levels. However, intestinal complications may present as prolonged ileus and so should be actively sought and treated.

Return of function of the intestine occurs in the following order: small bowel, large bowel and then stomach. This pattern allows the passage of faeces despite continuing lack of stomach emptying and, therefore, vomiting may continue even when the lower bowel has already started functioning normally.

\section*{Localised infection}

An abscess may present with persistent abdominal pain, focal tenderness and a spiking fever. The patient may have a prolonged ileus. If the abscess is deep-seated these symptoms may be absent. The patient will have a neutrophilic leucocytosis and may have positive blood cultures. An ultrasound or CT no of the abdomen should identify any suspicious collection - studocu
and will identify a subphrenic abscess, which can otherwise be difficult to find.

\section*{Summary box 20.9}

\section*{The main complications after abdominal surgery}
- Paralytic ileus
- Bleeding or abscess
- Anastomotic leakage

\section*{Orthopaedic surgery}

\section*{Neurovascular supply to the extremity}

Patients who have undergone extremity surgery, for example open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture, require regular neurovascular observations, both in recovery and on the ward (this will usually follow a local or national guideline). Moreover, if a tourniquet has been used, the restoration of the distal neurovascular supply should be established. Careful documentation of findings before and after surgery will allow comparison. Concern about the neurovascular status requires urgent and experienced surgical review and further management. Circumferential casts can be split and dressings cut down to skin.

\section*{Compartment syndrome}

Raised pressure in an osseofascial compartment can prevent adequate tissue perfusion and present after surgery. Patients with compartment syndrome complain of pain out of proportion to that expected, pain that is increasing and pain on passive stretching of the muscles in the affected compartment. Other symptoms that relate to pressure on nerves (paralysis, paraesthesia) and blood vessels (pallor and pulselesness) occur late. When suspected, prompt senior input is required. In terms of initial management, circumferential casts can be split, dressings cut down to skin and the limb elevated. Further management will require experienced judgement and may include compartment pressure monitoring and/or fasciotomies. Compartment syndrome is considered more extensively in Chapter 28.

\section*{Summary box 20.10}

\section*{Compartment syndrome symptoms and signs}
- Pain out of proportion to that expected
- Pain that is increasing
- Pain on passive stretching of the muscles in the affected compartment
- Paralysis, paraesthesia, pallor and pulselessness generally occur late

\section*{Neck surgery}

Patients having neck surgery, e.g. thyroid surgery, must be observed for accumulation of blood in the wound, which may cause rapid asphyxia. Another potential complication is
damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which can produce voice change.

\section*{Thoracic surgery}

Careful fluid management is important in patients undergoing a lobectomy or pneumonectomy as they are susceptible to fluid overload in the first 24-48 hours postoperatively. Chest drains require regular review. If the fluid in a chest drain swings then the drain has been correctly inserted into the pleural cavity. If the chest drain continues to bubble then a bronchopleural fistula probably exists. A haemothorax or pleural effusion will reveal itself as a prolonged loss of blood or fluid, respectively, into the drain. Cardiac patients require continuous ECG monitoring postoperatively.

\section*{Neurosurgery}

Postoperatively the patient should be kept under close observation. A rise in intracranial pressure may be signalled by a deterioration in the state of consciousness, as well as by neurological signs. Some patients may have an intracranial monitoring device to allow for more sensitive monitoring.

\section*{Vascular surgery}

The patency of grafts and anastomoses, for example femoropopliteal bypasses and abdominal aneurysmal, needs to be checked by regular clinical assessment of the limbs and by Doppler ultrasound in the postoperative phase.

\section*{Plastic surgery}

The viability of flaps is crucial and the perfusion needs to be monitored regularly. The blood supply may be compromised by position, dressings or collection of fluids or blood beneath the flap.

\section*{Urology}

Catheter patency must be checked regularly following urological surgery. In patients who have undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), continuous bladder irrigation may be used. More generalised complications can occur, for example transurethral resection syndrome, and are discussed further in the appropriate section.

\section*{GENERAL POSTOPERATIVE PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT}

When considering postoperative problems, the importance of pain control and fluid management should be appreciated, and the reader is directed to Chapters 18 and 19.

\section*{Nausea and vomiting}

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are unpleasant for patients, can delay recovery and prolong length of stay.

They can lead to more serious complications including aspiration pneumonia, precipitation of bleeding and dehiscence of wounds by dislodging the clots and bursting suture lines. In neurosurgical patients PONV may precipitate raised intracranial pressure with disastrous effects.

Risk factors for PONV include female gender, nonsmoking, and a history of PONV, motion sickness or migraine. Use of volatile anaesthetic agents, opioids and nitrous oxide add to the risk. Duration and type of surgery also affect the incidence of PONV.

The risk of PONV can be estimated by using validated risk scores such as the Apfel (Table 20.4) or Koivuranta scores and appropriate preoperative strategies applied to high-risk individuals.

Treatment of PONV includes adequate treatment of pain, anxiety, hypotension and dehydration. Antiemetics can be administered both prophylactically and for treatment. A multimodal pharmacological approach, using drugs that work at different sites, such as HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron), steroids (e.g. dexamethasone), phenothiazines (e.g. prochlorperazine) and antihistamines (e.g. cyclizine), is the most effective.

\hline 2 & 39 \\
\hline 3 & 61 \\
\hline 4 & 78 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Hypothermia and shivering}

Anaesthesia induces loss of thermoregulatory control. Exposure of skin and organs to a cold operating environment, antiseptic skin preparation (that cools by evaporation), and the infusion of cold intravenous fluids all lead to hypothermia. This in turn can lead to shivering, with imbalance of oxygen supply and demand (risking cardiac morbidity), a hypocoagulable state and immune function impairment, with the possibility of wound infection, dehiscence and anastomotic breakdown. It is now expected that temperature is monitored intraoperatively and the incidence of postoperative hypothermia has decreased significantly as a consequence. Active warming devices should be used to treat hypothermia as appropriate.

This document is available on

\section*{Drains}

Drains are used to prevent accumulation of blood, serosanguinous or purulent fluid or to allow the early diagnosis of a leaking surgical anastomosis. In clean surgery, such as joint replacement, blood collected in drains can be transfused back into the patient provided that an adequate volume is collected rapidly and that a specifically-designed drain and filter system is used.

The use of surgical drains has decreased in recent years as the evidence for their benefits has been questioned. Complications of drains include trauma to surrounding tissues and infection. The quantity and character of drain fluid can be used to identify an abdominal complication such as fluid leakage (e.g. bile or pancreatic fluid) or bleeding.

Drains should be removed as soon as possible and certainly once the drainage has stopped or become less than $25 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day .

\section*{Wound care}

Within hours of the wound being surgically closed, the dead space fills up with an inflammatory exudate. Within 48 hours of closure a layer of epidermal cells from the wound edge bridges the gap. Consequently, sterile dressings applied in theatre should not be removed before this time.

Wounds should be inspected only if there is a concern about their condition or the dressing needs changing. Inspection of the wound should be performed under sterile conditions. If the wound looks inflamed, a wound swab can be taken and sent for microbiological examination, but this can be unreliable. Infected wounds and haematomata may need treatment with antibiotics or even wound washout. If a surgical procedure is performed it gives an opportunity to collect samples for bacteriology (before any antibiotics, if the patient's general condition allows), to excise dead tissue and to control any bleeding. Depending on location, the wound may require packing if it is contaminated or if non-viable tissue remains. The dressing should then be changed regularly until the wound is clean.

Skin sutures or clips are usually removed between 6 and 10 days after surgery. The period can be shorter in wounds on the face or neck, and are left longer if the incision has been closed under tension. Wound healing is delayed in patients who are malnourished, or have vitamin A and C deficiency. Steroids also inhibit the adequate healing of wounds as they inhibit protein synthesis and fibroblast proliferation. Poor-ly-controlled diabetes delays wound healing and increases the risk of infection at the surgical site.

\section*{ENHANCED RECOVERY}

Enhanced recovery is an approach to the perioperative care of patients undergoing surgery. It is designed to speed clinical recovery of the patient and reduce both the cost and the length of stay of the patient in the hospital. It is achieved by optimising the health of the patient before surgery through prehabilitation and then delivering evidence-based best care in the perioperative period.

Postoperative strategies advocated by enhanced recovery protocols include:
- Early planned physiotherapy and mobilisation.
- Early oral hydration and nourishment.
- Opioid-sparing analgesia regimens that include the use of regional blocks, regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol.
- Discharge planning is started before the patient is admitted to hospital and involves support from stoma care nurses, physiotherapists and other community care workers.
Early mobilisation is encouraged to reduce the risks of DVT, urinary retention, atelectasis, pressure sores and faecal impaction. Telephone follow-up is carried out to make sure that the patient is recovering well.

\section*{DISCHARGE OF PATIENTS}

Patients discharged home need a 'discharge letter' detailing the postoperative plan. The discharge letter should include details of the final diagnosis, the treatment and any complications that may have occurred. There should be advice for referring the patient back to hospital and indications for readmission if specific problems do occur. The general practitioner (GP) should be informed of the subsequent care plan, including follow-up, physiotherapy and other support needed. Pathology results should be included if available, and the basis of these in the subsequent care plan should be described along with the prognosis if appropriate.

\section*{Summary box 20.11}

\section*{Follow-up in clinic}

Patients should only be reviewed in clinic when a key decision on management needs to be made. The findings and the care plan agreed with the patient at the clinic appointment should be included in a letter to the patient's GP, as well as in a clear entry in the notes or electronic patient record. This should include advice on how to recognise the onset of complications and what to do if there is concern. Patients should be discharged from clinic as soon as their GP or they themselves, can manage their care.

\section*{Day case surgery}

\section*{Learning objectives}

To understand:
- The concept of the day surgery pathway
- The importance of patient selection and preoperative assessment
- Basic principles of anaesthesia for day surgery
- The spectrum of surgical procedures suitable for day surgery
- Postoperative management and discharge arrangements

\section*{DAY SURGERY}

The delivery of a surgical procedure on a day case basis offers advantages in providing significant benefits for both patient and healthcare providers. The removal of an overnight stay causes less disruption to the patient's domestic and social situation, and provides significant financial savings to the hospital. In resource-rich countries, day surgery is now an integral component of healthcare delivery, while in resourcepoor countries, day surgery is increasing in popularity due to patient preference and healthcare reorganisation.

Day surgery is defined as the admission and discharge of a patient for a specific procedure within the 12-hour working day. Where a patient requires an overnight admission, then the term '23 hour stay' should be used.

Day surgery is a patient pathway, not a surgical procedure, and extends from first patient contact to final discharge (Figure 21.1). Success in day surgery requires each component of the pathway to be safe and efficient and to be performed in sequence. Unplanned overnight admissions are minimised by ensuring that:
- the patient is informed and fit for the procedure;
- the procedure itself is achievable as a day case;

\section*{Summary box 21.1}

\section*{Definition of terms used in ambulatory surgery}
- Outpatient surgery: not admitted to a ward facility
- Procedure room surgery: surgery not requiring full sterile theatre facilities
- Day or same-day surgery: admitted and discharged within the 12-hour day
- Overnight stay: 23-hour admission with early morning discharge
- Short-stay surgery: admission of up to 72 hours
- the procedure is scheduled early on the operating list to allow safe recovery and discharge; and
- the home environment can support a postoperative ambulatory patient.

consultation premises, allows patients ready access to 'high street' care. The downside is that the practice is usually limited to procedures under local anaesthesia, with or without conscious sedation. The use of general anaesthesia is limited, as this requires additional equipment and personnel, and raises safety issues in an isolated facility.

\section*{Stand-alone day surgery facilities}

Where day case procedures are performed in isolated facilities, either on a remote site, or in the campus of the parent hospital, the workload is free from interference by emergency admissions. The spectrum of procedures performed is, by necessity, limited to those under local or regional anaesthesia or minor to intermediate procedures under general anaesthesia, to avoid unplanned overnight admissions and the requirement to transfer the patient to the parent hospital, which may be some distance away.

\section*{Self-contained integrated day surgery facilities}

Though structurally part of a hospital, self-contained units have their own reception, ward, theatre and recovery areas and are functionally separate from the main hospital and potential disruption by emergency admissions. The back-up facilities of the main hospital are readily available if required, so these units can undertake a full spectrum of day surgery procedures. The growing demand for day surgery can lead to capacity issues and there may be duplication of costly capital equipment where procedures are performed on both a day case and inpatient basis.

\section*{Integrated day and short-stay surgery facilities}

This type of unit allows complete flexibility in the delivery of day and short-stay surgery, with the ability to embark on more challenging day surgery procedures or consider day surgery on less fit patients. The availability of overnight beds has its downside: the preassessment team may convert fewer patients from overnight stay to day surgery by adopting the easy option of keeping the more challenging patient in overnight. Moreover, the availability of beds rather than day surgery recovery trolleys, puts these ambulatory beds at risk from emergency admissions.

While dedicated day surgery facilities are welcome, regardless of model, they are not mandatory for the successful delivery of the day surgery pathway. Success does require a dedicated day ward facility, where the staff can concentrate on the timely recovery and discharge of the day case patient. In mixed wards of day cases and inpatients, nursing and medical staff naturally prioritise the care of the less fit patient, and it may be easier to keep the day case patient overnight, rather than ensuring an optimum discharge process.

\section*{SELECTION CRITERIA Medical criteria}

\section*{Age}

There is no upper age limit. The physiological health of the patient is a superior determinant of day surgery success.

- Social: a responsible adult carer must be available for the first 24 hours, for the elderly and patients at risk of covert bleeding home conditions need to be suitable ability to contact hospital in an emergency
- Surgical: operations up to 2 hours
recognised day surgery procedures
ability to eat and drink within a reasonable timescale

\section*{Comorbidity}

Day surgery units traditionally use the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Classification, which is a crude evaluation of chronic health (Table 21.1). Stand-alone units often confine their criteria to ASA 1 and 2 patients, while ASA 3 patients are more suitable for hospital-integrated units. Patients with significant respiratory or cardiovascular disease should be reviewed by an anaesthetist before being accepted for day surgery (see Chapter 17). Many patients who are fit but hypertensive are incorrectly excluded from day surgery. There is no evidence to support cancellation when blood pressure is below $180 / 110 \mathrm{mmHg}$.

\section*{Diabetes}

The incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Patients with well-controlled Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are good candidates for the well-managed day surgery pathway. Control can be assessed by measuring their HBA1c, with a level of below $8.5 \%$ indicating good control. Diabetes is associated with potentially severe comorbidities, such as renal disease,

\begin{table}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
autonomic neuropathy and cardiovascular disease, and so these patients must be assessed carefully preoperatively and managed by an experienced team. It is important to have protocols for the care of diabetic patients that have been agreed with the local diabetic team and to involve them in the care of more complex patients. Success depends on ensuring these patients return to normal eating and drinking and managing their own diabetes as quickly as possible in the postoperative period.

Traditional care, with placing the patient first on the list and providing them with instructions on management of their medication preoperatively, works well. Those on morning lists can simply miss their morning dose of oral hypoglycaemic medication or insulin, though they must be instructed to bring their medications with them and to manage any hypoglycaemia as they would normally. Those on afternoon lists and those patients who are on more complex therapy, such as continuous subcutaneous infusions, can still be managed with input from the anaesthetic or diabetic team.

\section*{Epilepsy}

A diagnosis of epilepsy does not contraindicate day surgery. Patients who have well-controlled epilepsy should be managed as normal patients, though it is important to ensure that their regular medication is not omitted in the preoperative period. Patients who are on medication but remain poorly controlled need careful review and discussion with their medical and anaesthetic teams. However, if they have suitable home support and the proposed surgery does not put them at risk, then they too are suitable for day surgery.

\section*{Obesity}

The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres ( $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) and obesity is defined as a BMI $>30$ (Figure 21.2). Traditional guidelines are conservative about obesity due to fears of intra- and postoperative complications. Although there is an increased incidence of non-serious respiratory complications intraoperatively and in the immediate postoperative recovery

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
period, the course of these patients is otherwise uneventful. They should however, be managed by experienced medical and nursing staff. Hypertension, congestive cardiac failure and sleep apnoea are all more common in patients with morbid obesity, but in selected and optimised patients, a BMI up to 40 for surface procedures and 38 for laparoscopic procedures are acceptable and achievable in advanced units. Patients established on nasal positive airway pressure for obstructive sleep apnoea can be managed successfully.

\section*{Anticoagulants}

Patients are generally on oral anticoagulants due to atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism or because they have a metal heart valve. It is therefore important to review these patients carefully before deciding to discontinue their anticoagulant for their operation. When it is felt that surgery will require its discontinuation, this should be discussed with their cardiologist and the risks involved explained to the patient.

\section*{Social criteria}

Safe and comfortable discharge home requires the patient to be accompanied by a responsible and physically able adult. A journey time to home of 1 hour or less is advocated, but the comfort of the journey rather than the time involved is more relevant. Home circumstances require appropriate toilet facilities and the means of contacting the hospital should complications occur.

\section*{Surgical criteria}

Patients undergoing procedures up to 2 hours in duration can safely undergo day surgery with modern anaesthetic techniques. The degree of surgical trauma is an important determinant of success, with entry to abdominal and thoracic cavities confined to minimal access techniques. Whatever the procedure, the main requirement is that there is suitable control of pain and the ability to drink and eat in a reasonable timescale. With day surgery now applicable to more major and prolonged procedures, patients should undergo a venous thromboembolism risk assessment and have prophylaxis provided if required.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT}

The evaluation and optimisation of a patient's fitness for surgery is known as preoperative assessment (see Chapter 17) and is best performed by a specialist nursing team with support from an anaesthetist with an interest in day surgery. All elective surgical patients should be initially regarded as suitable for day surgery until proved otherwise. The assessment should be performed early in the pathway to allow time to optimise health problems before surgery The consultation consists of a basic health screen to include the measurement of BMI, blood pressure and an assessment of past medical history with current medication recorded. Appropriate investigations are performed to ensure the patient is fit for surgery. The patient and/or their carer should be given verbal and written information regarding admission, operation and discharge.

\section*{PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Scheduling}

With dedicated day surgery lists, major procedures should be scheduled early on morning lists to allow maximum recovery time. When the list is in the afternoon, the allocation of local or regional anaesthetic cases later in the day helps reduce unplanned overnight admissions. When mixed lists of day and inpatient cases are planned, then day cases are scheduled first. The mixing of day and complex inpatient cases is not advisable. The complex case may be inappropriately delayed if the day case is scheduled first and, conversely, if the day case patient is scheduled later, there is a risk of cancellation or unplanned overnight admission for the day case.

\section*{Anaesthesia and analgesia}

Successful day surgery anaesthesia requires a multimodal approach to analgesia, while ensuring patients are given optimal dosages of anaesthetic agent (see Chapter 18). The agents used matter less than the skill of the person providing anaesthesia.

Multimodal analgesia starts in the preoperative period and unless contraindicated, patients should receive full oral doses of paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen. Intraoperative anaesthesia can be maintained by any of the traditional inhalational agents. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) techniques using propofol are also popular and offer the advantage of reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The use of intraoperative analgesia will depend on the procedure being performed. When available, the anaesthetist should use short-acting opioids (fentanyl, alfentanil). Careful use of these agents can minimise the incidence of PONV. Where the choice is limited to morphine, this should be used in small doses ( $<0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) to minimise sedation and PONV. Wherever possible, a long-acting local anaesthetic agent such as bupivacaine should be injected into wounds by the surgeon.

Pain levels should be routinely assessed in the postoperative recovery area. Further doses of paracetamol, fentanyl or low doses of morphine can be used to ensure that patients are comfortable prior to return to the ward.

\section*{Postoperative complications}

The range of postoperative complications is no different from inpatient surgery. However, the fact that the patient is discharged home within a few hours of surgery requires proactive monitoring in the immediate postoperative period.

\section*{Summary box 21.4}

\section*{Optimal analgesia and anaesthesia}
- Multimodal analgesia with paracetamol and NSAIDs (if not contraindicated) should be given preoperatively
- Use long-acting local anaesthetic infiltration of the surgical wound
- Careful dosing of inhalational or intravenous agents should be used to maintain anaesthesia
- Avoid long-acting opiates such as morphine, to reduce the incidence of sedation and PONV

Reactionary haemorrhage is uncommon but requires careful consideration following tonsillectomy and laparoscopic procedures. Reactionary haemorrhage following tonsillectomy occurs within the first 6 hours and these patients should be monitored for this period. The danger in laparoscopic surgery is covert haemorrhage, especially in young fit patients who can lose over $15 \%$ of their blood volume before showing any cardiovascular signs of hypovolaemia (tachycardia and hypotension). These patients require a high index of suspicion as the first signs can often be as subtle as slow recovery and mobilisation or uncontrolled abdominal pain. When problems do occur, there should be clear escalation policies to ensure the patient is reviewed by the surgical team as soon as possible. Nausea and vomiting is not uncommon and should be managed actively to maximise successful discharge (Figure 21.3).

\section*{ELECTIVE DAY SURGERY}

For some surgical specialties, over $90 \%$ of their elective workload can be achieved in day surgery. As a result, teaching and training now routinely occurs on day surgery lists but requires structure and close supervision. As the spectrum of procedures has increased and become more challenging, many surgeons have increased their involvement in day surgery. This is important because safe and efficient day surgery demands the competence and skill of an experienced surgeon. Some surgeons have concerns regarding patient safety after discharge. The risk of postoperative haemorrhage occurring once the patient has returned home is often stated as a major reason to keep the patient in hospital overnight, especially where the abdominal or thoracic cavities have been entered. Reactionary haemorrhage commonly occurs in the first $4-6$ hours after surgery, but the patient is unlikely to have been discharged home within this time period. It may be caused by slippage of a ligature or displacement of blood clot, precipitated by a rise in blood pressure, coughing or increased mobility. Postoperative monitoring of vital signs should alert the recovery team to any underlying bleed. Secondary haemorrhage is defined as occurring at least 24 hours after surgery but usually presents several days later, as it is due to postoperative infection. Thus, even if the patient had stayed overnight, these postoperative bleeds are still likely to occur once the patient has returned home.

\section*{Summary box 21.5}

\section*{Surgical haemorrhage}
- Reactionary: occurs $4-6$ hours after surgery and is caused by ligature slippage, clot displacement or cessation of vasospasm after mobilisation or coughing
- Secondary: occurs more than 24 hours after surgery and is due to infection eroding a vessel

Good surgical technique requires minimal tissue traction or tension and good haemostasis. In day surgery these attributes are even more important. The number and variety of surgical procedures performed on a day case basis is increasing year on year. Volume procedures in general surgery where the British Association of Day Surgery considers at least $40 \%$ of procedures can be performed on a day case basis, are shown in Table 21.2.

\section*{EMERGENCY DAY SURGERY}

Many emergency surgical procedures are minor and nonlife threatening, and traditionally have been considered low priority for surgical intervention. The prioritisation of more urgent cases to restricted emergency theatre slots may result in extensive delays for minor cases, with unnecessary bed stays and preoperative starvation. Many of these cases, such as incision and drainage of abscesses, can be safely discharged home after their initial evaluation in the emergency department. They are provided with adequate analgesia and scheduled to return to the hospital at an appointed time the following day, suitably starved for their operation. This allows same-day discharge for minor emergency procedures.

If performed early in the day, the surgery rather than the pathway, may be defined as 'day case'. Some patients may, by chance, achieve a true day case pathway with admission, operation and discharge in the same day, provided they are admitted early in the day, there is no diagnostic delay and a theatre slot is available. Others may only achieve day case surgery, but not a day case pathway, if there has been diagnostic or clinical delay on admission (Figure 21.4). Common procedures suitable for the emergency day surgery pathways are shown in Table 21.3.

The success of an emergency day surgery pathway is dependent on the identification of unallocated theatre slots. These may be planned where there is reasonable predictability of emergency cases or may arise on elective lists, either day case or inpatient, due to patient cancellations. Emergency facilities may also be underutilised when there are delays in getting the more seriously ill patient to surgery. There is therefore an opportunity, providing staff are available, to utilise the empty theatre for a minor case before bringing the optimised sick

patient to operation. This allows the ambulatory patient to be discharged on the day of surgery, provided discharge protocols are in place. This balance between clinical and managerial priority can be difficult to achieve without surgical experience, but forethought can permit a positive outcome for the quality of emergency patient care and the managerial requirement to shorten duration of stay.

When designing an emergency day surgery pathway, traditional day surgery selection criteria are ignored, with clinical judgement used to determine whether patients are appropriate for day surgery. The only absolute contraindications are systemic sepsis, unstable diabetes, major comorbidities and if parenteral, rather than oral, analgesia is required.

\section*{DISCHARGE}

The assessment of when a patient is fit for discharge is best performed by trained day surgery nurses using strict discharge criteria (Table 21.4). While postoperative review by the surgical team is encouraged, the discharge should not be delayed by failure of their timely attendance. A suitable supply of analgesics for the management of pain should be provided. Paracetamol, NSAIDs and codeine form the basis of the drugs available in many countries.
