\section*{CARE OF COLOSTOMIES}
- Definition
- Indications
- Types of colostomies
- Care of colostomies
- Complications of colostomy

\section*{Definition}
-Colostomy refers to surgical bringing out, through the abdominal wall, a portion of the large intestine to carry out stool.

\section*{Indications for colostomies}
1. Decompress an obstructed colon
2. Evacuation of stool when the distal colon or rectum is removed like in colorectal cancer
3.To divert the fecal stream in preparation for resection of an inflammatory, obstructive, or perforated lesion or following traumatic injury;
4. To protect a distal anastomosis following resection.

\section*{Types of colostomy}

\section*{Classification by function}

Temporary colostomies - created to divert stool from injured or diseased portions of the large intestine, allowing rest and healing before closure of colostomy and anastomosis of the colon is done Permanent colostomies are performed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest distance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.

\section*{Classification by nature of stoma}

\section*{Loop colostomy}
-This colostomy is created by bringing a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal wall.
-The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by a plastic rod slipped beneath it.
-An incision is made in the loop to allow the passage of stool through the loop colostomy.
-The supporting rod is removed approximately $7-10$ days after surgery, when healing has occurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from retracting into the abdomen.
A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured.

\section*{Terminal or end colostomy (Hartman's colostomy)}
-The colon is divided and the proximal end is brought out (functional part) while the distal end closed and left intra abdominal (dysfunctional part)
-The functioning end of the intestine (the section of bowel that remains connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the surface of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.
-The surface of the stoma is actually the lining of the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink.
-An end colostomy is usually a permanent ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another pathological condition

\section*{Double barred colostomy}
(Also Divided colostomy /Paul-Mickulicz colostomy )
Involves the creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall by exteriorizing both ends of the divided colon.
The proximal stoma is the functional end that is connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will drain stool. The distal stoma, connected to the rectum and also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts of mucus material. This is most often a temporary colostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be later closed.

\section*{Care of colostomies}

\section*{Immediate post operative}

\section*{General}
1.Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes until patient is awake then 30 minutes until patient gets to the ward then every 4 hours
2. IV fluids (NS and Dextrose) at least 500 mls every 6 hours
3.Continue prophylactic antibiotics
4. Analgesia- $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of pethidine then introduce IM NSAIDs as decrease pethidine dose.
5.Keep patient nil per oral
6. Keep input and output chart thus keep NG tube, and urethral catheter.

\section*{Stoma management.}
1.The patient is instructed how to support the operative site during deep breathing and coughing
2. The stoma is observed for color and amount of wound drainage. Initially, the colostomy will drain bloody mucus.
3. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously until the patient's diet is can gradually be resumed, beginning with liquids with the return of bowel sounds.
Usually within 72 hours, passage of gas and stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool is liquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to take solid foods.
The patient is usually out of bed in 8-24 hours after surgery and discharged in 2-4 days.
4. Counseling

All patients should be counseled about colostomy before surgery and counseling and education continued after the surgery both within the ward and even after discharge.
The counseling should also include the spouse and the family members to ensure support of the patient and to continue his usual lifestyle.
5.Education

During the hospital stay, the patient and his or her caregivers will be educated on how to care for the colostomy.
i)-Determination of appropriate pouching supplies
ii)Proper application of the pouch on the stoma to avoid leakage
ii)Schedule of how often to change the pouch
iii) Regular assessment and meticulous care of the skin.
iv) diet changes
v)counseling on regular activities and work

\section*{Continued care of colostomy after discharge}

\section*{1.Skin care}
-Frequent Cleaning of the area around the stoma with soap and water and adequate drying.
-The skin around the stoma may be protected by application of water repellants as zinc oxide and Vaseline.
-To make sure that the colostomy bag fits snugly around the stoma to avoid leakage to the surrounding skin

\section*{2.Control of odor}
-Well managed colostomy should not have disturbing odor. This should be achieved by.
-Prompt changing of the colostomy bags to avoid filling with effluent and leakage.
-Avoid diet with spices causes' bad odor.
-Cleaning the skin around the stoma
-General hygiene of the body
-Use of deodorants incase all this fails.

\section*{3.Diet}
-Patient is encouraged to take a balanced diet and to increase his fluid intake because of loss of water through the effluents.
-Avoid spices in food which give the effluents bad smell.
-Avoid food with lots of roughage as vegetables which increases the amounts of effluent discharged.

\section*{4.Lifestyle}

As much as possible, Patient should continue with the normal lifestyle.
-Should continue with his work or employment as normal.
-Should continue to have normal sexual function without hindrance
However, few modifications
Bathing - You can shower or bathe with the pouch on or off. Swimming - Use waterproof tape around the stoma
Lifting - Heavy lifting should be avoided and if previous job involved this then should change job.

\section*{5.Colostomy bags}

Patient should be able to get regular supply of affordable colostomy bags for continued use.

\section*{6.Social support}

Patient should be supported by the family thus the importance counseling spouse and family.
Should be linked to colostomy society and associations for social support and continued education

\section*{7.Know when to consult a doctor}
-Change in stoma color, swelling or bleeding.
-Skin irritation, redness, or rash around stoma.
-Change in color, amount or appearance of stool.
-Vomiting, abdominal swelling, or cramping with fever

\section*{Complications of colostomy}

\section*{1.Gangrene of stomal tissue}

Caused by inadequate blood supply, this complication is usually visible 12-24 hours after the operation and may require additional surgery.

\section*{2.Stomal Stenosis}
(Narrowing at the opening of the stoma). Often associated with infection around the stoma or scarring. Mild stenosis can be removed under local anesthesia. Severe stenosis may require surgery for reshaping the stoma.

\section*{3.Stomal Retraction}
-Stoma is flush with the abdomen surface or has moved below it. Caused by insufficient stomal length, this complication may be managed by use of special pouching supplies.
-Elective revision of the stoma is also an option.

\section*{4.Stomal Prolapse}
-Stoma increases length above the surface of the abdomen).
-Most often results from an overly large opening in the abdominal wall or inadequate fixation of the bowel to the abdominal wall.
-Surgical correction is required when blood supply is compromised.

\section*{5.Parastomal hernia}
-Bowel causing bulge in the abdominal wall next to the stoma. This is due to placement of the stoma where the abdominal wall is weak or creation of an overly large opening in the abdominal wall. The use of an ostomy support belt and special pouching supplies may be adequate. If severe, the defect in the abdominal wall should be repaired and the stoma moved to another location

\section*{6. Parastomal abscess formation Others}
7.Infection/sepsis
8. Skin irritation around the stoma
9.Feccal impaction
10.Diarrhhea.
11.Psychological

NB Location of colostomy Consider:
-The contour of abdomen
-The belt line should be placed away from it.
-Away from bony prominences
-Placed in the descending colon-if possible. Semi-solid discharge reduce the water loss

\section*{CHEST TRAUMA}

Broadly chest trauma could be:
a) Mechanical-high or low velocity
b) Chemical
c) Thermal

Mechanical trauma may be further classified as:
1) Penetrating
2) Non-penetrating-Blunt and Crush injuries
3) Inhalational injury
4) Aspiration of foreign body

2 major forces within the chest which lead to injury are the compression and distraction injuries.
Compression results in destruction of vascular structures, haemorrhage, edema and impairment of function. Distraction injuries usually result in shearing forces which destroy the integrity of intrathoracic viscera.

\section*{Penetrating injuries}
-61\% of chest trauma admissions. Result in parenchymal damage related to track of missile or stabbing, implant used and velocity. Solid structures as the heart and major great vessels suffer more injuries
-Most lethal complication is haemorrhage
-Often associated with abdominal injury

\section*{Non-penetrating injuries}

Blunt (acceleration and deceleration injuries)
Sudden reduction in speed as in RTA. Aortic rapture as a cause of death on spot is not uncommon.
Care should be taken while dealing with the very young or the elderly.

\section*{Crush injuries}

Occurs where the elastic limit of the chest wall and its limit have been exceeded. Patients usually have AP deformity Majority have flail chests, hemothorax or pneumothorax Most has pulmonary contusion. Injuries of the heart ,Aorta, liver ,spleen ,kidney are common
In "Traumatic asphyxia" syndrome-constrictive forces are applied in wide area for as little as $2-5$ minutes
Crush injuries have high mortality.

2.Acidosis -Anaerobic respiration
3.Low Cardiac output-Hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock

\section*{CASUALTY MANAGEMENT}
1.PRIMARY SURVEY
2.SECONDARY SURVEY
3.INVESTIGATION
4.TRANSFER TO WARD OR THEATRE

\section*{PRIMARY SURVEY}

The majority of chest injuries are confined to the thoracic cage. These consist of rib fractures with underlying pulmonary contusion, haemothorax, or pneumothorax.
Can be treated effectively simply by chest drain insertion and fluid restriction

Early deaths caused by in chest injuries are usually caused by:
Conditions that would impair breathing
1) Airway obstruction
2) Open pneumothorax
3) Massive hemothorax
4) Tension pneumothorax
5) Flail chest
6) Cardiac tamponade

Later deaths are due to
1) Respiratory failure
2) Sepsis
3) Unrecognized injuries

The basis for successful management of thoracic trauma is effective cardio pulmonary resuscitation followed by early detection and treatment of life-threatening injuries.

\section*{INITIAL MANAGEMENT-Primary Survey \\ $1^{\text {st }}$ is $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$ of resuscitation plus vital signs}
1. Airway and cervical spine.

Maintain cervical spine immobilization in all unconscious or symptomatic (neck pain or tenderness) patients.
i)-Inspect mouth remove debris by sweeping through
ii)Chin lift/jaw thrust (tongue is attached to the jaw) and always airway in tongue falling back
To perform a chin lift, place two fingers under the mandible and gently lift upward to bring the chin anterior. During this manoeuvre, be careful not to hyperextend the neck. Care should be given to neck stabilization, if appropriate.
The jaw thrust is performed by manually elevating the angles of the mandible to obtain the same effect.
iii) Secure airway by Guedel airway/oropharyngeal airway. Insert the oral airway into the mouth behind the tongue; it is usually inserted upside down until the palate is encountered and is then rotated 180 degrees.
iv) Intubations; keep the neck immobilized in neutral position. Use sedation and short acting neuromuscular blockade if necessary. If not possible to intubate:
v) Tracheostomy
vi) Cricothyrotomy

\section*{2. Breathing: Oxygenation and ventilation.}

Check for the six conditions that would impair breathing.

\section*{1 Inspect (LOOK)}

Inspection of respiratory rate and evidence of respiratory distress is essential. Are any of the following present?
-Use of accessory muscles,flaring of alae nasae
-Cyanosis-lips
-Chest movements(chest excursions)
-Penetrating injury in the chest or Sucking chest wounds
-Presence of flail chest
2 Palpate (FEEL)
-Tracheal shift
-Broken ribs
-Subcutaneous emphysema.
-Chest expansion
3.Percusion

Percussion is useful for diagnosis of haemothorax(dull) and pneumothorax (hyperesonant)
4. Auscultate (LISTEN)
-Pneumothorax/hemothorax (decreased breath sounds on site of injury)
-Detection of abnormal sounds in the chest.
Immediate intervention
1. Tension pneumothorax-put through a needle then chest tube insertion
2. Massive pneumothorax-chest tubes insertion
3. Sucking wounds-strap the open wound then chest tube insertion.
4. Flail chest-positive pressure ventilation
5. Cardiac tamponade

\section*{Resuscitation action}
-Insert an intercostal drainage tube as a matter of priority, and before chest X-ray if respiratory distress exists, to drain the chest pleura of air and blood
-When indications for intubation exist but the trachea cannot be intubated, consider using a laryngeal mask airway or direct access via a cricothyroidotomy.
If available, maintain the patient on oxygen until complete stabilization is achieved
-If a you suspect a tension pneumothorax, introduce a large-bore needle into the pleural cavity through the second intercostal space, mid clavicular line, to decompress the tension and allow time for the placement of an intercostal tube
- If intubation in one or two attempts is not possible, a cricothyroidotomy should be considered a priority

\section*{3. Circulation and arrest of bleeding.}
"Shock" is defined as inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. In the trauma patient, it is most often due to haemorrhage and hypovolaemia.
The diagnosis of shock is based on clinical findings:
- Hypotension
- Hypothermia
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnoea
- Pallor
- Cold extremities
- Decreased capillary refill
- Decreased urine production

Haemorrhagic (hypovolaemic)
-Shock is due to acute loss of blood or fluids. The amount of blood loss after trauma is often poorly assessed and in blunt trauma is usually underestimated. Remember:
-Large volumes of blood may be hidden in the abdominal and pleural cavity.
-Femoral shaft fracture may lose up to 1.0-1.5 litres of blood -Pelvic fracture often loses in excess of 2 litres of blood.

Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate heart function. This may result from
-Myocardial contusion (bruising)
-Cardiac tamponade
-Tension pneumothorax (preventing blood returning to heart)
- Penetrating wound of the heart
-Myocardial infarction.
Assessment of the jugular venous pressure is essential in these circumstances and an ECG should be recorded, if available.

Neurogenic shock
Is due to the loss of sympathetic tone, usually resulting from spinal cord injury. The classical presentation is hypotension without reflex tachycardia or skin vasoconstriction.

Septic shock
Is rare in the early phase of trauma, but is a common cause of late death (via multi-organ failure) in the weeks following injury. It is most commonly seen in penetrating abdominal injury and burns patients.

\section*{Resusciation}
-First priority is to stop any obvious bleeding by Sub fascial gauze pack placement and Manual compression on the proximal artery. Carefully applied compressive dressing of the entire injured limb can be done. Then
-Vascular access 2 large bore size 16 on the 2-basilic veins -Fluids: infuse $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ initially 2 L to run as fast as possible through 2 large bore IV lines in the antecubital fossa then reassess
-Resuscitate to goal of mean arterial pressure (MAP) $>90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ to maintain a presumptive cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) $>60$ mmHg
-Urinary catheter insertion and monitor the input and output chart at least $30-50 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour or $0.5 / \mathrm{kg} /$ hour of urine flow
-Monitor by vital signs, pallor, sweating, anxiety, skin warmth clammy, input and output
-Blood transfusion must be considered when the patient has persistent haemodynamic instability despite fluid (colloid/crystalloid) infusion.
If type specific or cross matched blood is not available, use group O negative packed red blood cells. Transfusion should, however, be seriously considered if the haemoglobin level is less than 7 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and the patient is still bleeding.

\section*{4.Neurological dysfunction}

Establish preliminary level of consciousness by AVPU
A -Awake, V -Verbal response, P- Painful response
U -Unresponsive and any focal neurologic deficits.

\section*{5.Exposure and environmental modification}

Cover patient in case of shock and shivering

\section*{ANATOMICAL CLASSIFICATION OF CHEST INJURIES}

\section*{A.Skin and Subcutaneous tissue}

Cuts and bruises
Superficial cuts-surgical toilet and suturing, analgesia and tetanus toxoid

\section*{B.RIBS}

Usually fracture. Types of rib fracture include:
1) Simple fracture
2) Compound fracture
3) Multiple fractures-many ribs or rib plus sternal fracture. May or may not cause Flail chest
4) Flail chest

\section*{1.Simple fractures}

Main management is to provide analgesia, reduce pain and allow ventilatory movements.
Analgesia may be systemic or local
Systemic analgesia
i. Paracetamol
ii. NSAIDS
iii. Opiods
iv. Combination

\section*{Local analgesia}
-Intercostal block usually administered as a mixture of short acting (cylocaine or Procaine) and long acting(Bupivacine) local anaesthetic plus a steroid
-Inject the intercostals space involved plus two above and two below because of the overlap of the sensory innervation
-Usually is cumbersome to do this for a single fracture, more reasonable for multiple rib fractures.
-Injection is done below the rib and along the medial border of the scapula.

\section*{Risks}
-Bleeding
-Penetration of pleura-pneumothorax and hemothorax

\section*{2.Multiple fractures}
-Firm strapping of the thorax in a hemi-thorax fashion.
-May give systemic analgesia or local analgesia as above. Firm strapping not done in older patients because may interfere with respiration.

\section*{3.Flail chest/segment}

A portion of the chest wall becomes isolated by multiple fractures moves in and out with inspiration and expiration with severe reduction in ventilatory efficiency.
Is dangerous because of the paradoxical movement of the flail segment to the rest of the ribs cage and thus the area of the lung under it is not ventilated and may collapse.
Atelectasis, hypercapnia, hypoxia, accumulation of secretions, and ineffective cough occur.

\section*{Management options}

Less severe cases, intercostal nerve block or continuous epidural analgesia may be adequate treatment otherwise
i)Hemi-thorax strapping

Pack with gauze and Strap 3-4 ribs in hemi thorax fashion ii)Positive pressure ventilation

Sedate patient and do the positive pressure ventilation iii) Tracheostomy

This reduces the work of breathing by reduction of dead space and thus reduces the paradoxical movement of the flail segment. Give humidified oxygen.
iv) Thoracotomy and ORIF

Drill two holes in each rib and hold using wire.

\section*{C.PLEURA}

Pleural injuries also involves lung parenchyma

\section*{Hemothorax}

Classified according to the amount of blood:
1.Minimal, 350 mL
2.Moderate, 350-1500 mL;
3. Massive, $\quad>1500 \mathrm{~mL}$
-Rate of bleeding after evacuation of the hemothorax even more important. If air is also present, the condition is called hemopneumothorax
-Hemothorax should be suspected with penetrating or severe blunt thoracic injury.
-Clinically-Reduced chest movements, dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds
-CXR (upright or semiupright,) should be promptly obtained.
-Tube thoracostomy using one or two large-bore pleural catheters should be performed promptly
In $85 \%$ of cases, tube thoracostomy and circulatory support are the only treatment required.
-If bleeding is persistent, as noted by continued output from the chest tubes, it is more likely to be from a systemic (eg, intercostal) rather than a pulmonary artery.
In most cases, the chest wall is the source of hemorrhage, but the lung, heart, pericardium, and great vessels account for 15-25\%. Indication for thoracotomy
1.Initial drainage of fluid $>1500 \mathrm{~L}$ and still draining
2.Drainage rate $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for 3 or more hours

\section*{Pneumothorax}

Types
1.Open pneumothorax
2.Closed
3.Tension
-Lacerations of the lung or chest wall following penetrating or blunt chest trauma. Prompt occlusive dressing should be done for open pneumothorax before tube insertion.
-Hyperinflation (eg, blast injuries, diving accidents) can also rupture the lungs. After penetrating injury, $80 \%$ of patients with pneumothorax also have blood in the pleural cavity.
-Tension pneumothorax develops when a flap-valve leak allows air to enter the pleural space but prevents its escape; intrapleural pressure rises causing total collapse of the lung and a shift of the mediastinal viscera to the opposite side.
-It must be relieved immediately to avoid interference with ventilation in the opposite lung and impairment of cardiac function.
NB For any impaled or penetrating objects still on the chest should left in situ until the patient is in theatre.
Bandage and stabilize the object to avoid further injury.

\section*{Indications for thoracotomy}
1.Cardiac tamponade
2.Initial drain through the chest tube $>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ and continuing
3.Hourly drain $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for more than 3 hours
2.Electro cardiac dissociation
3.Intraabdomial bleeding in excess indicating a thoracoabdominal injury
4. Persistent pneumothorax even with adequate drainage suggesting injury to trachea or bronchi. Confirmed by bronchoscopy

5 Diaphragmatic injury
6.Large Chest wall defects
7.High velocity injuries
8.Impaled objects on the chest in situ
9.Trans mediastinal injury
9.Delayed indications Clotted hemothorax, Lung abscess or fistula formation.
10. Failure of resuscitation measures

\section*{Trachea and Bronchus:}
-Blunt tracheobronchial injuries are often due to compression of the airway between the sternum and the vertebral column in decelerating injury
-Patients present with
- Pneumothorax or hemopneumothorax
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Cervicofacial emphysema
- Pneumo mediastinum
- Hemoptysis.
-Suspected with massive air leak or when the lung does not readily re-expand after chest tube placement
-In penetrating injuries of the trachea or main bronchi, there is usually massive hemorrhage and hemoptysis.
-Systemic air embolism resulting in cardiopulmonary arrest may occur if a bronchovenous fistula is present.
-Diagnosis may require tracheobronchoscopy. Primary repair is indicated for tracheobronchial lacerations.

\section*{Lung Injury}
-Pulmonary contusion due to blunt or penetrating injuries.
-Alveolar rupture with fluid transudation and extravasation of blood are early findings. These enter alveolar spaces and bronchi and produce localized airway obstruction and atelectasis.
-Increased mucous secretions and overzealous intravenous fluid therapy may combine to produce copious secretions (wet lung) and further atelectasis.
-Blood oxygenation and pH drop and $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ rises.
-Treatment is often delayed because clinical and x-ray findings may not appear until 12-24 hours after injury.
-The clinical findings are loose, copious, blood-tinged secretions, chest pain, restlessness, apprehensiveness, and labored respirations.Eventually, dyspnea, cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia develop.
- X-ray changes consist of patchy parenchymal opacification or diffuse linear peribronchial densities that may progress to diffuse opacification ("white-out").
- Mechanical ventilatory support permits adequate alveolar ventilation with oxygen.
-Most lung lacerations are caused by penetrating injuries, and hemopneumothorax is usually present. Tube thoracostomy is indicated to evacuate pleural air or blood and to monitor continuing leak

\section*{Heart and Pericardium:}
-The injury varies from localized contusion to cardiac rupture. -Early clinical findings include friction rubs, chest pain, tachycardia, murmurs, dysrhythmias, or signs of low cardiac output.
-ECGs show nonspecific ST and T wave changes. Serial tracings should be obtained, since abnormalities s may not appear for 24 hours.
-Hemopericardium may occur without tamponade and can be treated by pericardiocentesis. Tamponade in blunt cardiac trauma is often due to myocardial rupture or coronary artery laceration.
-Cardiac Tamponade produces
- Distended neck veins
- Muffled heart sounds
- Shock
- Cyanosis.
-Immediate thoracotomy and control of the injury are indicated.
-Treatment of injuries to the valves, papillary muscles, and septum must be individualized; when tolerated, delayed repair is usually recommended.
-Pericardial lacerations from stab wounds tend to seal and cause tamponade, whereas gunshot wounds leave a sufficient pericardial opening for drainage.
-Gunshot wounds produce more extensive myocardial damage multiple perforations, and massive bleeding into the pleural space.
Hemothorax, shock, and exsanguination occur in nearly all cases of cardiac gunshot wounds.
-Treatment of penetrating cardiac injuries has gradually changed from initial management by pericardiocentesis to prompt thoracotomy and pericardial decompression.
-Pericardiocentesis is reserved for selected cases when the diagnosis is uncertain or in preparation for thoracotomy. The myocardial laceration is closed with sutures

\section*{Diaphragm}
-Penetrating injuries of the diaphragm outnumber blunt diaphragmatic injuries by at least $4: 1$.
-Wounds of the diaphragm must not be overlooked, because they rarely heal spontaneously and because herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest can occur either immediately or years after the injuries.
-More common on the left hemi diaphragm as the right is protected by the liver.
Presentation
- Abdominal tenderness
- Dyspnea
- shoulder pain
- unilateral breath sounds
-CXR it is entirely normal in about $20 \%$ of cases. The most common finding is ipsilateral hemothorax.
-Once the diagnosis is made, immediate thoracotomy and the diaphragm sutured with heavy nonabsorbable sutures. -In delayed diagnosis, when repair can not be done without tension Marlex mesh or a pericardial flap are employed.
-Because pulmonary complications are frequent; diaphragmatic injury should be approached through the abdomen when there is no other injury requiring thoracotomy.

If any aspects of the $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{E}$ deteriorates re-evaluate the patient for stabilization

\section*{Esophagus:}
-Esophagus is well protected, and perforation from external penetrating trauma is relatively infrequent. Blunt injuries are very rare.
-Symptom of esophageal perforation is chest pain; fever develops within hours in most patients.
- Regurgitation of blood
- Hoarseness
- Dysphagia
- Respiratory distress may also be present.
-Physical findings include
- Shock
- Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum
- Local tenderness
- Subcutaneous emphysema,
- Hamman's sign (ie, pericardial or mediastinal "crunch" synchronous with cardiac sounds)
- Leukocytosis occurs soon after injury.
-A nasogastric tube should be passed to evacuate gastric contents. If recognized within 24-48 hours of injury, the esophageal perforation should be closed and pleural drainage instituted with large-bore catheters.
-Illness and death are due topneumothoraxor mediastinum , mediastinal and pleural infection.

\section*{Thoracic Duct:}
-Chylothorax and chylopericardium are rare complications of trauma but, when they occur, are difficult to manage.
-Penetrating injuries of the neck, thorax, or upper abdomen can injure the thoracic duct or its major tributaries. The occurrence of chylothorax after a trivial injury should lead one to suspect underlying cancer.
-Chest tube drainage should be instituted if the effusion recurs. Intravenous hyperalimentation with no oral intake may be effective in persistent leaks.
-Three or 4 weeks of conservative treatment usually are curative.
- If daily chyle loss exceeds 1500 mL for 5 successive days or persists after 2-3 weeks of conservative treatment, the thoracic duct should be ligated via a right thoracotomy.

\section*{The sternum}
-These fractures are usually transverse and may overlap, causing agonizing pain.
- Internal fixation is required to correct deformity and relieve the discomfort of instability.
-This is performed by making an incision in the xiphisternum and passing a Steinmann pin up through the medulla of both sternum fragments from underneath.

\section*{B.SECONDARY SURVEY}

This is a second examination from the head to the toe while still monitoring the vital signs.

\section*{UNDERWATER SEAL DRAINAGE (U.W.S.D) \\ Indications}
1) Fluid in the pleural space
2) Greater than $20 \%$ pneumothorax
3) Tension pneumothorax

\section*{Components of UWSD system}
1.Chest tube
2.Bottle for fluid collection
3.Connecting tubes
4.Sealing fluid
5.-/+Suction mechanism

\section*{Types of collecting Bottles}
1.Single Tube Edwards Bottle system
2.Separate Reservoir and Seal
3.Three bottle system with controlled suction
4.Commercial system

\section*{Characteristics of good chest tube}
1.Be transparent
2.Be flexible
3.Radio-opaque line in tube
4. Last tube hole goes through the radio-opaque line.
5.Must be graduated

\section*{Principles of under water seal drainage}
1. Drainage of fluid influenced by gravity.
2. Drainage of air influenced by the pressure difference of the chest cavity and the UWSD system.
3.The return of air/fluid is prevented by the under water seal
3. The rate of fluid drainage is influenced level of seal under water

\section*{Insertion of a chest tube}
-Explain to the patient his condition and the need to have a chest tube inserted
-Collect materials needed
UWSD system, sterilized drapes., Scalpel, Local anaesthetic, antiseptics, curved artery forceps, surgical gloves

\section*{Procedure}
1. Have patient lie lateral position with the side with pathology facing upwards.
2. Expose the whole chest wall and identify the intercostal space of insertion.
Usually in the $4^{\text {th }}$ intercostal space just above the $5^{\text {th }}$ rib in triangle of safety (bordered anteriorly by anterior axillary line, posteriorly by mid axillary line and inferiorly by the upper border of fifth rib.
3. Clean the area with antiseptic and drape the patient leaving the identified intercostals space.
4. Infiltrate the skin, muscle and pleura with $1 \%$ lidocaine at the appropriate intercostal space.
Aspirate fluid from the chest cavity to confirm your diagnosis
5. Using a sterile scapel a small transverse incision just above the rib to avoid damaging the vessels under the lower part of the rib
6. Using a pair of large, curved artery forceps, do blunt dissection penetrating the pleura and enlarging the opening.
7. Using the same forceps to grasp the chest tube at its tip(clamped distally ) and introduce it into the chest.
8. Advance the chest tube Posteriorly into the costovertebral angle.(hemothorax) or towards the apex for pneumothorax.
9. Close the incision with interrupted skin sutures, using one stitch to anchor the tube.
Leave an additional suture untied adjacent to the tube for closing the wound after the tube is removed.
10. Apply dressing around the chest tube.
11. Remove the clamp and Connect the tube to the underwaterseal drainage system and mark the initial level of fluid in the drainage bottle.
12. Do a check x-ray to know the position of the chest tube

\section*{Management of chest tube in situ.}
1. Monitor the vital signs of the patient with his respiratory pattern.
2. Observe the UWSD system for the initial level, the nature of the drainage, the movement of the water seal up and down with respiration, the volume of initial drainage.
3. Observe for bubbling of air-continuous air bubbles in both expiration and inspiration may be sign of deep chest tube into the airway or the presence of brochopleural fistula
4. Secure the UWSD system in clearly lit area and protect it -in ward using a stool to avoid accidents.
5. Always keep the UWSD system at a level below the patient to facilitate drainage of fluid by gravity.
6.Chest drains should never be clamped except when changing drain bottles, whenever the chest drain bottle has to lifted above the level of the patients chest
7. Educate patient on the need to keep the chest tube secure and avoid turning or movements that would kink or dislodge the chest tube. Encourage the patient to sit upright, take deep breaths and slight coughs to encourage drainage of fluid or gases from the pleural space
Chest physiotherapy is equally important Establish original level of fluid in drainage bottle before reconnecting as this provides a baseline for future measurements. The fluid level should be clearly marked on the bottle either in the area provided or using a strip of tape
8. Continuously monitor the amount and nature of drainage-
$>1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of hemothorax and continuing or $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ for moe than 3 hrs are indications for thoracotomty.
9. Change the bottle every 24 hours noting the nature and volume of drainage which is noted as part of the output in the 24 hr input/output chart.
10. Use of prophylactic antibiotics especially in penetrating chest injuries-contaminated wounds.
Also give analgesics appropriate.
11. Inspect the wound at point of chest tube insertion for exudates, discharges or signs infection and change dressing every 3 days.
12. Palpate area of chest wall around the chest tube for any crepitation-subcutaneuous emphysema.
13. Do regular respiratory examination for any features of distress, chest expansion, air entry bilaterally.
14.Do regular CXR to monitor the drainage of the hemothorax or pneumothorax and thus chest expansion

\section*{When to remove the chest tube}

When it has done its work of draining the hemothorax or pneumothorax.
This is assessed both
A)Clinically by respiratory examination
B) Radiologically by taking CXR
C)Drainage from the chest tube $50-100 \mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$

\section*{Removal of chest tube.}
1. Remove the dressing and clean the area with antiseptic.
2. Remove the suture securing the chest tube and ask the patient to deeply breath in and do valsalva manouvre.
3. Remove the chest tube while the assistant ties the purse string stitch around the chest opening.

\section*{Complications of chest tubes.}

There is no organ in the thoracic or abdominal cavity that has not been pierced by a chest drain."

\section*{Acute complications (Poor technique)}
1. Haemothorax, usually from laceration of intercostal vessel (may require thoracotomy)
2. Lung laceration (pleural adhesions not broken down)
3. Diaphragm / Abdominal cavity penetration (placed too low)
4. Stomach / colon injury (diaphragmatic hernia not recognised)
5. Tube placed subcutaneously (not in thoracic cavity)
5. Tube placed too far (pain)
6. Tube falls out (not secured)

\section*{Late complications}
1.Blocked tube (clot, lung)
2.Retained haemothorax
3.Empyema or sepsis
5.Pneumothorax after removal (poor technique)

\section*{CLEFT LIP AND PALATE}

Are part of Orofacial clefts / defect anomalies
- cleft lip [CL]
- cleft lip and palate [CLP]
- cleft palate [CP] alone
- median, lateral [transversal], oblique facial clefts

\section*{Prevalenve}
are among the most common congenital anomalies.
Approximately 1 case of orofacial cleft occurs in every 500-550 births.
From a genetic standpoint, cleft lip with or without cleft palate is distinct from isolated cleft palate.
-Cleft lip more common in males, the cleft palate in females.
-Although both can occur in a single family, particularly in association with certain syndromes, this pattern is unusual. Race
There is racial variation in the incidence of facial clefting. Among Asians, whites, and blacks, the incidence is $1.61,0.9$, and 0.31 , respectively, per 1000 live births.

\section*{Clinical Findings}
-A cleft lip may be unilateral or bilateral and complete or incomplete.
- It may occur with a cleft of the entire palate or just the primary (anterior and gingival ridge) or secondary (posterior) palate.
- An isolated cleft palate can involve only the soft palate or both the soft and hard palates.
-It can be a V-shaped or wide horseshoe cleft.
-A cleft associated with micrognathia and glossoptosis (a tongue that falls back and causes respiratory or feeding problems) is called Pierre Robin syndrome.
-Among individuals with facial clefts-more commonly those with isolated cleft palate-there is an increased incidence of other congenital abnormalities.
- The incidence of congenital heart disease, for example, is between $1 \%$ and $2 \%$ in liveborn infants, but among those with Pierre Robin syndrome it can be as high as $15 \%$.
-Associated abnormalities should be identified in the period immediately after birth and before surgery

\section*{Problems}

Problems associated with facial clefts include
1.early feeding difficulties, which may be severe; 2.recurrent serous otitis media associated with fluctuating hearing and language delays
3. speech problems, including hypernasality and articulation errors
4.dental and orthodontic complications.

Long-term management should ideally be through a multidisciplinary cleft palate clinic.
Gaining weight and preventing aspiration and ear infections are the most important parts of caring for neonates with a cleft during their first days and weeks of life.

\section*{Mangement}

Below is the most common treatment protocol presently used in most cleft treatment centers:

\section*{Newborn -}

Diagnostic examination
general counseling of parents
feeding instructions
palatal obturator (if necessary)
genetic evaluation and specification of diagnosis
empiric risk of recurrence of cleft calculated;

\section*{Age 3 months}
-Repair of CL (and placement of ventilation tubes)

\section*{Age 6 months}
- Presurgical orthodontics, if necessary; first speech evaluation Age 9 months
-Speech therapy begins

\section*{Age 9-12 months}
-Repair of CP (placement of ventilation tubes if not done at the time of CL repair)

\section*{Age 1-7 years}
-Orthodontic treatment

\section*{Age 7-8 years}
-Alveolar bone graft
-Older than 8 years - Orthodontic treatment continues Other surgical procedures can be performed in patients with severe clefts as necessary

\section*{Surgical therapy:}
-Undoubtedly, closure of the CL is the first major procedure that tremendously changes children's future development and ability to thrive.
-Variations occur in timing of the first lip surgery; however, the most usual time occurs at approximately age 3 months.
-Pediatricians used to strictly follow a rule of "three 10s" as a necessary requirement for identifying the child's status as suitable for surgery (ie, $10 \mathrm{lb}, 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of hemoglobin, and age 10 wk ). -Although pediatricians are presently much more flexible, and some surgeons may well justify a neonatal lip closure, considering the rule of three 10s is still very useful.

Team for the multidisciplinary treatment of a child with an orofacial cleft includes the following specialists:
- Pediatrician
- Nurse practitioner
- Plastic surgeon
- Pediatric dentist
- Otolaryngologist

Breastfeeding an infant with a cleft
- In a case of an isolated CL, the infant typically does not experience feeding problems beyond learning how to "latch on" to the nipple at the beginning of the feeding. Infants with CP must squeeze the milk out of the nipple by compressing the nipple between the tongue and whatever portion of the palate that remains.
- Massaging the breast and applying hot packs on the breast 20 minutes before nursing usually helps.
- The mother should apply pressure to the areola with her fingers to help the engorged nipple protrude. She should hold the infant in a semi-upright, straddle, or football position. She should support the breast by holding it between her thumb and middle finger, making sure that the infant's lower lip is turned out and the tongue is under the nipple.
- If the infant cannot hold onto the nipple any more, the mother can collect the remaining milk using an electrical or manual breast pump or by squeezing the breast with both hands and can finish the feeding with collected milk in a bottle.
- The mother should increase her fluid intake (drink lots of water).

Feeding breast milk with a bottle
- Particularly for infants with bilateral CLP, breastfeeding is not possible.
- The mother can use a breast pump (an electric pump ensures the highest level of success). Then, she can feed the baby with a bottle (see below).

Other recommendations
- More upright or seated positions prevent the milk from leaking to the nose and causing the infant to choke.
- Advise the mother to stop feeding and allow the infant to cough or sneeze for a few seconds when nasal regurgitation occurs. A palatal obturator may be used.

\section*{COLORECTAL CANCER}

\section*{Introduction}
-Ninety percent of colorectal cancers occur in patients over 50 years of age.
-Adenomas precede carcinomas. -Early cancers are asymptomatic. -Fecal occult blood testing can detect preneoplastic lesions and early cancers.
-Microcytic anemia in the elderly suggests the presence of colorectal cancer.- Hematochezia may be a sign of colorectal cancer (especially of the distal colon and rectum).
Weight loss and obstructive symptoms are late findings.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{History-symptoms}
1.Per rectal Bleeding

This is the most common symptom of rectal cancer and occurs in $60 \%$ of patients.
Higher tumors may present with occult bleeding. The bleeding mixed with stool usually no heavy bleeding.May be mucoid.
Occult bleeding: This is detected on screening fecal occult blood test (FOBT)
2.Change in bowel habit

Often, it occurs in the form of diarrhea, particularly if the tumor has a large villous component.
But may also present with alternating constipation and diarrhea.
3.Incomplete evacuation

Tumors located low in the rectum can cause a feeling of incomplete evacuation and tenesmus.
4.Abdominal pain

Partial large-bowel obstruction may cause colicky abdominal pain and bloating
5.Back pain

Usually is a late sign caused by a tumor invading or compressing nerve trunks.
6.Urinary symptoms

May occur if the tumor is invading or compressing the bladder or prostate.
7. Malaise, weight loss, night sweat, anorexia

Non specific constitutional signs of malignancy.
8.Bowel obstruction features

Complete obstruction of the large bowel is rare.
9. Other presentations include emergencies such as peritonitis from perforation (3\%) or jaundice, which may occur with liver metastases (<1\%).

\section*{Predisposing factors}
1.Diet-fatty diet Omega-3 monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-6 monounsaturated fatty acids also appeared to be less carcinogenic than unsaturated or polyunsaturated fats
-The ingestion of a high-fiber diet appears to be protective against colorectal cancer. Fiber causes the formation of a soft, bulky stool that dilutes out carcinogens; it also decreases colonic transit time, allowing less time for harmful substances to contact the mucosa.
-Increased dietary intake of calcium appears to have a protective effect on colorectal mucosa by binding with bile acids and fatty acids.
-Other dietary components, such as selenium, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E, may have protective effects by scavenging free-oxygen radicals in the colon
2. Alcohol: Daily alcohol drinkers experience a 2 -fold increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma.

\section*{3.Cigarette smoking}

\section*{4.Pelvic radiation}

\section*{5.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)}
a) Ulcerative colitis The incidence of malignancy increases with duration.
Evaluate patients for dysplastic changes with annual colonoscopy. Dysplasia is a precursor of cancer and, when present, the risk of cancer is $30 \%$.
b) Crohn disease The incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with Crohn disease is 4-20 times greater than that of the general population.
Cancers often develop in areas of strictures and in defunctionalized segments of intestine. In patients with perianal Crohn disease, malignancy often presents in fistulous tracts.

\section*{6.Genetic predispositions,}
a)-Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) HNPCC is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome that occurs because of defective mismatch repair genes located on chromosomes 2,3 , and 7.
b)-Familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP)

The defect is in the $A P C$ gene, which is located on chromosome 5 at locus q21. FAP is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome that results in the development of more than 100 adenomatous polyps
The disease process causes the formation of hundreds of intestinal polyps, osteomas of the bone, desmoid tumors, and, occasionally, brain tumors.
If left untreated, colorectal cancer develops in nearly 100\% of these patients by age 40 years.

\section*{Gross morphology}
1.Cauliflower is the least malignant form
2. The Annular type tends to give rise to obstructive symptoms, whereas the others more commonly will present with bleeding.
3. Ulcerative type.
4. Tubular type

\section*{Histology:}

The microscopic appearance of colonic adenocarcinomas may be that of well-differentiated or poorly differentiated glandular structures.
-Normal topological architecture of colonic epithelium in terms of a crypt-villous axis is lost.
- Anorectal lesions have a squamous morphology

\section*{Spread;}
a)Local spread
b) Lymphatic spread $-90 \%$;

N 1 - Nodes in the immediate vicinity of the bowel wall (Epicolic)
N 2 - Nodes arranged along the; (Paracolic)
Ileocolic, Right colic ,Midcolic,Left colic ,Sigmoid arteries
N3 - Apical nodes around the superior \& inferior mesenteric vessels where they arise from the abdominal aorta → Left supraclavicular nodes (Virchow's node)
c)Haematogenous - $10 \%$ - Metastasises first to the Liver via portal system, Lung, Bone
d)Transcoelomic
e)Iatrogenic

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1.CBC-Anaemia (microcytic)
2. LFT and U/E/C
3. (CEA Screen

Liver function tests usually are part of the preoperative workup; these test results often are normal even with metastases to the liver.
Carcinoembryonic antigen test: Perform a CEA test in all patients with rectal cancer. A baseline level is obtained before surgery and a follow-up level is obtained after surgery. This may alert to a possible recurrence if a previously normalized CEA begins to rise in the postoperative period. A CEA higher than $100 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ usually indicates metastatic disease and warrants a thorough investigation

\section*{Imaging}

\section*{1.Proctoscopy}

\section*{1.Proctosigmoidoscopy/Colonoscopy AND Biopsy}

Allows direct visualization of the lesion, and provides an estimation of the size of the lesion and degree of obstruction. Colonoscopy is better for higher lesions
-This procedure is used to obtain biopsies of the lesion, assess ulceration, and determine the degree of fixation.
- In addition, it gives an accurate measurement of the distance of the lesion from the dentate line; critical in deciding which operation is appropriate

\section*{2.Double contrast barium enema}

For location, size \& relations- Blow in air to stretch out the ruggae in the colon n addition to the barium enema
-Constant irregular filling defect
-'Apple core' Appearance i.e. A short, irregular stenosis with sharp shoulders at each end

\section*{3.Endorectal ultrasound}
-Invaluable in assessing depth of invasion of rectal by visualization of the layers of the wall
-cancers detection of lymph node involvement
-Also used in determination of local recurrence when used after surgery.
-Endorectal surface-coil MRI: An alternative to ERUS, this technique is touted as equally or more accurate than ERUS in lymph node staging.

\section*{4.Metastatic workup}
a) Abdominal pelvic ultrasound-metastasis to the bladder cervix or other abdominal organs
b) Chest radiograph: rule out pulmonary metastases
c) CT scan: This study generally is used to determine the presence or absence of metastases lesions in the liver, adrenals, ovaries, lymph nodes, and other organs
-Depth of penetration of the primary rectal tumor.and nodal involvement. .
d)MRI actually is the most sensitive test for determining the presence of liver metastases and often is used if liver resection is considered

\section*{Low anterior resection}

Generally is performed for lesions in the middle and upper third of the rectum and, occasionally, for lesions in the lower third. Tumor lesion should be more than 8 cm from the dentate line.

Operation entails full mobilization of the rectum, sigmoid colon, and, usually, the splenic flexure. Mobilization of the rectum requires a technique called total mesorectal excision (TME) A circular stapling device is used to create the anastomosis. A double-stapled technique is performed.
Coloanal anastomosis Very distal rectal cancers that are located just above the sphincters occasionally can be resected without the need for a permanent colostomy.
Closure of the temporary colostomy done 6-8 weeks.

\section*{5).Abdominal perineal resection Surgery}

Abdominal perineal resection (APR) is performed in patients with lower-third rectal cancers who cannot undergo a sphinctersparing procedure.
This includes patients with complex involvement of the sphincters, preexisting significant sphincter dysfunction, or pelvic fixation, and sometimes is a matter of patient preference A 2-team approach often is used, with the patient in modified lithotomy position. One team mobilizes the colon and rectum, transects the colon proximally, and creates an end-sigmoid colostomy.
The perineal team begins by closing the anus with a purse-string suture and making a generous elliptical incision.
The dissection plane continues posteriorly, anterior to the coccyx to the level of the levator ani muscles.
Care must be taken to avoid the prostatic capsule in the male and the vagina in the female (unless posterior vaginectomy was planned.
A closed-suction drain is left in place, and the perineal wound is closed in layers by using absorbable sutures.

\section*{1)Hemicolectomies:}
i)Right - Caecal tumours, ascending or proximal transverse colon (Right extended Hemicolectomy)
ii)Left - Distal transverse colon or descending colon (Left extended Hemicolectomy)

\section*{2)Transverse colon}

When there is no obstruction, excision of the transverse colon \& the 2 flexures together with the transverse mesocolon \& the greater omentum, followed by end-end anastomosis

\section*{3) Sigmoid colectomy}

Tumours of the sigmoid colon - Done at the pelvic brim with a 5 cm clean margin above pelvic diaphragm for anastomosis. Modes of surgery

\section*{Anorectal cancers}
6) Posterior sagittal anorectoplasy (PSAR) - Small tumour in rectum

\section*{Staging}

\section*{Dukes staging}

Originally, system divided tumor classification into 3 stages, as follows:
-Those limited to the rectal wall (Dukes A)
-Those that extended through the rectal wall into extrarectal tissue (Dukes B)
-Those with metastases to regional lymph nodes (Dukes C)
Modification by Astler -Coller into the following.
Stage A- limited to rectal mucosa
Stage B1- Extend into muscularis propia

B2- Extend through muscularis propia
Stage C1- B1 plus nodal involvement
C2- B2 plus nodal involvement
Stage D Was added to indicate distant metastasis

\section*{TNM classification for cancer of the colon and rectum (AJCC)}

Primary tumor (T)
TX - Primary tumor cannot be assessed or depth of penetration not specified
T0 - No evidence of primary tumor
Tis - Carcinoma in situ (mucosal); intraepithelial or invasion of the submucosa
T1 - Tumor invades lamina propia
T2 - Tumor invades muscularis propria
T3 - Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the subserosa or into nonperitonealized pericolic or perirectal tissue T4 - Tumor perforates the visceral peritoneum or directly invades other organs or structures

\section*{Regional lymph nodes (N)}

NX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis
N1 - Metastasis in 1-3 pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes
N2 - Metastasis in 4 or more pericolic or perirectal lymph nodes
N3 - Metastasis in any lymph node along the course of a named vascular trunk

\section*{Distant metastasis (M)}

MX - Presence of metastasis cannot be assessed
M0 - No distant metastasis
M1 - Distant metastasis

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Treatment of polyps}
- $10 \%$ of polyps larger than 1 cm contain carcinoma.
-Not all polyps are amenable to colonoscopic excision.
-Sessile polyps that contain invasive carcinoma require resection.
-Pedunculated, cancer-containing polyps may be removed colonoscopically if they meet certain established criteria. If not met, surgical resection
(1) The carcinoma must be well or moderately differentiated with no venous or lymphatic invasion.
(2) The carcinoma must not invade further than the stalk of the polyp, and the margins of resection must not contain tumor

\section*{7) Inoperable tumour with obstructive features}
-Ascending colon - A bypass using an ileocolic anastomosis
-Left colon-Upper part of left colon - A transverse colostomy
-Pelvic colon - Left iliac fossa colostomy

\section*{Radiotherapy}

Preoperative radiation therapy
Advantages of this treatment include tumor down-staging; an increase in resectability, possibly with a sphincter-sparing procedure; and a decrease in tumor viability, which may decrease the risk of local recurrence. The disadvantages include delaying surgery, loss of accurate surgical staging, and increased postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.
Post operative Radiotherapy
Postoperative RT decreases the rate of local recurrence when compared to surgery alone

\section*{Chemotherapy}
-Drugs that have been used include 5-flourouracil with immunomodulant levamisole.
-Irinotecan and methyl-CCNU

\section*{Prevention}

\section*{Screening:}

The process of malignant transformation from adenoma to carcinoma takes several years.
The purpose of screening is to eradicate potential cancers while they are still in the benign stage of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
Screening also increases the likelihood of discovering existing cancers while they are still in the early stage
High-risk screening
People at increased risk for colorectal cancer include those with affected first-degree relatives, those with a family history of FAP or HNPCC, and those with a personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or IBD.
Colonoscopy: Allows full visualization of the colon and excision and biopsy of any lesions
Double-contrast barium enema: usually in combination with flexible sigmoidoscopy. Lesions detected by this method require colonoscopy for biopsy or excision.
Combined FOBT(feccal oral blood Tests) and flexible sigmoidoscopy

\section*{Prognosis}

Overall 5-year survival rates for rectal cancer are as follows:
Stage I - 72\%
Stage II - 54\%
Stage III - 39\%
Stage IV - 7\%
Fifty percent of patients develop recurrence, which may be local, distant, or both.
Factors that influence the development of recurrence include surgeon variability, grade and stage of the primary tumor, location of the primary tumor, and ability to obtain negative margins

\section*{Prognosis}

Poor prognostic factors following surgery;
1. Pre-op ↑ CEA ( $>5 n g / m L$ )
2. Tumour penetration through the bowel wall
3. Tumour adherence to adjacent organs
4. Perforation
5. Tumour spread to regional LN
6. Number of regional LN involved
7. Venous invasion
8. Poorly differentiated histology
9. Aneuploidy
10. Specific chromosomal deletion (e.g. allelic loss on chromosome 18q)

\section*{CONGENITAL HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS}

\section*{Introduction}

A progressive stenosis of the pyloric canal occurring in infancy.

\section*{Etiology}

The cause is not known.
-positive family history

\section*{Incidence}

The incidence is 1-8:1000 births, with a 4:1 male predominance

\section*{Onset}

Onset usually at 3-4 weeks of age.

\section*{Clinical presentation}
1) Intermittent, non-bilious, projectile vomiting of increasing frequency and severity
2) Initially hungry and feeds avidly, later weakness due to electrolyte imbalances
3) Epigastric distention
4) Visible gastric peristalsis, from left to right
5) An olive-sized mass can often be felt on deep palpation in the right upper abdomen, especially after the child has vomited.
6) Jaundice, occasional
7) Late signs: dehydration, weight loss
8) Constipation

\section*{Laboratory Findings:}
1. There is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with potassium depletion.
2. Hemoconcentration is reflected by elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit values.
3. Elevated unconjugated bilirubin occurs in $2-5 \%$ of cases.

\section*{Imaging}
1. Ultrasonography (1st choice) shows a hypoechoic ring with a hyperdense center. Thickness of circular muscle is greater than 4 mm in pyloric stenosis.
2. An upper gastrointestinal series reveals delay in gastric emptying and an elongated narrowed pyloric channel with a double tract of barium. The enlarged pyloric muscle causes characteristic semilunar impressions on the gastric antrum

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
1. In esophageal stenosis or achalasia, the vomitus contains no gastric contents, and metabolic alkalosis is rare.
2. With annular pancreas, malrotation, volvulus, and lesions causing small bowel obstruction, the vomitus is bilious.
3. The absence of virilization and hyperkalemia generally rules out congenital adrenal hyperplasia with adrenal insufficiency.Pylorospasm during barium x-ray may cause delay in gastric emptying, but the elongated narrow pyloric canal is not seen and no mass is palpable.
Others-Antral webs or diaphragms, duplications, cysts.

\section*{Management}

Pyloro-myotomy-Ramstedt surgery

Is the treatment of choice and consists of incision down to the mucosa along the pyloric length.
Prior to surgery, it is imperative to correct dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities

\section*{CRANIOPHARYNGIOMA}

Other names Rathke pouch tumor, suprasellar cyst, pituitary epidermoid tumor, ameloblastoma pituitary adamantinom

\section*{Definition}

Are histologically benign tumors that are found in the sella tursica and are composed of squamous epithelial cells.

\section*{Origin}

The origin of these tumors is presumed to be from rests of embryonic tissue located in Rathke pouch, an embryonic structure that later forms the anterior pituitary gland.

\section*{Age}

These tumors may appear clinically at any age and constitute 6 to $10 \%$ of all intracranial tumors in children. Although craniopharyngiomas usually occur in the suprasellar region they may extend superiorly into the third ventricle, or inferiorly along the base of the brain.

Usual course - progressive.

\section*{Morbidity}

Although histologically benign, the clinical behavior of this tumour and its proximity to the optic chiasm, carotid arteries, third cranial nerve, and pituitary stalk, make this a difficult tumor to treat without morbidity.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Most often the presenting complaints are secondary to central-nervous-system involvement by the tumor; they include headaches, vomiting, visual disturbances, symptoms of diabetes insipidus, and changes in sensorium.
Abnormal visual examination, include papilledema (27\%), bitemporal hemianopia (52\%), homonymous
- hemianopia (8\%), unilateral hemianopia (8\%), significant unilateral visual acuity deficit (35\%), and bilateral visual acuity deficit
In some patients there are no signs of endocrine deficiency ; in others growth arrest and pubertal delay may be obvious features If the tumor invades the hypothalamus, signs of impaired vegetative function may occur. These include poikilothermia, hypersomnia, and obesity.

\section*{Anatomy}

The most common location of these tumors is a combination of intrasellar and suprasellar (70\%).
Twenty percent are only suprasellar, and $10 \%$ are purely intrasellar. These tumors occasionally grow into the third ventricle, causing hydrocephalus.
The arterial supply is usually from the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries or from the internal carotid and posterior communicating arteries.

\section*{Investigations}

Laboratory
Lab Studies: A full pituitary endocrine workup is mandatory. 1.Corticotropin (ie, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH])
2.Growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor (IGF-1)
3.Cortisol
4.Prolactin
5.Luteinizing hormone (LH)
6.Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
7.Thyrotropin (ie, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH])
8.Triiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ ),Thyroxine ( $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ )

Routine CBC count, chemistry panel, and coagulation studies are needed before surgery.

\section*{Imaging}
1. Skull x-rayBecause many as $88 \%$ of patients have suprasellar or intrasellar calcificationEven when calcification is not present there is often ballooning of the sella or erosion of the sella walls and posterior clinoid processes
3.CT-scan
3. MRI Advantage over CT is that MRI can easily visualize the tumor in multiple planes and also give the surgeon a better view of the relationship of the tumor to the arteries of the Circle of Willis, pituitary stalk, and the optic and oculomotor nerves.

\section*{Management}

Controversy with respect to the extent of surgical resection and the use of postoperative irradiation
The ultimate goal is to prevent recurrence of the tumor with the least impairment of endocrine and intellectual function.
These goals can be achieved either by complete surgical removal of the tumor, or by cyst drainage or partial resection followed by radiotherapy.
Surgery is by the trans-sphenoidal approach, in which the surgeon approaches the sella turcica by a submucosal incision through the nose along the nasal septum approaching the pituitary fossa via the sphenoid sinus.
The pterional craniotomy is the standard approach to suprasellar lesions because it allows good visualization of the optic nerves and chiasm. Variations of the pterional craniotomy have been proposed to include resection of the orbital rim and zygoma so as to provide a more basal view and therefore better access to the superior aspects of this tumor
Complete surgical resection will obviate the need for irradiation, but such aggressive surgery usually results in permanent endocrine dysfunction and sometimes behavioral and intellectual abnormalities. Radiotherapy usually spares remaining endocrine dysfunction, but can cause intellectual problems, especially in the younger child.

\section*{CRYPTOCHIDISM}

Cryptorchidism is the most common genital problem encountered in pediatrics, refers to an un-descended or mal-descended testis.

\section*{Testicular embryology}

Normal testicular development begins at conception. The testisdetermining factor is now identified as the $S R Y$ gene (sexdetermining region on Y chromosome). The presence of this gene and an intact downstream pathway generally result in testicular formation.
At 3-5 weeks' gestation, the gonadal ridge or indifferent gonad develops, and at 6 weeks, primordial germ cell migration occurs. Soon after, Sertoli cells develop and secrete müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS), the level of which remains high throughout gestation and causes regression of müllerian ducts.
At 9weeks, Leydig cells develop and secrete testosterone. Up to 28 weeks there is transabdominal movement to the internal inguinal ring. Transinguinal migration, thought to be under hormonal control, occurs from weeks $28-40$, usually resulting in a scrotal testis by the end of a full term of gestation.

\section*{Occurrence}

Seen in 3\% of full-term newborn boys, decreasing to 1\% in boys aged 1 year. Spontaneous descent after the first year of life is uncommon

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- .Prematurity- The prevalence rate is $30 \% \mathrm{n}$ premature boys.
- Low birth weight
- Twinning
- Maternal exposure to estrogen during the first trimester.
- Siblings of boys with undescended testes $\mathrm{A} 7 \%$ incidence rate is seen.

\section*{Etiology}

The multifactorial mechanism of occurrence involves
1) Differential body growth relative to spermatic cord/gubernaculums
2) Increased abdominal pressure
3) hormonal factors, including testosterone, MIS, and extrinsic estrogen
4) development/maturation of the epididymis
5) gubernacular attachment
6) genitofemoral nerve/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).

\section*{Clinical:}

The most useful classification is whether testes are palpable upon physical examination.
-If nonpalpable, testes may be intra-abdominal or absent.
-If palpable, testes may be undescended, ectopic, or retractile.
Nonpalpable testes occur in approximately $20-30 \%$ of those who have cryptorchidism. The absent testis is thought to occur from an intrauterine or perinatal vascular event. Only $20-40 \%$ of nonpalpable testes are absent upon surgical exploration.
Were abdominal $10 \%$; inguinal $68 \%$; prescrotal, $24 \%$; ectopic/SIP, $11.5 \%$; bilateral, $30 \%$;
Associated anomalies/conditions may include the following:
Patent processus vaginalis
Abnormal epididymis
- Cerebral palsy
- Mental retardation
- Wilms tumor
- Abdominal wall defects (eg, gastroschisis, omphalocele, prune belly)
- Hypospadias
- Inguinal hernia
- Hemiscrotum
- Hydrocele
- Abnormalities of vas deferens and epididymis
- Klinefelter's syndrome
- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

Overall, $32-79 \%$ of undescended testes are reported to be associated with some type of epididymal abnormality. However, abnormalities that inhibit sperm transport (eg, complete caput separation, atresia, agenesis ) have been reported in only $8 \%$ of patients.

\section*{History}
- Determination of whether the testis has ever been palpable in scrotum
- History of prior inguinal surgery
- Prenatal history, ie, assisted reproductive technique, maternal hormonal treatment, multiple gestations, prematurity
- Family history, ie, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, intersex, precocious puberty, infertility, consanguinity

\section*{Physical examination}
- Warm, relaxed patient
- Observation prior to examination
- Frog-leg position
- Milk down, palpating from iliac crest to scrotum (soap or lubrication on fingertips may help)
- Scrotum, ie, hypoplastic, bifid, rugae, transposition, pigmentation
- Contralateral testicular hypertrophy
- Ectopic sites, ie, superficial inguinal pouch or transverse scrotal, femoral, prepenile, perineal, or contralateral hemiscrotum
- Presence of hypospadias/chordee, normal stretched penile length
- Serial examinations, if equivocal

Indications for hormonal or surgical correction of cryptorchidism include the following: Possible improved fertility
- Self-examination for testis mass (cancer)
- Correction of associated hernia
- Prevention of testicular torsion
- Avoidance of injury against pubic bone
- Psychological effects of empty scrotum

Lab Studies: For unilateral undescended testis without hypospadias, no lab studies are needed.
For unilateral or bilateral undescended testes with hypospadias or bilateral nonpalpable testes, tests include the following:
- Testing to rule out intersex condition (mandatory)
- 17-hydroxylase progesterone
- Testosterone
- Luteinizing hormone (LH)
- Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

Abdominopelvic ultrasonography to determine the location of ectopic testis and rule out other associated abnormalities in the upper urinary tracts.

\section*{Medical therapy:}

The appropriate time for treatment is when the individual is aged approximately 1 year. This age limit has decreased over the recent decades and is based on
(1) the rarity of spontaneous descent after age 1 year and (2) the possible salvage of improved fertility by earlier intervention. Primary hormonal therapy with hCG or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH or LH-releasing hormone [LHRH])

\section*{Human chorionic gonadotropin}

The action of hCG is virtually identical to that of pituitary LH , although hCG also appears to have a small degree of FSH activity. It stimulates production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the Leydig cells to produce androgens.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Agonistic analogs of GnRH such as nafarelin or buserelin stimulate the release of the pituitary gonadotropins, LH and FSH, resulting in a temporary increase of gonadal steroidogenesis.

\section*{Surgery}

\section*{Non-palpable testis-Exploratory laparatomy and orchidopexy.}

Usually surgery should be done before the age of 2 years as past this age structural changes are noticed to occur in the testis which compromise the blood testis barrier and this lead to auto immunity.
However its thought that cryptochidism may b part of chromosomal abnormality part of which affect the spermatogenesis.

\section*{Palpable testis}

An incision is made over the inguinal canal along the Langer lines. For gonadal identification, care is taken when incising the Scarpa fascia because the testis may be located in the superficial inguinal pouch and not in the inguinal canal.
For mobilization of the testis, the distal gubernacular attachments are divided. Then, the cremasteric muscle fibers are transected. Separate the cord structures from the peritoneum above the internal inguinal ring during ligation of the hernia sac. Divide the lateral spermatic fascia to allow medial movement of the testis. Isolate and perform high ligation of the patent processus vaginalis on the anteromedial surface of the cord. Relocate the testis into the scrotum in a subcutaneous or subdartos pouch.

\section*{Complications of orchidopexy are as follows}
1.Inadequate testis position occurs in as many incomplete retroperitoneal dissection.
2.Testicular atrophy occurs in approximately $5 \%$ of cases due to devascularization.
3.Accidental division of the vas deferens occurs in $1-2 \%$ of patients..
4.Epididymoorchitis is uncommon and may be treated with antibiotics.
5.Scrotal swelling may occur and usually is secondary to edema. If progressive, it may be due to bleeding and should be explored. A later presentation of swelling may be secondary to a hydrocele, which, if large, requires transscrotal repair
6.Higher risk (20-46 times) of testicular cancer (risk may remain despite orchiopexy)

\section*{7.Hernia development (25\%)}

NB Orchidopexy is not protective against subsequent testis cancer. Testicular tumors after previously successful orchidopexy most frequently are nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, while abdominal testes may develop seminomas

\section*{CYSTIC HYGROMA}

\section*{Definition}

Cystic hygromas are multiloculated cystic structures that are benign in nature.
-They form as the result of budding lymphatics and, thus, may occur anywhere in the body, although they are most frequently encountered in the neck (75\%) and axilla (20\%).
-Cystic hygromas frequently abut and/or encompass neurovascular structures.
-Surgical excision remains the therapy of choice and usually is performed shortly after diagnosis.

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

Lymphatic channels are formed from a series of clefts that develop in the mesenchyme around the sixth week of gestation. -From these channels, sacs are formed that establish drainage with the venous system.
-Failure to establish venous drainage results in dilated disorganized lymph channels, which, in the largest form, present as cystic hygromas.

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity:}

\section*{Airway obstruction}
-Is the most critical complication of cystic hygroma occurring in the neck.
-To assess risk of airway obstruction, carefully evaluate children with cystic hygromas of the head and neck for any signs of tracheal deviation and for involvement of the oropharynx, airway, and pharynx, such as the hypopharynx and hypolarynx.
- Often the tongue, base of tongue, and supraglottic larynx are involved when the airway is involved, not just mediastinal or neck fullness causing tracheal deviation. Secure the airways in patients with high risk of obstruction.

\section*{Risk of infection}
-In a cystic hygroma is approximately $16 \%$. Infection may result in additional swelling, pain, fever, and localized erythema.

\section*{Risk of hemorrhage}

Is approximately $13 \%$. Consider this complication in an enlarging painful cystic hygroma in a patient with evidence of acute blood loss.

\section*{Age:}

Most cystic hygromas are evident at birth (65\%), with the remainder evident by the time the individual is aged 2 years.

\section*{Etiology}
-Fetal cystic hygromas have almost a $50 \%$ association with chromosomal disorders such as aneuploidy
-Cystic hygroma is strongly associated with Turner syndrome (predominantly a 45 XO karyotype), trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and Noonan syndrome.
-Some cystic hygromas can occur in otherwise healthy fetuses and babies.

\section*{Physical:}
-The masses are usually large soft structures without clear margins.
-Physical examination may reveal extension into adjacent structures (eg, oral cavity).
-Examine neck for tracheal deviation or other evidence of impending airway obstruction.
-Closely inspect the tongue, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx because any involvement may lead to airway obstruction
-At the time of presentation, include physical examination and chest radiograph with evaluation.
-Chest radiography and/or computed tomography are necessary to determine whether the mediastinum is involved
-Ultrasonograpy and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often is required preoperatively to determine extent of invasion into adjacent structures and tumor involvement with neurovascular structures.

\section*{DDX}
-Hemangiomas
-Lymphangiomas
-Neck tumors
-Anterior cystic hygroma
-Laryngocele
-Posterior encephalocele
-Cervical meningocele or meningomyelocele
-Transient cervical cyst
-Branchial Cleft Cysts
-Encephalocele
-Dermoid cyst
-Sebaceous cyst.

\section*{Management}

\section*{Medical Care:}

The medical treatment of cystic hygroma includes injection of sclerosing agents and/or steroids.
-Treat an infection with intravenous antibiotics and perform definitive surgery once the infection has resolved.
-However, some infected cystic hygromas may improve with use of a sclerosing agent, such as OK-432, which contains penicillin and streptococci.
-Medical therapy with sclerosing agents is an alternative and should be discussed with the patient.
-Absolute alcohol as a sclerosing agent has been used with some success in some patients; alcohol works well in vascular malformations.
-If unresectable lesions are small cysts, they may not respond to sclerosis.
-Recurrent disease may respond poorly to sclerosis. .
-Medical therapies also are being studied for in utero application.
-This approach is appealing because it avoids the difficulties of delivery of a child with a large cystic hygroma. .

\section*{Surgical Care:}
-The mainstay of therapy is surgical excision.
-The goal of performing surgical therapy is to remove the lymphangioma completely or to remove as much lymphangioma as possible, sparing all vital neurovascular structures.
-The exceptions include premature infants of small size and those with involvement of crucial neurovascular structures that are small and difficult to identify (eg, facial nerve).
-In such infants, delay surgery until the child is aged 2 years to allow growth of the child to a size that facilitates surgical excision without increased morbidity
-Many newborns who have cervical hygromas with stable airways and food ways can be observed, especially individuals with parotid hygromas.
-Do not attempt drainage of the cyst because it increases the risk of infection through possible contamination and causes increased difficulty during resection because the thin walls of the cyst are not located easily when not fluid filled.
-Tracheotomy may be necessary to secure the airway when obstruction is observed.

\section*{Complications resulting from excision of a cystic hygroma}
include
- damage to a neurovascular structure
- chylous fistula
- chylothorax
- hemorrhage.
