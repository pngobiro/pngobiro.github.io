-Lifetime risk of melanoma developing in large congenital nevi ( $>20 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) is $5-20 \%$, with some increased risk in smaller lesions as well.
-Prophylactic excision is cosmetically prohibitive in many cases, and these lesions must be carefully monitored for suspicious change.
Other pigmented lesions, including basal cell carcinomas, seborrheic keratoses, and actinic keratoses, occasionally resemble melanoma and require biopsy for diagnosis.

\section*{Biopsy}
-Perform biopsy on all lesions suggestive of melanoma in the thickest part.
-If the resection will not result in a disfiguring defect, excisional biopsy with a $2-\mathrm{cm}$ skin margin and extending to the subcutaneous tissue is suggested for lesions less than 1.5 cm in diameter.
-If the lesion is large or located in an anatomic area where skin removal would cause disfigurement, an incisional biopsy may be performed.
-A full-thickness core punch biopsy in the most raised or irregular area is suggested with the understanding that this area may not be the thickest area.

\section*{Skin anatomy}

The skin is composed of multiple layers. The epidermis is the most superficial layer, and it contains keratinocytes in various stages of development. Melanocytes are located in the deepest layer of the epidermis. A basement membrane separates the epidermis from the underlying dermis, which is divided into 2 zones, papillary dermis and reticular dermis. Subcutaneous tissue is deep to the reticular dermis.

\section*{Histological classification}

Four major types of melanomas exist based on growth pattern.
1. Superficial spreading melanoma
2. Nodular melanoma
3. Lentigo maligna melanoma
4. Acral lentiginous melanoma

Other more unusual types include mucosal lentiginous melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, and verrucous melanoma.

\section*{1.Superficial spreading melanoma}

Commonest up to 70\% of melanomas in white population. Histologically
- Appear singly or in nests along the dermal-epidermal junction
- May migrate into the stratum granulosum or stratum corneum
- These cells can invade the papillary dermis with an inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate.

\section*{Clinically}
- Usually arise in a preexisting dysplastic nevus.
- Typically, this lesion changes slowly over several months to years.
- They are usually flat but may become irregular and elevated in later stages.
- The lesions average 2 cm in diameter with variegated colors and peripheral notches and/or indentations.

\section*{2,Nodular melanoma}

They comprise approximately $15-30 \%$ of melanoma Histology
- Characterized by extensive vertical growth into the dermis with a minimal radial component.
Clinical
- These tumors typically are blue-black but may lack pigment in some circumstances.
- They are known to arise without a preexisting lesion. May develop at the site of a preexisting nevus and rapidly becomes a palpable, elevated, firm nodule

\section*{3..Lentigo maligna melanoma}
-4-10\% of melanomas. Show dermal and epidermal changes from sun exposure.
Clinical.
- Larger than 3 cm
- Flat, tan, and begin as small, freckle-like lesions.
- They occur in sun-exposed areas (eg, face and neck of older individuals).
- Marked notching of the borders is present.
-Lentigo maligna melanoma usually arises within a Hutchinson freckle (lentigo maligna).
The histologic appearance
- Irregularly shaped hyperchromatic cells that form spindle-shaped nests.
- The epidermis is atrophic
- The dermis contains solar elastosis with chronic inflammatory infiltrates.

\section*{4. Acral lentiginous melanoma}

This tumor comprises 2-8\% of melanomas in whites and 35-60\% of melanomas in dark-skinned people.
Histology
- Occur in dermal-epidermal junction with microinvasion into the papillary dermis.
- The cells have increased melanin granule production, which fills their dendritic extensions.
Clinical
- Occur on the palms of the hands, beneath the nailbeds, and on the soles of the feet.
- They may appear as flat, tan, or brown stains with irregular borders on the palms and soles
- Subungual lesions can be brown or black, with ulcerations in later stages.
No correlation with a worse prognosis is demonstrated for these lesions when tumor thickness is considered.

\section*{5. Desmoplastic melanoma}
-These lesions account for approximately $1 \%$ of melanoma cases; they are fairly rare.
- They demonstrate a tendency for perineural invasion, especially in the head and neck.
-They have a propensity for higher local recurrence rates but lower regional metastasis rates.

\section*{Classification and staging}

Two classification schemes have been developed, based on either:
1.The vertical thickness of the lesion in millimeters (Breslow classification)
2. The anatomic level of invasion of the layers of skin (Clarks staging)
Breslow classification scheme is used almost exclusively now since it more accurately predicts future tumor behavior.

The TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system is used for clinical staging

\section*{Breslow classification -Thickness of lesion}

Stage 1Thickness of 0.75 mm or less
Stage 2 Thickness of $\mathbf{0 . 7 6 - 1 . 5 0 m m}$
Stage 3 Thickness of $\mathbf{1 . 5 1}-\mathbf{4 . 0 0} \mathbf{~ m m}$
Stage 4 Thickness greater than 4.00 mm

\section*{Clark classification}

Level I - Involves only epidermis (in situ melanoma); no invasion
Level II - Invades papillary dermis
Level III - Papillary-reticular dermis interface
Level IV - Invades reticular dermis
Level V - Invades into subcutaneous tissue

\section*{TNM classification}

\section*{Primary tumor (pT)}
pTX - Primary tumor cannot be assessed
pT0 - No evidence of primary tumor
pTis - Melanoma in situ (Clark level [CL] I)
pT1 - Tumor 0.75 mm or less in thickness; invades papillary dermis (CL II)
pT2 - Tumor $0.76-1.50 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness and/or invades to papillary-reticular dermal interface (CL III)
pT3 - Tumor $1.51-4.00 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness and/or invades reticular dermis (CL IV)

\section*{pT3a - Tumor $1.51-3.00 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness}
pT3b - Tumor $3.01-4.00 \mathrm{~mm}$ in thickness
pT4 - Tumor greater than 4.00 mm in thickness and/or invades subcutaneous tissue (CL V) and/or satellite(s) within 2 cm of the primary tumor
pT4a - Tumor greater than 4.00 mm in thickness and/or invades subcutaneous tissue
pT4b - Satellite(s) within 2 cm of primary tumor

\section*{Regional lymph nodes (N)}

NX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed
N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis
N1 - Metastasis 3 cm or less in greatest dimension in any regional lymph node
N2 - Metastasis more than 3 cm in greatest dimension in any regional lymph node(s) and/or in-transit metastasis N2a -
Metastasis more than 3 cm in greatest dimension in any regional lymph node(s)
N2b - In-transit metastasis
N2c - Both N2a and N2b

\section*{Distant metastasis (M)}

MX - Distant metastasis cannot be assessed
M0 - No distant metastasis
M1 - Distant metastasis
M1a - Metastasis in skin or subcutaneous tissue or lymph node(s) beyond the regional lymph nodes
M1b - Visceral metastasis.

\section*{Management}

Surgical therapy-wide margin excision. If the lesion has not spread beyond the primary site, it is potentially curable.

\section*{Stage I}

For a T1 lesion, 1-cm excision margins are adequate, but lesions greater than 1 mm require $2-\mathrm{cm}$ margins. Studies demonstrate no improvement in recurrence or survival rates with larger margins of resection. Attempt primary closure and perform skin grafting or flap closure if necessary. For lesions with a depth greater than 1 mm , many recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of wide local excision (see "Stage II," below).

\section*{Stage II}

Perform a 2-cm surgical resection on stage II lesions. No recurrence or survival advantage exists when $2-\mathrm{cm}$ margins are compared to wider margins $(4-6 \mathrm{~cm})$.
Smaller resection decreases the need for skin grafting and inpatient hospital stay.
-Perform a complete therapeutic lymphadenectomy on patients with suspected lymph node metastases based on physical examination. This consists of excision of all lymph nodes in the affected regional lymph node basin.
-Consider sentinel lymph node biopsy if no clinically positive nodes are present. Using blue dye and/or radioisotope injected at the site of the primary melanoma, the first-echelon node can be identified within the regional lymph node basin. Send this sentinel node to the pathologist for analysis using routine stains, immunohistochemistry, and even polymerase chain reaction in some centers.
-If the sentinel node is positive, then predictive importance exists of regional lymph node metastases; perform a complete lymph node dissection.
-The correlation is based on the thickness of the primary tumor. If the sentinel lymph node is negative, a $99 \%$ chance exists that all others are negative. This procedure is becoming the standard of care for tumors greater than 1 mm in depth.
-Hyperthermic arterial limb perfusion with melphalan for extremity melanomas has been studied as an adjuvant therapy. One study found it to be beneficial in that it produced higher response rates and overall survival rates than those for surgery alone. Other studies do not demonstrate benefit.
-Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or biological therapy also are under clinical evaluation. One study demonstrated that high-dose
interferon alfa-2b resulted in prolonged relapse-free survival and overall survival compared to no adjuvant therapy. A followup study by the same group demonstrated in preliminary results that high-dose interferon offered patients a relapse-free survival benefit over patients who did not receive adjuvant treatment but not over those who received low-dose interferon.
-Neither high-dose nor low-dose interferon had a significant overall survival advantage compared to observation alone. Highdose interferon can be associated with significant toxic side effects (ie, liver toxicity), and some patients require dose reduction since it may not be well tolerated.

\section*{Stage III}
-Wide local excision of the primary tumor with 2 -cm margins remains the first-line therapy.
-. Skin grafting or other tissue-transfer technique may be necessary to close the defect.
-Perform regional lymph node dissection, since a stage III melanoma represents nodal disease.
- If the nodal status is unknown, consider a sentinel lymph node biopsy to determine if the disease is stage I, II, or III.
-As in stage II disease, a higher rate of treatment failure exists with wide local excision alone in this group compared to stages 0
and I. Many clinical trials currently are exploring similar options as adjuvant therapy.

\section*{Stage IV}

Advanced metastatic melanoma usually is refractory to standard therapy; thus, consider these patients for clinical trials. Some treatments have reported various objective responses, although they usually are short lived. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and the nitrosoureas, carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU), produced a $20 \%$ objective response rate.
Response rates for interferon alfa and interleukin-2 range from 8$22 \%$ and $10-20 \%$, respectively. Currently, other studies in progress are comparing other cytotoxic and biologic drug regimens.

\section*{Prognosis}
1) Size of the tumor and the depth of invasion. Small tumors with minimal invasion ( $<0.7 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) are usually curable by wide local excision.
2) The prognosis is usually favorable in lentigo maligna melanoma and in superficial spreading melanomas without deep invasion. Most nodular melanomas, particularly if ulcerated and associated with deep invasion, have a poor prognosis.
3) Lesions of the extremities have a more favorable prognosis than those of the trunk, and women with malignant melanoma have better survival statistics at 5 and 10 years than men.

\section*{OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE/ SURGICAL JAUNDICE}

\section*{Definition}

Jaundice amenable to surgical treatment-usually due to extra hepatic obstruction in the flow of bile.

\section*{Common causes include:}
1.Cholelithiasis/choledocholithiasis
2.Pancreatic head carcinoma
3.Common bile duct strictures mostly iatrogenic-ERCP and cholecytectomy.
4.Cholangiocarcinoma
5.Choledochocele,Choledochal cysts and congenital atresia
6.Infections
- Parasitic-Clonorchis sinesnsis and Ascaris Lumbricoides
- Opportunistic infections in HIV-Cryptosporidium, CMV, Microsporidia, TB adenitis
7.Other Tumours- Hepatoma, lymphomas, stomach cancer ,Colorectal cancer, Ampullary cancer of Duodenum, Gallbladder Adenocarcinoma
8. Pancreatic pseudo- cysts

\section*{CHOLELITHIASIS}
-Cholelithiasis is the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder. The spectrum of gallbladder disease in cholelithiasis ranges:
1) Asymptomatic gallstones-Up to $90 \%$
2) gallbladder colic/biliary colic.
3) Cholecystitis
4) Choledocholithiasis
5) Cholangitis
-Gallbladder colic is pain caused by a stone temporarily obstructing the cystic duct or common bile duct (CBD)
-Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder from obstruction of the cystic duct or CBD (choledocholithiasis or common bile duct stone)
-Cholangitis is infection of the biliary tree.

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

Three types of gallstones exist.
(1) Cholesterol (most common)
(2) Pigment-calcium bilirubinate-15\%
(3) Mixed stones
-Impaired gallbladder motility, bile stasis and bile content alteration predispose people to the formation of gallstones
-An increase in the cholesterol concentration or a decrease in the bile salt concentration results in supersaturation of bile with cholesterol, and the formation of a liquid crystalline phase of cholesterol.
-Normally, bile salts (ursodeoxychilic and cheno deoxycholic), lecithin, and phospholipids help to maintain cholesterol as a solute in the bile.
-When bile is supersaturated with cholesterol, it crystallizes and forms a nidus for stone formation.
Cholesterol stones are the most common type of stone Calcium and pigment also may be incorporated in the stone. Pigment stones, which comprise 15\% of gallstones, are formed by the crystallization of calcium bilirubinate. Diseases that lead to increased destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), abnormal
metabolism of hemoglobin (cirrhosis), or infections (including parasitic) predispose people to pigment stones.
Black stones are found in people with hemolytic disorders.
Brown stones are found in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic duct and are associated with infection in the gallbladder.
-Usually mild jaundice, deep jaundice suggestive of choledocholithiais
Crohn's disease, terminal ileal resection, and jejunoileal bypass

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{Biliary colic}
-Due to impaction of a stone in the neck of the gallbladder. The severe pain starts abruptly in the epigastrium, often after a heavy meal, and lasts for several hours. Pain is usually intense for 1 to 4 hours and then resolves slowly, leaving vague residual ache or soreness. (stone drops back into the fundus of the gallbladder or migrates out of the common duct into the duodenum)
-It usually constant and is associated with restlessness, vomiting, and sweating.
-The pain may radiate through to the back rarely to radiate to the shoulder, as in acute cholecystitis.
-General examination may disclose a patient in obvious severe pain(writhing in bed), with a mild tachycardia and normal temperature.
-Abdominal examination shows only mild tenderness in the epigastrium. In contrast to acute cholecystitis, tenderness over the gallbladder is absent.

\section*{Acute cholecystitis}
-It is usually due to persistent impaction of a stone in the neck of the gallbladder.
-The result is initially a chemical inflammation of the gallbladder wall perhaps due to the mucosal toxin lysolecithin, produced by the action of phospholipase on biliary lecithin.
-This is soon followed by bacterial infection
-Because of cystic duct occlusion the inflammatory process is particularly aggressive and the gallbladder becomes acutely distended, with accompanying lymphatic and venous obstruction.
-The serosa may be covered by a fibrinous exudate and subserosal haemorrhage gives the appearance of patchy gangrene. The gallbladder wall itself is grossly thickened and oedematous and the underlying mucosa may show hyperaemia or patchy necrosis.
-Three grades of inflammation are recognized: acute cholecystitis, acute suppurative cholecystitis, and acute gangrenous cholecystitis.
- Rarely an abscess or empyema develops within the gallbladder, while perforation of an ischaemic area leads to a pericholecystic abscess, bile peritonitis, or a cholecystoenteric fistula.

\section*{Clinical Presentation}
-RUQ Pain becomes severe, constant localizing to the right upper quadrant, often radiating to the tip right scapula and hyperalgesia on medial border of scapula(boas sign)and shoulder -Pain is worsened by movement especially respiratory movements.
-Murphy's sign -Patient asked to expire then Palpation at intersection of $9^{\text {th }}$ intercostals space and mid clavicular line patient then inspires, there is inspiratory arrest during subcostal palpation. Is widely regarded as pathognomonic of cholecystitis. However, positive in chronic cholecystitis, acute hepatitis, and a localized abscess around a perforated duodenal ulcer
-Gallbladder becomes palpable in < 50\% of cases due to distension -Nausea and vomiting are usual
-Mild-moderate fever and tachycardia
NB The combination of jaundice; fever, usually with rigors; and upper quadrant abdominal pain. Charcots triad.Occurs as a result of cholangitis. When the presentation also also includes hypotension and mental status changes, it is known as Reynolds' pentad
-Itchiness of the body
-Dark urine and pale stool

-Acute pancreatitis, Pancreatic cancer
-Perforation of a peptic ulcer, duodenal cancer
-Biliary colic.
-Cholangitis
-Cholangiocarcinoma
-Hepatocellular carcinoma
-Acute appendicitis
-Acute pyelonephritis
A raised white cell count and serum amylase level may occur in several of these conditions
In the majority of patients with cholecystitis, as with recurrent biliary colic, the treatment of choice is early surgery. In most cases, cholecystectomy done after initial stabilization in $1{ }^{\text {st }} 24$ hrs. -72 hrs
1. IV Fluids 2. NG tube for decompression. 3.IV antibiotics 4. Prepare for surgery 5.Analgesia

\section*{Management of Cholelithiasis}
1.Medical therapy
2.Lithotripsy
3.ERCP and sphincterotomy
3.Cholecystectomy -open or laparascopic
5.Close follow up

\section*{1.MEDICAL TREATMENT:}
-Gallstone dissolution therapy.
-Cholesterol gallstones can be dissolved by decreasing the cholesterol saturation of bile.
-The naturally occurring bile salt chenodeoxycholic acid and the synthetic ursodeoxycholic acid when given by mouth achieve this.
M.O.A - reducing the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol rather than by expanding the bile acid pool.
Ursodeoxycholic acid is more efficient at reducing the cholesterol saturation of bile.
-Unexplained benefit is that some patients experience relief of their symptoms without much change in the size of the stones.
-Dissolution therapy can only be used for non-calcified stones within a functioning gallbladder
-Less than 20 per cent of patients are suitable candidates
-Unsuitable for patients with acute symptoms and are less effective in obese patients and in stones $>15 \mathrm{~mm}$
-Chenodeoxycholic acid ( $10-15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day )
ursodeoxycholic acid ( $8-12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ) and up to ( $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in obese patients)
-Liver function is carefully monitored and the stones are measured at 6 months.
-If there has been no reduction in size there is no point in continuing with treatment. Eighty per cent of small stones dissolve in 6 months, but larger stones require up to 2 years treatment.
-Recurence common.
-Useful in patients who are poor anaesthetic risks or who refuse surgery.

2-Stones must be radiolucent

3-Stones should be less than 30 mm in diameter or 40 ml in volume
4-Should not be more than three (ideally only one)..
These criteria restrict the use of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of patients.

\section*{Contraindications}
-Pregnancy
-Cholecystitis
-Cholangitis
-Pancreatitis
-Gastroduodenal ulcers
Patients are partly immersed in a water bath or placed in contact with a water cushion. An electromagnetic impulse, a piezoelectric generator or a high-voltage spark from an underwater electrode produces a shock wave that is transmitted through water. The acoustic impedance of most body tissue is similar to that of water, while stones have different impedance.
The wave, guided by ultrasound or fluoroscopy to focus directly at the stone, penetrates the body with only slight attenuation. When the wave reaches the stone, tear and shear forces develop, disintegrating it.
Patients generally take an oral gallstone-dissolving drug such as ursodiol -for one week before lithotripsy and continue it for at least three months after disappearance of stone fragments.

\section*{3.ERCP and SPHICTEROTOMY}

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic sphincterotomy offer effective minimally invasive effective procedure as the procedure of choice.

\section*{4.CHOLECYSTECTOMY-OPEN OR LAPARASCOPIC Open cholecystectomy}
-Dissecting the Calots triangle is the first step in cholecystectomy
-Borders of calots triangle are cystic duct laterally, CBD medially and the inferior aspect of the liver superiorly
-The cystic artery crosses the triangle from left to right, running behind the bile duct and arising from the right hepatic artery. -Once the cystic duct and artery have been definitely identified, the cystic artery is ligated in continuity and divided between ligatures.
-The cystic duct is dissected as far as is necessary to expose a sufficient length for easy cannulation for operative cholangiography. Any stones in the cystic duct are milked back into the gallbladder and the cystic duct is ligated close to the gallbladder.
The dissection of the gallbladder from the liver can begin either at the fundus or in the region of the cystic duct.

\section*{Complication}

Sudden hemorrhage is usually from the cystic artery.
If this cant be controlled by clamping then occluding the hepatic artery with the fingers and thumb of the left hand placed across the entrance of the lesser sac (Pringle's manoeuvre).

Laparascopic cholecystectomy
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapidly replacing open cholecystectomy

Pancreatic cancer is the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy after colorectal cancer, which affects five times more people.
However, it's the malignancy with the lowest 5 -year survival.

\section*{Age}

Malignant neoplasms of the pancreas can occur at any age, but they are rare before the age of 40: the mean age of diagnosis is 64 years, after which the incidence increases rapidly.

\section*{Risk factors}
1.Cigarete smoking-most consistent risk factor
2.Diet-Fatty diet
3.Assoction with Diabetis mellitus
4.Chronic pancreatitis
5.Exposure to several chemical agents, including naphthylamine, benzidine, and petrol has also been linked to pancreatic cancer.
6. Prior surgery in the alimentary tract has also been implicated as a causative factor. Patients with a history of gastrectomy have at least a X3 risk
7.Genetic predisposition

\section*{Sites}

About $75 \%$ are in the head and $25 \%$ in the body and tail of the organ.

\section*{Pathology}

Malignant tumours of the pancreas can occur in either the exocrine parenchyma or in the endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans
Exocrine neoplasms are far more common. Adeno-carcinoma accounts for around 80 per cent of pancreatic neoplasms, and is thought to be of ductal origin.
At time of diagnosis more than 85 per cent of these tumours have extended beyond the limits of the organ. Perineural invasion within and beyond the gland is particularly prominent in this type of cancer, although lymphatic spread also leads to early metastasis to adjacent and distant lymph nodes.
The most common sites of extralymphatic involvement are the liver and peritoneum.
The lungs are the most frequently affected of the extra-abdominal organs.
Some rare types of cancers with relatively favorable diagnosis include:
Mucinous cystadenoma-cystadenocarcinoma and the papillarycystic tumor mostly occur in women. Lymphomas constitute up to $5 \%$ of pancreatic cancers are of favorable outcome.

\section*{Clinical presentation}
1. Epigastric or left upper quadrant of the abdomen pain ; it has a dull, aching nature and can radiate to the back.
The patient may experience some relief when lying or sitting in a flexed or curled position. The pain becomes more severe as the disease advances.
2. Jaundice-Usually insidious in onset, progressive deep jaundice associated with severe pruritus. It is painless in a third of cases.
3. Weight loss, night sweats and generalized fatigue. Anorexia and vomiting may occur in duodenal obstruction.
4. Psychiatric disturbances, particularly depression, which are seen in up to 75 per cent of patients.

\section*{PANCREATIC HEAD CANCER}
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding may also occur; this is most commonly secondary to gastric or duodenal invasion by the tumor.
6.Migratory thrombophlebitis

\section*{Physical exam}

In the early stages of pancreatic cancer
1. Jaundice.
2. Evidence of weight loss.
3. Hepatomegaly, which reflects bile duct obstruction.
4. A non-tender gallbladder can be palpated in 50 per cent of jaundiced patients (Courvoisier's sign).
5. In advanced disease, ascites and a palpable mass are indicative of an unresectable tumour.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Imaging}
1.Upper abdominal ultrasonography

Demonstrate pancreatic masses, dilation of the pancreatic duct as well as of the bile duct and gallbladder, hepatic metastasis. Shows pancreatic tumours to be less echogenic than the surrounding parenchyma, and accompanied by changes in the contour of the gland.
Endoscopic ultrasonography, especially for tumours located in the head of the pancreas.
2.CT-SCan

Important in delineating the tumour and its local spread and staging of the tumour.
3. (ERCP)
is a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of the cause of obstructive jaundice when pancreatic or other peri-ampullary cancer is suspected.
- Virtually all pancreatic cancers show abnormalities in the pancreatogram, these consisting mainly of stenosis or obstruction of the pancreatic duct.

\section*{Laboratory}
1.FHG-Hb level
2.LFT-Alkaline phosphatase and GGT, AST and ALT Bilirubin -Total and Direct.
3.Coagulation screen- PTI, INR.
4.An elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has been noted in over 70\% of patients with confirmed pancreatic neoplasm.
5.The CA19-9 antigen correlate with the degree of differentiation of the tumor and with advancing stages of the disease. 6.Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration of the tumour for cytological examination is invaluable, particularly for patients with advanced stage pancreatic cancer, who otherwise would require surgical exploration. The procedure is usually performed under direct guidance by ultrasonography or CT.

\section*{Management}

Pancreatoduodenectomy has been the standard operation for carcinoma of the pancreatic head since its demonstration by Whipple in 1935(Whipple surgey)
Variations on this procedure include total, subtotal, and radical pancreatectomy, as well as the pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy
In unresectable tumors palliative surgery involves by pass surgery. A triple or Double by-pass my be performed 1.Cholecystojejunostomy-By-pass bile
2. Gastrojenunostomy -tumour head of pancrease causes obstruction at duodenum and this to by-pass gastric contents.
3. Jejunojejonostomy-To prevent reflux of bile into the stomach. Chemotherapy
Single-agent chemotherapy does not provide substantive palliation and improvement in survival for patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer
The mean survival time after the administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is less than 20 weeks, with a response rate of only 10 $15 \%$. Mitomycin, streptozotocin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin likewise provide only a $10-25 \%$ response rate without improvement in long-term survival.

\section*{PAGETS DISEASE OF BREAST}

Chronic eczematous disease on the skin of the nipple and the areola in with an associated intraductal carcinoma of the mammary gland
Proper recognition of this disorder is required to initiate an appropriate workup (eg, skin biopsy) for differentiating it from other benign inflammatory dermatosis and for detecting an underlying breast carcinoma.
A similar disease involving the skin of female and male external genitalia (ie, vulva, glans penis) is known as extramammary PD. Histologic features of mammary PD and extramammary PD are similar; however, the histogenesis and the pathogenesis are different.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
-Caused by_underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium.
-Malignant Paget cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. These tumor cells are derived from luminal lactiferous ductal epithelium of the breast tissue. They possess microscopic features of glandular epithelial cells.
-Paget cells have cell markers like underlying breast carcinoma, including tumour markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (p53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast. -However, Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) is thought to be specific and nearly 100\% sensitive marker for mammary PD.
-Paget cells (large neoplastic cells of glandular origin) infiltrate and spread to the overlying epidermal layers of the nipple and adjacent areola is thro' induction by a mobility factor (heregulinalpha) that acts through the HER2/NEU receptor that are expressed by paget cells.
Normal epidermal keratinocytes produce and release the mobility factor heregulin-alpha.
The binding of this receptor-mobility factor complexes results in chemotaxis paget cells to the epidermis in the nipple and areola area.
-Nearly 100\% of mammary PD cases are associated with an underlying carcinoma, either in situ (intraductal, 10\%) or infiltrating cancer (90\%).

History: Patients with mammary PD present with a relatively long history of an eczematous skin lesion in the nipple and adjacent areas.
Eczematous skin lesions are associated with several symptoms.
- Erythema
- Scaling
- Itching
- Burning sensation
- Ulceration
- Oozing with serosanguinous discharge
- Bleeding

Early symptoms and signs of mammary PD
- Excoriation from itching
- Resolution and recurrence of small vesicles within the skin lesion
- Symptoms of pain, itching, and a burning sensation prompt patients to seek medical attention.

\section*{Physical:}
-Scaly, erythematous, crusty, and thickened plaques on the nipple, spreading to the surrounding areolar areas, are typical. -Retraction of the nipple or the presence of palpable nodules indicates an underlying breast cancer; as many as two thirds of patients have a palpable breast tumor
-Serosanguinous discharge from the nipple may be present. -Usually the lesion is unilateral.

\section*{Differentials}
-Bowens disease of the breast
-contact dermatitis
-malignant melanoma
-Drug reaction

\section*{Investigation}
-Scrape cytology a noninvasive and reliable, rapid diagnostic screening method for mammary PD.
Stain the smears with Papanicolaou or Giemsa stain.
Paget cells
- A high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio
- occasional acinar formation
- intracytoplasmic vacuoles
-Punch, wedge, or excisional biopsy of the lesional skin of the nipple-areola complex to include the dermal and subcutaneous tissue for detailed microscopic examination provides an adequate sample for the accurate diagnosis of mammary PD.

\section*{Histologic Findings:}
-The epidermis exhibits hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and acanthosis.
-Infiltration occurs by variable numbers of large, rounded or ovoid, malignant-appearing tumor cells that are present in all layers of the epidermis.
-The tumor cells contain abundant pale-staining or sometimes eosinophilic cytoplasm and large vesicular-to-hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli

\section*{Management}

Like breast cancer

\section*{PENETRATING ABDOMINAL INJURY}
-Gun shot wounds-GSW
-Stab wound
-Blast injury

\section*{Introduction}

GSW is caused by a missile propelled by combustion of powder. It implies high-energy transfer and unpredictability of the extent of intra-abdominal injuries. Not only is the missile track unpredictable, but also, secondary missiles such as bone fragments or fragments of the bullet are capable of inflicting additional injuries
Stab wounds are caused by a sharp object penetrating the abdominal wall. This type of injury usually is more predictable with regard to injured organs, but a high index of suspicion must be maintained to avoid overlooking occult injuries.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Management should begin with the scene of accident because in addition to the abdominal injury patients may have sustained injury to the other systems.
ATLS-Advanced Trauma life support protocol should be followed. Triage and safe fast transport should be afforded to the patient.
Triage-Patients most likely to benefit from your intervention. Very badly off patients who may not make it to the nearest hospital are unlikely to benefit and the loudly screaming patients may not be the most critical

\section*{A. Primary Survey (Life Support)}
1. Airway: guarantee patency and assure that the patient can protect his/her airway.
a. Possible C-spine injury - cervical column and maintain in-line stabilization if intubation required.
b. Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) is appropriate in most patients when needed, possible exceptions below.
c. Anterior neck injury, stridor, but no acute airway obstruction: consider awake, fiberoptic intubation or urgent surgical airway under local anesthesia in OR.
d. Anterior neck injury, stridor, and acute airway obstruction: consider emergent surgical airway without prior attempts at intubation.
e. Head injury - intubate when GCS is less then or equal to 8, consider neurosurgical evaluation prior to intubation when feasible.
f. Apnea - immediate orotracheal intubation with in-line stabilization, RSI generally unnecessary.
2. Breathing: assess breath sounds bilaterally. Acute causes causing dyspnea
a. Airway obstruction.
b. Tension Pneumothorax - immediate needle decompression, followed by tube thoracostomy
c. Simple Pneumothorax - tube thoracostomy after X-ray confirmation.
d. Cardiac tamponade-distant heart sounds,distended neck veins
e. Massive Hemothorax- tube thoracostomy after fluid resuscitation, consider OR thoracotomy for initial chest tube output $>1500 \mathrm{cc}$.
f. Open peumothorax -strap the opening
g. Flail chest-pack gauze and strap hemithorax,Positive pressure ventilation
h. Confirm position and function of all chest tubes with CXR.
3. Circulation: assess for signs of obvious and occult shock via signs of adequate organ perfusion (mental status, capillary refill, urine production), vital signs, Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis, cold extremity, sweating, parlor
All GSW require emergency laparatomy to look for other abdominal injury. After initial primary survey the patient should be prepared for laparatomy.
If hemodynamically unstable go directly to exploratory laparotomy GXM and carry blood to theatre.
With stable patient other investigations may be done before theatre.
a.Hemostasis - direct pressure to bleeding wounds; consider immediate, rapid closure for intensely bleeding scalp wounds.
b. Treat Shock
i. Assess for etiology. Consider hypovolemic shock as most common cause.
Neurogenic shock considered if evidence of spinal cord injury. Shock state should never be assumed to result from head injury. ii. Initial therapy should consist of 2 liters of isotonic crystalloid solution, failure to respond or shock state that is difficult to correct should illicit a search for bleeding that requires operative or angiographic control.
iv. Cardiac Tamponade - consider diagnosis with shock that does not respond to volume, especially in penetrating chest trauma, neck vein distension may or may not be present. FAST may confirm diagnosis. Consider ED
thoracotomy with loss of vital signs; otherwise proceed emergently to OR for pericardial window or sternotomy/ thoracotomy.
v. Indications for ED Thoracotomy:
(a) Penetrating Chest Trauma and one of the following:
(b) Loss of vital signs (pulse) en route to ED, with electrical activity on presentation.
(c) Loss of vital signs or sustained systolic BP <90 in ED.

\section*{4. Disability:}
a. Calculate GCS. Consider Neurosurgery consult when GCS $<14$, consider intubation when GCS <9.
c. Assess for sensory and motor deficits.

\section*{5. Exposure and environmental modifications}
a. Remove clothing, log roll to examine back, remove backboard when present.
b. Maintain normothermia - blankets, warm fluids, warm room.

\section*{B.Secondary Survey (head to toe exam, adjuncts)}

With focus on abdomen injury

\section*{History}

Gunshot-range of shot, from front or back, whether shot while fleeing or confrontation, presence of exit wound, bleeding and features of shock-dizziness and confusion or loss of consciousness, sweating.
Abdominal pain or chest pain afterwards. Description of the pain.
-Exact circumstances mechanism of injury
-if gunshot range of shot and how many shots
-If stab the size and type of knife and direction of stab from the side, front or back .Number of stabs
-If there was a struggle and if the assailant twisted the knife and shoved it in.
-Knife left sticking or withdrawn by the assailant of patient
-Immediate period after the stab-abdominal pain location and radiation relieved by bending forward or bending to the side, worsened by cough or walking.
-Whether patient was able to walk or lost consciousness.
-Wound the location, bleeding, intestinal evisceration, fecal matter
-Hematemesis, hematochizia-upper GI or lower GI injury
-Abdominal swelling progressive?
-Chest pain-diaphragmatic injury
-signs of shock if bleeding
-Any other injury other any place in the body.

\section*{Physical exam}

For physical examination, completely undressing the patient for the primary survey and examining the entire body surface for entry and exit wounds is important. Wounds that look like entry and exit marks actually may be 2 separate entry wounds.
Patients brought in as presumed cases of blunt trauma may have penetrating injuries that have been overlooked initially. Carefully record the pattern of the wounds and characteristics.
Patients with penetrating abdominal trauma who present with abdominal pain, tenderness, and guarding should undergo exploration without unnecessary delays

\section*{Stab wound :Indications for laparatomy include}
a. Hemodynamic instability-vital sings
b. Evisceration of the intestines
c. Extrusion of feces through the stab wound
d. Peritoneal signs.

Stable patients may be investigated further to determine presence of other visceral injury which is indication for laparatomy.

\section*{Other examination}
1. Head/Maxillofacial - examine wounds, control bleeding, pupil exam, and assess facial stability.
2. Neck - examine for wounds, palpate for tenderness, deformity, etc...
3. Chest - examine for wounds, etc.., re-evaluate breath sounds.

4 Pelvis - examine for wounds, assess for tenderness, avoid excessive motion/compression, x-ray to diagnose fracture.
6. Extremities
a. Complete pulse exam.
b. Reduce fracture dislocations.
c. Splint as needed.
7. Spine - assess for tenderness or deformity.
8. Adjuncts:
a. Naso/orogastric tube - consider placement in all blunt trauma victims.
b. Foley - place after rectal exam
c. X-rays-c-spine, supine CXR and pelvic x-ray for blunt trauma.

\section*{D. Frequent Re-Assessment:}
1. Vital Signs should be documented no less then every 30 min . until initial work-up is complete and patient has stabilized.
2. Outputs (chest tubes, urinary) - to be recorded at frequent intervals.
3. Patients with shock/blood loss or high base deficit need serial determinations of perfusion status i.e. $\mathrm{ABG}, \mathrm{Hb}$, Lactate.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1.Chest radiographs (CXR) are part of a routine workup in all patients with penetrating abdominal trauma.
-In patients with a GSW, findings can reveal hemothorax or pneumothorax secondary to penetration of the missile into the chest.
-In patients with thoracoabdominal stab wounds, x-ray films can indicate violation of the thoracic cavity by the stab wound. Air under the diaphragm indicates peritoneal penetration. The cardiac silhouette needs to be evaluated to help rule out penetrating cardiac trauma.
2.Abdominal radiographs- predict the pattern of the injury based on the location of the missile. AP erect/ lateral decubitus and Supine views

\section*{3.Ultrasound (FAST-focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma)}
-Four views are used in trauma, with visualization of the right upper and lower quadrants, left upper and lower quadrants, pelvis, and pericardium. Ultrasound is up to $95 \%$ sensitive for helping detect intra-abdominal hemorrhage but is not sensitive for helping detect hollow organ injuries.
4. CT scan of the abdomen with triple contrast (ie, oral, intravenous, rectal) is indicated in stable patients with stab wounds to the flank and back.
Extravasation of the contrast, hematoma, violation of the peritoneum, and free fluid in the abdomen are indications for exploration.
5.Exploratory Laparoscopy-Evaluating the injury and can be therapeutic as well

\section*{Laboratory Tests}
1.PCV- Findings may indicate hemorrhage. Acute bleeding frequently does not reflect the hemoglobin level until fluid resuscitation is in progress.
2.U/E/C-Renal function and theatre preparation
3. Prothrombin/partial thromboplastin time (Findings may indicate coagulopathy.
4. Arterial blood gas determination (ABG) (all patients): hemodynamic status of the patient. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis may require immediate exploration.
5.Type and cross match blood
6.Urine dipstick test for blood (all patients): This is a quick test to help evaluate for potential genitourinary injuries
7.Serum amylase levels-Pancreatic injury.

\section*{Diagnostic Procedures:}

\section*{1.Nasogastric intubation}

Is needed for all patients to decompress the stomach before endotracheal intubation.
Nasogastric intubation can help detect gastric injury by the presence of blood in the nasogastric tube (NGT).
2. Foley catheter insertion (all patients)
can help indicate injury to the urogenital system by the presence of blood. Catheter insertion also enables monitoring of the fluid resuscitation at least $30-50 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour urine $0.5 \mathrm{ml} /$ Min

\section*{3. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage}

DPL used in stable patients detect hollow organ injuries. Two commonly accepted methods of DPL are open DPL and closed DPL.
a)-The open method involves exposure of the peritoneum through a small infraumbilical midline incision and insertion of the lavage catheter into the peritoneal cavity under direct vision.
-This step is followed by aspiration, and if aspirate is grossly negative for blood, 1 liter of warm peritoneal dialysate (or isotonic sodium chloride solution) is infused into the peritoneum. Fluid then is retrieved by gravity siphonage

\section*{Positive DPL:}
1. Presence of RBCs (Blunt injury $>20,000 / \mathrm{ml}$ ); But $>100,000 / \mathrm{ml}$ in penetrating abdominal injury
2. WBCs ( $>500 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ );

3 Bile or feccal matter
4. Food particles;
5. Lavage fluid from the Foley catheter, NGT, or chest tube.
6.Serum Amylase levels $>20 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$
7.Alkaline phosphatase $>10 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$

The closed technique involves blind insertion of the catheter into the peritoneum over the guide wire through a small skin puncture.
4.Tube thoracostomy- is indicated in thoraco abdominal injuries Intra-operative
-Systematic inspection of the abdominal quadrants
-Hollow organs and solid organs
-Retroperironeal structures
-Vessels
-Any immediate bleeding is packed first as inspection continues NB. special attention to the retroperitoneal structures.

Injury to small bowel.
Small laceration-freshen the edges and anastomosis.
If circumferential or large defect - resection of the segment and anastomosis
Large bowel injury
Resect the involved part and fashion a colostomy. Closure of the colostomy after gut preparation in 6 weeks time.

\section*{SPLENIC INJURY}

\section*{Causes;}
1.Blunt abdominal trauma
2.A fall with a diseased or enlarged spleen
3.Fractured overlying ribs - 9, 10, 11
4. Iatrogenic complications of any surgical procedure especially those in the LUQ when adhesions are present.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Peritoneal contamination from GI injury
Rupture of diseased spleen

\section*{PERITONEAL ADHESIONS}

\section*{Introduction \\ Definition}

An adhesion is a band of scar tissue that joins two separate internal body surfaces together.
Adhesions usually occur between two serous membranes which are close together.
Adhesion formation after abdominal and pelvic operations remains extremely common and is a source of considerable morbidity. Adhesion formation occurs following any procedure, including cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, appendectomy, hysterectomy, colectomy, abdominoperineal resection, and abdominal vascular operations. The operations that frequently lead to adhesive obstruction include colon and rectal surgery, gynecologic procedures, and nonelective appendectomy. The incidence of intraperitoneal adhesions ranges from 67 to $93 \%$ after general surgical abdominal operations and up to $97 \%$ after open gynecologic pelvic procedures.

\section*{Classification}

\section*{Congenial and Acquired}

\section*{A. Congenital Adhesions}

Are present from birth as embryological anomaly in the development of the peritoneal cavity (vitellointestinal bands, adhesions seen across the lesser sac).

\section*{B. Acquired adhesions}

Are subdivided into inflammatory and post-surgical adhesions.

\section*{Inflammatory adhesions}

Arise after intra-abdominal inflammatory processes, such as
- Appendicitis
- acute cholecystitis
- acute diverticulitis
- pelvic inflammatory disease
- Previous use of an intrauterine contraceptive device.

The true proportion of each of these types is not known, but it has been reported that the majority of adhesions are postsurgical.

\section*{Post surgical adhesions}

Results when injured tissue surfaces following incision, cauterization, suturing or other means of trauma, fuse together to form scar tissue.
Recently, it was found that all patients who had undergone at least one prior abdominal surgery developed one to more than ten adhesions.
Factors associated with the formation of post surgical adhesions include:
1.Trauma
2.Thermal injury
3.Infection
4.Ischemia
5. Foreign bodies.

Multiple other factors, including:
-Tight suturing, where tension within the sutured peritoneum produces ischemia, abrasions
-Exposure to foreign bodies such as talc and powders from gloves, lint from abdominal packs, or fibers from disposable paper items, reactive sutures, intestinal contents, overheating by
lamps, or irrigation fluid, may contribute to postoperative adhesion formation
Such adhesions often contain multiple foreign body granulomas. This suggests a relationships between foreign material, foreignbody granulomas, and adhesion formation.

Microscopic examination of adhesions shows in a large proportion both suture and starch granulomas. Suture granulomas are often found in patients who recently underwent surgery

\section*{Clinical Significance}

Importance and Complications from Intraperitoneal Adhesions
Most common complications pf adhesions
- small-bowel obstruction
- difficult reoperative surgery
- chronic abdominal and pelvic pain
- female infertility

Adhesions form between the wound and the omentum in over $80 \%$ of the patients, and they may involve the intestines in $50 \%$ of the patients
Intra-abdominal adhesions are almost inevitable after major abdominal surgery.
Re-operating through a previous wound can be extremely difficult, risky, and potentially dangerous.
Also, adhesiolysis extends operating time, anesthesia, and recovery time and causes additional risks to the patient such as blood loss, visceral damage including injury to the bladder, enterocutaneous fistulas, and resection of damaged bowel.

\section*{Intestinal obstruction}

Adhesions are the most common cause of large and small intestinal obstructions account for approximately one third to one half of all intestinal and for 60-70\% of the small-bowel obstructions
Congenital or inflammatory adhesions rarely give rise to intestinal obstructions, except for malrotation].
However, between 49 and 74\% of the small-bowel obstructions are caused by post surgical adhesions
Extensive soft adhesions will form within 72 h after laparotomy.
These seem most extensive at about 10 days to 2 weeks, by which time they become dense and vascular.
Over 20\% of adhesive obstructions occur within 1 month of surgery, and up to $40 \%$ occur within 1 year .
Obstruction by adhesions is usually the result of kinking or angulation or by creating bands of tissue that compress the bowel .
Impairment of the local circulation of the small intestine due to strangulation is caused by adhesions in $30 \%$ of the cases.
Although it is not clear how often adhesive obstruction recurs after conservative or surgical treatment, it is well known that adhesions create a lifetime risk of intestinal obstruction. An operation for obstruction due to adhesions carries a higher likelihood of recurrence than a laparotomy for other indications. The problem of postsurgical adhesions increases with the patient's age, the number of laparotomies, and the complexity of surgical procedures.
Simple adhesive obstruction may be resolved without surgicalintervention in the majority of the cases, in contrast to other forms of obstruction. According to recent series, up to $80 \%$ of episodes of partial small-bowel obstruction caused by adhesions resolve nonoperatively

Adhesions more likely to become obstructive are those involving the small intestine; however, intestinal adhesions occur less frequently than those involving the omentum.
Most of the patients with adhesive intestinal obstructions have been found to have had surgery in the infracolic part of the abdomen, where the loops of small intestine adhere and become obstructed

\section*{Gynecologic Considerations and Sterility}
-Abdominal hysterectomy is among the most commonly performed operations contributing to intestinal obstruction associated with postoperative adhesions.
-Myomectomy is associated with a high degree of adnexal adhesions, especially after incision performed on the posterior uterine wall.
-Surgical treatment of gynecologic malignancy, such as ovarian cancer debulking surgery, may commonly be associated with intestinal obstruction either by persistent tumor growth or by postoperative adhesions
-The incidence of adhesions can increase with postoperative radiation therapy .
-Also, postoperative adhesions have been implicated in inadequate distribution of chemotherapeutic regimens when they are given interaperitoneally for treatment of ovarian carcinoma -Endometriosis is associated with fibrous adhesion formation following conservative surgical procedures and excision of ovarian endometriomas. Fibrous adhesions often form as a response to chronic irritation of the peritoneal surface by the endometriotic implant and its secretory products.
- Fifteen to $20 \%$ of female infertility is caused by adhesions peritubal as well as intratubal adhesions may affect tubal motility and ovum transport.
The slowing of or preventing the embryo from reaching the uterus may lead to either infertility or an ectopic pregnancy. Chronic pelvic pain is one of the sequelae of intra peritoneal adhesions. They were thought to be caused from increased tension, stretching, and traction of pelvic organs which stimulate peritoneal pain receptors and from the restriction of the mobility or expansibility of pelvic organs

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Peritoneal healing differs from that of skin. Skin re epithelialization takes place through proliferation of epithelial cells from the periphery toward the center of the skin wound. By contrast, the peritoneum becomes mesothelialized simultaneously, and regardless of the size of the injury, with new mesothelium developing from islands of mesothelial cells which later proliferate into sheets of cells. Thus, Larger peritoneal wounds remesothelialize about as quickly as small peritoneal wounds, within 5-6 days for the parietal peritoneum and within 5-8 days for the visceral mesothelium
The key site in adhesion formation is the surface lining of the peritoneum. The delicacy of the peritoneal surface and its subsequent susceptibility to damage as well as the rapid rate of remesothelialization within 5-8 days are important factors in adhesion formation.
Various other traumatic factors such as ischemia caused by grafting or suturing of peritoneal defects, the use of retractors by their mechanical effects of pressure, crushing, stripping, excessive handling of the peritoneum,the presence of foreign materials (starch powder), inflammation-induced peritonitis,
intraperitoneal blood, and serosal drying can inhibit fibrinolysis and lead to adhesion formation
Injury or inflammation of the peritoneum triggers a coagulative state at the beginning of post surgical peritoneal repair that releases multiple chemical messengers at the injury site.
Leukocytes, mesothelial cells, and fibrin play a major role in this cascade of events.
Also present in the peritoneal cavity prior to surgery is a small amount of fluid that contains macrophages and plasma proteins containing a large amount of fibrinogen
Following surgery, the macrophages increase in number and change function. These postsurgical macrophages are entirely different from the resident macrophages and secrete variable substances including
- cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites,
- plasminogen activator
- plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)
- collagenase, elastase
- interleukins (IL) 1 and 6 , tumor necrosis factor (TNF),leukotriene B4, prostaglandin E2
Postsurgical intraperitoneal macrophages recruit new mesothelial cells onto the surface of the injury. These mesothelial cells proliferate injured area which will lead to peritoneal remesothelialization
The organization of the fibrin gel matrix is of major importance in adhesion formation. This matrix forms in several steps, beginning from fibrinogen to fibrin monomer, then to soluble fibrin polymer, theninsoluble fibrin polymer.
This last product interactswith proteins, including fibronectin, to form the fibrin gel matrix.
The fibrin gel matrix includes leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, endothelium, epithelium, mast cells, and cellular and surgical debris.
Two damaged peritoneal surfaces coming into apposition while covered with fibrin gel matrix may form an adhesion, not only at the time of surgical injury, but also during the next $3-5$ days. Finally, adhesions will mature into fibrous bands containing collagen, elastin fibers, and blood vessels and may be lined by mesothelial cells.

\section*{Management and Strategies for Adhesion Prevention}
a).Adjusting surgical techniques
-meticulous hemostasis are necessary to avoid presence of free blood and ischemic tissues which provide a source of fibrin. -careful and delicate handling of the bowel in order to reduce severe trauma
-keeping tissues moist with irrigation
-avoiding large abdominal wounds and unnecessary dissection -micro and atraumatic instruments to reduce serosal injury. Surgical techniques summary:
1 Tissue injury
2 Peritoneal suturing
3 Foreign material
4 Sponges
5 Intraperitoneal blood deposits
6 Minimally invasive surgery
B). Applying adjuvants to decrease adhesion formation Antiadhesion barriers basically fall under two main categories: macromolecular solutions and mechanical devices Barriers

\section*{Solutions}

1 Crystalloids
2 32\% dextran 70
3 Hyaluronic acid
4 HA-PBS/Sepracoat
5 Carboxymethylcellulose
Solids
1 Autologous peritoneal transplants
2 PTFE (Gore-Tex)
3 Oxidized-regenerated cellulose (Interceed)
4 HA-CMC (Seprafilm)
C). Exclusion of foreign-body material from the abdominal cavity Postsurgical coalescing adhesions will form only when both contacting peritoneal surfaces have been traumatized during surgery.

Peritoneal fibrinolytic activity has been hypothesized to play an important role in the pathophysiology of adhesiogenesis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) found in mesothelial cells is an important natural defense against postsurgical adhesion formation. The active enzyme plasmin, which is produced from the inactive plasminogen by the tPA and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, degrades the fibrin gel matrix into fibrin split products which have no effect on adhesion formation. Fibrinous adhesions are lysed, if local fibrinolysis is sufficient; Hypofibrinolytic activity and increased adhesion formation At sites of surgical or inflammatory injury, increased levels of PAI1 and PAI2 prevent tpA and urokinase plasminogen activator from stimulating plasmin to remove the fibrin gel matrix.

Inadequate blood supply and reduced tissue oxygenation, occurring frequently with surgical injury, inhibit fibrinolysis and decrease fibrinolytic activity, allowing the fibroproliferative structure to persist, leading to fibrovascular adhesion development

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Manage the complication eg intestinal obstruction.
Surgery may not be done to remove non cpmlicating adhesions as surgery causes more adhesions formation.
Adhesion removal (adhesiolysis) can be done laparascopically or by open surgery laparatomy.

Some drugs under investigations for the prevention of adhesions include:
1 NSAIDs
2 Corticosteroids
3 Antihistamines
4 Progesterone/estrogen
5 Anticoagulants
6 Fibrinolytics
7 Antibiotics

\section*{POST OPERATIVE CARE OF THE SURGICAL PATIENT AND COMPLICATIONS OF SURGERY}

\section*{POST OPERATIVE CARE:}

The care of a patient who has had a surgical procedure in order to prevent, detect and or handle complications that may arise, with main objectives being reduction in morbidity and mortality from surgery and anesthesia.

\section*{PHASES OF POST-OP CARE:}

Three phases are considered.

\section*{Phase I - Immediate post-operative period}

\section*{This can be in either the recovery ward or the Intensive care unit}
(ICU) depending on the patients needs and the nature of the operation done.
a) The recovery ward
i) usually located within the theatre complex
ii) Staff involved - trained nurses assisted by an anaesthetist
ii) Equipment - Monitoring facilities which should include today Pulse Oximeters in addition to e.g Bp machines etc
The recovery room should be ready to deal with immediate life threatening complications eg
haemorrhage, cardiac arrest
Possibility of immediate re-access to theatre.
b) ICU or HDU (High Dependency Unit)

\begin{tabular}{ll} 
ii) & \begin{tabular}{l} 
For patients who need intensive monitoring \\
and life support
\end{tabular} \\
iii) & \begin{tabular}{l} 
The ICU should be easily accessible from \\
theatre
\end{tabular} \\
iv) & ICU care involves anaesthetist (or intensive \\
care specialist), the surgeon and well trained \\
ICU nurses, other supportive staff (lab \\
technicians, physiotherapists etc)
\end{tabular}

Phase II Intermediate
This could be in the ward for patient who was in the recovery ward or sometimes continued in the ICU or HDU for some category of patients.
Phase III Late
This involves rehabilitation and follow up.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION AND POST-OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS}

Proper documentation by the surgeon is important. The operation notes should be written clearly and should be comprehensive.

\section*{The data should include}

Patient details Name, age, sex hospital registration number
Date of operation
Diagnosis

\section*{Operation}

Incision/approach

\section*{Details of the procedure}

Operative findings
Actual surgical procedure performed (detailed)
Name of the surgeon(s) and assistant(s)
Name of anaesthetist (s)
Type of anesthesia used eg general , LA regional etc Name of scrub nurse

The post operative instructions to be followed by others looking after the patient should include - The observations to be taken and how often eg., blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse, temp $\frac{1}{4}$ hourly $\times 2$ hours, then hourly for 4 hours etc.

Special investigations required eg. X-rays of chest,Ultra sound, etc. Blood gases

Post-operative prescriptions for
Drugs (for pain, antibiotics, etc)
Fluids I.V or per other routes
Transfusions etc
Other instructions eg
Feed or not - Nil by mouth
Prop - up in bed
Elevation of limbs etc.

\section*{POST-OP CARE THEREFORE INVOLVES;-}
A) MONITORING
C) PRESCRIPTIONS OR ORDERS TO MAINTAIN, RESTORE NORMAL HOMEOSTASIS OR AVOID COMPLICATIONS

\section*{PAIN RELIEF}

FLUID + ELECTROLYTES
NUTRITION
TRANSFUSIONS
ANTICOAGULATION
ANTI ULCER THERAPY ETC
MONITORING

Is necessary to recognize or detect early any physiological derangements or surgical complications that may occur. It involves:-
a) Clinical observations

Vital signs taken eg $\frac{1}{4}$ hourly or even continuously
General examination of the patient
System oriented approach - physical examination of the various organ systems.
However parameters normally monitored
Eg CVS - Pulse (rate, volume, rhythm), Bp, CVP, ECG
Renal eg urine output
CNS level of consciousness/alertness etc
RS - RR etc (Blood gases etc)
Others output from drains
