\section*{PAIN RELIEF}

Need for pain relief
a) Patient comfort and avoidance of adverse psychological effects.

Its inhuman for anyone to be allowed to undergo pain if something can be
done. "Comfort always, cure sometimes".
b) Avoidance or prevention of pulmonary complications

Pain poor respiratory effort poor effective coughing Inability to clear the airways of secretions (low tidal volume)

Alvelar collapse - lung collapse
- Bronchopneumonia (-hypoxia etc)
c) Avoidance of DVT (Thrombo-embolism).

Pain leads to reluctance to move venous
Stasis DVP ormation Thrombo-embohtm ⟶

\section*{METHODS OF PAIN RELIEF}
1. Intramuscular inj. Of opioids
2. Intravenous infusions
3. Subcutaneous infusions
4. Spinal opioids
5. Rectal opioids
6. Transdermal opioids
9. Local anesthesia
- infiltrations
- nerve blocks
- epidural

\section*{SOME CONCEPTS IN PAIN RELIEF}
1. PRE-EMPTIVE ANALGESIA - To avoid hypersensitisation to painful sensory input and prolongation of duration of pain beyond duration of tissue injury.
2. PATIENT CONTROLLED ANALGESIA (PCA)
- Devise that allows patient to press a button that self administers analgesia when required
3. MULTIMODAL ANALGESIA optimizes the pain control and reduces side effects of the individual analgesic

\section*{FLUID . ELECTROLYTES . NUTRITION}

\section*{Consideration of this is important in patients who}
- Have had GIT surgery
- Are very sick - who are unlikely to start feeding immediately.

\section*{In such cases}
1. I.V. fluids
2. Parenteral nutritional support may be necessary
3. Other forms of enteral feeding eg NG tube, jejuostomy etc

\section*{I.V. Fluids:}

Most adults will require about $3 \mathrm{~L} /$ day given usually as $500 \mathrm{mls} / 4$ hourly eg as 5\% dextrose alternating with Hartmans solution. NB with increased losses eg from drains this is adjusted upwards accordingly.

\section*{Electrolytes}

Esp $\mathrm{K}+$ is important in patients who are not feeding as urine losses continue hence K+ supplementation may be necessary.

Nutritional Supplements
If the non feeding phase is prolonged especially with pre-existing malnutrition, TPN through a entral line to give nutritional supplements or other form of nutritional supplementaion.

\section*{OTHERS}

\section*{POST -OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS}
"Regardless of how technically gifted, bright, and capable a surgeon is, surgical complications are a virtually guaranteed aspect of life".
"The possibility of post-operative complications is a part of every surgeon"s thought process - something with which all surgeons will be required to deal’.
"strive for the best but be prepared for the worst".
- After every operation, complications may occur which if not recognized early and acted upon can cause morbidity or even death.
- Complications may be related to the disease process per se, or errors of omission or commission in technique.

Can be classified as
i) a) General complications related to any surgical procedure or anesthesia
b) Complications associated with specified operations
ii) Classify by organ systems eg. Renal, cardiac etc
iii) Chronologic approach eg early, intermidiate, or late

\section*{GENERAL POST OP COMPLICATIONS}
1. HAEMORRHAGE

Post-operative bleeding may be internal External (wound)

Early
Delayed
Reasons for post.op bleeding
i) Poor surgical technique
ii) Coagulation problems
a) Thrombocytopenia (after over transfusion of stored blood CPB)
b) DIC
c) Missed mild coagulations defects (underlying medical conditions).
* Some surgical conditions are associated with increased tendency to bleeding eg
Obstructive jaundice, post open heart surgery.
* Prevention of bleeding can be achieved by:
a) Careful Pre-operative assessment (good history, physical exam and investigations to rule out bleeding disorders (congenital or acquired) and proper pre-operative preparation of patients.
b) Proper surgical techniques.

\section*{2. THROMBO-EMBOLIC EVENTS}

\section*{Incidence not clear but may be responsible for 12-15\% of deaths in}
critical care situations.
Majority of cases death occurs before diagnosis of DVT is made.
* High index of suspicion and prevention are vital.

\section*{Aetiology:}

Stasis, initial injury, hyperioagulation states. (Virchow's triad) may exist in surgical conditions eg

Patient undergoing surgery who is supine for long time, paralysed during anesthesia hence pooling of blood in soleal sinuses with vasodilator effect of G.A (Stasis) coupled with hypercoaguable state in some surgical conditions, especially obesity, cancer, chronic venous insufficiency, long operations.

Signs of DVT may include tenderness, swelling pain on movement and fever.

\section*{Diagnosis Doppler u/s + venography etc}

\section*{POSTERIOR FOSSA TUMORS}

Tumors in the posterior fossa are considered some of the most critical brain lesions. This is due primarily to the limited space within the posterior fossa, as well as the potential involvement of the vital brain stem nuclei.
Some patients should undergo operation on an emergency basis, especially if they present with acute symptoms of brain stem involvement or herniation.

\section*{Occurrence}

Posterior fossa tumors are more common in children than the adult populations.
Between 54\% and 70\% of all childhood brain tumors originate in the posterior fossa.
About 15-20\% of brain tumors in adults occur in the posterior fossa.
Certain types of posterior fossa tumors, such as medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, ependymomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), and astrocytomas of the cerebellum and brain stem, occur more frequently in children.

\section*{Etiology:}

No specific causes for posterior fossa tumors exist. However, genetic factors, such as dysfunction of some tumor suppressor genes (p53 gene) and activation of some oncogenes, may play a role in their development

Pathophysiology: Common types of posterior fossa tumors include the following:

\section*{Cerebellar astrocytoma}

Cystic cerebellar astrocytoma comprises about $33 \%$ of all posterior fossa tumors in children.
It represents $25 \%$ of all pediatric tumors. Average age of presentation is 9 years. Typically, cerebellar astrocytoma presents as a laterally located cyst with a well-defined solid component. It may be solid or cystic. It may be located medially in the vermis or laterally in the cerebellar hemisphere.

\section*{Primary neuroectodermal tumors}

PNETs include
- Medulloblastomas
- Medulloepitheliomas
- Pigmented medulloblastomas
- Ependymoblastomas
- Pineoblastomas
- Cerebral neuroblastomas.

These tumors originate from a pool of undifferentiated cells in the subependymal region in the fetal brain. PNETs are second to the cerebellar astrocytoma in frequency, comprising 25\% of intracranial tumors in children.

\section*{Medulloblastoma}

Meduloblastoma initially arises in the inferior medullary velum and then grows to fill the fourth ventricle, infiltrating the surrounding structures. It falsely was thought to arise from medulloblast cells, which do not exist. It is better included in the family of PNETs.

\section*{Ependymoma and ependymoblastoma}

Ependymomas are derived from ependymal cells. They occur more frequently in females, with $50 \%$ presenting in people younger than 3 years. Ependymoma has much better prognosis than anaplastic ependymomas (ependymoblastoma). Plastic ependymoma can mold itself to the available spaces inside or outside the ventricle without adhering to the ventricle.

\section*{Choroid plexus papilloma and carcinoma}

Choroid plexus papilloma and carcinoma represent $0.4-0.6 \%$ of all intracranial tumors. They are more frequent in children than in adults (3\% of childhood brain tumors). Sixty percent occur in the lateral ventricle and $30 \%$ in the fourth ventricle. Third ventricle and cerebellopontine angle are rare locations for this type of tumor. Overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that may reach 4 times more than normal occurs. In most of cases, CSF analysis shows increased protein, xanthochromia, or both.

\section*{Dermoid tumors}

Dermoid tumors arise due to incomplete separation of epithelial ectoderm from the neuroectoderm at the region of the anterior neuropore; this usually occurs during the fourth week of gestation. The cyst wall usually includes hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. The cyst grows slowly and gradually becomes filled by desquamated epithelium, sweat, and sebaceous materials. Aseptic meningitis is a sequela of cyst rupture. The cyst is located more commonly in the posterior fossa, at or near the midline. It may be extradural, vermian, or intraventricular. A dermal sinus may be connected to the mass. It may be detected clinically or by MRI.

\section*{Hemangioblastoma}

Hemangioblastoma represents about 7-12\% of all posterior fossa tumors.
About 70\% of hemangioblastomas occurring in the cerebellum are cystic.
Age of presentation is $30-40$ years old. Hemangioblastomas are more common in males. Hemangioblastoma may be associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

\section*{Metastatic tumors}

Three percent and 18\% of all cranial metastatic lesions occur in the brainstem and cerebellum, respectively. Primary sites include breast, lung, skin, and kidney. Solitary metastasis is better treated by surgical removal before radiation therapy. Surgery also should be considered in case of radiosensitive original tumors or when the primary source is unknown.

\section*{Brainstem gliomas}

Brainstem gliomas constitute $15 \%$ of all brain tumors. In children, brainstem glioma represents $25-30 \%$ of all brain tumors. Most brainstem gliomas are low-grade astrocytoma.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

The clinical presentation depends on the site of the tumor and the rate of growth.
Symptoms may be caused by focal compression of the cerebellum or brain stem centers and increase of intracranial pressure.
compression of the brainstem include
- Cranial nerve dysfunction, as with involvement of the nuclei or tracts of the third, fourth, or the sixth cranial nerves; ocular palsies and diplopia;
- Long tract signs (hemiparesis).
focal compression of the cerebellum.
- Truncal ataxia is a common finding in midline tumors eg medulloblastomas, ependymomas and vermian astrocytomas. It will be manifested as tendency to fall frequently and walk with a wide based gait.
- Hemi-cerebellar syndrome involves limb ataxia, nystagmus, and dysmetria.
- Tumors that occur in the cerebellar hemisphere, such as metastases, cerebellar astrocytomas, or cystic hemangioblastomas, may present by ataxia of the contralateral limbs. Nystagmus usually occurs late in the course of the disease. Vertical nystagmus suggests a lesion in the anterior vermis, periaqueductal region, or craniocervical junction. Horizontal nystagmus implies involvement of the cerebellar hemisphere.
Intracranial hypertension causes the following symptoms:
- Headache: It is the most common complaint in patients with posterior fossa tumors.
Associated neck pain, stiffness, or head tilt suggest tonsillar herniation into the foramen magnum. It is insidious and intermittent. It is most severe in the morning or after a nap due to increased intracranial pressure from hypoventilation occurring during sleeping and from recumbency. Headache manifests itself in children as irritability and difficulty to be handled.
- Vomiting: It may be due to generalized intracranial hypertension or due to local irritation of the vagal nuclei in the medulla oblongata or area postrema of the fourth ventricle.
It may be projectile vomiting, usually in the morning. Vomiting sometimes relieves headache.
- Strabismus: It is secondary to sixth nerve palsies from intracranial hypertension. Third nerve palsies may also occur.
- Blurring of vision due to papilledema
- Meningismus
- Dizziness
- Macrocephaly in children
- Hydrocephalus

Patients presenting with posterior fossa tumors undergo surgery for the following reasons:
1. To decompress the posterior fossa for the purpose of relieving pressure on the brain stem and/or to release intracranial pressure and avert the risk of herniation
2. To histopathologically diagnose the tumor
3. To determine further plan of management depending on the nature of the tumor
4. When indicated, to shunt CSF to the peritoneal cavity to treat obstructive hydrocephalus associated with the tumor

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1.Complete blood profile: In some cases of hemangioblastoma, erythrocytosis may be found, presumably from erythropoietic factors secreted by the tumor.
2.Coagulation profile
3.Blood grouping
4. Renal function tests
5.Liver function tests
6.Tumor markers 1) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), (2) alphafetoprotein (AFP), and (3) placental proteins

\section*{Imaging}
1.Plain x-ray skull
-It may show signs of chronic intracranial hypertension-sutural diastesis, copper beaten appearance of inner table, signs of herniation-tentorial, erosion of post. cliniod proceses
-It may show calcification.
-In case of a dermoid cyst, a bone defect with sclerotic margins may be detected.
2.CT scanning: CT scan of the posterior fossa is a limited study because of the artifact produced from the surrounding thick bone.

\section*{3.Cerebral angiography}

Cerebral angiography is useful to assess the vascular supply of the tumor.
With the wide availability of MRI, cerebral angiography is no longer used as the first option in brain tumor assessment.
4.Magnetic resonance imaging-superior

MRI appearance of cerebellar astrocytoma
Intra-axial, either midline or hemispheric, mass Displacement of effacement of the fourth ventricle
Hydrocephalic changes due to obstruction of the CSF pathway
Nodule that usually is enhanced with contrast
Medical therapy: Medications, such as Lasix and corticosteroids, are administered before surgery to reduce the effect of edema on the surrounding structures.

\section*{Surgery}

General operative principles
-Midline incision extends from the inion to the upper cervical vertebra.
-The paracervical and suboccipital muscles are separated by diathermy.
--Craniectomy is performed according to the site and size of the tumor.
-The foramen magnum is opened, and the Cl arch may be removed, especially in tumors extending to, or beyond, the craniocervical junction.
-The dura is opened in Y-shape, with the base upward.
-Bipolar and self-retaining retractors are used for cerebellar cortical incision to expose the tumor.
-Tumors are removed using gentle suction, ultrasonic surgical aspirator.
-The extent of tumor removal should be weighed with the possible risk of complication, especially with tumors adherent to the brainstem.
-The dura is closed in a watertight fashion. Dural grafting may be needed for complete closure

\section*{Late postoperative care}

\section*{Medulloblastoma:}

In this type of tumor, both the brain and spinal cord receive radiation therapy.
Adjuvant chemotherapy also is administered in poor-risk patients with medulloblastoma in the form of cyclophosphamide-cisplatin-vincristine.

\section*{Ependymomas}
craniospinal irradiation should be considered because subarachnoid seeding sometimes is found, especially in the anaplastic type and those in the fourth ventricle. Recurrent cases may be administered adjuvant chemotherapy as bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) and dibromodulcitol.

\section*{Hemangioblastoma}

Complete surgical resection should be the aim of surgery. However, in case of subtotal removal, radiation therapy may be useful to eradicate the residual Complications of the posterior fossa tumors include the following:
1.Lower cranial nerve dysfunction Facial nerve palsy ,Deafness
2.Long tract deficits -Hemiplegia ,Hemiparesis ,Sensory abnormalities
3.Hydrocepahalus
4.Severe compression of brainstem
5.herniation

\section*{Other postoperative complications}

Infection ,Prolonged coma ,Shunt obstruction or malfunction, Chest infection ,Deep venous thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism ,Cerebrospinal fluid leak

\section*{PREPARATION FOR THEATRE OF PATIENT WITH TOXIC GOITRE.}

Preparation is directed to ensure safe induction of anaesthesia and a trouble free intra- and postoperative course.
Thyrotoxic patients need to be rendered euthyroid and the peripheral effects of high circulating levels of thyroxine blocked. Anti-thyroid drugs used are carbimazole and incase of adverse drug reaction then propylthiouracil (expensive) used. Usually administered for between 3-6months.
Carbimazole dose of 20 mg TDS( max dose $60 \mathrm{mg} /$ day )
Howevere if not well controlled can increase dose to 30 mg TDS plus steroid.
Propylthiouracil given at a dose of 100 mg TDS.
To block the adrenergic effects Propanolol is administered at dose of $40-80 \mathrm{mg} \mathrm{BD}$ while monitoring pulse to check on the control.
The antithyroid drugs are stopped 1 week prior to surgery because of their tendency to cause BM suppression and prothrombin deficiency.
Propronalol continued until the morning before surgery or until induction of anaesthesia
For very vascular goiters then lugols iodine may be administered from I week before surgery to reduce hyepervascularity of the gland.

\section*{Base line preparations}
1. Hemoglobin estimation
2. U/E/creatinine
3. Chest radiology and ECG
4. GXM blood

\section*{Other investigations required:}

\section*{1.CT scan}

Of the neck and thoracic inlet. Indications
✓ Incase the enlargement is massive or retrosternal
✓ patient shows clinical signs of respiratory embarrassment or superior vena caval obstruction
Indicate the possible need to enter the chest and potential problems which may be encountered on intubation.

\section*{2. Indirect laryngoscopy}
to determine before surgery whether or not the vocal cords are moving normally. Especcially is malignancy and invasion of vocal cords suspected -horseness of voice or previous history of thryroid surgery.

\section*{COMPLICATION OF SURGERY}

\section*{Hypoparathyroidism}

The serum calcium level should be monitored postop Patients may develop vague lethargy and depression, insidious cataracts, mental deterioration, and psychosis. Hypocalcaemia due to parathyroid deficiency will usually be evident within 1 week of operation
Suspected if the patient appears unduly agitated or depressed or hyperventilates.

\section*{Other signs}

Circumoral tingling first and most sensitive indicator of a low serum calcium

Paraesthesia in the fingers and toes preceding frank tetany is seen when hypocalcaemia is profound.
Chvostek- Weiss sign Tapping over the facial nerve will cause contraction of the facial muscles
Trousseau's sign- Carpopedal spasm, provoked by occlusion of the circulation to the arm

\section*{Treatment}
1. Intravenous infusion of 10 ml of $10 \%$ calcium gluconate (given slowly to avoid cardiac arrest in systole)
This infusion may need to be repeated every 4 to 6 h .
2. Oral effervescent calcium should also be administered 4 to 6 g daily, depending on response.
If hypocalcaemia persists, vitamin D (calciferol 25 000-100,000 units) plus 2 to 3 g oral calcium per day are given until a normocalcaemic state is achieved.
Signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia will recur in these patients at times of metabolic stress, such as pregnancy or the menopause.

\section*{Thyroid crisis}

This is now very rare, with the improved methods of control of thyrotoxicosis, but when fully expressed, is characterized by high fever, tachycardia (atrial fibrillation), extreme restlessness, and delirium.
High doses of antithyroid drugs (Neo Mercazole (carbimazole) 30 mg immediately and then 15 mg 8 -hourly), plus 1 g of sodium iodide IV should be given promptly.
Propranolol ( 2 mg ) is slowly infused IV, with electrocardiographic control.
Fluid replacement, ice pack cooling, and sedation may help to abort the crisis.

\section*{PRESSURE ULCERS}

Also decubitus, from the Latin decumbere, means "to lie down." Thus describes ulcers due to prolonged lying on bed not other types of pressure ulcers.

\section*{Frequency}

At any given time, $3-10 \%$ of hospitalized persons have pressure sores and $2.7 \%$ develop new pressure
Pressure sores also occur with a higher frequency in neurologically impaired young patients.
Immobility and lack of sensation make these patients susceptible to developing pressure sores

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The primary pathophysiological event is chronic pressure on skin over a bony prominence.
Tissue ischaemia follows, producing areas of necrosis with ulceration that are susceptible to infection.
Friction and prolonged contact with urine or faeces are additional predisposing factors.
These pressures often are in excess of capillary filling pressure, approximately 32 mm Hg .
Tissues are capable of withstanding enormous pressures when brief in duration, but prolonged pressure leads to ischemia, tissue necrosis and ulceration. Irreversible changes may occur during as little as 2 hours of uninterrupted pressure.
In patients with normal sensitivity, mobility, and mental faculty, pressure sores do not occur. Feedback, both conscious and unconscious, from the areas of compression leads to change in position.
This shifts the pressure from one area to another prior to any irreversible ischemic damage to the tissues.
The elderly, the neurologically impaired, and patients hospitalized with acute illness are more at risk.

\section*{Sites}

Anatomically, the hip and buttock region account $>67 \%$ of all pressure sores. Most common areas:
- Ischial tuberosity
- Trochanteric
- Sacral locations

The lower extremities account for an additional $25 \%$ of all pressure sores with malleolar, heel, patellar, and pretibial locations being most common.
The remaining approximately $10 \%$ of pressure sores may occur in any location that experiences long periods of uninterrupted pressure. Nose, chin, forehead, occiput, chest, back, and elbow are among the infrequent sites for pressure ulceration. There is no surface of the body that may be considered immune to the ischemic effects of unrelieved pressure, but ulcers most often occur over a bony prominence.

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity}

Pressure sores are listed as the direct cause of death in 7-8\% of all patients with paraplegia.

\section*{Sex}

Most younger individuals suffering from pressure ulceration are males. This reflects the greater number of men suffering
traumatic spinal cord injuries. In the older population, most patients are women because of their survival advantage over men

\section*{Age:}

The prevalence of pressure sores appears to have a bimodal age distribution. A small peak occurs during the third decade of life, reflecting ulceration in those with traumatic neurologic injury, and a much larger peak occurs during the eighth decade of life. Two thirds of pressure sores occur in patients older than 70 years.

\section*{History}

When initially evaluating a patient with pressure ulceration, it is important to note the following information from the history: Overall physical and mental health including
-Presence of neurological deficits-sensory loss hx of spinal trauma or head trauma, pelvic fractures etc.
- Fecal and urinary continence
- Presence of spasticity or flexion contractures
-How long the admission has been and nursing care-turning, ripple mattress, pneumatic mattress
Average number of hours spent sitting or lying down per day.
-Prior hospitalizations, operations, or ulcerations
-Chronic illness hypertension and diabetis mellitus
-Diet and recent weight changes
-Medications and allergies to medications
-Tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug use If developed at home
-Place of residence and the support surface used in bed or while sitting
-Level of independence, mobility, and ability to comprehend and cooperate with care
-Underlying social and financial support structure
-Presence of specific cultural, religious, or ethnic issues All cases presence of signs or symptoms related to the current ulceration
- Pain
- Fever
- Discharge
- Odor

Natural history of the present ulcer
- Length of time the ulcer has been present
- Local treatments employed

\section*{Physical:}

A thorough physical examination is necessary to evaluate the overall state of health, comorbidities, nutritional status, and mental status of the patient.
The level of comprehension and cooperation indicate the intensity of nursing care that will be required.
The presence of contractures or spasticity is important to note and may help identify additional areas at risk for pressure ulceration.
Neurological examination especially sensory examination Following the general physical examination, turn attention to the wound.
Adequate examination of the wound may require the administration of intravenous or oral pain medications to ensure patient comfort.
Chronic pain is common among these patients and may be exacerbated by ulcer examination.

Shea, the most widely accepted system describe the degree of tissue damage observed at the specific time of examination

\section*{Stage I}

Represents intact skin with signs of impending ulceration. Initially, this presents as blanchable erythema indicating reactive hyperemia.
Reactive hyperemia should resolve within 24 hours of the relief of pressure. Warmth and induration also may be present.
Continued pressure creates erythema that does not blanch with pressure and may well represent the first outward sign of tissue destruction.
Finally, the skin may appear white from ischemia.

\section*{Stage II}

Represents a partial thickness loss of skin involving epidermis and possibly dermis. This lesion may present as an abrasion, blister, or superficial ulceration.

\section*{Stage III}

Represents a full thickness loss of skin with extension into subcutaneous tissue but not through the underlying fascia.
This lesion presents as an ulcer with or without undermining of adjacent tissue.

\section*{Stage IV}

Represents extension into muscle, bone, tendon, or joint capsule. Osteomyelitis with bone destruction and dislocations or pathologic fractures may be present. Sinus tracts and severe undermining commonly are present NB
The presence of an eschar or necrotic material does not allow adequate assessment of wound depth until the eschar or necrotic material is removed.
Necrosis may begin deep within the tissues in the absence of an outward sign thus just small ulceration on the skin may just be tip of the iceberg.
Examination of ulcer
- Size of the skin opening
- Floor
- Edges
- Presence of any surrounding maceration or induration.
- presence or absence of foul odors
- wound drainage
- soilage from urinary or fecal incontinence.

\section*{Etiology}
1. Impaired mobility is probably the most common reason patients are exposed to uninterrupted pressure. Predisposed patients are
- Neurologically impaired
- Heavily sedated or anesthetized
- Restrained
- Demented
- Traumatic injury such as a pelvic or femur fracture These patients are incapable of assuming the responsibility of altering their position to relieve pressure.
Moreover, this immobility, if prolonged, leads to muscle and soft tissue atrophy, decreasing the bulk over which bony prominences are supported.
2. Contractures and spasticity often contribute by repeatedly exposing tissues to trauma through flexion of a joint. Contractures rigidly hold a joint in flexion, while spasticity subjects tissues to repeated friction and shear forces.
3. The inability to perceive pain, from neurologic impairment or medication, contributes to pressure ulceration by removing one of the most important stimuli for repositioning and pressure relief.

Conversely, pain from surgical incisions, fracture sites, or other sources may make the patient unwilling to change position.
4. Skin quality also affects whether pressure leads to ulceration. Paralysis, insensibility and aging lead to atrophy of the skin with thinning of this protective barrier.
A decrease in epidermal turnover, flattening of the dermalepidermal junction, and loss of vascularity occur. The skin becomes more susceptible to minor traumatic forces, such as friction and shear forces typically exerted during the moving of a patient. Trauma causing de-epithelialization removes the barrier to bacterial contamination and leads to transdermal water loss, creating maceration and adherence of the skin to clothing and bedding.

\section*{5. Incontinence or presence of a fistula}

Cause the skin to be continually moist, leading to maceration. Also chemical irritation from the urine, soiling has the effect of regularly introducing bacteria to the wound.
6. Bacterial contamination from improper skin care or urinary or fecal incontinence, while not truly an etiologic, factor is an important element to consider in the treatment of pressure sores and can delay wound healing.
These wounds serve as warm, moist reservoirs for bacterial overgrowth where antibiotic resistance may develop as a result of the injudicious use of antibiotics.
Pressure sores may progress from being simply contaminated, as all open wounds are, to being seriously infected, which indicates tissue invasion by bacteria. This may lead to uncommon but lifethreatening complications such as sepsis, myonecrosis, gangrene, or necrotizing fasciitis

\section*{7. Malnutrition, hypoproteinemia, and anemia}

Reflect the overall status of the patient and can contribute to tissue vulnerability to trauma as well as cause delayed wound healing.
Poor nutritional status certainly contributes to the chronicity often seen in these lesions and inhibits the ability of the immune system to prevent infections. Anemia indicates poor oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Vascular disease and hypovolemia also may impair blood flow to the region of ulceration.

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1) CBC with differential
2) Electrolyte determination
3) Evaluation of nutritional parameters-Albumin, Prealbumin, Transferrin, Serum protein level
4) Urinalysis and culture in the presence of urinary incontinence
5) Stool examination for fecal white blood cells and Clostridium difficile toxin when pseudomembranous colitis may be the cause of fecal incontinence
6) Blood cultures if bacteremia or sepsis is suggested
7) Pus swab for the ulcer for M/C and sensitivity
8) Biopsy the chronic ulcers to rule out underlying malignancy

\section*{TREATMENT}

\section*{Medical Care}
1. Relieve pressure

The first step in healing is to reduce or eliminate the cause, ie, pressure. Turning and repositioning the patient remains the cornerstone of prevention and treatment through pressure relief. Perform this every 2 hours

\section*{2. Wound cleaning}

The wound must be kept clean and free of urine and feces. The surrounding intact skin must be kept clean and dry.
This should be done through frequent inspection and cleansing. Urethral catheterization and urinary incontinence secondary to urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics.
Manual disimpaction and the addition of stool bulking agents to the diet may relieve overflow fecal incontinence
Fecal incontinence secondary to diarrhea may be related to an infectious cause such as $C$ difficile pseudomembranous colitis that will resolve with appropriate antibiotics.

\section*{3.Wound dressings}

Vary with the state of the wound, and the goal is to achieve a clean, a moist environment to facilitate healing wound with granulation tissue and reepithelialization
Topical antibiotics may be applied with the dressing in infected wounds e g silver sulfadiazine

\section*{4. Antibiotics}

Bacterial contamination must be assessed and treated appropriately. Antibiotics also are indicated when accompanying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, bacteremia, or sepsis is present.

\section*{6. Relieve Spasticity}

Use diazepam, baclofen, or dantrolene sodium. Refractory patients are candidates for surgical release of the contractures or neurosurgical ablation

\section*{7. Nutrition}

Nutritional status should be evaluated and optimized to ensure adequate intake of calories, proteins, and vitamins.
This may require dietary supplements, enteral feedings, or even parenteral feedings.

\section*{8.Adequate Analgesia.}

These are directed at preventing vasoconstriction in the wound and optimizing the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Other important aspects include:
a. Cessation of smoking
b. Maintenance of adequate blood volume and correction of anemia.

By medical management, most of the signs of impending ulceration of stage I pressure sores will resolve.
Approximately $75 \%$ of stage II pressure sores also will heal with conservative management.
However, stage III and IV ulcers are much less likely to heal spontaneously and often require a surgical approach

\section*{Surgical Care}

Even with optimal medical management, many patients require operative debridement, diversion of urinary or fecal stream, release of flexion contractures, neurosurgical ablation of spasticity, amputation, or reconstruction.
1.Debridement is aimed at removing all devitalized tissue that serves as a reservoir for ongoing bacterial contamination and possible infection
2. Urinary or fecal diversion to prevent frequent bathing of the wound with urine or feces may be necessary in difficult instances where incontinence or fistulas do not resolve with medical therapy.
3. Release of flexion contractures or neurosurgical ablation of spasticity may assist with positioning problems and make tissues over the involved joint less susceptible to further injury.
4. Amputation may be necessary for a nonhealing extremity wound in a patient who is not a candidate for reconstructive surgery.
5. Goals of pressure sore reconstruction
- Improvement of patient hygiene and appearance
- Prevention or resolution of osteomyelitis or infection
- Reduction of fluid and protein loss through the wound
- Prevention of future malignancy (Marjolin ulcer).

Well-vascularized pad of tissue should be placed in the wound to eliminate dead space, enhance perfusion, decrease tension on the wound closure provide a new source of padding over the bony prominence.

\section*{Complications of pressure sores}
1. Autonomic dysreflexia is a disordered autonomic response to specific stimuli. Includes sweating, flushing, nasal congestion, headache, intermittent hypertension, piloerection, and bradytachycardia.
The most common precipitating factors are bladder distension and fecal impaction.
2.Osteomyelitis
3.Pyarthrosis of the hip joint can occur with communication of ischial or trochanteric ulcers.
4. Recurrence of pressure sores due to patient noncompliance, seromas, hematomas, wound infections, and dehiscence.
5. Pressure sores can also erode into the urethra causing a urethral fistula. Management involves urinary diversion. Pressure sore reconstruction can be considered once the fistula has healed 6. Marjolin ulcer has been used interchangeably for malignant transformation of any chronic wound, including pressure sores, osteomyelitis, venous stasis ulcers, urethral fistulas, anal fistulas, and other traumatic wounds.
From pressure sores is usually more aggressive than any other chronic wound

\section*{PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA}

\section*{History:}

The initial patient interview is extremely important in the evaluation for POAG or other ocular diseases secondarily causing elevated IOP.
Because of the silent nature of the disease, patients usually will not present with any visual complaints until late in the course.
Therefore, attention should be given to the following:
-History of eye pain or redness
_Multicolored halos
-Headache
-Previous ocular disease including
- Cataracts
- Uveitis
- Diabetic retinopathy
- Vascular occlusions
-Previous ocular surgery, including photocoagulation or refractive procedures
-Ocular/head trauma
-Past medical history - Any surgeries or pertinent vasculopathic systemic illnesses
-Current medications, including any hypertensive medications (which may indirectly cause fluctuation of IOP) or topical/systemic corticosteroids
-Risk factors for glaucomatous optic neuropathy
- Family history

Possible implications are as follows:
Systemic cardiovascular disease
Diabetes mellitus
Migraine headache
Systemic hypertension
Vasospasm
Anecdotal risk factors Obesity, Smoking, Alcohol ,History of stress, Anxiety

\section*{Physical:}
- Compare visual acuity with previous known acuities. If declining, rule out secondary causes of vision loss, whether it is from cataracts, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), ocular surface disorders (eg, dry eye), or adverse effects from topical medications (especially if using miotics).
- Pupils - Test for presence/absence of afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil).
- Slit lamp examination of the anterior segment
- Cornea - Signs of microcystic edema (found only with acute elevation of IOP); keratic precipitates, pigment on endothelium (Krukenberg spindle); congenital anomalies
- Anterior chamber - Cell or flare, uveitis, hyphema, angle closure
- Iris - Transillumination defects, iris atrophy, synechiae, rubeosis, ectropion uveae, iris bombe,
difference in iris coloration bilaterally (eg, Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis), pseudoexfoliation (PXF) material
- Lens - Cataract progression (ie, signs of phacomorphic glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation, phacolytic glaucoma with a Morgagnian cataract)
- Optic nerve/nerve fiber layer - Stereoscopically examine for evidence of glaucomatous damage, including the following: cup-to-disc ratio in horizontal and vertical meridians (describe by color and slope, and diagram, if needed); appearance of disc; progressive enlargement of the cup; evidence of nerve fiber layer damage with red-free filter; notching or thinning of disc rim, particularly at superior and inferior poles (because nerve fibers at the superior and inferior poles of the disc can often be affected first); pallor; presence of hemorrhage (most common inferotemporally); asymmetry between discs; parapapillary atrophy (possible association with development of glaucoma); or congenital nerve abnormalities.
- Fundus - Other abnormalities that could account for any nonglaucomatous visual field defects or vision loss present (eg, disc drusen, optic pits, retinal disease), vitreous hemorrhage, or proliferative retinopathy.
- Baseline stereo fundus photographs for future reference/comparison; if unavailable, record representative drawings.
- Tonometry
- IOP varies from hour-to-hour in any individual. The circadian rhythm of IOP usually causes it to rise most in the early hours of the morning; IOP also rises with a supine posture.
- When checking IOP, measurements for both eyes, the method used (Goldmann applanation is the criterion standard), and the time of the measurement should all be recorded.
- Previous tonometry readings, if available, should be reviewed (eg, Is the reading reproducible? What method was used to obtain the reading? What time of the day was it? Where does it fall on the diurnal pressure curve? Do both eyes have similar measurements?).
- In obese patients, the possibility of a Valsalva movement causing an increased IOP should be considered when measured in the slit lamp by Goldman applanation. Measurement should be tried via Tono-Pen, Perkins, or pneumotonometer with the patient resting back in the examination chair.
- A difference between the 2 eyes of 3 mm Hg or more indicates greater suspicion of glaucoma. An average of 10\% difference between individual measurements should be expected. The measurements should be repeated on at least 2-3 occasions before deciding on a treatment plan. The measurement should be completed in the morning
and at night to check the diurnal variation, if possible. (A diurnal variation of more than 5-6 mm Hg may be suggestive of increased risk for POAG.) Early POAG is suspected strongly when a steadily increasing IOP is present.
- Perform gonioscopy to rule out angle-closure or secondary causes of IOP elevation, such as angle recession, pigmentary glaucoma, and PXF.
- Check the peripheral contour of the iris for plateau iris, and examine the trabecular meshwork for peripheral anterior synechiae, as well as neovascular or inflammatory membranes.
- The Schlemm canal may be seen with blood refluxing through the canal into the posterior trabecular meshwork. This possibly could indicate elevated episcleral venous pressure, with such conditions as carotid-cavernous fistula, Graves orbitopathy, or Sturge-Weber syndrome needing to be ruled out.
- Pachymetry: Pachymetry is used to measure CCT. According to the OHTS, pachymetry is now the criterion standard for every baseline examination in patients who are at risk for or suspected of having glaucoma (see Image 11).
- Visual field testing
- Perform automated threshold testing (eg, Humphrey 24-2) to rule out any glaucomatous visual field defects.
- If the patient is unable to perform automated testing, Goldmann testing may be substituted.
- Caveats about visual field analysis are outlined below. (See Other Tests.)

\section*{PROBLEMS OF ILEOSTOMIES}

Physiologic changes after ileostomy are due to the loss of the water- and salt-absorbing capacity of the colon.
If the small bowel is free of disease and extensive resection has not been done, an ileostomy puts out $1-2 \mathrm{~L}$ of fluid per day initially.
The volume of effluent diminishes to between 500 and $800 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{d}$ after a month or two.
This loss of fluid is obligatory and is not reduced by manipulations of diet.
Obligatory sodium losses are about $50 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{d}$ and potassium losses are also increased.
Healthy ileostomy patients have low total exchangeable sodium and potassium but normal serum electrolyte concentrations. The depletion, therefore, is primarily intracellular.
The patient with an ileostomy is susceptible to acute or subacute salt and water depletion manifested by fatigue, anorexia, irritability, headache, drowsiness, muscle cramps, and thirst. Patients should be counseled to salt food liberally, but salt tablets will not be required in usual circumstances. Patients with unusually high ileostomy outputs may need supplemental potassium in the form of bananas or orange juice. Water intake in response to thirst may not be adequate to maintain hydration, and patients should consume enough water to keep the urine pale or to maintain a urine output of at least $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{d}$.
Nutritional loss depending on the amount of the small intestine resected.

\section*{Other complications}
(1) Intestinal obstruction: Obstruction may be due to adhesive bands, volvulus, or paraileostomy herniation of bowel.
(2) Stenosis: Circumferential scar formation at the skin or subcutaneous level is usually at fault. Stenosis may cause profuse watery discharge from the ileostomy. Treatment requires a minor local procedure to release the scar.
(3) Retraction: The stoma should protrude $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the skin level to avoid leakage beneath the ileostomy pouch. Retracted stoma functions poorly and should be revised.
(4) Prolapse: This is uncommon if the mesentery has been sutured to the parietal peritoneum.
(5) Paraileostomy abscess and fistula: Perforation of the ileum by sutures, pressure necrosisfrom an ill-fitted appliance, or recurrent disease may cause abscess and fistula.
(6) Skin irritation: This is the single most common complication of ileostomy and is due to leakage of ileal effluent onto the peristomal skin; it is usually minor but can be very severe if neglected.
Treatment is directed toward the cause of leakage, usually an illfitted pouch.
Protection of the skin by a barrier material (eg, karaya [Sterculia] gum, or a variety of synthetic products will resolve the problem.
(7) Offensive odors: Odor-proof appliances, commercial deodorants placed in the appliance, and attention to diet usually control the problem.
(8) Diarrhea:Excessive output should be reported to the physician promptly, and supplemental water, salt, and potassium should be given. Codeine, diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil), or loperamide (Imodium) may slow the output. Recurrent intestinaldisease, bowel obstruction, or ileostomy stenosis should be looked for.
9.Urinary tract calculi: Uric acid and calcium stones occur in about $5-10 \%$ of patients after ileostomy and are probably the esult of chronic dehydration due to inadequate fluid intake. Ileostomy is associated with lower urinary pH and volume and higher urinary concentration of calcium, oxalate, and uric acid than an intact gastrointestinal tract
10) Gallstones: Cholesterol gallstones are three times more common in ileostomy patients than in the general population. Altered bile acid absorption preoperatively may be responsible.
(11) Ileitis: Patients who develop inflammation $f$ the ileum just proximal to the ileostomy usually have recurrence of their original inflammatory bowel disease. Stenosis of the stoma is another cause.

\section*{PROSTATE CANCER}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMNT}

\section*{Symptoms and Signs:}

Stage 1 carcinoma of the prostate presents no physical signs (it is non-palpable) may be picked TRUS or PSA monitoring. Stage 2 or higher disease has a hard nodule on the prostate that can be felt during rectal examination.
Only advanced disease (stage 3 and 4) gives rise to S/S usually within 6months
1) Obstructive symptoms incomplete emptying, weak stream, intermittency ,strain
2) Irritative symptoms urgency, frequency ,nocturia, urge incontinence
3) Advanced disease with complications
- Renal failure with lower limb edema
- Limb swelling due to lymph edema
- Pelvic pain \& haematuria
- Lumbar masses-hydronephrosis
4) Evidence of metastases/advanced disease.
- Weight loss, night sweat., Anemia
- Bone pain ( in the lumbosacral area)
- Acute neurologic deficit in the lower limbsprolapse disc

\section*{DRE}

Signs of malignancy
1) Prostate enlargement .If cant get above $>70 \mathrm{~g}$
2) Gland asymmetry
3) Median sulcus obliteration
4) Fixity of prostate mucosa and the overlying rectal mucosa
5) Nodularity
6) Woody hard prostate
7) Tenderness
8) Blood on the examining finger

Since only the peripheral zone is accessible to digital rectal examination, tumors confined to the central or transitional zones may be missed.

\section*{Laboratory investigations}
1. FHG-Extensive metastases may have anemia due to bone marrow replacement by tumor or anaemia of chronic disease.

\section*{-Urinalysis-r/o UTI}
2. U/E/C-Uremia due to obstructive uropathy-CRF hydroneprosis.

\section*{3.Alkaline phosphatase-in bone metastasis}

Osteoblastic reaction in bone due to metastasis.
Acid phosphatase increase in relation to the volume of the prostate.
4. PSA-Both diagnostic and for to get baseline to follow up during treatment.
PSA is age dependent: Normal below $4 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$
0-49yrs below $2.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$
50-59yrs below $3.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$
60-69yrs below $4.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$
$>70 \mathrm{yrs}$ below 6.5

\section*{Chances of CA based on PSA figures}

\section*{Imaging Studies}
1.Transrectal ultrasound

Has become the most accurate diagnostic imaging study, revealing typical hyper-echoic peripheral zone. Also
a) Size of the prostate
b) Can be used to guide biopsy
c) Local staging
2. Abdominal U/S state of kidney and ureters in advanced disease. Estimation of residual urine.
2. An intravenous urogram (IVU) may reveal urinary retention or distal ureteral obstruction. Extensive lesions may exhibit a ragged-edged filling defect in the bladder base
4. .Lumbosacral x-ray may reveal metastases in the lumbosacral spine or ilium
5. CT- Scan of the pelvis may show enlarged prostate and large pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes. Used in staging
6. MRI -more helpful in pelvic staging of prostate cancer than is CT scan.
Useful in neurological deficits due to metastasis
7. Bone Scan Isotopic (technetium Tc 99m) bone scan will rule out bone metastases
8. CXR may identify uncommon lung metastases but more often shows typical osteoblastic metastases in the thoracic spine or ribs

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
1.Bladder neck stenosis- trauma,congenital
2.Carcinoma bladder neck
3.Bladder calculi
4.Neurogenic bladder
5.Bladder clots
6.Urethral strictures
7.Urethritis -UTI
9.Benign prostatic enlargement
10.Chronic prostatitis
11.Prostatic calculi

\section*{Biopsy}
1. TRUS-guided transrectal biopsies (Trucut biopsy) are quite accurate for diagnosis when typical hypoechoic areas are identified.
Procedure
-Evacuate rectum
-Antibiotic prophylaxis

Ciprofloxacin -500 mg
Gentamycin - 160 mg
-Gets the cells plus the surrounding stroma for the architecture
-Can be done in lateral or supine position
-Sextants-six different quadrants
-Put in formalin and send for histology
-Can leave a pack with betadine in the rectum for some hours
2. Transrectal needle aspiration and cytologic studies may be used but less appropriate compared to biopsy.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Dependent on -Stage of tumor
Early disease- (Stage 1 and 2)
Radical prostatectomy or Radical radiotherapy
Advanced disease(Stage 3 and 4)
-Hormonal manipulation

\section*{A. For early disease/Localized disease}

\section*{Radical prostatectomy (curative therapy)}
-Removal of the prostate plus its covering and the seminal vesicles.
-Laparoscopic nerve sparing radical prostatectomy to avoid injury to the nerves is even better.
Complications
1.Bleeding
2.Pulmonaty embolism
4.Infections
5.urinary incontinence
6.impotence
7.Urethral strictures
8.Rectal injuries

\section*{Radical Radiotherapy}
1.Teletherapy- Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy:

CT-assisted localization of beam that allows delivering high
doses of radiation that conform to the target volume of interest while sparing more of the surrounding normal tissues than is possible using conventional techniques
2. Brachytherapy-involves the implantation of radioactive seeds of iodine or palladium.

\section*{B .Metastatic/late disease/Palliative}

\section*{Hormonal treatment (Total androgen ablatiom) \\ 1.Orchiectomy}

Bilateral subcapsular orchiectomy is simple, safe, and produces castrate levels in about 3 h .
The main side effects are gynaecomastia, impotence, and hot flushes.
- Anaesthesia may be general, regional, or local.
-If a normal appearing scrotum is important to the patient then subcapsular orchiectomy (preserving the tunica albuginea), or implantation of a synthetic testicular prosthesis are appropriate options

\section*{2.Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues eg Goserelin, Nafarelin}
-Results in a flare of testosterone after about 3 days, but testosterone levels then drop paradoxically to castrate levels after 2 weeks
-The clinical effect is equivalent to orchiectomy or diethylstilboestrol.
-There is a lower incidence of gynaecomastia and fluid retention but a higher incidence of hot flushes.
-In addition, unless the early flare period is covered by diethylstilboestrol or an antiandrogen, there is danger of tumour expansion leading to spinal cord compression or ureteral obstruction.
-LHRH analogues are available as daily subcutaneous injection, nasal spray, or as a monthly depot injection.

\section*{3.Anti-androgens}
a)Receptor Blockers

\section*{Flutamide}

Pure antiandrogens such as flutamide block binding of dihydrotestosterone and testosterone to the androgen receptor. Use of pure antiandrogens is the only hormone treatment that preserves libido and potency, but the potential for increasing testosterone levels precludes their use as monotherapy

\section*{Cypro-terone acetate}

Is a synthetic progestational agent that blocks the dihydrotesterone_receptor but also has central gonadotropin blocking effects, making it particularly helpful in patients with hot flushes on other therapy.
-The central effect may be lost with prolonged use

\section*{b) 5 alpha reductase}
inhibitors as Finasteride and Deusteride

\section*{Total Androgen Blockade.}

Orchiectomy or GNRH analog plus Anti -androgen

\section*{Chemotherapy}
-Cytotoxic chemotherapy has produced very disappointing results to date.
-The most promising agents have been Adriamycin and 5flurouracil.
-Docetaxel (mitotic spindle poison through the enhancement of tubulin polymerization) is used for Hormone Refractory Prostate cancer

\section*{Non-hormonal therapy}

The most promising include suramin, which blocks growth factors and decreases binding of tumour growth factor; estramustine phosphate which has some oestrogenic effect but also produces mitotic arrest in tumours; Diphosphonates, which inhibit bone mineralization and resorption, producing symptomatic relief of bone metastases. Radiotherapy for bone relief in case of metastasis.

6) -Irregular breathing/slowed fats

Parameters: Normal ICP $=0-10 \mathrm{mmHg}$. Treatment threshold > $20-25 \mathrm{mmHg}$. Goal CPP $=60-70 \mathrm{mmHg}$.

\section*{1. Elevation of head}

To promote venous drainage from the head.

\section*{2.Ventilation 02 by mask}

Prevention of hypoxia and hypercapnia which increase ICP

\section*{3. Mannitol.}
i. Effective doses range from 0.25-1 gram/kg, given by intermittent bolus infusion every $4-6 \mathrm{hrs}$.
ii. Euvolemia must be maintained.
iii. Monitor osmolality. Do not exceed $320 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$

\section*{4. Anticonvulsant therapy}

Phenytoin is used to prevent or control seizure activity that increases cerebral blood flow and subsequently intracranial pressure. Anticonvulsant medications should be used for 1 week following injury and then discontinued if seizures are not recurrent.

\section*{5. Nimodipine}

The calcium channel blocker reduces death and severe disability when instituted acutely in patients with head injuries

\section*{6. Sedatives}

High dose diazepam may be considered for hemodynamically stable, salvageable, severe head injury patients with intracranial hypertension refractory to maximal medical and surgical therapy. Other narcotics may depress respiration.

\section*{7. Relieve and prevent pyrexia}

Which increases intracranial pressure. eg NSAIDS Provision of .analgesia has similar effects

\section*{8. Steroids}

Dexamethasone use is controversial in head injury

\section*{9. Hyperventilation}

To blow out the co2 and reduce hypercapnia and keep the partial pressure of co 2 between $30-40 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
The use of prophylactic hyperventilation ( $\mathrm{PaCO} 2<35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) therapy during the first 24 hours after severe TBI should be avoided because it can compromise cerebral perfusion during a time when cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced.
Hyperventilation therapy may be necessary for brief periods when there is acute neurologic deterioration, or for longer periods if there is intracranial hypertension refractory to sedation, paralysis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, and osmotic diuretics.

\section*{RHABDOMYOSARCOMA}

\section*{Introduction}

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue tumor in children, accounting for approximately $5 \%$ of all pediatric cancers.

\section*{Age}
-The tumor presents throughout childhood and has even been reported at birth.
-The peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years of age, with $70 \%$ of children diagnosed before 10 years of age.
-A second smaller peak is seen in adolescents with extremity tumors.

\section*{Sex}

Males are affected more commonly than females (1.4:1).

\section*{Race}

Whites x3 more affected

\section*{Aetiology}

\section*{Unknown}
- Associated with Fraumeni syndrome is an inherited mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene that results in a high risk of bone and soft tissue sarcomas in childhood plus breast cancer and other malignant neoplasms before age 45 . But characteristic chromosomal changes have been reported, including $\mathrm{t}(2 ; 13)$ translocation and loss of allelic heterozygosity on chromosome 11.

\section*{Site of Presentation}

There are four major anatomic sites of involvement:
(a) Head-and-neck region (35 to 40\%)
(b) Genitourinary tract (20\%)
(c) Extremities (15 to 20\%),
(d) Trunk ( 10 to $15 \%$ )
-In the head-and-neck region occurs predominantly in the orbit , nasopharynx, maxillary antrum, middle ear, and soft tissues of the scalp, face, or neck.
-Within genitourinary tract of younger children, presents in the urinary bladder, prostate, and vagina.
In adolescents, the tumor occurs in the paratesticular soft tissues or spermatic cord.
-A small proportion (ie, 1 to $3 \%$ ) of patients are diagnosed as having disseminated disease involving primarily the bones and bone marrow without an identifiable primary tumor site.

\section*{Symptoms and signs}

Are usually pressure or obstructive phenomena.
1-Nasopharyngeal tumors may put pressure on the eustachian tubes and produce chronic otitis media
2-Orbit-proptosis
3-Bladder or prostate -heamaturia and urinary obstruction.
4-Vagina and uterus-A protruding mass of polypoid tissue presenting with pelvic mass or vaginal discharge
5-Paratesticular-painless mass.
6-Infiltration of tumors arising in the nasopharynx, middle ear, or infratemporal fossa into the middle cranial fossa may be associated with cranial nerve dysfunction
7-Extremity-progressive swelling of the affected part.
-Evaluation of children with soft-tissue masses should include a complete examination of the suspected site. Extensive examination of the ears, nose, and throat for head-and-neck primaries as well as rectal or bimanual examination for genitourinary

\section*{Investigations}
1. Incisional biopsy.
2. CT Scan-The local tumor extension
3. MRI- In head-and-neck, extremity, and pelvic tumors evaluation
4. Assessment for metastatic disease involves chest radiography, thoracic CT, bone scan, and bone marrow aspiration

\section*{Histological classification}

Rhabdomyosarcoma consists of rhabdomyoblasts, which are primitive cells of mesenchymal origin. Tumors can be classified into four histologic types:
1. Embryonal type- $\mathbf{6 3 \%}$ is the most common. It predominantly affects children under 15 years of age in the head-and-neck region and the genitourinary tract.
The botryoid type is a variant of the embryonal type. It arises as polypoid, grape-like lesions in mucosal-lined hollow organs such as the vagina and urinary bladder.
2. Alveolar type 19\% is a more aggressive tumor, occurring in children and young adults. It commonly involves the muscles of the extremities or trunk.
3.Anaplatic type-10\%
4.Pleomorphic type1\% is the least common, usually arising in muscles of the extremities.
Embryonal and botryoid tumors are felt to have "favorable histology." Alveolar, pleomorphic, and other less common subtypes are classified as "unfavorable histology."

\section*{DDX}
- small, round-cell tumors of childhood such as Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and malignant lymphoma. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry may facilitate the diagnosis.

\section*{Staging}

The extent of local, regional, and distant disease determines the tumor stage or group.

\section*{Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group}

This system is based on disease extent and resectability, defining groups I to IV by local disease status, involvement of the regional lymph nodes, and extent of residual tumor after primary surgery.
Stage 1- Completely resectable, localized disease
Stage 2-Resectable but with residual microscopic disease
Stage 3a-Resectabe but with have gross residual tumour
3b- no residual disease but regional lymph node metastases
3c-both gross residual tumor and regional lymph nodes
Stage IV- tumors have distant metastasis

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Combined modality treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma constituted has resulted in significant improvement of survival.
Surgical resection of the primary tumor usually offers the best prospect for local tumor control in limited disease presentations.

Integrating chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic modalities with surgery in has decreased the indications for radical surgery, thus permitting more limited surgical resection and sometimes potentially eliminating the need for surgery altogether Radiation therapy is not necessary in patients with localized, completely resected tumors (ie, group I).
Vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide have shown the greatest efficacy in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.

\section*{Prognosis}

The extent of tumor at diagnosis, the primary site, pathologic subtype, and response to treatment all influence long-term disease-free survival from the time of diagnosis

\section*{SIGMOID VOLVULUS}

\section*{Definition}

Axial rotation or twisting of sigmoid colon on an axis formed by its mesentery.
Result in partial or complete obstruction of the lumen and may be followed by circulatory impairment of the bowel which may lead to gut gangrene.
Accounts for $>50 \%$ of intestinal obstruction in parts of Africa.
Commonest cause of large bowel obstruction.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
1.High dietary fibre diet major contributing factor .
2.Chronic constipation
3.Long redundant colon
4.Acquired megacolon eg.TB, Diabetes
5.Narrowly based mesentery.

\section*{Age}
-Occur in the elderly.
-Peak age - $>70 \mathrm{yrs}$
-Especially elderly patients suffering from psychiatric \& chronic neurological diseases such as stroke or multiple sclerosis.
-Also, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{History}
1. Acute colicky abdominal pain usually with persistence of pain between spasms.
May be a previous history of transient attacks in which spontaneous reduction of the volvulus has occurred.
2.Abdominal swelling
3. Constipation is absolute-obstipation.
4. Vomiting-if present appear late.

\section*{Physical examination}
1. Most striking finding is of a tensely distended, tympanitic, drum-like abdomen.
2. The rectum is empty of stool.
3. Bowel sounds are often increased
4. Signs of peritoneal inflammation such as rebound tenderness or guarding are unusual.
-When these signs are present they suggest that colonic infarction or gangrene has occurred.
5.Signs of dehydration may be apparent if presentation has been delayed and these should always be sought.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Radiology}
1. Plain supine abdominal radiograph.

The most useful investigation This alone may be diagnostic in 70 to 80 per cent of patients.
The typical appearance is that of a single grossly distended loop of colon arising out the pelvis from the let and extending towards the diaphragm.

✓ Inverted U sign
✓ M-sign
✓ Inner tube sign
✓ Frieman's Dohls sign
-Haustral markings are usually lost
2. Contrast enema

Investigation by a contrast enema such as dilute barium or a water-soluble contrast medium will increase the diagnostic yield of radiology to over 90 per cent of patients. If gangrenous bowel or perforation is suspected a water-soluble contrast must be used rather than barium, as the latter will produce a severe peritonitis. The pathognomonic sign on a contrast enema is described as a birds beak or ace of spades; appearance, produced as the upper end of the barium column tapers into the spirally twisted distal sigmoid colon

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Supportive management}
1.NG tube for gut decompression.
2.Flatus tube-decompression
3.Analgesia
4.IV fluid rehydration and maintenance fluids
5.Correction of electrolyte derangement.
6.IV antibiotics if signs of peritonism
7.Keep nill per oral
obtain consent if signs of perforation or peritonism

\section*{Non-operative management}
-Patients who present with no sings of peritonism can be treated initially by non-operative means.
-Careful flexible sigmoidoscopy and the passage of a flatus tube via the sigmoidoscope is successful in up to 90 per cent of cases, and is well worth trying in the first instance.
-Protective clothing is recommended as the results of a successful decompression are usually explosive.
-Following a successful deflation, the flatus tube should be left in place for at least 48 h , and some would recommend as long as 5 days.
-Unless this is done the likelihood of an early recurrence is very high ( $50-90$ per cent).
-Due to high recurrence rates>50 \% patients should be admitted back to the ward, gut prepared and surgery planned for resection of sigmoid colon and primary anastomosis.
-If the follow up of patient is good then elective surgery may be planned.

\section*{Emergency Surgery}

Patients with features of peritonitis require emergency surgery before perforation and gram negative toxemia ensues.
Option:
1. Sigmoid colectomy with a hartmans colostomy which is closed 6-8weeks later.
2.On Table mechanical gut preparation by doing colonic washout with warm normal saline until the washout is clear.
Antegrade colonic irrigation via caecal intubation. Then sigmoid colectomy with a primary anatomosis is done.

✓ sigmoid colon CA
✓ Giant sigmoid diverticulum
✓ Pseudo obstruction

\section*{Complications}

✓ Colonic ischemia and gangrene
✓ Perforation
✓ Peritonitis
✓ Endotoxic shock.
