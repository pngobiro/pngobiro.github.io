\section*{THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME}

\section*{Background:}
-Compression of the neurovascular structures at the superior aperture of the thorax.
-It represents a constellation of symptoms.
-The cause, diagnosis, and treatment are controversial.
-The brachial plexus ( $95 \%$ ), subclavian vein ( $4 \%$ ), and subclavian artery (1\%) are affected

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
-The brachial plexus trunks and subclavian vessels are subject to compression or irritation as they course through 3 narrow passageways from the base of the neck toward the axilla and the proximal arm.
- The most important of these passageways is the interscalene triangle, which is also the most proximal. This triangle is bordered by the anterior scalene muscle anteriorly, the middle scalene muscle posteriorly, and the medial surface of the first rib inferiorly.
-This area may be small at rest and may become even smaller with certain provocative maneuvers.
- Anomalous structures, such as fibrous bands, cervical ribs, and anomalous muscles, may constrict this triangle further.
-Repetitive trauma to the plexus elements, particularly the lower trunk and C8-T1 spinal nerves, is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of TOS.
-The second passageway is the costoclavicular triangle, which is bordered anteriorly by the middle third of the clavicle, posteromedially by the first rib, and posterolaterally by the upper border of the scapula.
-The last passageway is the subcoracoid space beneath the coracoid process just deep to the pectoralis minor tendon
-The sex ratio varies depending on the type of TOS (eg, neurologic, venous, arterial). Overall, the entity is approximately 3 times more common in women than in men.
Neurologic - Female-to-male ratio approximately $3.5: 1$
Venous - More common in males than in females
Arterial - No sexual predilection
Age: The onset of symptoms usually occurs in persons aged 2050 years.

\section*{History:}
-Neurologic symptoms occur in $95 \%$ of cases. The lower 2 nerve roots of the brachial plexus, C8 and T1, are most commonly ( $90 \%$ ) involved, producing pain and paresthesias in the ulnar nerve distribution.
-The second most common anatomic pattern involves the upper 3 nerve roots of the brachial plexus, C5, C6, and C7, with symptoms referred to the neck, ear, upper chest, upper back, and outer arm in the radial nerve distribution.

\section*{Neurologic}
- Pain, particularly in the medial aspect of the arm, forearm, and the ring and small digits
- Paresthesias, often nocturnal, awakening the patient with pain or numbness
- Loss of dexterity
- Cold intolerance-Raynauds phenomenon
- Headache

Venous - Pain, often in younger men and often associated with strenuous work
Arterial-Pain, Claudication, Often in young adults with a history of vigorous arm activity

\section*{Physical Exam}

In most cases, the physical examination findings are completely normal.
-Other times, the examination is difficult because the patient may guard the extremity and exhibit giveaway-type weakness. The sensory examination is often unreliable.
-Provocative tests, such as the Adson, costoclavicular, and hyperabduction maneuvers, are unreliable. Approximately $92 \%$ of asymptomatic patients have variation in the strength of the radial pulse during positional changes.
In the Adson test, the patient takes a deep breath and tilts his or her head back and turns it to one side. The physician tests to see if the strength of the patient's pulse is reduced in the wrist on the arm on the opposite side of the head turn.
In the Allen test, the arm in which the patient is experiencing symptoms is raised and rotated while the head is turned to the opposite side. The physician tests to see if the pulse strength at the wrist is reduced. If the strength of the pulse is reduced in either of these two tests it indicates compression of the subclavian artery.
-The elevated arm stress test (EAST) is of debatable use, but it may be the most reliable screening test. It evaluates all 3 types of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).
-To perform this test, the patient sits with the arms abducted 90 degrees from the thorax and the elbows flexed 90 degrees. The patient then opens and closes the hands for 3 minutes.
-Patients with TOS cannot continue this for 3 minutes because of reproduction of symptoms. Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome experience dysesthesias in the fingers, but do not have shoulder or arm pain.

\section*{Neurologic}
-A typical patient is a young, thin female with a long neck and dropping shoulders.
-A positive EAST result and the presence of a radial pulse are strong indicators of neurologic involvement of the brachial plexus.
-Supraclavicular tenderness
-Usually no evidence of muscle atrophy is present, although the classic finding is known as the Gilliatt-Sumner hand with the most dramatic atrophy in the abductor pollicis brevis, with lesser involvement of the interossei and hypothenar muscles
-Paresthesias/sensory loss is restricted to the ulnar aspect of the hand and forearm
-Weakness (usually subtle) of affected

\section*{Venous}
-Edema of the upper extremity
-Cyanosis of the upper extremity
-Distended superficial veins of the shoulder and chest

\section*{Arterial}
-Pallor and pulselessness
-Coolness on the affected upper extremity
-Lower blood pressure in affected arm of greater than 20 mm Hg (a reliable indicator of arterial involvement)
-Rarely can produce multiple small infarcts on the hand and fingers (embolization)

Causes: The 3 major causes of TOS are anatomic, trauma/repetitive activities, and neurovascular entrapment at the costoclavicular space.

\section*{Anatomic}

Scalene triangle: Anterior scalene muscle frontally, middle scalene muscle posteriorly, and the upper border of the first rib inferiorly account for most cases of neurologic and arterial TOS. Cervical ribs are found in most arterial cases but rarely in venous and neurologic cases.
Congenital fibromuscular bands are noted in as many as $80 \%$ of patients with neurologic TOS.
Transverse process of C7 is elongated.

\section*{Trauma or repetitive activitie}
-Motor vehicle accident hyperextension injury, with subsequent fibrosis and scarring
-Effort vein thrombosis (ie, spontaneous thrombosis of the axillary veins following vigorous arm exertion
-Playing a musical instrument: Musicians can be particularly susceptible owing to their need to maintain the shoulder in abduction or extension for long periods

\section*{Neurovascular entrapment:}

This occurs in the costoclavicular space between the first rib and the head of the clavicle.

-Pulmonary disease
-Pancoast tumour
3.Color flow duplex scanning for suspected vascular thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS

-Suspected subclavian stenosis or aneurysm (eg, bruit or abnormal supraclavicular pulsation)
-Blood pressure differential greater than 20 mm Hg
-Obliteration of radial pulse during EAS

\section*{Venography (indications)}
-Persistent or intermittent edema of the hand or arm
-Peripheral unilateral cyanosis
-Prominent venous pattern over the arm, shoulder, or chest

\section*{Other Tests:}

Nerve conduction evaluation via root stimulation and F wave is the best direct approach to evaluation of neurologic TOS.
Electromyography (EMG) is unreliable and does not provide objective evidence of TOS.
Cervical myelogram, CT scan, or MRI may be appropriate for patients suspected of having cervical disk disease or spinal cord disease.

\section*{TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA}

\section*{Introduction}
-Blockage of the oesophagus occurs with an incidence of $\underline{1 \text { in }}$ 3000-4500 live births.
-About 1/3 of the affected infants are born pre-maturely.
-Oesophageal Atresia is associated with trachea oesophageal fistula (TOF) in 85\% of cases.

\section*{Embryology}
-Oesophageal Atresia results from deviation of Tracheoesophageal septum in a posterior direction hence incomplete separation of oesophagus from the laryngotracheal tube.
-There can be failure of recanalization of oesophagus in the 8th week, due to defective growth of endodermal cells

\section*{Types of Esophageal Atresia}
1. Proximal blind pouch and distal oesophagus with fistula to trachea >85\% Type C)
2. Pure oesophageal atresia/no fistula - 8\%.-type A
3. Fistula from both upper and lower oesophageal ends $2 \%$-type B
4. Isolated tracheoesophageal fistula H type 2\%.
5. Atresia with fistula to trachea from both esophageal pouches.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{In Utero}

A foetus with oesophageal atresia in unable to swallow amniotic fluid.
Presents with polyhydramnios.
At birth
-The newborn appears healthy.
1-Excessive Frothy saliva through mouth and nostrils.
2-Could be in respiratory distress if they aspirate saliva.
3-Repeated episodes of coughing, choking, and cyanosis.
4-Attempts at feeding result in choking, gagging, and regurgitation.
5-Inability to pass a nasogastric tube into the stomach is suggestive of oesophageal atresia
6. VACTER-associated anomalies.

\section*{Investigation}
1. CXR- with the NG tube in situ shows shows the coiled tube in the upper pouch.
2. Plain X-Ray of abdomen showing gas in the stomach indicates a tracheo oesophageal fistula.
Absence of gas in abdomen indicates no fistula and often this is a long gap defect
3. The presence and position of the fistula can also be determined by bronchoscopy
4.Water soluble contrast media shows blockage of oesophagus (not recommended) as there is risk of aspiration
Investigate for other anomalies-VACTREL.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{INITIAL}

\section*{-Nil per oral}
1.Insertion of a soft plastic, double-lumen orogastric catheter into the blind upper esophageal pouch, taping it in this position, and
connecting it to constant, low, negative pressure(continuous suction) through Repro-gel tube
2. Keeping the head elevated (ie, $\mathbf{4 5}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ ) both facilitates the drainage of secretion into the pouch for suctioning and prevents the reflux of gastric contents into the lungs
3.IV fluids and monitor electrolytes
4..Prophylactic antibiotics
5.Mainatian on 5 \%Dextrose IV
6. Maintain temperature placed in a humidified incubator

\section*{Definitive management}

After the patient is stabilized, there are three potential surgical approaches to this anomaly.
Considerations are:
1) Prematurity
2) Overall clinical condition
3) Associated anomalies
4) Length of the gap between the ends of the esophagus -Usually, the gap is 1 to 2 cm , allowing primary anastomosis of the two ends.
-In a healthy, full-term infant without other severe anomalies and minimal pneumonitis, primary closure of the fistula and an esophageal anastomosis can be performed within the first 24 to 72 hours after birth.
- In this circumstance, a gastrostomy may or may not be performed.
-However, if the infant has a severe pneumonia or other associated significant medical problems that increase the risk of major surgery, only decompressive gastrostomy is performed, thus allowing time for the medical problem to resolve.
-Head-of-bed elevation and upper pouch suction are maintained until surgery can be accomplished.
-In an extremely small infant with or without other severe anomalies and in whom it is apparent that surgical correction of the tracheoesophageal anomaly must be delayed, a decompressive gastrostomy, surgical closure of the tracheoesophageal fistula, and continuous suction of the upper esophageal pouch is appropriate, with the esophageal anastomosis being performed at a much later date.

\section*{Esophageal anastomosis}

Primary anastomosis done with short segments of atresia. If the atretic segment is $>$ than 4 cm or more than 6 vertebral bodies then esophageal replacement required.

\section*{Short Gap;}
-Performed on the side opposite to the aortic arch, usually the right at the level of the 4th ICS -approximately at the carina -Performed Extra pleural to avoid leaving a chest tube for drainage after (not drained)
-Ligate the azygous vein as it crosses the lower oesophagus to the SVC
-Identify the vagus nerve as it lies on the oesophagus \& safeguard it
-Identify proximal pouch - Identification of the upper pouch is facilitated by intermittent pressure by the anaesthetist on a previously positioned large upper pouch tube.
-A traction suture is placed in the tip of the pouch and the pouch dissected as high as possible, taking care not to enter the closely adherent trachea.
-Achieve end-to-end anastomosis between the blind upper segment \& the lower segment - Use 6 isolated single stitches with
lots of tissue in-between to avoid stricture formation \& to ensure the ring will grow.
-A transanastomic NG tube for suctioning \& later feeding is passed across the posterior wall into the stomach and the anterior wall is completed.

\section*{Long Gap options;}
-Cervical Oesophagostomy to drain saliva \& Gastrostomy for feeding then;
-Reversed gastric tube - A tube flap is made from the greater curvature of the stomach based on left gastroepiploic vessels \& rotated to bridge the gap

\section*{Types of esophageal replacements}
1.Colonic interposition-most popular
2.Gastro-tuboesophagoplasty
3.Gastric transposition
4.Jejunal interposition

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT}
1.Start NGT feeding on Day 4
2. Day 10 - Do a Danosil swallow - to visualise anastomosis Check for leakage; if any, wait for further healing. If no leakage, remove transanastomotic tube \& feed PO
3.Stenosis will require dilatation later in theatre under GA by a radiologist

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF ESOPHAGEAL REPAIR}

\section*{1.Leakage through the anastomosis}
-Common-in up to $50 \%$ of patients.
- Feedings are introduced very slowly, because reflux into the esophagus could threaten the integrity of the anastomosis. -If the infant is well for 1 week, radiographic contrast studies are performed, and if the anastomosis is intact, the infant is gradually allowed to begin oral feedings.
-An anastomotic leak usually presents with tachypnea and sepsis on the third or fourth postoperative day.
-Management usually is conservative, with antibiotics and, if necessary, placement of a chest tube.
Over time, the leak usually seals, and feeding can be started.

\section*{2. Stricture formation}
-at the site of the esophageal anastomosis frequently occurs in the first weeks to months after repair.
-This narrowing may require repeated dilatation.
-Severe strictures require resection and secondary anastomosis.

\section*{3. Dysphagia-}

Particularly for solids) is common because peristalsis is abnormal in the lower esophageal segment.

\section*{4.Gastroesopahgeal reflux disease}
-With esophagitis risk of barrets esophagus and adenocarcinoma later on
-Anti reflux fundoplication may be necessary early Children who have required an esophageal replacement procedure are at even higher risk of gastroesophageal reflux with ulceration of the interposed segment

\section*{5.Distended interposed segments}
-Particularly colonic or gastric interposition may distend with time, further compromising pulmonary function and occasionally requiring surgical revision.

\section*{Other complication}
6.Respiratory complications
- Either pre or post operative pneumonia.
- Pulmonary collapse or pneumothorax.
7. Recurrence of tracheoesophageal fistula.
8.Tracheal malacia

\section*{UPPER GIT BLEEDING}

UGIB is defined as bleeding derived from a source proximal to the ligament of Treitz.
Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a potentially lifethreatening abdominal emergency

\section*{Incidence}
-The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is approximately $0.1 \%$ of the general population.
-Bleeding from the upper GI tract is approximately 4 times as common as bleeding from the lower GI tract and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
-The use of various endoscopic techniques, medical therapies, and visceral angiography has progressively diminished the role of surgery in the emergent management of UGIB
-Nevertheless, operative intervention still represents the most definitive intervention and remains the final therapeutic option for many bleeding lesions of the upper GI tract.
-Of patients who develop UGIB, $3-15 \%$ require a surgical procedure.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Hematemesis and melena are the most common presentations of acute UGIB, and patients may present with both symptoms. Occasionally, a brisk UGIB manifests as hematochezia.
In order of frequency:
1. Hematemesis in 40-50\% patients.
2. Melena in 70-80\% of patients.
3.Hematochezia
4.Syncope
5.Presyncope

Symptoms 30 days prior to admission
1.Dyspepsia ,Epigastric pain ,Heartburn
2.Diffuse abdominal pain
3.Dysphagia
4.Weight loss

5Jaundice
The history findings can be extremely helpful in determining the location of the GI hemorrhage.
-Alcohol abuse or a history of cirrhosis should elicit consideration of portal gastropathy or esophageal varices -A history of recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) abuse -a gastric ulcer or chronic back -pain -need for NSAIDs -History of treatment for Peptic ulcers-bleeding could be PUD or gastric ulcers.

\section*{Differential diagnoses for UGIB}
1) Gastric ulcer and Duodenal ulcer
2) Esophageal varices/Gastric varices
3) Mallory-Weiss tear, Boerhave tear
4) Esophagitis , Hemorrhagic gastritis
5) Neoplasm-Esophageal ca, stomach ca, Kaposi sarcoma.
6) Dieulafoy lesion
7) Arterio-venous malformations.
8) Angiodysplasia
9) Hemobilia
10) Pancreatic pseudocyst and Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm
11) Foreign body 14.Merkels diverticulum
12) Coagulopathy 13.Aortoenteric fistula

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Resuscitation of a hemodynamically unstable patient begins with assessing and addressing the ABCs (ie, airway, breathing, circulation) of initial management.
Earliest opportunity is taken to intubate the patient and avoid risk of aspiration.
Using two large bore venous access in the antecubital fossa.
Replace blood loss with crystalloid in the ration of 1 ml of blood loss replaced by 3 ml of crystalloid.
Urethral catheter for monitoring the urine production.
Continuously monitor the resuscitation measures especially the circulatory aspect:

✓ Urine output should be $30-50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$
✓ BP monitoring systolic BP not $<90 \mathrm{mmHg}$
✓ Decrease in BP and urine output suggest need for colloids but a decrease in urine output but normal BP suggest need for crystalloids
✓ Pulse. Pulse should be less than 120/minute
✓ Pulse oximetry
✓ CVP monitoring the best to avoid over-infusion
✓ State of patient should be calm
-Once the maneuvers to resuscitate are underway, insert a nasogastric tube (NGT) and perform an aspirate and lavage procedure.
-This should be the first procedure performed to determine whether the GI bleeding is emanating from above or below the ligament of Treitz.
- If the stomach contains bile but no blood, UGIB is less likely. If the aspirate reveals clear gastric fluid, a duodenal site of bleeding may still be possible

\section*{Surgical therapy: \\ Endoscopy}

Both diagnostic and therapeutic Upper GIT bleeding.
Endoscopy should be performed immediately after endotracheal intubation (if indicated) and hemodynamic stabilization.
Endoscopy is now the method of choice for controlling active ulcer hemorrhage and variceal bleeds.

Methods for hemostasis.
1) Injection of vasoactive agents
2) Injection of sclerosing agents
3) Coagulation-types

✓ Bipolar electrocoagulation
✓ Thermal probe coagulation
✓ Laser photocoagulation
✓ Argon plasma coagulator
4) Band ligation
5) Pressure tamponade - with Constant probe
6) Application of hemostatic materials, including biologic glue
The 3 most popular methods of hemostasis are injection therapy, coaptive coagulation, and laser phototherapy

\section*{Vasoactive agent injection}
a)Epinephrine -diluted $(1: 10,000)$ and injected as 0.5 - to $1-\mathrm{mL}$ aliquots. Works by inducing vasoconstriction and decreasing blood flow to the area.
This allows for increased platelet function and clot formation to attain hemostasis.
However, the tamponade effect produced by injecting the volume of drug into the tissue surrounding the bleeding lesion may also facilitate hemostasis.
b) Injecting a volume of sterile isotonic sodium chloride solution and providing a tamponade effect also leads to hemostasis, although not as effectively as epinephrine

\section*{2.Sclerosant injection}

The sclerosant solutions used today include
✓ Absolute ethanol
✓ Polido-canol
✓ Sodium tetradecyl sulfate.
-These achieve hemostasis by inducing thrombosis, tissue necrosis, and inflammation at the site of injection.
-When large volumes are injected, the area of tissue necrosis can produce an increased risk of local complications such as perforation.

\section*{3.Coaptive coagulation}
-Uses direct pressure and thermal therapy to achieve hemostasis.
-Thermal therapy includes monopolar and bipolar electrocoagulation and heater-probe application.
-The bleeding vessel is isolated, compressed, and tamponaded prior to coagulation therapy. By using both maneuvers, the depth of tissue injury is minimized.
-Coaptive coagulation is as effective as injection therapy in achieving hemostasis
-Combining injection therapy with heater-probe coagulation can be used in an attempt to reduce the rebleeding rate in high-risk patients who have spurting arterial bleeding observed during endoscopy

\section*{Other aspects of treatment}

\section*{Duodenal Ulcers}

Proton pump inhibitors decrease rebleeding rates in patients with bleeding ulcers associated with an overlying clot or visible nonbleeding vessel in the base of the ulcer.
It is administered at the same time as endoscopy.
The indications for surgery in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers are as follows:
1) Severe life-threatening hemorrhage not responsive to resuscitative efforts
2) Failure of medical therapy and endoscopic hemostasis with persistent recurrent bleeding
3) A coexisting reason for surgery such as perforation, obstruction, or malignancy
4) Prolonged bleeding with loss of $50 \%$ or more of the patient's blood volume
5) A second hospitalization for peptic ulcer hemorrhage

The 3 most common operations performed for a bleeding duodenal ulcer are as follows
a)Truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty with suture ligation of the bleeding ulcer
c)Truncal vagotomy and antrectomy with resection or suture ligation of the bleeding ulcer
d)Proximal (highly selective) gastric vagotomy with duodenostomy and suture ligation of the bleeding ulcer
-The purpose of the vagotomy is to divide the nerves to the acidproducing body and fundus of the stomach.
-This inhibits the acid production that occurs during the cephalic phase of gastric secretion.
-Although acid secretion is controlled, gastric motility and gastric emptying is affected
-Eradication of $H$ pylori can reduce the risk of rebleeding
-Lansoprazole 30 mg plus amoxicillin at 1 g plus clarithromycin at 500 mg q12h for 2 weeks.

\section*{To diagnose H.pylori}
a)The endoscopic tests include culture, histology, and a rapid urease test (RUT). RUTs are based on the urease-producing activity of Hpylori. If urease is present, then urea is hydrolyzed, thus releasing ammonia that raises the pH .
b) Available nonendoscopic tests are the urea breath test and serologic testing.

\section*{GASTRIC ULCERS}

The 3 most common complications of a gastric ulcer that surgical intervention is hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction.
The goals of surgery are to correct the underlying emergent problem, prevent recurrent bleeding or ulceration, and exclude malignancy.
A bleeding gastric ulcer is most commonly managed by a distal gastrectomy that includes the ulcer with a gastroduodenostomy or a gastrojejunostomy reconstruction.
The common operations for the management of a bleeding gastric ulcer include
(1) truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty with a wedge resection of the ulcer
(2) antrectomy with wedge excision of the proximal ulcer, (3) Distal gastrectomy to include the ulcer with or without truncal vagotomy
(4) Wedge resection of the ulcer only.

The choice of operation type of ulcer and hemodynamic stability of the patient to withstand an operation.
Five types of gastric ulcers occur, based on their location and acid-secretory status.
Type 1 gastric ulcers are located on the lesser curvature of Are not associated with a hypersecretory acid state.
Type 2 ulcers represent a combination of 2 ulcers that are associated with a hypersecretory acid state. The $1^{\text {st }}$ ulcer in body of the stomach, $2^{\text {nd }}$ ulcer in the duodenum.
Type 3 ulcers are prepyloric ulcers. They are associated with high acid output and are usually within 3 cm of the pylorus.
Type 4 ulcers are located high on the lesser curvature of the stomach and (as with type 1 ulcers) are not associated with high acid output.
Type 5 ulcers are related to the ingestion of NSAIDs or aspirin. These ulcers can occur anywhere in the stomach.

A vagotomy is added to manage type 2 or type 3 gastric ulcers.

\section*{3.VARICEAL BLEEDS}

\section*{Pharmacologic therapy}

The patient with acute variceal bleeding may initially be treated with
- intravenous vasopressin and nitroglycerine
- somatostatin, or one of its analogs (eg, octreotide).

Vasopressin is a potent splanchnic and systemic vasoconstrictor, including coronary vasoconstriction. Nitroglycerin should be concomitantly administered to titrate and maintain the SBP in the range of $90-100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Nitroglycerin should be initiated at 40 $\mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{min}$ to protect the coronary arteries from the profound adverse cardiovascular effects of the vasopressin. The intravenous infusion of vasopressin is started at $0.2-0.4 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{min}$.

\section*{Endoscopy}

The 2 main endoscopic techniques available to control variceal bleeding are endoscopic sclerotherapy and endoscopic variceal band ligation.
Endoscopic sclerotherapy involves injecting a sclerosing agent, such as ethanolamine or polidocanol, into the varix lumen (intravariceal) or immediately adjacent to the vessel (paravariceal) to create fibrosis in the mucosa overlying the varix, which leads to hemostasis. Endoscopic variceal banding ligation consists of the placement of a rubber band around the varix. This technique is performed by first sucking the varix into a sheath attached to the distal end of the endoscope. Once the varix is suctioned into the sheath, a trigger device allows the deployment of a rubber band around the varix, a procedure that strangulates the varix.
Variceal banding associated with significantly lower mortality rates, lower variceal rebleeding, less esophageal perforation, and stricture formation compared to sclerosants

\section*{Balloon tamponade}

Can be a life-saving maneuver when medical and endoscopic efforts fail to control the bleeding. Achieve temporary control of the bleeding but recurrent bleeding with release of the tamponade occurs in most patients
They are also cause complications as
✓ Airway obstruction
✓ Aspiration
✓ esophageal necrosis with rupture
Because of the severe life-threatening complications and limited use, the tubes are used only as a temporary measure while the patient is resuscitated.
The tubes act as a bridge to help stabilize the patient until a time when the patient is prepared for either a repeat endoscopy procedure or a portal pressure decompression through a radiological or surgical method
The 2 most commonly used tubes are the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and the Minnesota tube. These tubes have an esophageal balloon and a gastric balloon that are inflated to produce a tamponade effect after confirming appropriate anatomical placement.
Before use endotracheal intubation to secure and protect the patient's airway

Major complications of balloon tamponade
1) Esophageal rupture
2) Tracheal rupture
3) Duodenal rupture
4) Respiratory tract obstruction
5) Aspiration
6) Hemoptysis
7) Tracheoesophageal fistula
8) Jejunal rupture
9) Thoracic lymph duct obstruction
10) Esophageal necrosis
11) Esophageal ulcer

Minor complications
1) Nasopharyngeal bleeding
2) Chest pain
3) Balloon impaction and/or migration (nausea and vomiting)
4) Alar necrosis

The tube is first introduced into the stomach, and a small amount of air is injected into the gastric balloon. A radiograph is then obtained to confirm placement in the stomach. Once proper placement is confirmed, the gastric balloon is inflated with 300350 mL of air and is pulled up into the gastric fundus, compressing the gastroesophageal junction. The tube is secured to the facemask of a football helmet placed on the patient's head. The esophageal balloon is then inflated to a pressure of 40 mm Hg . Another radiograph is obtained to confirm proper placement of both tubes. Deflate the esophageal balloon every 4 hours for 15 minutes to avoid esophageal pressure necrosis. Do not leave the entire tube in place for more than $24-48$ hours.

\section*{Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt}

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) decompression of the portal system can be achieved through either radiologic or surgical methods. The goal is to reduce intravariceal pressure to less than 12 mm Hg . The TIPS procedure for bleeding esophagogastric varices that are unresponsive to endoscopic and pharmacologic first-line treatment
By surgery -Portacaval shunt (end-to-side) or (side-to-side)

\section*{URETHRAL STRICTURES}

\section*{Definition}
-Fibrosis of the urethral urothelium leading to scar tissue formation which contracts and reduces the caliber of the urethral lumen, causing resistance to the antegrade flow of urine.

\section*{-Relevant Anatomy:}

The urethra is divided into anterior and posterior segments. The anterior urethra (from distal to proximal) includes the meatus, fossa navicularis, penile or pendulous urethra, and bulbar urethra.
It lies within the corpus spongiosum, beginning at the level of the bulbous urethra and extending distally through the length of the penile urethra.
-The bulbar urethra begins at the root of the penis and ends at the urogenital diaphragm.
-The penile urethra has a more central position within the corpus spongiosum in contrast to the bulbous urethra, which is more dorsally positioned
The posterior urethra (from distal to proximal) includes the membranous urethra and the prostatic urethra.
-The membranous urethra involves the segment extending from the urogenital diaphragm to the verumontanum.
- The prostatic urethra extends proximally from the verumontanum to the bladder neck.
The soft tissue layers of the penis, from external to internal
- - Skin
- Superficial (dartos) fascia
- Deep (Buck) fascia,
- Tunica albuginea surrounding the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum.
-The superficial vascular supply to the penis comes from the external pudendal vessels, which arise from the femoral vessels.
-The deep penile structures receive their arterial supply from the common penile artery, which arises from the internal pudendal artery.
-The scrotum receives its vascular supply via branches from both the external and internal pudendal arteries

\section*{Etiology:}

Congenital or acquired.

\section*{Congenital}
1.Epispadias-Abnormal urethral opening on the dorsal aspect of the penis.
Some epispadias are accompanied by anterior abdominal wall defects and bladder extrophy
2. Hypospadias-abnormal urethral opening on the ventral aspect
3.Urethral valves especially the posterior urethral valves
4.Congenital stenosis of the meatus urethra

\section*{Acquired}

The most common causes of urethral stricture
1.Traumatic (commonest cause) e.g. pelvic fracture (of the pubis \& ischial rami), saddle injury, penile fracture
2. Iatrogenic.-surgery (Prostatectomy) and instrumentation (Indwelling catheter,Urethral endoscopy)
3.Infectious- Post-gonorrhoea, tuberculous urethritis, chlamydial infection of the membranous urethra or schistosomiasis
4. Malignancy-penile shaft squamous cell cancer, field effect from transitional bladder cancer.
The male urethra is about $15-17 \mathrm{~cm}$

The female urethra is $3.5-5.5 \mathrm{~cm}$

\section*{Investigations}

Lab Tests
1. FHG-for theatre
2. Urinalysis-UTI
3. Random blood sugar-DM neurogenic bladder can present in similar fashion
4. U/E/C-theatre prep and hydronephrosis.
5. Elderly patients PSA -prostatic cancer or enlargement

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

The entire urethra, both proximal and distal to the strictured area, must be evaluated endoscopically and/or radiographically prior to any surgical intervention.
Radiographic evaluation of the urethra with contrast studies is best achieved by retrograde urethrogram or antegrade cystourethrogram if the patient has an existing suprapubic catheter
Accurately documenting the extent and location of the stricture is important so that the most effective treatment options can be offered to the patient
Complete stricture - MCU + Ascending /Retrograde CU
Incomplete stricture - MCU

\section*{1-Retrograde urethrogram}
involve placing a nonlubricated 8 F or 10 F urethral catheter into the fossa navicularis and inflating the balloon with $1-3 \mathrm{~mL}$ of sterile water until the balloon occludes the urethral lumen. Approximately 10 mL of iodinated contrast media then is injected into the catheter under fluoroscopy, and images of the anterior urethra are taken.
This must be combined with MCU to localize the stricture

\section*{2-An antegrade cystourethrogram}
involves distending the bladder with water-soluble contrast media via a suprapubic tube or urethral catheter.
A scout film is taken before administration of contrast material. Once the bladder is fully distended with contrast media, the suprapubic tube is clamped or the urethral catheter is removed and the patient is asked to void. Spot films are taken before, during, and after the voiding phase.

\section*{3.Micturating cystoureathrogram}

This is usually sufficient is posterior urethral valves in children.

\section*{4. Cystourethroscopy}

Endoscopic evaluation can be conducted by flexible cystourethroscopy -/+ biopsy

\section*{5.Abdominal pelvic ultrasound}

Evaluate the bladder wall for fibrosis and hypertrophy. Ureters and kidneys evaluated for dilated uropathy

\section*{6.IVU}

This is indicated if hydronephrosis and hydroureters.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Dilatation}
-The goal is to stretch and dilate the stricture without producing additional scarring and allow for urine flow
-Serial dilatations first 2 weekly ,then monthly, 2 monthly , 6 monthly and aim for dilatation annually.
-It may be curative in patients with isolated epithelial strictures (no involvement of corpus spongiosum). -However, the trend has been towards endoscopic and open surgical management of the strictures.

Complications of DVU
a) Recurrence of stricture - is the most common complication -very high up to 50 \%of case
b) Bleeding.
c) Extravasation of irrigation fluid into perispongial tissues.
d) Increasing fibrotic response worsening the stricture. Typically, an indwelling urethral catheter is left in place for 14 days to allow granulation tissue re-epithelization

\section*{Open reconstruction}

\section*{Primary repair -One stage open urethroplasty}

Primary repair involves complete excision of the fibrotic urethral segment with re-anastomosis. The key technical points that must be followed include

Tension-free anastomosis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/64d8f25b-40a6-4a3c-b392-a971106d7fde-09.jpg?height=38&width=55&top_left_y=995&top_left_x=242)
Widely patent anastomosis.
Primary urethrotomy depend on site and length of the stricture. Primary repair typically is used for stricture lengths of less than 2 cm . Complete strictures resection and free tube graft or pedicle graft can be done
In pedicle graft the scrotal or penile skin may be rotated and used as a tissue graft although it has many disadvantages and less popular. The scrotal skin has ruggae, hair and sebaceous gland. Leads to collection of urine and stasis and infection.
Commonly used is buccal mucosa. Advantages include: 1.The tissue is resistant to infection and trauma.
2. The epithelium is thick, making it easy to handle.
3. The lamina propria is thin and highly vascular, allowing efficient imbibition and inosculation.
4. Harvesting is easier than other free grafts or pedicled flaps 5. Elastic and can be stretched.

NB. In penile strictures no primary anastomosis done because of risk of chordee formation. Do grafting or staged urethral repair. The repair is left stented with a small silicone catheter in the urethra for 2weeks.

\section*{Staged urethroplasty}

Two-stage urethroplasty
- If previous procedures are unsuccessful
- Stricture $>2 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Penile strictures-avoid chordee formation
- 䡒 Multiple strictures

1st stage
-Open up the urethra and excise stricture and surrounding fibrotic tissues
-Suture it to the surrounding skin \& leave urethral catheter in-situ for 2 wks as the wound heals.
-After 2 weeks remove the catheter and start serial dilatation every 2 weeks of the proximal stoma for 8 weeks.
During this time the urine may be passed from the proximal stoma created in the urethra.
2nd stage
Refashioning of the urethra \& perineum by covering of the urethra with skin flaps from both sides.

The various parts of the male urethra have relatively different acquired etiology of the urethral stricture
Anterior urethra.
i)Bulbar urethra

Trauma-falling astride(man-hole injuries), instrumentationpassing sounds ,infections especially around the glands around this segment makes treatment difficult
ii)Penile urethra-instrumentation, infections
iii) Glans meatus-instrumentation, infections especially the

BXO(the balanitis xerotica obliterans). It is thought to be caused by lichens causing inflammation and leukoplakia.It is usually very painful.
Posterior urethra
i)Bladder neck-Instrumentation, cystitis, TURP
ii)Prostatic urethra/membranous urethra-Trauma-Fracture pelvic rami ,surgery-open or closed prostatectomy ,instrumentation

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

Diagnosis is made based on a suggestive history, findings on physical examination, and radiographic or endoscopic techniques.

\section*{Clinical presentation.}

The most common presentation includes obstructive voiding symptoms
The patient may present with acute urinary retention-acute onset, painful and patient can't pass urine.
Chronic urinary retention-gradual occurrence, not painful and patient can pass some urine.
1. Straining at urination
2.Weak stream, splaying of the urinary stream

3 Urinary retention/ incomplete emptying of the bladder
4. Urinary terminal dribbling,
5. Urinary intermittency/hesitancy
6. Dysuria
7. Nocturia
8. Recurrent Urinary tract infections

These symptoms are progressive for many patients.

\section*{Stricture Complications}
1.Recurent Infection e.g. UTI, STI
2.Calculi formation
3.Urine Extravasation
4.Urethral diverticulum
5.Periurethral abscess
6. Urethral fistula - Usually $2^{\circ}$ to bursting or incision of a periurethral abscess. If the fistulae arise behind a tight stricture, there may be multiple openings - watering-can perineum
7.Abdominal straining to void urine causes; Hernia ,Haemorrhoids, Rectal prolapse
8.Dilated uropathy- hydroureters, hydronephrosis

\section*{Permanent urethral stents}

Permanent urethral stents are endoscopically placed. Stents are designed to be incorporated into the wall of the urethra and provide a patent lumen. They are most successful in short-length strictures in the bulbous urethra. Complications occur when a stent is placed distal to the bulbous urethra, causing the patient pain while sitting or during intercourse. Other complications involve migration of the stent.
-It may be best reserved for patients who are medically unfit to undergo lengthy open urethral reconstruction procedures

\section*{Internal urethrotomy}

Internal urethrotomy involves incising the stricture transurethral using endoscopic equipment. The incision allows release of scar tissue. Success depends on the epithelialization process finishing
before wound contraction significantly reduces the urethral lumen caliber.
i)Direst vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU)

Endoscopic incision is made under direct vision at the 12 o'clock position with a urethrotome. Care must be taken not to injure the corpora cavernosa because this could lead to erectile dysfunction. It is not done for membranous urethra because of the proximity to the internal sphincter mechanism.
DVU is not appropriate for bulbar urethra and open urethrotomy advocated
ii) Internal Blind urethrotomy
iii) Perineal urethrotomy

\section*{Postoperative details}
1. Patients are placed on bedrest for $24-48$ hours, depending on the extent of the procedure.
2 . Intravenous antibiotics are continued for 24 hours and then followed with oral culture-specific antibiotics or antibiotics with good gram-negative coverage for 2-3 days.
3. Advive on sexual abstinence
4. Catheter left in situ for 2 weeks
5. Wounds should be washed with soap and water daily after drains are removed.
Prior to removal of the urethral catheter, a voiding cystourethrogram is conducted with contrast, instilled through the suprapubic tube. If no evidence of contrast extravasation occurs and the suture line is intact, then the urethral catheter is removed and the suprapubic tube is capped.

\section*{Complications}
1.Urinary tract infection
2.Wound infection
3.Wound dehiscence
4. Urethrocutaneous fistula
5.Recurrence of urethral stricture

\section*{Post-op}
-Catheterize with a 3-way catheter for irrigation for 1-2days (Until clear on irrigation)
-Insert urethral catheter for 2wks
-Repeat Urethral calibration/Flow rate to determine improvement
-Discharge on clean intermittent self catheterization with Nélaton catheter (Filiform is better)

\section*{VARICOSE VEINS}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT. \\ Definition}

Varicose veins are dilated, elongated and tortuous veins.
Varicose veins are signs of chronic venous insufficiency

\section*{Incidence}

It is estimated that $10-20 \%$ of the world's population has varicose veins in the lower extremities.

\section*{Sex}

They are more common in women, and the prevalence increases with age.

\section*{Location}

They are most common in the lower extremities-medial aspect of leg.
But also occur in other areas, such as the spermatic cord (varicocele), esophagus (esophageal varices), and anorectum (hemorrhoids).

\section*{Classification}

On the basis of predisposing factors varicose veins are divided into two classes: primary and secondary.
Primary varicose veins are associated with normal deep veins. Secondary varicose veins, are complication of deep venous disease or arteriovenous fistula.

\section*{Etiology}

\section*{Primary varicose}
1. Incompetence of the valves- either in the main saphenous trunks or in the communicating veins
( perforators)Incompetent valves cause higher pressure at the subjacent valve and localized dilatation of the affected venous segment.
2. Weak wall theory assumes an inherited weakness of the vein wall, producing venous dilatation even with normal pressures and secondary failure of valvular competence.
- $50 \%$ of patients give a family history of the illness.
-Varicose veins more common in pts with diverticular disease of the colon and low-roughage diet.
-Aggravating factors associated with an increased incidence of varicose veins are
- Female sex
- Parity
- Constricting clothing
- Prolonged standing
- Marked obesity
- Estrogens replacement or oral contraceptives.

\section*{Secondary varicose veins}

\section*{DVT}
-Develop following damage or obstruction to the deep veins. Recanalization of the thrombosed deep veins leaves the valves incompetent, and this loss of valve sufficiency leads to reflux and places an unusual strain on the superficial veins, which have little external support because of their location relative to the deep fascia of the leg.
Obstruction of the inferior vena cava or iliac veins can result in secondary varicosities in the lower extremities.

\section*{An arteriovenous fistula}

An arteriovenous fistula may also lead to regional varicose veins. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (congenital arteriovenous malformation)associated with extensive varicosities of the lower extremities, usually in atypical locations (eg, lateral), and absence or maldevelopment of the deep veins.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{History}
-Leg pain and discomfort- Pain dull, heavy, bursting sensation, especially after prolonged standing, prolonged inactivity and is relieved by elevation of the leg, by the use of an elastic stocking and activity as walking
-Leg swelling -The swelling is mild and usually involves the feet and ankles only. It resolves completely on elevation of the leg in bed overnight.
-Skin itchiness and changes in pigmentation.
-In women, symptoms are often more severe in the few days just prior to menses
-The symptoms of primary varicose veins are rarely severe, and most patients seek medical advice for cosmetic reasons. Secondary varicose veins due to chronic deep venous insufficiency often cause more severe symptoms.
-Leg ulcers-Progression to ankle ulcers is relatively common in secondary ulcers, whereas this complication is rare with primary varicosities.
-Hemorrhage, sometimes of serious magnitude, may be induced by traumatic rupture of a varix or may be spontaneous
-Predisposing factors
-Hormonal contraceptives
-Parity-Multiparity predispose
-Current or last pregnancy
-Occupation- prolonged standing?
-Cigarette smoking
-HTN and DM
-Family history
-Previous hx of deep venous thrombosis
-Previous fractures of femur or pelvis or surgery
-Prolonged immobilization-chronic illness or fractures
-Rule out other causes of ulcers

\section*{MIDNNIGHT}

M-Metabolic causes as diabetes mellitus
I-Insufficencies-Ischemia-Venous ,arterial insufficiency (atherosclerosis, embolic,thrombotic)
D-Degenerative conditions-SLE,RA, Ulcerative colitis
N-Neoplastic causes-SCC, Malignant melanoma,
Basal cell carcinoma

H-Hematological -Sickle cell disease, Leukemia
T-Trauma

\section*{ON EXAMINATION}

General examination
CVS examination

\section*{LOCAL EXAMINATION}

Should be done when the patient is standing:

\section*{Inspection}
1. Reveals dilated, elongated, and tortuous subcutaneous veins of the thigh and leg.
2.Swelling

This is mainly due to oedema which may be localized or found extensively over the limb.
The volume of over distended veins can also make a significant contribution to the bulk of a limb, especially in foot. Measure the limb girth from tibial tuberosity.
General inspection of calf muscles for any signs of DVT swollen, skin stretched and shinny
3. Saccules along the veins
4. Induration- A characteristic diffuse fibrosis develops in the subcutaneous tissues
5.Pigmentation- is due to the accumulation of haemosiderin in the skin. It is often the earliest
6. Ulceration-A venous ulcer will always be surrounded by pigmented skin and at least some indurations .Causes of ulcerations in Varicose veins:
-ischemia and poor perfusion
-Infection
-Poor healing
-Itchiness and scratching
Examination of ulcers
- Site
- Size
- Shape
- Edges(undermined eg buruli ulcer, overhanging eg malignant ulcer,irregular or regular)
- Depth
- Floor-clean, necrotic tissue, granulation tissue,bleeds
- Base-palpated ,mobility, tenderness
- Surrounding areas
7. Eczema and dermatitis

\section*{Palpation}
-If there is apparent swelling, is there any pitting edema?
-Are varicose veins warm to touch ?
-Do they show a cough impulse? Varicose veins commonly give a palpable impulse when the patient coughs. This is because there is no functioning valve between the abdomen and the vein, and it confirms incompetence in the valves of deep and superficial veins leading down to this point.
-If there is an isolated bulge on the inner thigh, is there a thrill on coughing indicating an underlying jet of blood through a leaking valve?

Tap-wave test (percussion test of Chevrier)
In the standing patient with fully distended veins, a tap or sharp compression of a vein will send a corresponding wave of movement along its length, easily detected by light touch. This assists in mapping out the varicose vein involved.

Examination with patient horizontal and the limb elevated to 45
Hollows and grooves in the elevated limb When the limb is elevated the veins will empty and the space occupied by large varicose veins becomes a hollow or a groove readily palpable or even visible. This is particularly marked when the surrounding tissues have become fibrotic in response to venous hypertension.

\section*{The Brodie- Trendelenburg type of test (selective occlusion test)}

Brodie-Trendelenburg test is a useful maneuver to test the valvular competence of the perforating veins and those in the greater saphenous system. With the patient supine, the leg is elevated until all the blood is drained from the superficial veins The saphenofemoral junction is occluded with a tourniquet and the patient asked to stand and the filing pattern of the veins observed.
If the veins fill rapidly from below, the valves in the perforating veins are incompetent and the varices are being filled from the deep system.
If varicosities are due to saphenofemoral valve insufficiency, the varicosities will remain flat or undetectable when the patient stands.
The tourniquet can be applied at different levels to get the level of the incompetent perforators.

\section*{Perth's Test}

Tests the deep venous pumping system and perforators. If positive then the problem lies in the superficial veins.

\section*{Other examination}
1.Report pulses-dorsalis pedis,popliteal and femoral pulses to rule out arterial insuficieny
2.Lymphadenopathy -inguinal to rule out malignant ulcers especially malignant melanoma.
- infectious causes
3.Sensory examination of the lower limb to rule out the neuropathic ulcers

\section*{Investigations}

Laboratory
1.Random blood sugar-Diabetic mellitus
2.FDP-Fibrionogen Degradation Products
3.D-Dimers
4.Homocysteine

Other Baseline
U/E and Creatinine-end organ failure ulcers, HTN
FHG-Anemia, Infections ,leukemia

\section*{Imaging}
1.Doppler Ultrasonography-3-D,2-D,Colour Doppler Hand held Doppler check for:
-DVT
-Incompetent perforators
-Reflux
-At sonography compressibility test of veins shows venous HTN if the veins can not be compressed.
2.Venogram
3.Ples-thysmo-graphy
4.Vascular MRI

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Ulcer management
-Management of varicose veins
-Management of underlying cause

\section*{Ulcer management}
-Pus swab for MCS
-Clean and dress wound daily. Dress with honey or sugar dressing.
-Antibiotics as appropriate if infected.
-If wound clean- secondary wound closure may be done if not skin graft.
-Eczematous skin-Dexamethasone cream

\section*{Varicose veins Management}
-Treatment of varicose veins should relieve discomfort, prevent or ameliorate the complications of venous stasis, improve the appearance of the extremity, and, if possible, eliminate the cause of the varicosities to prevent progression of the disease.
-About one-third of patients with simple varicose veins require no therapy at all or only advice about taking care of their legs.

\section*{1.Nonoperative Management:}

Aim to improve venous return and reduce pressure in varicose superficial veins.
-Encourage walking discourage prolonged sitting and standing.
-Elevate the leg as frequently as possible to reduce venous pressure.
- Properly fitted elastic stockings will compress the superficial veins and prevent reflux of blood from the deep to the superficial veins via incompetent perforators, prevent edema, and assist the muscular pumping action of the calf.
Elastic support combined with periodic elevation and exercise is the treatment of choice for most patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and gives excellent relief of symptoms when the varicosities are mild.

\section*{2. Sclerotherapy}
-Obliterates and produces permanent fibrotic obliteration of collapsed veins.
-With the patient recumbent and the vein collapsed, small amounts ( $\mathbf{0 . 5 ~ m L}$ ) of sclerosing solution ( $3 \%$ sodium tetradecyl sulfate) are injected into each varix with a fine-gauge needle.
-Isolation of the injected segment is maintained by digital pressure; thereafter, continuous pressure on the veins is maintained for 1-2 weeks with elastic bandages. This prevents thrombosis and allows a fibrous union to form between the two walls of the collapsed vein.
Extravasation necrosis of the skin is the most serious local complication
Best reserved for small unsightly veins, dilated superficial veins, lower leg perforators, and recurrent or persistent veins after operation.
With incompetence of the main long or short saphenous vein, the only effective treatment is surgery

\section*{3.Surgery:}

Indications
1) Severe symptoms
2) Very large varices, even if asymptomatic
3) Superficial phlebitis;
4) Hemorrhage from a ruptured varix
5) Ulceration from venous stasis (usually in conjunction with deep venous insufficiency);
(6) Cosmetic reasons.

Surgical treatment entails removal of the varicose veins and ligation of incompetent perforating branches.

\section*{Venous stripping}
-Incompetent superficial and perforating veins must all be identified and marked preoperatively.
-Introduce the stripper distally and drive it proximally.
-Proximal high tie(at the sphenofemoral junction)can be done.
-Once it is tied and the veins ligated at the end then the stripper is pulled stripping the veins.
-Postoperatively, the legs are supported with elastic bandages for approximately $\mathbf{6}$ weeks.
-Elevation of the legs in bed minimizes postoperative swelling.
-Walking is encouraged, but sitting and standing are forbidden.

\section*{Stab avulsion}
-Patient with less significant varicosity.
-Does not involve the great saphenous or small saphenous veins.
-Indicated for small isolated varicosities.

\section*{Modern management}

Endoluminal lazer
Radiofrequency ablation

\section*{Complications of varicose veins}
1.Ulcers
2.Dermatitis and eczema
3.Cellulitis
4.Venous thrombophlebitis
5.Haemorrhage

\section*{Results \& Prognosis}

After surgical treatment, varicosities recur in about $10 \%$ of patients.
-The most common causes of recurrence are failure to ligate all the tributaries of the greater saphenous system at the saphenofemoral junction and failure to ligate the incompetent perforators

\section*{WOUND HEALING}

Forms of wound healing:
1. First intention
2. Second intention.

First intention (primary) healing occurs when tissue is cleanly incised and re approximated and repair occurs without complication.
Second intention (secondary) healing occurs in open wounds through formation of granulation tissue* and eventual coverage of the defect by spontaneous migration of epithelial cells. Most infected wounds and burns heal in this manner
Granulation tissue is the red, granular, moist tissue that appears during healing of open wounds. Microscopically, it contains new collagen, new blood vessels, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells, especially macrophages.
Primary healing is simpler and requires less time and material than secondary healing. It sometimes happens that primary healing is possible but there is insufficient reserve to support secondary healing.
Eg. Ischemic limb may heal primarily, but if the wound opens and becomes secondarily infected, it may not heal.

\section*{Healing phases}

Injury profoundly disrupts the chemical environment and architecture of tissues.
The postinjury environment, characterized by impaired perfusion coinciding with inflammation, invokes a number of fundamental biochemical, physiologic, and cellular coping mechanisms in process of healing.
Process includes
- Coagulation
- Inflammation
- Fibroplasias and matrix deposition
-團 Angiogenesis
- Epithelialization
- 8 Contraction.

Cells involved are platelets, leukocytes (especially macrophages), fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Signals that direct them cytokines and growth factors as Insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), transforming growth factors (TGFs), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), leukocyte-derived growth factors (LDGFs), platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), and EDGF.
These molecules may also behave as chemoattractants, inhibitors of differentiation, and stimulants of specific protein synthesis. In higher doses, they may be cytolytic.Cytokines include interleukins 1,2,6 and TNF-alpha

\section*{1.COAGULATION \& INFLAMMATION}

Clotting of blood contributes the first reparative signals. Fibrinopeptides, fibrin, thrombin and platelets released PDGF, IGF-1, and TGF(beta) attract other inflammatory cells esp macrophages into injured tissue.
Inflammation begins as damaged endothelial cells release cytokines, which induce integrin and integrin receptor expression in passing leukocytes.
The leukocytes adhere to local endothelial cells and enter the injured extravascular space attracted by tissue complement factors, fibrinopeptides, growth factors, and cytokines. Initially, inflammatory components such as histamine, serotonin, and
kinins cause vessels to constrict as an aid to hemostasis and then to dilate a short time later
During inflammation, vessels become porous and release cells and blood plasma into the injured area.
The newly arrived inflammatory cells increase metabolic demand. Since the local microvasculature has been damaged, $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ falls while $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and lactate accumulate. Lactate in produce more vasodilatation and attract more inflammatory cells.
Vicious cycle is thus set with macrophages taking the role of releasing chemo attractants as coagulation derived factors decrease.
Macrophages release more lactate even in the presence of oxygen, thereby maintaining the environment of injury. The environment causes them to release growth promoters and more lactate, which in turn stimulates angiogenesis and collagen deposition.
By $2^{\text {nd }}-3$ rd day Unless the wound becomes infected, its granulocyte population, which dominated on the first day, has diminished. Macrophages now cover the cut surface. In $3{ }^{\text {rd }}-4{ }^{\text {th }}$ Immature fibroblasts, the product of growth signals, lie just beneath, mixed with bud of new vessels. More mature fibroblasts are scattered behind

\section*{2.FIBROPLASIA \& MATRIX DEPOSITION}

\section*{Fibroplasia}

Replication of fibroblasts is stimulated by PDGF, IGF-1, and TGF (beta) released by platelets and continuing with cytokine released by macrophages. Fibroblasts appear to release IGF-1. EGF and IGF-1 are also delivered by blood.
Fibroplasia is mainly near the wound edge, where they are exposed to the growth environment and to an higher oxygen tension.
Smooth muscle cells are likely progenitors of fibroblasts as they seem to stream from the adventitia and media of vessel.

\section*{Matrix Deposition}

Replicated fibroblasts secrete the collagen and proteoglycans of the connective tissue matrix that weld wound edges together. Both assume high-molecular-weight polymeric forms and become the physical basis of wound strength.
Some growth factors (TGF(beta) and IGF-1) promote collagen gene transcription. Accumulation of lactate in the extra cellular environment directly stimulates transcription of collagen genes as well as synthesis and deposition of the protein itself.

\section*{3.ANGIOGENESIS}

It becomes visible about 4 days after injury but begins 2 or 3 days earlier when new capillaries sprout out of preexisting venules and grow toward the injury in response to chemo attractants released by platelets and macrophages.
In primarily closed wounds sprouting vessels soon meet counterparts migrating from the other side of the wound, and blood flow across the wound is established. In unclosed wounds or those not well closed, the new capillaries fuse only with neighbors migrating in the same direction, and granulation tissue is formed instead.
Wound angiogenesis appears to be a response to local energy depletion ,hypoxia and lactate accumulation.

\section*{4.EPITHELIALIZATION}

Epithelial cells respond to many of the same stimuli as do fibroblasts and endothelial cells. A variety of growth factors
regulate replication. TGF (beta), for instance, tends to keep epithelial cells from differentiating and thus may potentiate and perpetuate mitogenesis, though it is not itself a mitogen for these cells. TGF(alpha) is an epithelial cell mitogen.
Mitoses appear in epithelium a few cells away from the wound edge. The new cells migrate over the cells at the edge and into the unhealed area, perhaps attracted by a growth factor or cytokine, and anchor on the first unepithelized place, forming a new wound edge.
The $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ on the underside of the cell at the anchor point is likely to be low. Low $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ stimulates squamous epithelial cells to produce TGF(beta), presumably hindering terminal differentiation and favoring mitosis. This process repeats itself until the wound is closed.
Squamous epithelialization and differentiation proceed maximally when the local $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ approaches about 700 mm Hg and when surface wounds are kept moist, even short periods of drying can impair the process. The exudate from acute, uninfected, superficial wounds also contains growth factors and lactate and therefore recapitulates the growth environment found internally.

\section*{5.COLLAGEN FIBER MATURATION, LYSIS, \& CONTRACTION}

Replacement of an extracellular matrix is a complex process. First, fibroblasts replace the provisional fibrin then extracellular matrix with collagen monomers.
Extra cellular enzymes, some of which are $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$-dependent, quickly polymerize these monomers but in a pattern that is much more random than normal, thus leaving young wounds weak and brittle.
This brittleness is overcome when the hastily placed matrix is replaced with a more mature one consisting of larger, better organized, stronger, and more durable fibers.
Fibroblasts and leukocytes secrete collagenases that ensure the lytic component. Turnover occurs rapidly at first and then more slowly. Even in simple wounds, increased turnover can be detected chemically for as long as 18 months. Healing is successful when a net excess of matrix is deposited despite concomitant lysis.
During rapid turnover, wounds gain strength and durability but also are vulnerable to contraction and stretching. Fibroblasts provide the motive force for contraction. Receptors in fibroblast membranes attach to collagen molecules and pull them together when the cell membranes shorten as the fibroblasts migrate. The fibers are then fixed in the packed positions, probably by a variety of cross-linking mechanisms. Both open and closed wounds tend to contract if not subjected to a superior distorting force. The phenomenon is best seen in surface wounds, which in areas of loose skin may close $90 \%$ or more by contraction alone.
On the back, the buttock, or the neck, this is often a beneficial process, whereas in the face and about joints, the results may be disabling or disfiguring formation of contractures or strictures. Skin grafts, especially thick ones, impede but do not totally stop the process.

Dynamic splints, passive or active stretching, or insertion of flaps containing dermis and subdermis may be needed to counteract contraction. The force can be quite strong, though even severely contracted joints can usually be straightened with countertraction. Contraction occurs as long as collagen deposition is active, and
chronic, slowly healing wounds (eg, as in ischemic tissues) are particularly likely to contract. Prevention of a stricture in a ureteric repair, for example, depends on ensuring that the opposing tissue edges are well perfused so that healing can proceed quickly to completion.
Healing wounds may also stretch during active turnover when tension overcomes contraction. This may account for the laxity of scars in ligaments of injured but unsplinted joints and the tendency for hernia formation in abdominal wounds of obese patients

\section*{6.COMPLETION OF HEALING}

Normally, the final stimuli to release of growth factors and cytokines seem to be local hypoxia and lactic acidosis. When these stimuli disappear as the new microcirculation matures, healing should stop.
Keloids, local overgrowths of connective tissue, and hypertrophic scars, which occur particularly in pigmented skin, probably represent a loss of normal control over the healing process.

\section*{Factors impairing healing}
1.Disorders of inflammation-steroids, immune suppression, cytotoxics
2.Impaired perfusion- Prevention or resolution of problems can be achieved by turning off sympathetic activity by correcting blood volume deficits, alleviating pain, and avoiding hypothermia. Wounds in highly vascularized tissues (eg, head, anus) heal fast and are quite resistant to infection.
3.Malnutrion
4.Endocrine disorders
5.Infestion.
6.Radiation
7.Foreign body
