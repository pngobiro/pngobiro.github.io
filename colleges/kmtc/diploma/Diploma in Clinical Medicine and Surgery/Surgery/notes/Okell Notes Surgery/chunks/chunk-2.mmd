\section*{BENIGN PROSTATIC ENLARGEMENT (BPE)}

\section*{Etiology}

\section*{Thought to related to}
1. Hormones-balance between testosterone, estrogen, prolactin and growth factors.
2, Age-the mesenchymal theory that apoptosis of cells is slowed in favor of cell proliferation with advancing age.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia related to either the obstructive component of the prostate or to the secondary response of the bladder to the outlet resistance. Obstruction can be due to either mechanical or dynamic
As prostatic enlargement occurs, mechanical obstruction may result from intrusion into the urethral lumen or bladder neck, resulting in a higher bladder outlet resistance. Prostatic size on digital rectal examination (DRE) correlates poorly with symptoms.
The dynamic component of prostatic obstruction explains the variable nature of the symptoms. The prostatic stroma is composed of smooth muscle and collagen and is rich in adrenergic nerve supply. Level of autonomic stimulation thus sets a "tone" to the prostatic urethra. Alpha-blocker therapy decreases this tone, resulting in a decrease in outlet resistance.
The irritative voiding complaints result from the secondary response of the bladder to the increased outlet resistance. Bladder outlet obstruction results in detrusor muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia as well as collagen deposition. This leads to a decrease in bladder compliance, but detrusor instability also occurs. Also due to chemical from the urine deposit on the wall of bladder and stimulate contractility

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Quiz: Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with benign prostatic enlargement?

\section*{History}

Age usually greater than 40 years. With both irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms.

\section*{Irritative Symptoms}

Due to chemical from the urine deposit on the wall of bladder and stimulate contractility.
- Nocturia
- Frequency
- Urgency/urge incontinence
- Dysuria

\section*{Obstructive symptoms}

Can be mechanical due to the prostatic enlargement or dynamic obstruction- the increased tone of the bladder neck and internal sphincter
- Intermittency/hesitancy
- Poor urinary stream
- Incomplete emptying and dribbling-Acute or chronic RF
- Straining

Any symptoms of complications:
-Acute urinary retention
- Suprapubic pain
- Complete inability to pass urine
-Chronic urinary retention
- Usually painless
- Can pass some urine -presence of other complications
-Signs of UTI- Fever, Dysuria and frequency.
-Pyelonephritis-flank pains, fever and vomiting
-Renal failure-Leg edema, scrotal edema

\section*{Physical examination}

General examination-complications
Anemia-chronic renal failure
Pitting edema.
Fever-UTI

\section*{Addominal examination}
-Suprapubic distension-acute retention-full bladder.
-Abdominal distension especially flanks-Hydronephrosis
-Suprapubic tenderness and full bladder.

\section*{DRE}
-Normal anal sphincter tone.
-Prostate is firm, smooth and mucosa over is mobile
-Medial sulcus felt, the symmetry maintained.

\section*{Neurological examination}
-Tests for the sacral plexus to rule out any cause of neurogenic bladder.
- Perianal senation and anal wink
- S1, S2, S3 tests of sensation from the lateral foot and back of thigh and ischial tuberosity.
- ? Diabetis neuropathy

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Laboratory}
1.FHG
- WBC and differential to rule out any UTI
- ESR and C-reactive proteins
2.Urinalysis

Dipstick-nitrites show UTI R/o hematuria
Mcroscopy-RBC casts, WBC
3.U/E and Creatinine

Rule out obstructive uropathy to upper tracts
4.PSA

Usually age dependent but $0-4 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dl}$ regarded as normal range.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$0-49$ years & $2.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dl}$ \\
$50-59$ years & $3.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dl}$ \\
$60-69$ years & $4.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dl}$ \\
$70-79$ years & $5.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$ \\
$>90$ years & $>6.5 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dl}$
\end{tabular}

Other conditions with increased PSA include
1.Prostatitis
2.Prostatic infarction
3.DRE or prostatic massage for culture
4.Sexual intercourse(when doing PSA patient abstains for 3days)
5.Instrumenation- passing sound
6.Cancer of the prostate

Predictive value of PSA for cancer prostate
$\mathbf{0 - 4 ~ g} / \mathbf{d l}$ 5\% chance(poorly differentiated cancer)
$4-10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl} 25 \%$
>10g/dl >65\%
5. Diabetic Neuropathy - RBS
6.Urine flow rate/urodynamic studies

Using a urine flow meter. Q max is the maximum flow rate in $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$.
Normal flow rate in male is $20-25 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$
Females $25-30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$ (short urethra)
Elderly male 60 years $10-15 \mathrm{ml} /$ second
Qmax cut off for intervention is $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{sec}$

\section*{Imaging}
1.Abdominal ultrasound

Features to be evaluated:
-Post void residual urine-U/s first on full bladder then patient voids to determine the residual urine. (Normal-<30mL)
-Size of the prostate
-Upper urinary tract-Bladder, ureters, kidneys for any hydronephrosis

\section*{2. Transrectal U/S (TRUS) ± TruCut Biops}

\section*{3. IVU}

\section*{Any features of RF}

Otherwise optional because its expensive and radiation exposure IVU and U/S complimentary

\section*{4.Urodynamic studies-MCU}

Graphic representation of micturition cycle depends on the bladder and the urethra.
Rule out other causes e.g. Strictures, Calculi

\section*{5.Pressure-flow studies}

Neurological disorders eg
-Back surgery
-Spinal injury
-Medical conditions -DM, Multiple myeloma, Parknisonism. Intravesical pressure-chronic obstruction bladder loses its contractility. It gets low.
Maximum intravesical pressure is 60 mmHg . If pressure too low then the patient may not benefit from prostatectomy because of the lack of bladder wall contractility.
Detrussor pressure=Intra-abdominal pressure-intravesical pressure

\section*{MANAGEMENT-}

Depend on presentation (acute or Chronic retention), IPSS and response to catheterization.

\section*{A.ACUTE URINE RETENTION}
-Relieve the obstruction by catheterization-Suprapubic or transurethral.
-Usually use foley's catheter
-Silicone catheter avoids irritation thus better.
-Usually use gauge 16 or 18 for adults
-Catheterization procedure.
- Aseptic technique
- Clean and drape the genitalia
- Clean glans and urethral meatus with 3-4 swabs dipped in antiseptic
- Lubricate foleys catheter with K-Y jelly and or remican jelly. Some jelly may also be applied at the tip of glans penis
- Hold the penile shaft on the palm of the left hand and Apply traction forwards
- Insert the catheter into the urethral meatus, and advance it down the penile urethra to the base of the penis with successive, steady movements.
- Advance the catheter to the hilt (even if urine is obtained earlier) to ensure that the balloon is not inflated in the urethra.
- Inflate the balloon with the proper amount of sterile water for its size (usually 5 mL ), and withdraw the catheter until the balloon is pulled snugly against the trigone.
- Obtain a specimen for appropriate tests (at a minimum, routine urinalysis should be performed
Connect the urinary drainage system bag to the catheter
- Tape the catheter to the upper thigh, leaving sufficient slack so that movement of the leg will not pull on the catheter.
- Patient kept on catheter for 2 weeks.
-Meanwhile do urinalysis
-Keep patient on prophylactic antibiotics-Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Quinolones
-Offer medical therapy in terms of the following
a)Alpha-blockers

Prostate $<40 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ - Drugs of choice - $\alpha_{1 \mathrm{~A}}$-blockers e.g..
-Phenoxybenzamine-very toxic
-Prazosine
-Terazosin
-Doxazosine-long acting
-Tamulsine-highly selective for alpha 1 receptors
-Alfuzosine
These ↓ smooth muscle tone (prostate \& bladder)
S/E - Drowsiness; depression; dizziness; BP↓; dry mouth;
ejaculatory failure; extrapyramidal signs; nasal congestion; weight ↑
b) - $5 \alpha$-reductase inhibitors
e.g. finasteride, duta-steride
Used Prostate $>40 \mathrm{~cm} 3$ - Reduce testosterone's conversion to dihydro-testosterone, the androgen which is effective.
Adverse-loss of hair, retrograde ejaculation, impotence Combination of the two drugs often used.
c)Phytotherapy

Sans -palmetto berries
Pygium africanum
E.purpurae

After two weeks, do a trial without catheter of urine flow and the IPSS score
If the flow rate is more than $10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{sec}$ then management depends on the IPSS score and patients desire. IPSS score of 0-7 (mild) or 8-19(moderate symptoms) management can be by watchful waiting and lifestyle modification eg reducing fluid intake intake before bed -The patient may continue with medical therapy above for $\mathbf{3}$ months.

Indications for surgery if any of the following:
1. Recurent urinary retention
2.Flow rate less than $10 \mathrm{ml} /$ second
3.Deteriorating IPSS score
4. Failed medical therapy-compliance? Drug expired?

Usually medical treatment for 3 months.
5.Upper urinary tract complications as hydronephrosis
6.Recurent/refractory UTI
7.Renal failure
8.Prostatic calculi
9. Haemorrhage - Occasionally venous bleeding from a ruptured vein overlying the prostate
10.Patient cant afford the medical therapy anymore
11.Patients choice
12. Presence of co-morbidity and deterioration of quality of life.
13.Occupational consideration

If the flow rate is less than $10 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{sec}$ and severe IPSS score(2035 ) then surgical review
Continue with catheter and medication as they await surgery.
NB. In chronic retention of urine-slow decompression of the bladder by catheterization to avoid bleeding
If in renal failure then post catheterization go into a diuretic phase

\section*{B.PATIENT WITHOUT ACUTE URINE RETENTION Do IPSS}

Mild and moderate score do watchful waiting and lifestyle modification.
-reduce fluid intake in evening.
-Stop Alcohol and cigarette smoking
Severe without complications do medical treatment above20-35 (IPSS).
With complications surgery

\section*{Surgery}

Minimally invasive
1.Intraprostatic stents
2.Baloon dilatation
3.Laser
4.Thermal ablation
5.Cryotherapy
6.Bladder neck incision
7.High Intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
8.Transurethral Needle Ablation (TUNA)

\section*{Invasive Surgery}

\section*{Transurethral Procedures;}
i)Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TU-RP) - (Main) Indicated for small prostates - $50-60 \mathrm{~g}$;Post-op - Put a 3-way catheter (Balloning, irrigation \& drainage) for 5-7days
ii)Transurethral Incision of the Prostate(TU-IP) - It relieves pressure on the urethra with minimal destruction \& less risk of sexual dysfunction - Best surgical option for those with small glands $<30 \mathrm{gm}$
iii)Transurethral Laser-Induced Prostatectomy (TU-LIP)

\section*{Open procedures}

Larger prostates (usually $>75 \mathrm{~g}$ ) may require open surgery using the suprapubic or retropubic approach, permitting enucleation of the adenomatous tissue from within the surgical capsule. Because larger prostates require longer transurethral resection times, with
an increased risk of TURP syndrome and anesthesia complications.
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)
$50-70 \mathrm{~g}$ of prostate timed operation 90 minutes
i)Transvesical prostatectomy/(Frayer's prostatectomy)
*Post-op - Twin-tube bladder irrigation with warm saline to wash out clots till effluent is clear (1-2days); Remove urethral catheter after 8-14days.
ii)Retropubic prostatectomy/(Milin's prostatectomy)
*Post-op - Put a 3-way catheter (Balloning, irrigation \& drainage) for 5-7days

\section*{Advantages of Open Procedures;}
-Reduced re-operation rate (1.8\%)
-Peak flow post-operation is good

\section*{Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)}

Standard is surgery is Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is preferred because of low morbidity . The major complications include bleeding requiring transfusion, failure to void, and infection; rarer is "TURP syndrome," severe hyponatremia due to systemic absorption of the hypotonic bladder irrigation fluid used intra -operatively. Symptoms are referable to excess ammonia production (a glycine metabolite), excess fluid absorption (hyponatremia, hypervolemia), or both (water intoxication

\section*{Ammonia intoxication}

Ammonia encephalopathy may be manifested as a delayed awakening in the postoperative period that persists despite correction of intravascular fluid volume and electrolyte balance. Severe forms-somnolence, marked alteration in consciousness seizures,coma
Patients may develop convulsions and/or oliguria up to 24 hours after the operation
Hyponatremia-Hypervolemia
Initial hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, headache, visual disturbance, restlessness, chest pain, agitation, confusion, and lethargy

\section*{Post-op Advice}
1.Avoid driving for 2 wks after the operation
2.Avoid sex for 2 wks after surgery
3.Expect to pass blood in the urine for the first 2 wks
4. At first you may need to urinate more frequently than before.

In 6wks, things should be much better - but the operation cannot be guaranteed to work ( $8 \%$ fail, \& lasting incontinence is a problem in 6\%)
5.12-20\% may need repeat TURPs within 8yrs, compared with
$1.8 \%$ of men undergoing open prostatectomy
6. If feverish, or if urination hurts, do urinalysis, $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$.

\section*{Complications of TURP}
1.Haematuria/Haemorrhage
2.Infection; prostitis
3.Incontinence - $\leq 10 \%$
4. Retrograde ejaculation - 65\% - Resection of the sphincter in the upper part of the prostate \& bladder neck that subserves a sexual function.
5.Erectile Dysfunction - $\leq 14 \%$ - results from damage of the region of the neurovascular bundle supplying the autonomic
innervation to the copora of the penis in close relationship to the posterolateral aspect of the prostatic capsule
6.Haematospermia
7.Urethral trauma/Stricture
8.Clot retention near strictures
9.Post TURP syndrome ( ↓ $\mathrm{T}^{\circ}, ~ \downarrow \mathrm{Na}+$ ) - Systemic absorption of the hypotonic bladder irrigation fluid used intraoperatively (usually
$1.2 \%$ Glycine or Purisol is used - isosmolar \& high conductance) leads to;
- Hypervolaemia with ↑BP
- Dilutional ↓ Na+
- Haemolysis
- Cerebral oedema

Management Diuresis - Furosemide + Mannitol
10.Rupture of the Denonvilliers' fascia causing a faecal fistula
$11.20 \%$ need redoing within 10 yr

\section*{BLADDER CARCINOMA}

\section*{Introduction}
-Bladder cancer is a common urologic cancer.
$-4^{\text {th }}$ most common tumour in men after lung, prostate and colorectal cancer.
-Most cases are transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) worldwide, often described as polyclonal field change defects. In Kenya the TCC and SCC are thought to be about $50 \%$ each.
-Urothelium in the entire urinary tract may be involved, including the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra.
-Nonurothelial primary bladder tumors are rare and may include
1) Primary lymphoma
2) Rhabdomyosarcoma
3) Small cell carcinoma
4) Carcinosarcoma
5) Sarcoma

\section*{Sex and Age}
-The male-to-female ratio is $3: 1$.
-Women generally have a worse prognosis than men.
-The median age at diagnosis is 68 years, and the incidence increases directly with age

\section*{Race:}
-Bladder cancer is more common in whites than blacks; however, blacks have a worse prognosis

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

Predisposing factors below.
- Adenocarcinomas account for less than $2 \%$ of primary bladder tumors.
-These tumors are observed most commonly in exstrophic bladders and are poorly responsive to radiation and chemotherapy. Radical cystectomy is the treatment of choice. Also develop in persistent urachus.
-Most squamous cell carcinomas of the bladder in are associated with persistent inflammations from
1) Chronic cystitis-schistosomiasis
2) Long-term indwelling Foley catheters
3) Bladder stones.
-Small cell carcinomas are thought to arise from neuroendocrine stem cells and are aggressive tumors that carry a poor prognosis. -Carcinosarcomas are highly malignant tumors that contain both mesenchymal and epithelial elements.
-Primary bladder lymphomas arise in the submucosa of the bladder and are treated with radiation therapy.
Leiomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma of the bladder.
Rhabdomyosarcomas most commonly occur in children and carry a poor prognosis

\section*{Predisposing factors :Environmental}
1. Cigarette Smoking-Nitrosamine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4aminobiphenyl are possible carcinogenic agents
2. Industrial exposure to aromatic amines in dyes, paints, solvents, leather dust, inks, combustion products, rubber, and textiles
3. Prior radiation treatments to the pelvis
4. Exposure to acrolein, a urinary metabolite of cyclophosphamide, increases the risk of bladder cancer.
5.Artificial sweeteners (eg, saccharin, cyclamate)

\section*{SCC}
1)chronic cystitis-schistosomiasis
2)long-term indwelling Foley catheters
3)bladder stone

\section*{Genetic}
1. Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene $p 53$, found on chromosome 17 and Rb gene in chromosome 13.
2. Mutations of the tumor suppressor genes $p 15$ and $p 16$, found on chromosome 9.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{History}
1. Painless global hematuria mostly gross hematuria but may be microscopic
2.Irritative symptoms-dysuria, frequency, urgency
3.Obstructive symptoms especially around the bladder neck.-poor stream, straining, incomplete emptying
4.Passage of tissue particles
5.Mucosuria-Adenocarcinoma
6.Renal failure signs -oedema
-Inquiry of signs of advanced disease
- Back pains
- Hematochizia
- Pain on defecation
-Any other bleeding from rest of the body
-.Inquiry of predisposing factors-above

\section*{Physical examination}

Clinical examination is usually normal, although an abdominal or pelvic mass may be palpable in those with advanced disease.
Anemia -hematuria

\section*{DDX-Causes of heamaturaia}
1.Hemorrhagic Cystitis: Noninfectious
2.Nephrolithiasis
3.Renal Cell Carcinoma
4.Transitional Cell Carcinoma, Renal
5.Ureteral Trauma
6.UTI

\section*{Investigations}
1.FHG-Hb-Anaemia,WBC-UTI, Platelates-Hemorrhage
2.Urinalysis-Nitrites-UTI

Microscopy-Microscopic hematuria.In surgical hematuria the RBC are not dysmorphic but in medical RBC may appear dysmorphic.
3.Urine cytology -for malignant cells
4.U/E/C- Upper tract involvement
5.Tumour markers
-Bladder tumor antigen [BTA-Stat]
-Nuclear matrix protein [NMP-22]
-Fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products [FDP])
-Telomerase

\section*{6. Flexible cystoscopy}
-Urine for cytology
-Biopsy of the areas with lesions or just sampled biopsy.
-Resection of superficial tumors.

\section*{TNM Staging for Bladder Cancer}

CIS Carcinoma in situ
T0-No tumour
TX-Tumour cant be assessed
Ta- Tumour confined to the epithelium
T1- Tumor invasion into the lamina propria
T2- Superficial muscle involvement
T3a-Deep muscle involvement
b-Perivesical fat involvement
T4a -Adjacent organs such as prostate, rectum
b-Pelvic sidewall involvement

N+ Lymph node metastasis
M+ Metastasis

\section*{Medical therapy}

\section*{Intravesical immunotherapy}

\section*{Bacille Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy}

\section*{Indication}
-CIS, T1 tumors, and high-risk Ta tumors
-This therapy may help to decrease the rate of recurrence and progression of superficial TCC and may help to treat CIS or unresectable superficial tumors.
-BCG immunotherapy is the most effective intravesical therapy and is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis
-It induces a nonspecific, cytokine-mediated immune response to foreign protein. BCG is a live attenuated organism, it can cause an acute disseminated tuberculosis like illness if it enters the bloodstream.

\section*{Imaging}

\section*{1.IVU}

An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is the criterion standard for upper-tract urothelium imaging.
However high radiation and picks only the distortion caused by tumor-thus low sensitivity.

\section*{2.Retrograde pyelography}

\section*{2.Pelvic ultrasonography}

Cheap and available, no radiation. Picks tumours in the kidneys and bladder but poor in the ureters.

\section*{3.CT-scan for staging}

\section*{4.CXR}
-The use of BCG is contraindicated in patients with gross hematuria.
-BCG typically causes mild systemic symptoms that resolve within 24-48 hours after intravesical instillation.
-BCG also can cause granulomatous cystitis or prostatitis with bladder contraction.
Other Immunotherapy
-High dose vitamin A
-Interferons and IL-2 and 12
-Bropi-ramine

\section*{Intravesical chemotherapy}
-Valrubicin used for CIS that is refractory to BCG
-Other forms of adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy for superficial bladder cancer include intravesical triethylenethiophosphoramide (Thiotepa), mitomycin C, doxorubicin, and epirubicin.

\section*{Chemotherapy for metastatic cancer}
-The Methotrexate, Vinblastine, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin (MVAC) or (MAC-V ) combination is the standard treatment of metastatic bladder cancer.

\section*{Surgical Care:}

\section*{A) Superficial bladder cancer (Ta, T1, CIS)}
-Endoscopic resection and fulguration of the bladder tumor adequately treat superficial bladder cancer.
-Because bladder cancer is a polyclonal field change defect, continued surveillance is mandatory

\section*{B) Organ-confined, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (eg, T2, T3)}

\section*{Radical cystectomy with urinary diversions}

In men, this is the criterion standard -Remove the bladder, prostate, and pelvic lymph nodes.
In women, Anterior pelvic exenteration involves removal of the bladder, urethra, uterus, ovaries, and anterior vaginal wall

\section*{Ileal conduit (incontinent diversion)}

The ileal conduit is the most common incontinent diversion performed.
-Small segment of ileum (at least 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve) out of gastrointestinal continuity, but maintained on its mesentery, taking care to preserve its blood supply.
Restore the gastrointestinal tract with a small bowel anastomosis. Anastomose the ureters to an end or side of this intestinal segment and bring the other end out as a stoma to the abdominal wall.
Urine continuously collects in an external collection device worn over the stoma.

\section*{Indiana pouch (continent)}

This is a urinary reservoir created from a detubularized right colon and an efferent limb of terminal ileum Plicate the terminal ileum and bring it to the abdominal wall. The continence mechanism is the ileocecal valve.
Empty the Indiana pouch with a clean intermittent catheterization $4-6$ times per day.

\section*{C) Locally advanced tumour}

T4-advanced the surrounding organs and pelvic wall. Treatment with radical radiotherapy.
Role of salvage cystectomy if recurrence with radiotherapy.

\section*{BREAST CANCER:}

\section*{DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Introduction}

Any treatment or investigations thus far done

\section*{Physical examination}

General examination
- General condition
- Wasting ,dehydration
- Anemia
- Lympadenopathy

\section*{Breast examination}
-Explain to the patient the examination and her consent.
-Exposure-All clothes up to the waist removed.
Patient seated facing the examiner check:

\section*{Inspection}
-Symmetry of the breasts -sizes and Level of the nipples
-Nature of the nipples-everted or inverted and any discharges
-Any masses obvious on inspection -its location and extent, skin changes over it , any ulcers or discharged from it.
-Any other skin changes-ulcers, hyperpigmentation ,peau d'orange ,discharges
NB.Obvious size discrepancy, nipple inversion, skin dimpling, scaling, and edema (peau d'orange) are suggestive carcinoma

\section*{Palpation}
-Started from the normal side.
-Do quadrants-lower outer quadrant ,then lower inner , upper inner, upper outer quadrant and the axillary's tail then periareaolar region.
-If any masses fully described-Site, size, shape, temperature,skin changes, tenderness, margins, mobility and attachments, consistency, any thrills or bruits
-Squeeze nipple for any discharge-Ask patient

\section*{Lymph nodes Exam}
-Examine the tail and the axillarry lymph nodes-apical, lateral, posterior and anterior
-Supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy can be suggestive advanced disease.\}
NB
-Benign lesions are more frequently smaller, rubbery, wellcircumscribed, and mobile. Characteristics suggestive of malignancy include skin involvement, fixation to the chest wall, irregular border, firmness, and enlargement.
- Unilateral nipple discharge, nonmilky fluid, and origin from a single duct. Intraductal papilloma, a benign finding, is the most common cause of unilateral bloody nipple discharge. Other benign pathology associated with nipple discharge includes subareolar duct ectasia and fibrocystic changes. Usually, malignant pathology presenting with nipple discharge also is associated with a palpable mass and/or suggestive mammographic findings.

\section*{Investigation}

\section*{Mammography}

Mammography is the most useful technique for the detection of early breast cancer. The two methods of mammography in common use are ordinary film screen radiography and xeroradiography.
Its sensitivity of is decreased significantly in young patients with dense breast tissue and possibly with augmentation prosthesis.
Useful in evaluating the breast for calcifications, architectural distortion, skin thickening, nipple changes, and axillary adenopathy.
Enlargement, stellate shape, irregular or spiculated margins, and the presence of pleomorphic calcifications less than 0.5 mm in a given lesion all are suggestive of malignancy.

The American College of Radiology established the standard for classification of radiographic abnormalities, known as the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), as follows:

\section*{0. Incomplete examination - Usually requiring further imaging or evaluation}

\section*{I. Normal - With follow-up study recommended in 1 year}

\section*{II. Benign - Follow-up study in 1 year}

\section*{III. Likely to be benign - Follow-up mammogram in 6 months}

\section*{IV. Suspicious - Consider biopsy}

\section*{V. Highly suspicious for malignancy - Biopsy recommende}

\section*{Ultrasound}

As an adjunct to mammography, it can be particularly useful in younger patients or women with fibrocystic change. Its main use remains in distinguishing solid from cystic lesions. In the workup of nonpalpable lesions, US can be used to guide a needle biopsy or to place a localizing wire to direct an excisional biopsy Other imaging modalities include CT and MRI are used n the evaluation of metastasis

\section*{Diagnostic Procedures:}

\section*{Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)}
-One of the first-line diagnostic procedures in the evaluation of a palpable breast mass.
-It is particularly useful in evaluation of cystic lesions.
-Persistence of a palpable mass and recurrence following a repeat aspiration are general indications for open biopsy.
-Bloody cyst fluid should be examined by pathology and warrants an open biopsy.
-Clearly malignant and suggestive lesions warrant an open biopsy.
However, performing a biopsy of benign or indeterminate lesions depends on assessment of individual patient risk and correlation with physical examination findings.

\section*{True-cut (core) needle biopsy}

Gives architectural information and determine the invasiveness of a lesion.
This is a distinct advantage over FNA, particularly in patients with large palpable masses suggestive of cancer. In this instance, definitive diagnosis of malignancy by true-cut biopsy may eliminate the need for an open biopsy prior to definitive surgical treatment (eg, modified radical mastectomy, conservation).

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Supportive
-Specific
-Preventive

\section*{Supportive management}
1.Hydration
2.Hematinics or blood transfusion
3.Analgesia
4.Nutritional build up
5.Antibiotics if superimposed infection
6.Counselling

\section*{Specific management}

Surgical Management
Aims of breast cancer surgery
-To achieve cure if excised before metastatic spread has occurred
-To prevent unpleasant sequelae of local recurrence
Surgical options for the breast
i)Breast Conserving Surgery (BCS)

BCS is regarded as either wide local excision
(lumpectomy), quadrantectomy or segmentectomy
ii) Simple/Total mastectomy
iii)Radical mastectomy - obsolete

Mastectomy + reconstruction (immediate or delâyed)

\section*{Breast conserving surgery}

Indications;
1) Small (<5cm)single tumours in a large breast
2) Peripheral location
3) No local advancement or extensive nodal involvement
For tumours that are suitable for breast conservation there is no difference in local recurrence or overall survival when BCS + radiotherapy is compared to mastectomy

Contraindications;
a)Multicentricity
b)Widespread multifocal disease
c)Central tumours beneath or involving the nipple
d)Poor tumour differentiation
c)Disseminated disease

Wide local excision
Remove tumour + a ream of at least 1 cm of normal breast

Aims of axillary surgery
-30-40\% of patients with early breast cancer have nodal involvement
-The aims of axillary surgery is to:
- To eradicate local disease
- To determine prognosis to guide adjuvant therapy
- Clinical evaluation of the axilla is unreliable ( $30 \%$ false positive, $30 \%$ false negative)
- No reliable imaging techniques available
- Surgical evaluation important and should be considered for all patients with invasive cancer
- Levels of axillary clearance are assessed relative to pectoralis minor
-Level 1 - below pectoralis minor
-Level 2 - up to upper border of pectoralis minor
-Level 3 - to the outer border of the $1^{\text {st }}$ rib
-Axillary samplings removes more than 4 nodes

\section*{Arguments for axillary clearance}
-Axillary clearance both stages and treats the axilla
-Sampling potentially misses nodes and understages the axilla
-Surgical clearance possibly gains better local control
-Avoids complications of axillary radiotherapy

\section*{Arguments for axillary sampling}
-Only stages the axilla
-Must be followed by axillary radiotherapy
-The $60 \%$ of patients with node negative disease have unnecessary surgery
-Radical lymphadenectomy in other cancers (e.g. melanoma) produces disappointing results
-Avoids morbidity of axillary surgery
-The combination of axillary clearance and radiotherapy is to be avoided
-Produces unacceptable rate of lymphoedema

\section*{Sentinel node biopsy}
-Aims to accurately stage the axilla without the morbidity of axillary clearance
-Technique used to identify the first nodes that tumour drains to -Can be located following the injection of either
$\begin{array}{ll}\text { - } & \text { Radioisotope } \\ \text { - } & \text { Blue dye }\end{array}$
- Combination of isotope and blue dye -Can be injected in peritumoural, subdermal or subareolar site -Allows more detailed examination of nodes removed

\section*{b) MASTECTOMY}

\section*{Indications;}
1.Congenital supranumerary breasts
2.Extensive destruction of breast architecture $2^{\circ}$ to; Chronic infections (TB, Fungi),Sarcoidosis, Severe trauma 3.Tumours;
a) Early breast cancer (Carcinoma in-situ)
b) Large tumours (in relation to the size of the breast)
c) Central tumours beneath or involving the nipple
d) Multifocal disease
e) Local recurrence
f) Palliative (Toilet Mastectomy)
g) Prophylaxis where there is a strong family history
h) Patient preference

Landmarks (Surgery is medial to lateral);
Upper - Clavicle
Lower - 6th Rib
Medially - Lateral sternal boarder
Laterally - Anterior Axillary Fold

\section*{Types of surgery.}

Total or simple mastectomy: This describes removal of breast parenchyma, including nipple-areolar complex, with no node dissection. Commonly done
Any form of radical surgery is rarely done
Modified radical mastectomy: This procedure involves resection of the breast parenchyma and axillary nodes lateral and behind the medial border of the pectoralis minor (levels I and II).

Patey modified radical mastectomy: This describes modified radial mastectomy (MRM) with additional removal of level III nodes requiring division or resection of the pectoralis minor; compared to MRM, this procedure increases lymphedema from $3-10 \%$ in the arm.

Radical (Halsted) mastectomy: This procedure entails removal of all breast, axillary nodes through level III, and both the pectoralis minor and major muscles.
Rarely done because of associated morbidity following Surgery.

\section*{2.RADIOTHERAPY}

Minimum 2 weeks after surgery
-Usually used to clear the breast bed of any residual tumour thus used for local-regional treatment.
Up to a total of 600 grays fractionated.

\section*{Indications}
1. Extensive local disease with infiltration of the chest wall-local regional control
2.Heavy node positive disease \& Extensive lymphovascular invasion
3.Recurrent disease
4.Secondary to breast conservation surgery (Local radiotherapy) or simple mastectomy (Axillary radiotherapy)
5. Can be used in metastasis to the spine and bone for pain control

\section*{3.Chemotherapy in breast cancer}

Can be given as:
-Primary systemic therapy prior to locoregional treatment Adjuvant therapy following locoregional treatment
$\boldsymbol{=}$ Post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy
-Depends primarily on:
- Age / menopausal status
- Nodal status
- Tumour grade
-Combination chemotherapy more effective than single drug
-Most commonly used regimen $=$ CMF (Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, 5-Flurouracil)

\section*{-Given as six cycles at monthly intervals}
-No evidence that more than 6 months treatment is of benefit
-Greatest benefit is seen in pre-menopausal women
-High -dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue produces no overall survival benefit

\section*{-Primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy}
-Chemotherapy prior to surgery for large or locally advanced tumours
-Shrinks tumour often allowing breast conserving surgery rather than mastectomy
$\underline{.70 \%}$ tumours show a clinical response.In $20-30 \%$ this is response is complete
-Surgery required even in those with complete clinical response
- $80 \%$ of these patients still have histological evidence of tumour
-Primary systemic therapy has not to date been shown to improve survival.

\section*{4. Systemic Hormonal therapy}

Directed at putative micrometastases to delay relapse \& prolong survival;
1) To palliate symptoms in locally advanced or metastatic disease
2) Lymph node +ve
3) Poor prognostic node -ve women
4) For women with oestrogen or progesterone receptor +ve tumours; mostly post menopausal women. Effective in 8\% receptor -ve patients

\section*{Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERM), Oestrogen receptor antagonists e.g. Tamoxifen}
Admin. At 20 mg OD for 5 years.
-Started immediately diagnosis is made
-Also beneficial in reducing tumours in the contra-lateral breast
-Risk of contralateral breast cancer reduced by $40 \%$
-Greater benefit seen in oestrogen receptor rich tumours
Benefit still seen in oestrogen receptor negative tumours
Benefit observed in both pre and post menopausal women Adverse effects.
1. Endometrial changes - Hyperplasia, polyps, cancer \& uterine sarcoma
2. Thromboembolism
3. Occasional cystic ovarian swellings in premenopausal women
4. Occasional hypercalcaemia if bony metastases

\section*{Other hormonal drugs}

\section*{1.Oral aromatase inhibitors e.g. anastrazole}
-These block conversion of androgens to oestrogens in the peripheral tissues.
-For post-menopausal women who are unable to take tamoxifen therapy because of high risk thromboembolism or endometrial abnormalities

\section*{2.Gonadorelin (LHRH) analogues e.g. Goserelin}
-Induce a reversible ovarian suppression.
-Ovarian ablation in pre-menopausal receptor +ve patients.
-Management of advanced breast cancer in pre-menopausal women

\section*{3.Monoclonal antibody -Tras-tuzu-mab}

Tumours + ve for the HER2 protein may respond

\section*{Symptomatic \& Terminal care}

Hospice care
DXT to painful bony lesions

\section*{Biochemical measurements}

\section*{1.Hormone and growth factor receptors}
-ER positivity predicts for response to endocrine manipulation -EGF receptors are negatively correlated with ER and poorer prognosis

\section*{2. Oncogenes}

Tumours that express C-erb-B2 oncogene likely to be
-Resistant to CMF chemotherapy
-Resistant to hormonal therapy
Respond to anthracycline and taxols

\section*{3.Proteases}
-Urokinase and cathepsin D found in breast cancer
-Presence confers a poorer prognosis

\section*{Inflammatory Breast Cancer}

Inflammatory breast cancer is the appearance of inflamed breasts (red and warm) with dimples and/or ridges caused by the infiltration of tumor cells into the lymphatics. Inflammatory breast cancer can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between benign (non-cancerous) conditions (such as mastitis) and inflammatory malignancy (cancerous conditions). Though rare, inflammatory breast cancer may spread quickly to other parts of the body.
Treatment of inflammatory breast cancer treatment is generally quite similar to the treatment of Stage IIIB or IV breast cancer. In addition, patients usually undergo chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and/or radiation treatment.
-Patients who respond positively to systemic treatment may be candidates for mastectomy.

\section*{Paget's Disease of the Nipple}

Paget's disease of the nipple is a rare form of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola.
The skin may appear crusted, red, or oozing.
Prognosis is better if nipple changes are the only sign of the breast disease and no lump is felt.

\section*{Recurrence of Breast Cancer}

Women who experience a recurrence of breast cancer after lumpectomy are often treated simply by mastectomy (with or without breast reconstruction).
If cancer reoccurs after mastectomy, additional surgery may be necessary to remove tumors near the mastectomy site, followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy may also be administered.
Alternative treatment options for recurrent breast cancer include:
- Hormone therapy
- Surgery and/or radiation therapy if cancer is confined to one area and is operable
- Entry into a clinical trial testing new chemotherapy or hormonal drugs, or biological therapy

\section*{PREVENTION}
1. Breast self-examination, performed monthly, is recommended for women beginning at 18 years.
2. Annual evaluation -With mammography. is advised for those older than 40
3.Same done annually irrespective of age after removal of contra lateral breast for breast cancer
4. Removal of breast lumps
5.Tamoxifen is approved use in healthy women at high risk for the development of invasive breast cancer and for patients with early invasive lesions at risk of secondary contralateral cancer.
6.Lifestyle modification-diet, cigarette and alcohol smoking stopped
7.Propylactic mastectomy-patients with strong family history and ask for it themselves

\section*{Prognosis}

Prognostic factors
-50\% women with operable breast cancer who receive locoregional treatment alone will die from metastatic disease. -Prognostic factors have three main uses:
1.To select appropriate adjuvant therapy according to prognosis
2.To allow comparison of treatment between similar groups of patient at risk of recurrence or death
3.To improve the understanding of the disease

\section*{Prognostic factors can be grouped}

Chronological prognostic factors
1.Age

Younger women have poorer prognosis of equivalent stage

\section*{2.Tumor size}

Diameter of tumour correlates directly with survival 3.Lymph node status
-Single best prognostic factor
-Direct correlation between number and level of nodes involved and survival

\section*{4. Metastases}

Distant metastases worsen survival

\section*{Biological prognostic factors}
1.Histological type

Some histological types associated with improved prognosis: Tubular ,Cribriform ,Mucinous ,Papillary Micro-invasive

\section*{2.Histological grade}

Three characteristics allow scoring of grade into grades one, two or three depending on:
- Tubule formation
- Nuclear pleomorphism
- Mitotic frequency

\section*{3.Lymphatic / vascular invasion}
$\boldsymbol{-} 25 \%$ operable breast cancers have lympho-vascular invasion ,Double risk of local relapse,Higher risk of short term systemic relapse

\section*{Paget's Disease of the Nipple}

Paget's disease of the nipple is a rare form of breast cancer that begins in the milk ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and areola.
The skin may appear crusted, red, or oozing.
Prognosis is better if nipple changes are the only sign of the breast disease and no lump is felt.

\section*{Recurrence of Breast Cancer}

\section*{BURNS}

\section*{Definition}

Tissue injury caused by thermal, radiation, chemical, or electrical contact resulting in protein denaturation, loss of intravascular fluid volume due to increased vascular permeability and oedema.

\section*{Incidence}
$100 \%$ about $1 / 3$ of whom require admission

\section*{Etiology}

Chemical, Thermal, Electrical, Mechanical, Radiation, Frost bite

\section*{Persons at Risk of burns}
1.Extremes of age - the very young (<4yrs) or very old (>50yrs)
2. Those whose ability to protect themselves is impaired or prone to accidents Alcoholics, Sick, paraplegics ,diabetics, psychiatric patients and patients of convulsive disorders
3.The unlucky - Innocent bystander
4.The careless - Storing petrol in the house, adding paraffin to a lit stove, smoking in bed, working close to high tension electric wires

\section*{Skin Anatomy and Function}

Skin is the largest organ of the body.It is 0.025 m 2 in children and $\underline{\mathbf{1 . 8 m 2}}$ in adults. It has 3 major tissue layers.

\section*{Epidermis}

The outermost layer, the epidermis, is composed of stratified epithelium.
Epidermis has two components, an outer layer of anucleate cornified cells (stratum corneum) that covers inner layers of viable cells (Malpighian layers) from which the cornified surface cells arise by differentiation. The stratum corneum acts as a barrier to impede the entrance of microorganisms and toxic substances while allowing the body to retain water and electrolytes. Malpighian layers provide a continuous production of cornified cells. Malpighian layers can be further subdivided into the germinal basal cell layer, stratum spinosum, and stratum granulosum

\section*{Dermis}

Beneath the epidermis is the dermis, which is composed of a dense fibroelastic connective-tissue stroma containing collagen and elastic fibers and an extracellular gel termed ground substance.
The dermal layer contains an extensive vascular and nerve network, special glands, and appendages that communicate with the overlying epidermis. The dermis is divided into two parts.
a) The most superficial portion, the papillary dermis, is molded against the epidermis and contains superficial elements of the microcirculation of the skin. Within the papillary dermis, dermal elevations indent the inner surface of the epidermis
b) In the reticular portion of the dermis, collagen and elastic fibers are thicker and greater in number. Fewer cells and less ground substance are found in the reticular dermis than in the papillary dermis

Subcutaneous tissue The third layer of skin is subcutaneous tissue, which is composed primarily of areolar and fatty
connective tissue. This layer shows great regional variations in thickness and adipose content. It contains skin appendages, glands, and hair follicles

\section*{Functions of skin}
1.Protect entry of micro-organism

2,.Protect against UV light
3.Vitamin D synthesis
4. Homeostasis-Thermoregulation and prevent excess water loss
5.Cosmesis ,beauty and identification-finger prints

\section*{Pathophysiology of Burns}
-Tissue damage due to above agents leads to release of vasoactive substances e.g. prostaglandins, histamines, oxygen radicals, leukotrienes \& platelet activating factors
-This cause microvascular instability w;-ith increased capillary permeability for the first $24-36 \mathrm{hrs}$ fluid shift to extravasular compartment and oedema.
- This leads to decreased right atrial filling pressures decreased CO and Shock.
-The body tries to compensate for these physiological changes by
- Increased peripheral resistance (sympathetic stimulation)
- Tachycardia
- Decreased capacitance of great vessels

If the process goes uncorrected;
- Cardiac output is diverted to vital tissues reducing perfusion of skin, muscle \& gut - Skin feels cold \& clammy
- Reduced renal perfusion lead to acute RE
-Irreversible shock occurs as an end stage with falling BP, CO \& PR
-In patients with serious burns, release of catecholamines, vasopressin, and angiotensin causes peripheral and splanchnic bed vasoconstriction that can compromise in-organ perfusion
-Myocardial contractility also may be reduced by the release of inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha
-In deep third-degree burns, hemolysis may be encountered, necessitating blood transfusions to restore blood loss
-A decrease in pulmonary function can occur in severely burned patients without evidence of inhalation injury from the bronchoconstriction caused by humoral factors, such as histamine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2.
-A decrease in lung and tissue compliance is a manifestation of this reduction in pulmonary function.
Burned skin exhibits an increased evaporative water loss associated with an obligatory concurrent heat loss, which lead to dehydration and hypothermia.

\section*{Classification}

\section*{A. According to Cause;}

\section*{1.Thermal}

Open flames and Hot liquid are most common (heat usually $\geq 15$ $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ )
2.Caustic chemicals or acids (may show little signs or symptoms for the first few days)

\section*{Mechanisms of injury:}

\section*{-Extravasation}

Due to drug leakage into tissues e.g. All Cytotoxics, Sulphur drugs, Potassium drugs ,bismuth drugs

Causes Inflammation, vesicles; Skin necrosis may occur within 24 hrs \& Gangrene secondary to vascular spasm in 2-3days.MxPrevention close monitoring, Iv line in forearm and flush line well.
Once it occurs -stop drugApply normal saline gauze and change every 2 hours
Contact injury
Paraffin: Types of injury
-Local chemical reaction
-Thermal injuries
-Inhalational injuries (chemical pneumonitis and bronchospasm)
-Systemic poisoning
Acids - Cause severe superficial coagulative necrosis. Burning stops within 1-2hrs for HCL \& H2SO4 \& 7-14days for HOCL Amount ingested does not contribute to extent of injury.
-Initial mx -pour a lot of water for long 1-2 hours, dress with clean material and control pain.
-Can Excise area to prevent continued reaction
-Usually the graft take is very disappointing
Alkali - Causes deep liquifactive necrosis - penetrate tissue by saponification (Fat +alkali), hydrolyzing structural proteins \& dissolving cells along it's course thus amount ingested contributes to extent of injury. The burn runs for 7-14 days.
Management - Generously irrigate with fluid for 1-2 hours \& Dress in gauze soaked in NS or Ice $2-3 \mathrm{hrly}$.
DO NOT try to neutralize the chemical.
Can excise the area to prevent continued reaction.

\section*{3.Electricity}

Types low voltage ,high voltage and very high voltage
Low voltage is $<1000$ volts while high voltage is $>1000$ volts.
Very high voltage include injury from the grid and lightening injuries
Have entry and exit points. Main injuries are
-Myonecrosis, Renal failure and Heart arrhythmia
-Myonecrosis lead Myoglobinuria causing to Renal failure with very little damage to overlying skin.
-Arching burn -Occur around joints due to burn at joint surrounded by two areas of conductance.
-Side flash-Very high voltage burns due to lightening.
-Body resistance is about 500 ohms. Current of 1 ampere is required to cause cardiac asystole this usually does not occur with domestic electric burns because the voltage is about 240 V giving current of approx. O. 5 A .
-Thus TBSA is NOT an index for resuscitation. IV fluids are titrated against the volume of urine \& specific gravity (1.010). Usually X2 the physiological requirements ( $3 \mathrm{~L} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$ ) of the patient.
-In microwave injuries, the area is normal looking but anaesthetic due to depolarization of nerves
-Flash burns occur in technicians \& may resemble open flame burns
Mx - Give plenty of fluids
-Alkalinizing the urine and admin of mannitol aid in Flushing the myoglobin from the kidney
-Do fasciotomy of muscle compartment to avoid Compartment syndrome. Normal pressure is 30 mmHg
-Debride after 3-4days
4.Frostbite
5.Mechanical (Frictional) burns
6.Radiation injury

\section*{B. According to Depth of Injury}

Depth of burn proportional to;
- Temperature applied
- Duration of contact
- Thickness of the skin
- Heat capacity of the agent
- Transfer coefficient
- The specific heat and conductivity of the local tissues

The depth of injury determines formation of scar tissue.
1st Degree Burns;
-Epidermis only involved
-Commonly caused by UV light or very short flash or flame exposure
-Skin is red, dry \& hypersensitive thus painful
-No treatment except analgesia.
-Leaves no scarring on healing
2nd Degree Burns;
Superficial $2{ }^{\text {nd }}$ Degree
-Epidermis + Upper $\frac{1}{3}$ of Dermis
-Commonly caused by scald (spill or splash)
-Red, moist, weeping, cob blisters that Blanche with pressure
-Painful - due to nerve exposure, \& heals from 10-14days
-Leaves no scarring on healing but there is potential pigment changes

Deep $2{ }^{\text {nd }}$ Degree
-Epidermis + Upper $\frac{2}{3}$ of Dermis
-Commonly caused by scald, flame, chemicals, oil \& grease
-Cheesy white, wet or waxy dry; Do not Blanche with pressure
-Healing takes 14-21days
-Severe scarring \& risk of contractures

\section*{3rd Degree Burns (Full Thickness Burns);}
-Full Epidermis + Dermis are destroyed leaving no cells to heal and extends to the subcutaneous tissue.
-Commonly caused by scald, steam, flame, chemicals, oil, grease \& high voltage electricity
-Grey to charred \& black, insensate, contracted, pale, leathery tissue
-Severe scarring \& high risk of contractures
4th Degree Burns
Muscle involvement
5th Degree Burns
Bone involvement - Especially in epileptics who convulse during burning

Imaging-U/S,MRI
Major or Severe Burns also includes;
1. High voltage Electrical burns
2. Significant burn to face, eyes, ears, fingers, feet, joints, or genitalia
3. Significant associated injuries e.g. fractures \& other major trauma
4. Inhalational Injuries

Inhalational injury
Classified as supraglotic ,subglotic , or Global
Causes upper airway obstruction secondary to;
-Reflex Laryngospasm
-Oedema
-Sloughing of the mucosa , reduced clearance blockage and infection( Pneumonia)

Clinical presentation
-History of having been injured in an enclosed space e.g. house, motor vehicle
-Physical examination
1) Facial burns
2) Soot in nasopharynx
3) Respiratory distress- Tachypnoea - $\geq 25$ breaths/min ,Stridor, flaring of alae nasae
4) Coughing up carbonaceous sputum/soot
5) Hoarseness of voice (will indicate vocal cord swelling)

Management
1) Admit patient to High dependency care or ICU
2) Intubate earliest opportunity to avoid difficulty once edema sets in.
Tracheostomy is indicated in the first several days for patients who are expected to require ventilatory support for a few weeks or more.
If the neck is burned, excision and grafting followed by tracheostomy is indicated in order to improve pulmonary toilet.
3) Give $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%} \mathbf{O 2}$ by Mask or Endotracheal tube in serious inhalational injury. Should be moist the humidity will help loosen the secretions and prevent drying of the airway;
4) Bronchodilators by aerosol or aminophylline intravenously may help if wheezing is due to reflex bronchospasm.
5) Suction /lavage of bronchial secretions (bronchial toilet)
6) Chest physiotherapy with postural drainage is also required.
7) Bronchoscopy to evaluate extent of inhalational injury at same time do bronchial toilet
8) Investigation-Measure carboxyhaemoglobin; With $100 \%$
$\mathrm{O} 2, \mathrm{t} \frac{1}{2}$ of CO Hb falls from 250 mins to 40 mins
Others investigations
- BGA
- Hb
- CXR.

NB Pulse oximetry - Unreliable (may be normal
Patient need about $10-15 \%$ more of IV fluid calculated)

\section*{Rescue \& First Aid}

\section*{General considerations;}

\section*{Casualty and Ward Management Goals}
A. The first 48 hrs - All efforts are towards resuscitation \& saving lives
B. 48 hrs -6months- Prevention of complications
C. $>6$ months- Reconstructive surgery, Rehabilitation, Training

\section*{The first $\mathbf{4 8 h r s}$}

\section*{On arrival at casualty}
1.Primary Survey - Airway with cervical spine control (Look out for \& manage inhalational injury),Breathing, Circulation \& haemorrhage control, Disability \& Exposure
At this point -IV access large bore
-Central Venous Pressure Monitor (CVP)
-Urethral catheterization
-NG tube
-Endotracheal intubation if inhalational burn
2.Seconadary Survey
-History of the burn
-Physical examination from head toe - Calculation of the BSA
3.Medical Management

\section*{i) IV Fluids}

\section*{For Moderate \& Major/Severe Burns}

\section*{-Parkland's Formula}

\section*{4mL/Kg /TBSA}
-Crystalloids: Ringers Lactate or Hartmann's solution, NS
-Give $\frac{1}{2}$ within 8 hrs since the burn occurred and the rest in the next 16 hrs(most fluid loss occur 8-12 hours after the burn)
-Give $\sim 50 \%$ more in electrical burns \& inhalational injury

\section*{Monitoring of fluid therapy}

1-Adequate resuscitation is measured by urine output; (best guide)
Adults - $\underline{30-50 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{hr}}$ and Children - $\underline{0.5-1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg} / \mathrm{hr}}$
-Increase rate of infusion if the urine is less than $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ and decrease rate of infusion if the urine output greater than $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ because of risk of pulmonary oedema especially in inhalational injury
-However in electrical burns aim for $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ of urine to flush the kidney. Alkalization of the urine by adding sodium bicarbonate to the IV fluid increases the solubility and clearance rate of myoglobin in the urine
-Hemaglobinuria suggest deep burn hence flush the kidney with increased fluids and mannitol
-Decrease in BP and urine output suggest need for colloids but a decrease in urine output but normal BP suggest need for crystalloids
2- Pulse and BP recording .Pulse should be less than 120/minute
3-State of patient should be calm
4--Frequent chest auscultation to detect pulmonary oedema
5-Cerebral oedema especially in children may occur during fluid therapy
6-If possible CVP line is best guide for avoiding over infusion
7-Evaluate treatment every $3-4$ hours
Causes of inadequate fluid resuscitation in a burns patient
Inaccurate estimate of burn size, Undiagnosed inhalational injury ,Concomitant traumatic injury, Cardiac dysfunction, Refractory shock, Mathematicmiscalculation
-Neosporin or Bacitracin - Good for facial burns as they are not toxic to the eyes
OR - Apply antibiotic impregnated material

\section*{Other formulas for calculating fluids include:}
1.Evans Formula

\section*{2ml/Kg/TBSA}

NB
-TBSA only up to $50 \%$
-Total fluid given as mixture of colloids and crystalloids in the ration of 1:1.
Colloid include, blood and blood products- plasma, albumin
,dextrans, Gelatins as haemacele and Gelofulsine
Crystalloids are Normal Saline, Hartmans solutions
-Add $2000 \mathrm{ml}(2 \mathrm{~L})$ of $5 \%$ dextrose for insensible losses
-Half of all the fluids given I the $1^{\text {st }} 8 \mathrm{hrs}$ since occurrence of burn and the rest in next 16 hours
-After 24 hours give half of the fluids ( $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{BSA}$ ) plus the 2 L of $5 \%$ dextrose.

\section*{2.Brook Army formula}

\section*{2ml/Kg/TBSA}

NB
-TBSA only up to $50 \%$
-Total fluid given as mixture of crystalloids and colloids in the ration of 1.5:0.5 respectively
-Colloid include plasma, blood, dextrans, albumin
-Crystalloids are Saline, Hartmans solutions
-Add $2000 \mathrm{ml}(2 \mathrm{~L})$ of $5 \%$ dextrose for insensible losses
-Half of all the fluids given I the $1^{\text {st }} 8 \mathrm{hrs}$ since occurrence of burn and the rest in next 16 hours
-After 24 hours give half of the fluids ( $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{BSA}$ ) plus the 2L of $5 \%$ dextrose.

\section*{ii)Analgesics}

Give opiate analgesics IV (IM is ineffective erratic absortption); NSAIDS

\section*{iii)PPI or H2 Blocker}
protection from Curling's Ulcers (duodenal ulcers which occur in burned patients)

\section*{iv)Tetanus toxoid}

\section*{v) Prophylactic antibiotics If TBSA $>15 \%$}

If less do M/C and sensitivity before antibiotic administration

\section*{vi) Optional Drugs}
-DVT prophylaxis in lower limb burns
-Tetracycline eye ointment for Face burns
-Insulin if Diabetic or hypertensive control if hypertensive

\section*{Wound care}
i)Remove all necrotic tissue \& debris
ii)Rupture blisters except those on the palms \& soles of feet and those $>1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter. Can do early escharectomy and grafting iii)Wash wound with soap \& water or normal saline
iv)Apply topical antibiotic e.g.
-Silver sulphadiazine (S/E - thrombocytopenia, leucopoenia, rash-sulfonamide sensitivity)
-0.5\% Silver Nitrate - Stains tissues \& can cause hypochloraemic alkalosis \& hyponatraemia; Good for grafts
-Mafenide 10\% - can penetrate tissue \& eschar. Good for infected wounds \& eschars. very painful on application; carbonic anhydrase inhibition causing metabolic acidosis; sulfonamide sensitivity rash

\section*{v) Dressing}

Open Dressing - No dressing applied
Exposure Dressing - Apply soothant e.g. Vaseline
Occlusive dressing e.g. for small superficial previously debrided wounds
Apply non-stick material e.g. Bactigras
-Apply 3-5 layers of dry material e.g. gauze
-Cover with crepe bandage
-Change after 3days \& then daily up to day 21. If there is no healing, consider skin grafting.
-Silver sulfadiazine/transparent polythene bags for hands
-Skin grafting e.g. for frictional burns.
Indications for occlusive dressing
-If the burn is oozing too much
-If there is risk of infection
-Children
-If co-morbid conditions present
-Joints
-Patient's comfort

\section*{vi) Skin grafting}

If wounds don't heal between 21-30 days. Skin graft immediately for frictional burn. It encourages healing.
Graft-any tissue removed from one anatomical part of the body to recipient floor and its survival depend on the floor.(blood transfusion is not a graft)
Flap-(Pediculated graft) -removed with own blood supply.
Any part of the body can donate except the perineum and below the eyes.
Skin graft types: Spit thickness and Full thickness grafts
$1^{\text {st }} 24$ hours -graft survives by osmosis
Next 48 hours Neovascularization .Beyond its take or non-take (rejected)
Donor site kept dressed for 10-14 days.
Grafting across joints should apply splints to facilitate take

\section*{Biological dressing}
-Amniotic membrane
-Graft from mother allograft which is rejected in 2 weeks but left in situ as a biological graft.

\section*{Other considerations;}

Face burns
Intubate patient \& do temporary tarsorrhaphy (suturing eyelids together).
Whistling and blowing mouth for physiotherapy

\section*{In neck burns}

A pillow is placed under the patients head to hyperextend the neck
Pillow below the shoulders to prevent contractures
Chest wall burns
$2^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ degree burns do occlusive dressing
Do escharotomy for any scar constricting respiratory movementsDo a checker-box release

Upper limb burns
Should be nursed elevated at $45^{\circ}$ to reduce oedema
Escharotomy lateral and medial also in the web spaces Patient on bed with a pillow between his shoulders to prevent contractures.

\section*{Investigations in the first $\mathbf{4 8}$ hours}
1.FHG-Hb determination

Blood group and GXM if $\mathrm{HB}<10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$
2.U/E and Creatinine-Renal function and any electrolyte derangement
3.Blood Gas analysis and carboxy haemoglobin if inhalational burn
4.Input/output chart

\section*{Nutritional support}

Curreri formula $-25 \mathrm{KCal} / \mathrm{Kg}+(40 \mathrm{KCal} * \%$ TBSA $)$
Because burn injury causes a hypermetabolic state that is characterized by a dramatic increase in resting energy expenditure, nutritional support is essential, especially via the enteral route, to reduce intestinal villous atrophy

48hrs - 6months Management is based on complication control
Escharotomies

Surgical division of constricting eschars (scab formed especially after a burn).
Indications;
- 3rd \& 4th Degree Burns
- Circumferential burns - may compromise distal extremity blood flow. Performed on the midlateral or medial aspects of limbs, chest burns that would impair respiration

\section*{Escharectomy}

Surgical -Tangential excision
Medical-Use of mafenide, soaking with NS

\section*{After 6months - Reconstructive surgery, Training \&}

Rehabilitation
-Physiotherapy - Splint at night \& Motion during the day
- To control pain
- Reduce oedema \& swelling
- To protect the wound
- To minimize cosmetic defects
- To maximise patient's function
-Start physiotherapy from day after escharotomy- do it 5 times a week. At night do nocturnal splintage and for sleep comfort and avoid contractures

\section*{Lower limbs}

Encourage movements to avoid DVT.
NB If $\geq 80 \%$ TBSA - Supervised Neglect
-Occupational therapy - To rehabilitate the patient back into functional living
-Psychiatric rehabilitation

\section*{1month - 1yr}

Hypertrophic scars - Itchy, Hyperaemic, Uncomfortable

\section*{Over 1yr}

Keloids - A keloid is a true tumour arising from the connective tissue elements of the dermis.
By definition, keloids grow beyond the margins of the original injury or scar; in some instances, they may grow to enormous size.
Mx - Local injection of Steroids \& Bleomycin, Excision \& Superficial irradiation

\section*{Contractures}

\section*{10yrs}
