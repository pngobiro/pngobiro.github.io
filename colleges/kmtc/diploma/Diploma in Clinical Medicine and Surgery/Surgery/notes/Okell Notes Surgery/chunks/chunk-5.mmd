10.Cumulative brain damage ('Punch-drunk syndrome')
11.Neurological \& neuropsychological deficits e.g. Parkinsonism, Dementia
12. Neuroendocrine \& metabolic disturbances e.g. Diabetes insipidus.

\section*{HEMORRHOIDS}

\section*{Definition}
-Are vascular and connective tissue cushions in anal mucosa.
-Hemorrhoids function as protective pillows that engorge with blood during the act of defecation, protecting the anal canal from direct trauma due to passage of stool.
-Hemorrhoidal tissues engorge when intra-abdominal pressure is increased.
This occurs with obesity, pregnancy, lifting, and defecation.

\section*{Classification}

\section*{Internal hemorrhoids}
-Are found superior to the dentate line and lined with columnar epithelium.
-They have autonomic innervation and thus not painful.
-They are further classified as:
1st degree, Do not prolapse only bleeding announces their presence
2nd degree -Spontaneously reducing prolapse at defecation
$3^{\text {rd }}$ degree, prolapse requiring manual replacement;
$4^{\text {th }}$ degree, permanent prolapse.

\section*{External hemorrhoids}
-Are found below the dentate line and lined by squamous epithelium .
-Are innervated by cutaneous nerves that supply the perianal area. These nerves include the pudendal nerve and sacral plexus. Thus are very painful.

\section*{Etiology-not clearly known but risk factors}
1. Pregnancy
2. Colon malignancy
3. Liver disease-Portal hypertension
4. Constipation
5. low-fiber diets cause small-caliber stools, which result in straining with defecation
6. Occupations that require prolonged sitting
7. Loss of muscle tone in old age
8. rectal surgery, episiotomy, anal intercourse
9. Obesity

\section*{Pathopysiology}
-Hemorrhoids generally cause symptoms when they become enlarged, inflamed, thrombosed, or prolapsed
-Abnormal hemorrhoidal tissue development is related to chronic straining that leads to engorgement, vascular dilatation due to decreased venous return.
-This leads to stretching of the supporting connective tissue. The most common cause of prolonged straining is the act of defecation.
-Aging causes weakening of the support structures, which facilitates prolapse. Weakening of support structures can occur as early as the third decade of life.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:}
1. Constipation
2. Straining with defecation
3. Episodic bleeding on stool
4. Feeling of incomplete evacuation
5. Pruritus
6. Severe acute pain may be due to thrombosis of the veins but hemmorhoids are classically painless.
7. Ulceration

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES:}
- Ano-rectal examination including anoscopy
- Sigmoidoscopy
- Inspection following straining at stool

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
1.carcinoma of the colon and rectum, diverticular disease, 2.adenomatous polyps
3.ulcerative colitis
4. Rectal prolapse (procidentia

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-This is only done when the hemorrhoids become symptomatic.
-The goal of treatment is not to obliterate hemorrhoidal plexuses but rather to render the patient asymptomatic.

\section*{A.Medical Treatment:}

Most patients with early hemorrhoids (first- and second-degree) can be managed by simple local measures and dietary advice. Decreasing straining and constipation shrinks internal hemorrhoids and decreases their symptoms; therefore, first-line treatment for all first- and second-degree (and many third- and fourth-degree) internal hemorrhoids should include measures to decrease straining and constipation.
1. Avoid constipation-The diet should be high in fiber (vegetables, fruits), and increased water intake must be stressed. Unrefined bran can be used to augment dietary bulk.
2.Avoid straining-no prolonged stay in the toilet seat
2.Stool softeners may be used-lactulose
3. Rectal suppositories and astringents-local anaesthetics+steroids sometimes antibiotics Topical hydrocortisone can sometimes ease internal hemorrhoidal bleeding.
4. Warm sitz baths may also offer symptomatic relief.

Done 3times a day for 30 minutes each time on just warm watertasted first
5.Sclerotherapy-Injection treatment, a form of sclerotherapy, consists of injecting an irritating chemical solution (eg, 5\% phenol in vegetable oil) submucosally into the loose areolar tissue above the internal hemorrhoid
6.Cryosurgery: Hemorrhoids can be necrosed by freezing with a cryoprobe, using $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
7. Strangulation -Rubber Band Ligation: For enlarged or prolapsing hemorrhoids, band ligation is excellent treatment. With the aid of an anoscope, the redundant mucosa above the hemorrhoid is grasped with forceps and advanced through the barrel of a special ligator. Ischemic necrosis occurs over several days, with eventual slough, fibrosis, and fixation of the tissues. major complication of this technique is pain severe enough to require removal of the band

\section*{Others}
- Infrared photocoagulation
-Laser ablation
-Lord dilatation

\section*{Surgical therapy:}

Operative resection is reserved for patients with
1. grade III and grade IV hemorrhoids
2. Fail non operative therapy
3. Significant symptoms from external hemorrhoids or skin tags
-External hemorrhoids generally elicit symptoms due to acute thrombosis, recurrent thromboses, or hygiene problems.
-Manage acute thromboses and recurrent thromboses in a similar fashion.
-Identify the offending vascular cluster inject local anesthetic, then perform excision of the overlying skin and underlying veins.
- Enucleation of the thrombosis alone can result in recurrence of the hemorrhoid at the same spot in the future. Excision of the underlying vein completely prevents this . Electrocoagulation or topical astringent (Monsel solution) provides hemostasis.
-Suturing the wound closed is not necessary and may cause more pain.
Stapled hemorrhoid surgery, or procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH), a specially designed circular stapler with smaller staples is used.
The technique involves placing a suture in the mucosa and submucosal layers circumferentially approximately $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the dentate line. The stapler is placed and slowly closed around the purse string. Care is taken to draw excess hemorrhoid tissue into the stapler. The stapler is fired, resecting the excess tissue and placing a circular staple line above the dentate line. This results in resection of excessive internal hemorrhoidal tissue, pexy of the internal hemorrhoidal tissue left behind and interruption of the blood supply from above

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}
1. Stenosis
2. Haemorrhage
3. Infection-perianal abscesses
4. Recurrence
5. Non healing wounds
6. fistula formation
7. Urinary retention is directly related to the anesthetic technique used and to the peri operative fluids administered

\section*{Summary of Management 6 S}
1.Stool softeners and diet modification- diet rich in roughage as fruits and vegetables plus a lot of water
2.Suppositories and astrigents
3.Sitz baths
4.Sclerotherapy
5.Strangulation-band
6.Surgery

\section*{HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE}

\section*{(aganglionic megacolon)}

\section*{Definition}

Presence of large, non-functional distal intestine usually the rectum with variable involvement of the colon and small gut

\section*{Sites}
-Only the terminal rectum occurs in about $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ of cases
-Extension to the sigmoid colon in $\mathbf{6 5 \%}$
-More proximal colon in 10\%
-Entire colon with small bowel involvement in 10-15\%

\section*{Race}

More common in Caucasians, then blacks. Least common among the Asians Whites >Blacks

\section*{Sex}
-Males are affected X5 more frequently than females in cases in which the diseased segment is of the usual length.
-Up to $70-80 \%$ of the involved patients are male.
-Females tend to have longer aganglionic segments.
A familial association occurs in 5-10\% of cases--more frequently when females are affected.

\section*{Incidence}

KNH-12 cases per year 0r 1: 4500

\section*{Etiology}

Can be broadly classified as Sporadic-up to $\mathbf{8 0 - 9 0 \%}$ of cases or Familial 15-17\%.

\section*{Familial cases:}
-Maternal transmission more common than paternal transmission. If both parents are involved risk of $12.5 \%$ of the offspring getting affected. In familial cases 20\% have associated congenital anomaly compared to $10 \%$ in sporadic case.
-Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance is responsible for the long segment familial disease. Autosomal recessive in short segment disease.
3 genes have been identified
i)RET gene in chromosome 10-Autosomal dominant inheritance
ii)Endothelial Receptor B gene in chromosome 13-autosomal Recessive
iii)Endothelial 3 gene chromosome 20-Autosomal recessive

\section*{Pathophysiology}

\section*{Exact cause unknown - 2 theories}
1. Due to failure in the cephalo-caudal migration of the neuro crest cells into the distal bowel.
-Therefore, the absence of ganglion cells always begins at the anus and extends a varying distance proximally.
-The aganglionic bowel produces a functional obstruction, because the bowel does not have normal propulsive waves and contracts en masse in response to distention.
2.Hostile microenviroment in the colon that damages already present neuroblasts.It is thought that the abnormality in chromosome causes the hostile enviroment

\section*{Other associations}
-Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome);
-Genitourinary abnormalities.
-Neural crest abnormalities, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (Ondine's curse)
- Waardenburg's syndrome
-Anorectal malformations
-The histological hallmark of Hirschsprung's disease is Aganglinosis in the submucosal plexus of Meissner and in the intermyenteric plexus of Auerbach.
-The nerves affected are the non-cholinergic non adrenergic ie NO ,VIP and NADPH tramsmitters
-This leads to unopposed autonomic nervous system functioning which causes;
1-Reduced or absent peristaltic(propulsive) activity
2-Increased intestinal sphincter tone
The pathological hallmark is
1.There is marked distension \& hypertrophy of gut proximal to the aganglionic segment
2.There is funnelling (coning) of the gut between the two transition zone
3.Constricted or collapsed gut at \& distal to the aganglionic portion

\section*{Spectrum of the disease}
1. Complete absence.
2. Hypoganglionosis.
3. Abnormal ganglion cells ( hirshprung like disease).
4.Also Intestinal neuronal dysplasia
.Acquired hirshsprungs disease
-Vascular causes e.g. Post-op $2^{\circ}$ to Pull-through operation, with damage to the mesenteric vessels
-Non-vascular e.g. TB, Diabetes
-Abnormal connective tissue and smooth muscle
DDX
1.Anatomic Anorectal malformation
2.Metabolic

DM mothers-electrolyte imbalances
Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism
3.Drugs-Heavy sedation eg in eclampsia of mother
4.Meconium plug/ileus
5.Sepsis
6.Immaturity

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{Symptoms}
-Vary widely in severity but almost always occur shortly after birth.
-The time of presentation depends on amount of intestine involved as long segment -present early.
1-Delayed passage of meconium
2-Chronic or intermittent constipation with diarrhea
3-.Passage of flatus and stool requires great effort, and the stools are small in caliber.
4-Progressive abdominal distention
5-Vomiting and Reluctance to feed/anorexia
6-Listlessness, irritability,
7-Poor growth and development These children are sluggish, with wasted extremities and flared costal margins
NB . Some pts present with acute enterocolitis or toxic megacolon with gross abdominal distension,vomiting, shock,septic and febrile

\section*{Signs}
-Small for age infant, irritable ,dehydrated,

\section*{P/A}

Impacted stools in the greatly dilated and distended sigmoid colon can be palpated across the lower abdomen Abdominal distension-increased bowel movts

\section*{DRE}
-Normal anal tone.
-Rectum collapsed ,tight and empty(no feccal matter).
-Rectal examination in the infant may be followed by expulsion of stool and flatus, with remarkable decompression of abdominal distention passage of foul-smelling diarrhea

\section*{INVETIGATIONS}

\section*{Imaging}

\section*{1.Plain abdominal x-rays}
-In infants show dilated loops of bowel, but it is difficult to distinguish small and large bowel in infancy.
-Air fluid levels
-Absence of air in the rectum

\section*{2.Barium enema}
-Should be done at least 48 hrs after birth.
-The aganglionic segment appears relatively narrow compared to the dilated proximal bowel.
-The proximal intestine can be dilated by impacted stool or enema, giving a false impression of the level of the normal colon.
-The contrast is left and another x-ray taken after 24hours and failure to evacuate the contrast is very suggestive of the disease.

\section*{3. Manometric studies}
-Normal resting pressure of the rectum taken before inflation of the balloon and its shown to be elevated.
-It also reveals abnormal irregularly, irregular contractions.
- Rectal distention by a balloon inflation, a failure of relaxation of the internal sphincter.

\section*{Biopsy}

Definitive diagnosis is made by rectal biopsy 2 methods
1. Mucosal biopsies may be taken from the posterior rectal wall with a suction biopsy capsule without anesthesia.

\section*{Features:}
-Aganglionic segment
-Nerve trunk hyperplasia
-Increased acetyl cholinesterase level
-Immunohistochemistry

\section*{2.Full thickness biopsy}

If equivocal, it is necessary to remove a $1-\mathrm{x} 2-\mathrm{cm}$ full-thickness strip of mucosa and muscularis from the posterior rectum proximal to the dentate line under general anesthesia or at laparatomy.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Supportive}
1.Manage fluid
2.Electrolyte imbalances
2. Insert a soft rectal tube \& give patient soft enemas $\mathbf{- 5 m l} \boldsymbol{/} \mathbf{k g}$ warm Normal Saline(NOT SOAP) \& irrigate GIT until patient settles
3..Antiotics- if fever and perionism

\section*{Definitive management}

\section*{Principles}
a)Decompression and improve nutrition
b)Establish extent of disease
c)Definitive surgery

\section*{Temporary colostomy and serial biopsy}
-Laparatomy and serial biopsy on the rectum and colon with aim of determining extent of disease.
-A colostomy is fashioned at the transitional zone to continue the decompression and allow the patient to gain weight before definitive surgery.
-The points of biopsy are marked with non-absorbable sutures. Function of the colostomy
-To decompress normal gut to allow normal growth \& development until when definitive management can be instituted.
-Reduce - NOT eliminate risk of enterocolitis

\section*{Definitive Surgery}

\section*{Principles}
1.Resection of aganglionic segment
2.Anastomosis of proximal to the distal segment

\section*{Modes of surgery}

\section*{1. Swenson Operation:}

In the Swenson procedure, the overly dilated and aganglionic colon and rectum are excised to within 2 cm above the dentate line.
-The transected end of the normally ganglionated bowel is sutured end-to- end with the distal anorectal segment.

\section*{2. Duhamel:}

Operation the rectum is oversewn, and the proximal bowel is brought between the sacrum and the rectum and sutured end-toside to the rectum above the dentate line. The intervening spur of rectum and bowel is divided, and a side-to-side anastomosis is made with a stapler
There is risk of faecaloma forming in the aganglionated rectal cuff - Lester-Martin modification takes care of this complication

\section*{3. Soave Operation:}

The Soave operation consists of dissecting between the mucosa and the muscularis layer, pulling the proximal bowel through out of the residual rectal stump and suturing it to the rectum just 2 cm above the dentate line.

\section*{4.Lynn Operation:}

Rectal myectomy is used for distal rectal (short-segment) aganglionosis

\section*{5. Total colonic aganglionosis - Martin's procedure;}

Some colon is left for absorption of water \& storage of faeces. Ileum is anastomosed at the dentate line \& a side to side anastomosis of ileum to remaining colon. The ileum will provide peristalsis.

\section*{Approaches}
1.Open Laparatomy
2.Laparascopy
3.Transanal

\section*{Age at Surgery}

Depends on the age at which the diagnosis is confirmed -tissue) and the availability of care.

\section*{HYDROCEPHALUS}

\section*{Definition}
-Hydrocephalus is the abnormal rise in cerebrospinal fluid volume with ventricular dilatation due to imbalance of cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption.
It is usually accompanied by increased intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is a diverse group of conditions, which result from;
1)Impaired circulation of CSF
2)Impaired absorption of CSF
3)In the rare circumstance, from increased production by a choroid plexus papilloma
The most common causes of hydrocephalus in acquired cases are tumor obstruction, trauma, intracranial hemorrhage, and infection.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

\section*{Flow of CSF}

CSF is produced in the lateral ventricle choroid plexus at
$30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ ( $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{hr}$ in infants)
Foramen of Monro ↓

\section*{3rd Ventricle}

Cerebral aqueduct of sylvius ↓

\section*{4th Ventricle}

\section*{Foramen of Lushka(2-leteral) ↓ magendie foramen}

Subarachnoid basal cisterns posteriorly over the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, and anteriorly through the cistern system and over the convexities of the cerebral hemispheres.
arachnoid granulations ↓
superior sagittal sinus
↓
Venous circulation
NB. Main CSF production is from the lateral ventricles ,some from the $4^{\text {th }}$ ventricle. $25 \%$ CSF is produced from the ependymal lining of the ventricles.
Infants-volume of CSF 50 mls
Adults - volume of CSF 125-150mls. Daily production of CSF $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ up to $720 \mathrm{ml} /$ day

\section*{TYPES OF HYDROCEPHALUS}
a) Obstructive / Non-communicating hydrocephalus

Hydrocephalus resulting from obstruction within the ventricular system .Proximal dilatation from obstruction.
1.An abnormality of the Aqueduct:

Stenosis; Congenital - inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait ,Acquired in Neurofibromatosis
Gliosis; Intrauterine viral infections, SAH in a premature infant, Neonatal meningitis,Mumps meningoencephalitis
2.Lesions in the fourth ventricle:

\section*{Chiari malformation}

Type II is characterized by progressive hydrocephalus and a myelomeningocele which results in elongation of the fourth ventricle and kinking of the brain stem, with displacement of the inferior vermis, pons, and medulla into the cervical canal.
Produce symptoms during infancy consisting of stridor, weak cry, and apnea, which may be relieved by shunting or by posterior fossa decompression.

Type I produces symptoms during adolescence or adult life and is usually not associated with hydrocephalus.
These patients complain of recurrent headache, neck pain, urinary frequency, and progressive lower extremity spasticity. The deformity consists of tonsilar herniation.
Dandy-Walker syndrome
Consists of a cystic expansion of the fourth ventricle in the posterior fossa, which results from a developmental failure of the roof of the 4th ventricle during embryogenesis.
Posterior fossa brain tumors- Meduloblastomas, hemangiomas, epindymomas.
3. Space occupying lesions may obstruct the flow along anyway along the ventricular system-Tumors, bleeds etc

\section*{b) Non-obstructive / Communicating hydrocephalus -}

Hydrocephalus resulting from obliteration of the subarachnoid cisterns or malfunction of the arachnoid granulations.
1.Infections;
-Intrauterine infections may destroy the CSF pathways. ---Pneumococcal and TB meningitis have a propensity to produce a thick, tenacious exudate that obstructs the basal cisterns 2.SAH

Blood in the subarachnoid spaces may cause obliteration of the cisterns or arachnoid villi, and obstruction of CSF flow.
3.Leukemic infiltrates
may seed the subarachnoid space and produce communicating hydrocephalus
4. Superior saggital sinus thrombosis

This impairs venous drainage and impairs re-absorption through the arachnoid villi.
5. Overproduction of CSF-choroid plexus papilloma
c) Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus

Cerebral ventricular dilation with normal lumbar CSF pressure $(5-18 \mathrm{cmH} 2 \mathrm{O})$
Aetiology - Same as Non-Obstructive or communicating hydrocephalus above
Presentation- Triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus.
-Dementia - rare cause of dementia in the elderly
- Apraxia of gait - initiation of gait is hesitant - described as a
"slipping clutch" or "feet stuck to the floor" gait - and walking eventually occurs. Motor weakness and staggering are absent
-Urinary incontinence

\section*{Investigations}

CSF pressure is normal
CT/MRI - the ventricles are dilated
Mx;
Shunting - Brief improvement after removing about 50 mL of CSF indicates a better prognosis with shunting but the longer the disease has been present, the less likely shunting will be curative

\section*{d)Ex Vacuo Hydrocephalus}

Enlarged ventricles resulting from a loss of brain tissue

\section*{Other terms}
-Arrested hydrocephalus-the ventricles dilated but the pressures not increasing. Seen more in children
-Occult hydrocephalus-dilated ventricles but no signs of raised ICP or suggestive of hydrocephalus.
Composition of CSF-Clear fluid, $15-45 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of protein
$-60-80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ of glucose, 3 lymphocytes or fewer

\section*{Presenting complaints}

Infants; sutures still open

\section*{History}
1.Accelerated rate of enlargement of the head is the most prominent sign
2.Irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, and vomiting
3.Delayed milestones

4-Failure to thrive
5.Family history
6.Premature delivery
7.Previous history of treatment for meningitis
8.Maternal infections and drug intake in prenatal period.

\section*{Physical examination}
1. Enlarged head for the age. At birth head circumference is $35 \mathrm{~cm}+/-2 \mathrm{~cm}$.this increases by:
- 2 cm per month for first 3 months
- 1 cm per month next 3 months
- $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~cm}$ per month for next 6 months
- $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{~cm}$ per month from 1 year to 3 years old.

The occipitofrontal head circumference is recorded and kept for monitoring the head progression.
2-Scalp veins are dilated and congested
3-The forehead is broad
4-Anterior fontanel is wide open and bulging
5-Percussion of the skull may produce a "cracked-pot" or Macewen sign, indicating separation of the sutures 6-Craniotabes
7-A foreshortened occiput suggests the Chiari malformation, and a prominent occiput suggests the Dandy-Walker malformation.
8-Dilatation of the 3rd ventricle → dilatation of the suprapineal recess which then impinges on the tectum → eyes deviate downward - "setting-sun" eye sign.
Also lid lag
9.Long tract signs-due to stretching and compression of corticospinal tract eg brisk tendon reflexes, spasticity, clonus in lower extremities, babinski reflex up going
10. Transillumination of the skull is positive with massive dilatation of the ventricular system or in the Dandy-Walker syndrome.
11.Fundoscopy-Papilloedema is observed in older children but is rarely present in infants because the cranial sutures separate as a result of the increased pressure
-In the older child, the cranial sutures are partially closed so that the signs of hydrocephalus may be more subtle. The signs of increased ICP become more prominent.

\section*{DDx}

The head may appear enlarged secondary to a thickened cranium resulting from;
1) Familial-autosomal dominant
2) Chronic anemia eg Haemoglobinopathies, SCD, Thalassaemia
3) Rickets
4) Achondroplasia
5) Osteogenesis imperfecta
6) Epiphyseal dysplasia
7) Neurofibromatosis
8) Storage diseases-Gaucher's disease, Tay sachs disease.

\section*{Investigations in infants}
1.Skull X-ray - Not very revealing but may show
-Separation of the sutures
-Erosion of the posterior clinoids in the older child
-Increase in convolutional markings ("beaten-silver appearance") with longstanding increased intracranial pressure.
-Flattening of gyri and obliteration of sulci
-Herniations-tentorial and through foramen magnum
2.Ultrasonography

Through the open anterior fontanele.

\section*{3.CT-scan}

Show ventricular dilatation
4.MRI

\section*{Adults}

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Mainly signs of increased intracranial pressure.
Signs /Symptoms of increased ICP
Symptoms
6) -Severe bursting headache
7) -Projectile vomiting
8) -Blurring of vision
9) -Convulsions/seizures
10)-Drowsiness and altered consciousness.

Signs
7) -Vital signs-increased BP and decreased pulse rate (cushings reflex)
8) -Anisocoria-unequal pupils
9) -Papiloedema on fundoscopy
10) -Nerve palsy eg $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $6^{\text {th }}$ cranial nerves
11) -Irregular breathing/slowed fats

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Aims}
1. Reduce the intracranial pressure-Medical treatment or CSF diversion
2.Remove the underlying cause-Definitive surgery

\section*{Medical treatment}

When patients have slowly progressive hydrocephalus with few symptoms or signs, and when the condition of the patient has prohibited surgery.
-Medical therapy usually is a temporizing measure. In transient conditions, such as sinus occlusion, meningitis, or neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, medical therapy can be effective. Acetazolamide ( $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in 3 doses): Careful monitoring of respiratory status and electrolytes is crucial. Treatment beyond 6 months is not recommended. Furosemide ( $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$ in 3 doses): Again, electrolyte balance and fluid balance need to be monitored carefully. Lumbar punctures: In neonates recovering from intraventricular hemorrhage, serial lumbar punctures can resolve hydrocephalus in some cases. If possible, this is the preferred method of treatment.
Removal of the underlying cause resolves hydrocephalus in most cases

\section*{SURGERY}

\section*{CSF DIVERSION}

\section*{Short-term}
-Acute intraventricular bleeds, subarachnoid bleeds, infections. There is high protein concentration in the CSF which would cause coagulum and block the valve.
-Do external ventricular drains until blood is cleared from the CSF. And the infection has settled.
-Exteriorization of the shunt can also be used for the administration of antibodies.

\section*{Permanent CSF diversion}
1.Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
2.Ventriculo-artrial Shunt
3.Ventriculopleaural shunt

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
A shunt is placed from the lateral ventricle to the peritoneum Procedure
-Standard pre-operative preparation
-Patient in supine position
-Clean and drape the right parietal, neck, chest and abdomen.
Right side of the head to be away from the speech areas-Brocas and Wernickes left in most people.
-Do right parietal burr hole
-Right subcostal minilaparatomy
-Subcuticular tunneling
-Insertion of the shunt system.
-Cannulation of lateral ventricle and confirm that the shunt is functioning
-Standard wound closure.

\section*{Complications;}

1-Bacterial infection, usually due to Staphylococcus epidermidis
2-Shunt blockade-mechanical kinks, choroid plexus block, omentum
3-Shunt disconnection-from the drainage of the lateral ventricle.
4-Shunt migration-can migrate downward the peritoneum
5-Subdural bleed due to rapid decompression seen with patients who have had sutural closure.

\section*{DEFINITIVE SURGERY}
-Operation for tumors
-Appropriate craniotomy dependent on the location of the tumor.

\section*{Prognosis}
-Depend on the cause of the dilated ventricles and not on the size of the cortical mantle at the time of the shunting.
- Increased risk of developmental problems
- Mean intelligence quotient is reduced compared to general population
- Risk of aggressive and delinquent behaviour
- Accelerated pubertal development in patients with shunted hydrocepahalus or meningomyelocele due to increased gonadotropins due to increased ICP

\section*{INTESTINAL FISTULA}

\section*{Definition}

A fistula is an abnormal tract between two or more epithelial lined surfaces. Tract is line by granulation or epithelial tissue It may involve a communication tract from one body cavity or hollow organ to another hollow organ or to the skin Enterocutaneous fistula is an .abnormal communication between bowel and skin

\section*{Classification}

There are several ways to classify fistulae and these are useful in selecting measures for management and for comparison of therapeutic approaches.
1. Descriptive includes the sites of origin and termination: e $g$ jejunocutaneous, ileovesical fistulas

\section*{2.Anatomical Classification}

Modified Sitges-Serra classification
Type 1 fistula are esophageal, gastric, and duodenal fistulae
Type II fistula Involve small bowel
Type III fistula Involve large bowel and
Type IV fistula where all the above drains through a large abdominal wall defect.

\section*{2. Internal versus external}

Internal fistulae include ileocolic or ileoileo fistulae.
Rarely follow a surgical procedure; usually result from local perforation of diseased bowel. An abscess forms that affects an adjacent structure.
External fistulae include duodenocutaneous or ileovaginal.

\section*{3.Physiologcal classification}

Quantifies fistula output over a 24 -hour period
-Low volume fistula $<200 \mathrm{ml} / 24$-hour
-Moderate volume 200 and $500 \mathrm{ml} / 24$ hours
-High volume $>500 \mathrm{ml} / 24$ hours.

\section*{4.Etiological}

Spontaneous Fistula-arises without prior surgery.
Iatrogenic-post surgical are the most common causes. Also post radiation enteritis.
5.Characteristics of the tract (simple or complex)

Simple fistulas-Single, short, direct tract, no abscess associated. Complex-multiple tracts. Several types
Type 1-abscess or multiple organ involvement
Type 2 -distal end within the base of a disrupted wound
6. End fistula, which encompasses the entire diameter of the bowel, and lateral fistula, which arises from one side only.

\section*{Etiology}

\section*{Iatrogenic fistulas}

Fistulas are either iatrogenic or spontaneous in development Iatrogenic..... Surgical misadventure' or 'post operative' is the commonest cause.
Fistulas may develop immediately or years later in conjunction with other processes such as diabetes mellitus, pelvic
inflammatory disease, pelvic surgery, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
Surgical complications that may may cause fistulas include:
1. Unintentional enterotomy
2. Anastomotic breakdown ( $85 \%-90 \%$ ) as a result of:
- Foreign body close to the suture line,
- Tension on the suture line
- Complicated suture techniques
- Distal obstruction
- Hematoma, abscess formation at the anastomotic site
- Sepsis
- Tumor
3. Emergent/urgent surgical procedures involving
- Un prepared bowel,
- under resuscitation,
- malnourishment
- or previously radiated tissue

\section*{Spontaneous $\mathbf{1 0 \% - 1 5 \%}$}
1. Intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease,malignancy
2. Infectious processes, as in tuberculosis, diverticulitis,
3. Vascular insufficiency, mesenteric ischemia.
4. Radiation exposure

\section*{Effect of fistula}

Loss of enteric contents is attended to by 1.Nutritional deficits due to nutrient loss/ lack of absorptive exposure
2.Loss of fluid, electrolyte and acid base imbalance
3.Contents contaminate sterile cavities like peritoneum with sepsis with its attendant metabolic and immunologic consequences

\section*{Some effects of Sepsis}
-Worsens the hypovolemic state
-Increases the metabolic demand worsens the nutritional state.
-Toxemia and circulatory disturbance can lead to Multiple Organ Failure Syndrome.
-In presence of sepsis spontaneous closure cannot occur Sepsis is mainifested by pyrexia, leucocytosis, tachycardia and hypoalbuminemia.
Cachexia may be the only manifestation

\section*{Fluid Type/ Origin Of Fistula}
-Watery .........Gastric
-Bile .............Gastric, biliary, duodenum
-Yellow/orange..Small bowel
-Colourless......Pancreas
-Brown fecal.... Large bowel

\section*{Presentation.}
1. Fever and sepsis.
2. Abdominal pain.
3. Localized abdominal tenderness.
4. External drainage of small bowel contents.
5.Severely excoriate the skin and abdominal wall tissues
6.Dehydration and malnutrition-loss of fluids and nutrients

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

The goal is to achieve permanent closure of the fistula in the shortest time and with the lowest possible risk to the patient. This achieved either surgically or by conservative management

Meticulous skin care is also provided around the fistula using skin protective creams eg zinc oxide, Aluminium paste, karaya powder.
These can be categorized into phase Four phases:
A. Stabilization,
B. Investigations
C. Conservative treatment

D Surgery

\section*{A.STABILIZATION}
1.Fluid and electrolyte replacement
2.Adequate nutrition
3.Perifistular skin protection
4.Infection control
5.Measures to reduce fistula output

\section*{1. Rehydration and electrolyte replenishment}
-Many fistula patients are profoundly depleted of intravascular and interstitial volume.
-The gastrointestinal tract secretes 5-9L of fluids with sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate daily.
-Loss of these essential electrolytes and fluid volume threatens the overall circulatory system.
-Hypovolemia, inadequate tissue perfusion, renal failure and circulatory collapse can occur in the presence of a high output fistula.
-Thus replacement of these fluids with isotonic saline solution takes first priority.
Monitoring of fluid resuscitation
- Central venous pressure
- Urine production per hour-at least $30-50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$
- Input/output chart -Fluid should be collected from fistula output, nasogastric suction, and urine for measurement of volume output versus the input of fluid
- Skin turgor.
- Pulse
-Blood collected for electrolytes and BGA.
Results of these studies assist in correcting electrolyte deficits and deranged acid-base balance.
Body weight is recorded daily. Fluid and electrolyte resuscitation can usually be accomplished within the first day or two. -Subsequent maintenance of homeostasis depends on accurately measuring losses and replacing them

\section*{2.Nutritional assessment and supplementation}

Good nutrition is needed for:
- Closure of the fistula
- Reduce chances of infection
- Appropriate mode of nutrition to allow gut to rest. Route of nutritional support either oral, enteral or parenteral nutrition dependent
- upon patient tolerance
- ability to ingest sufficient quantities
- the fistula tract location
- the bowel mucosa absorptive capacity

Oral route of nutrition is reasonable for patients with colonic fistulas.
Patients with esophageal and distal ileum fistulas could be supported via the enteral route
Ultimately, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is the route of choice for those with high output proximal small bowel fistulas. Central
parenteral hyperalimentation will allow the intestinal tract to be placed completely at rest.

\section*{3. Measures to protect the Perifistular skin from excoriation}

Fistula drainage fluid must be collected to avoid excoriation of skin and abdominal wall tissues and to record volume losses. Stomahesive appliances eg Ileostomy bag is placed on the opening to protect skin, allow for evaluation of spontaneous closure and monitoring the daily output.

\section*{4.Infection control}

Local and systemic sepsis treated with appropriate drainage and antibiotics guided by appropriate microbiological investigations Abscesses should be drained as soon as they are diagnosed.. Drainage is accomplished, and the fistula may close as the sump tube is gradually withdrawn over a period of weeks.

\section*{5.Meaures to decrease fistula output}

This simplifies management and increases the rate of spontaneous closure.
The initial measure is the placement of a nasogastric tube or if long-term use may be indicated a gastrostomy tube. Sometimes this can be placed at the time of another operative procedure.
'Nothing by mouth' regimen minimizes intestinal output as this decreases content within the intestinal lumen, reduce intestinal stimulation and pancreaticobiliary secretions.
Pharmacological methods includes:
-H2 antagonists/PPIs to prevent stress ulcers and to decrease gastric secretions
-Somatostatin to inhibit stomach, pancreas, biliary tract and small intestinal secretions

\section*{B.INVESTIGATIONS}

\section*{Lab investigation}
1.FHG-WBC rise with neutrophilia
2.Electrolytes-imbalnces hypokalemia, hyponatremia
3.LFT-sepsis may cause acute enzyme rise of liver injury
4.U/C -may show deranged kidney function due to sepsis

\section*{Imaging}

\section*{Fistulogram}

Assess the anatomical features of the fistula by radiography Maturation of the fistula track occurs postoperatively after 7-10 days. Then water-soluble iodinated media dye can be introduced for fistulogram
Fistulogram determines:
1) Origin of the fistula
2) Length of the tract
3) Continuity the bowel
4) Other manifestations such as an abscess or distal obstruction.
Combination with barium studies can accurately establish the site of the fistula in case of difficulty.
Orally administered barium will usually give the most information, including information about the size of the leak, the absence of distal obstruction and the presence of a tumour, or extent of inflammatory changes in the intestine itself

\section*{Ultrasonography and CT-Scan}

US and CT scan of the abdomen useful in detecting intra abdominal abscesses and US guided aspiration of the abscess

Hydrogen peroxide enhanced US-fistulography could be considered
Scintigraphy (Indium 111-WBC Scintigraphy) is useful in chronic disease such as Crohns disease .... distinguish fibrosis or scarring from active disease.

\section*{C.CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT}

This involes the five aspects of stabilization which are continued.
Once stable, continuous close monitoring of
✓ Fluid and electrolyte status
✓ The nutritional status and feeding
✓ Continued protection of skin around fistula
✓ Control of any infections to enhance spotenous closure of fistula tract
✓ Measures to decrease output from fistula with close monitoring of output from the fistula Control of fistula by percutaneous intubation of tract may be done

\section*{D. SURGERY}

Indications of surgery include the following
1.Dehiscence of a suture line
2.Presence of distal intestinal obstruction.
3.Presence of foreign body
4.Epitheliazation of the fistulas tract
5.Continuous high output even with measures to decrease output
6. Extensive disruption of intestinal continuity $>50 \%$
7.A short ( $<2 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) fistula tract
8.Increasing abdominal distension
9.Hemodynamic instability
10. Complex fistulas.
11.Underlying gut disease- Malignancy ,Irradiated Bowel, Inflammatory Bowel disease.
12. Flaring sepsis due to abscesses inadequately drained percutanously.
Sepsis, hemorrhage and evisceration call for immediate surgical intervention.

\section*{Surgical Intervention involves}

Exteriorization of the affected bowel ends followed by definitive surgery after 12 weeks i.e. after the intra abdominal septic process has been treated remains the mainstay of surgical treatment.
Muscle Flaps
If previous extensive resection, the use of muscle flaps may be helpful.
Muscle flaps provide well-vascularized coverage and help control fistula drainage when multiple fistulas occur in a large abdominal wall defect.
Flaps also useful in the presence of infection because they provide phagocytically active tissue.

\section*{Laparascopy}

Advances in instrumentation and accumulation of experience has allowed minimally invasive surgery to become an alternative to laparatomy in selected cases

\section*{INTESTINAL OSTRUCTION IN PEDRIATRICS}

\section*{Common Causes of intestinal obstruction}

\section*{A. Extramural causes}
1.Congenital hernia
2.Malrotation
3.Peritoneal bands or volvulus
4.Annular pancreas

\section*{B. Intra luminal causes}
1.Intestinal atresia or stenosis
2.Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
3.Meconium ileus
4.Meconium plug syndrome
5.Feccal impaction
6. Intussusceptions
7.Anorectal malformation .Also involve the wall defects

\section*{C. Mural causes/within wall}
1.Hirschsprung's disease
2. Neonatal small left colon syndrome.
3.Paralytic ileus-infections, electrolyte imbalances

\section*{Clinical presentation}

The cardinal signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction are
(1) Polyhydramnios in the mother-prenatal diagnosis
(2) Vomiting
(3) Abdominal distention
(4) Failure to pass meconium

1-Polyhydramnios is related to the level of obstruction and occurs in approximate $5 \%$ of women who have infants with duodenal atresia and 15\% of those who have infants with ileal atresia.

2-Vomiting occurs early in upper intestinal obstruction, and it is bile-stained if the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater. Lead to:
- Dehydration - most commonly in small bowel obstruction
- Signs of Shock - ↓urine output (Children- 0.5$1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg} / \mathrm{hr})$, ↑pulses, ↓ BP
- Hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis with Paradoxical aciduria
- Hypokalaemia-loss of electrolytes in vomiting.

3-Abdominal distention is related to the level of obstruction, being most marked for distal obstructions.

4-Failure to pass Meconium is passed in $30-50 \%$ of newborn infants with intestinal obstruction, but failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours is distinctly abnormal.

5-Constipation - initially stool may be reduced in quantity progressing to constipation
Absolute (Obstipation) - No faeces or flatus passes
Relative - Flatus but no faeces especially if obstruction is high

\section*{INTUSSUSCEPTION}

\section*{Definition}
-This occurs when one portion of the gut becomes invaginated within an immediately adjacent segment ie the proximal over the distal bowel.
-This telescoping of a segment of bowel (intussusceptum) into the adjacent segment (intussuscipiens) is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children under 2 years
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/661cbafb-685a-4cf0-95dc-0678025b16b1-13.jpg?height=327&width=656&top_left_y=612&top_left_x=1078)
-The process of intussusception may result in gangrene of the intussusceptum.

\section*{Types}
-The most common form is intussusception of terminal ileum into the right colon (ileocolic intussusception).
-Others include:
- Ileoileal
- Ileoileo-colic
- Jejunojejunal
- colocolic intussusceptions also occur

\section*{Age and Sex}
-The ratio of males to females is $\mathbf{3 : 1}$.
-The peak age is in infants 5-9 months of age; $80 \%$ of patients are under the age of 2 years

\section*{Aetiology}
-In 95\% of infants and children, no contributing factor.
-No fixation of cecum cause idiopathic intussusception.
-Seasonal following upper respiratory tract infection in the community

\section*{Predisposing factors/conditions;}
1. Hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum $2^{\circ}$ to weaning, URI e.g. adenovirus or rotavirus may be the initiating factor
2.Meckel's diverticulum - 2 ft proximal to the ileocaecal junction, $2^{\prime \prime}$ long, in $2 \%$ of 2 yr olds
3.Polyps
4.Duplication
5.Henoch-Scholein purpura
6.Appendicitis
7.Lyphedema
8.Post op intussusception-ENT,Non-GIT
-Post appendisectomy or anastomosis
-Post chemotherapy

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History
1.Intermittent Colicky abdominal pain
-An otherwise fit \& well male child of 6 months develops sudden onset of screaming associated with drawing up of the legs
-The attacks last for a few minutes recur every 15 minutes \& become progressively severe.
-During attacks the child has facial pallor while between episodes he is listless \& drawn
2.Reflex vomiting following pain -Becomes conspicuous with time
3.'Redcurrant jelly stool' due to exudation of mucus \& blood due to vascular compromise → Ischemia ± perforation → Tenderness on palpation
4. Lethargy,pallor and sweating are other symptoms.

\section*{Physical examination}
A. General:

Dehydration, pallor
B. Abdomen

1-Initially between episodes of pain, the abdomen is soft and non tender with Sausage shaped lump in the right upper quadrant or in the mid upper abdomen with concavity towards the umbilicus.
-Lump that hardens on palpation (lump in only $50-60 \%$ of case) 2-With time, the abdomen will become distended and tender and the examination more difficult
3-Feeling of emptiness in the Right Iliac Fossa (the sign of Dance)

\section*{DRE;}
1.Blood-stained mucus may be found on finger
2.Occasionally in extensive ileocolic or colocolic intussusception, the apex may be palpable or even protrude from the anus

\section*{DDX}

1-Adhesive band small bowel obstruction
2-Appendicitis
3-Gastroenteritis

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Imaging}
1. Abdominal radiograph should be examined for a soft-tissue mass displacing loops of bowel. The leading edge of the intussusceptum sometimes will be outlined with air, thus establishing the diagnosis.Evidence of bowel obstruction may be present. However, a normal abdominal radiograph does not exclude intussusception

\section*{2. Abdominal ultrasound}
-ring within a ring sign.
-Thickened bowel loop
-Pseudo kidney appearance
3.A contrast enema (preferably using air as the contrast agent) with fluoroscopic guidance is required to exclude intussusception in a patient with a suggestive history.(both diagnostic and therapeutic)
-Preparation for laparatomy is required before administering the enema because of the risk of perforation.
-Although barium and water-soluble contrast media have been used in the past, the air enema has proven to be more effective in reducing intussusceptions as is associated with fewer perforations.
-In few cases of perforation it causes less peritoneal cavity contamination.
-Radiologic reduction should be attempted unless the patient has evidence of peritoneal irritation, which is an absolute contraindication to hydrostatic reduction

\section*{Laboratory tests}
1. Electrolytes-hypokalemia, hypochloremia
2. CBC-leucocytosis in perforation
3. ABG -metabolic alkalosis
3.Urinalysis-paradoxic aciduria
4.Stool guaiac

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Supportive}
-Monitor vital signs
1. Replacement of IV fluids and Electrolytes
2.Adminstration of analgesia
3.Adminstration of prophylactic antibiotic in cases with signs of peritonism ...then 3 tubes....
4. NG tube for decompression
5. Urethral catheter to monitor input output.
5. Passage of flatus tube.
6. Obtain consent, do PCV, U/E and GXM if shows signs of peritonitis.

\section*{Non-operative management}
A. Hydrostatic or Pneumatic reduction
-This is done in early presentation with no signs of peritonism.
-Pneumatic is preferred to hydrostatic reduction as it causes less complication.
-Patient is under sedation but not put under anaesthesia to observe for complications.
-Air, Normal saline, Barium enema may be used under controlled pressure (should not be $>30 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or 100 ml of water) with fluoroscopic guidance.
-Air (the contrast) is pushed into the patient PR and the rectum blocked by balloon.
End point
-Pressure gives
-Reduction is confirmed by visualisation of contrast or air in the terminal ileum by x-ray

\section*{Contraindications}
1.Peritonism-absolute contraindication

Relative contraindications
2.Prolonged history $>24 \mathrm{hrs}$
3. Presence of complex intussusception
4. Mass palpable per rectum-extensive intussusceptum

Post operative
-Nill by mouth
-The recurrence rate after radiographic reduction is 3 to $5 \%$, and recurrences usually occur relatively soon after reduction within 24 hours.
-Patient kept in ward for this period for observation.(check pain, vomiting, abdominal distension)
-Confirm reduction by U/S before discharge

\section*{B.Surgery}
-Incisions Transverse-for good exposure
-Right iliac fossa commonest-Ileocolic ,ileoileal Indications
1.Duration> 24 hours
2.Evidenece of peritonitis
3.Presence of double or compound intussusception on U/S
4.Failure of radiologic reduction-Pneumatic or hydroststic
-Reduction is achieved by squeezing the most distal part of the mass in a cephalad direction slowly and patiently-NO PULLING! -The viability of the entire bowel should be checked carefully. -In the presence of an irreducible or gangrenous intussusception, the mass should be excised in situ \& an anastomosis if small gut. - However resection of terminal ileum would lead to megaloblastic anaemia-Vitamin B12 .also lead to bile stones due to reduction $n$ enterohepatic circulation of bile salts -Colonic gangrene or perforation-temporary end colostomy fashioned with anastomosis done later with colostomy closure.
-Fecal occult blood testing should be performed, and a positive result may suggest the possibility of a more proximal neoplasm.

\section*{Do a vaginal examination when appropriate}

\section*{Examine the chest}

\section*{Laboratory Tests}
1.FHG:A rising white blood cell count may herald the development of strangulation, but strangulation may be present in the absence of leukocytosis
2.Electrolyte
3.Urea and creatinine

\section*{Imaging}

Plain films of the abdomen (KUB) show dilated loops of bowel. Air fluid levels more than 3 in adults
Upright films of the abdomen or of the chest should be obtained also, to look for the free air under the diaphragm if a perforation has occurred

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Initial conservative management}
1.Nasogastric tube for decompression
2.Intravenous fluids for dehydration
3.Catheterize and monitor input and output
4.Visualization of foreign material
5.Prophylactic antibiotics.
6. Soapy enema may be used in partial distal obstruction.

Double contract barium enema has a role in intussseption reduction

Surgical management
Indication
1.Peritonism
2.Contiued deterioration of general condition of the patient

Closed bowel procedures: lysis of adhesions, reduction of intussusception, reduction of volvulus, reduction of incarcerated hernia
-Enterotomy for removal of bezoars, foreign bodies, gallstones
-Resection of bowel for obstructing lesions, strangulated bowel
-Bypasses of intestine around obstruction
-Enterocutaneous fistulae proximal to obstruction: colostomy, cecostomy

\section*{CHRONIC LEG ULCERS}

It is vital that any patient with leg ulceration has a full assessment. Lack of assessment can lead to long periods of inappropriate and potentially dangerous treatment.
For example, applying compression bandaging to a limb where the arterial blood supply is compromised may result in gangrene; withholding compression bandaging where there is venous insufficiency may result in failure to heal and/or rapid extension of the ulceration.

\section*{Etiology}

The most common cause of leg ulceration is tropical ulcers. Damaged to valves within the veins results in reflux of venous blood and consequent high pressures in the smaller vessels. This in turn leads to oedema and leakage of blood cells and fibrin into the tissues causing discolouration and hardening of the tissues (lipodermatosclerosis).
These tissues are then prone to injury and once injured slow to heal. However, there are other causes of ulceration and these should be excluded before treatment is begun.

\section*{Other causes}
1. Arterial insufficiency to the lower limb
2. Infections (tropical ulcers)
3. Blood disorders (sickle cell anaemia)
4. Neoplasms (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma
5. Trauma
6. Neuropathic (normally associated with diabetes and occurring on the feet)
7. Mixed arterial and venous insufficiency
8. Small vessel disease (associated with diabetes)
9. Vasculitis (associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune disorders such as lupus erythematosus)
10. Gross obesity
11. Hypertension
12. Lymphoedema
13. Factitious injury (rare)
14. Other rare conditions (scleroderma, pyoderma gangrenosum)

\section*{ASSESMENT OF LEG ULCERS}

\section*{History}

\section*{-Ulcer}
-Onset, location, number, discharge or bleeding, pain, pruritus, abnormal odour , skin changes around ulcers
-The ulcer healing or enlarging, recurrences and previous history of treatment
-History of trauma at the site
-Associated leg swelling
-Associated fever
-Associated weight loss, fatigue
-Associated chronic cough, past TB treatment or history of contact with person of chronic cough
-Associated loss of sensation on the limb
-History of yellowness of eyes, recurrent pains in limb or abdomen. Any other history suggestive of sickle cell disease.
-Associated groin swellings
-Hypertension and diabetis mellitus
-History of smoking
-Intake of any drugs

\section*{Past medical history}
-Vascular history including: history of DVT

\section*{Physical examination}

Examination of ulcers
- Site and number of wounds
- Size
- Shape
- Edges(undermined e.g. buruli ulcer, overhanging e.g. malignant ulcer, irregular or regular)
- Depth
- Floor-clean, necrotic tissue, granulation tissue, bleeds
- Base-palpated mobility, tenderness
- Exudates, discharges from the wound and odour
- Surrounding areas eczema, maceration, signs of scratching, blistering
-Leg examination
- Oedema
- prominent varicosities
- Skin discoloration
- skin condition colour and temperature
- examine calf-swelling and tender

Other examination
1.Report pulses-dorsalis pedis,popliteal and femoral pulses to rule out arterial insufficiency
Blood pressure measurement in both arms
2. Lymphadenopathy -inguinal to rule out malignant ulcers especially malignant melanoma.
- infectious causes
3.Sensory examination of the lower limb to rule out the neuropathic ulcers

\section*{Venous disease}
- usually shallow ulcers (situated on the gaiter area of the leg)
- oedema
- eczema
- ankle flare
- lipodermatosclerosis
- varicose veins
- hyperpigmentation
- atrophie blanche

\section*{Arterial disease-Pain,parlour,parasthesia,paralysis}
- ulcers with a 'punched out' appearance
- base of wound poorly perfused and pale
- cold legs/feet (in a warm environment)
- shiny, taut skin
- dependent rubor
- pale or blue feet
- gangrenous toes

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
1.FHG -Anemia, Infections, ,leukemia
2.Doppler measurement of ABPI (ankle brachial pressure index) in both feet (essential to rule out arterial disease).
3. Blood or urine screen for diabetes.
4.Swab ulcer for M/C and sensitivity

Additional blood investigations will depend on the patient's clinical history
Biopsy is indicated where areas of depigmentation and tissue proliferation raise the suspicion of malignant change
Radiology may be indicated to show bone changes, especially malignant erosion, pathological fracture, inflammatory changes, or dystrophic calcification.
Full assessment should be carried out when the patient first presents and should be repeated if the patient fails to respond to treatment. Foot pulses should be palpated and if not palpable, Doppler examination should be repeated at regular intervals (at least three monthly as long as compression therapy is being used). Doppler examination should also be repeated if there is a sudden increase in pain.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Treatment of uncomplicated chronic tropical ulcer comprises three main aspects;
1-control of infection
2-control of any factors hindering healing
3-provision of robust epithelial cover which will protect against further ulceration and malignant change.
-For control of infection patients require systemic treatment with antibiotics, chosen on the basis of laboratory determined sensitivities.
-Excision of indolent granulation tissue, areas of dense fibrosis, and severely scarred depigmented skin may be essential to achieve ultimate healing. Contractures and bone deformity will usually need to be corrected before the ulcer is covered. Bone infection must be controlled.
-Epithelial cover is usually achieved by applying a split-thickness skin graft to the granulating bed of the ulcer or after excision of the ulcer.
Management of underlying condition leading to ulceration.

\section*{Malignant Transformation}
-Rolled up edges, undermined edges, bleeding, irregular edges, rough floor with necrotic debris
The primary carcinoma
On presentation, most patients have large squamous cell carcinomas with bone attachment or invasion Despite advanced local disease, metastatic disease is not common and potentially curable primary lesions should be treated by surgery in otherwise well patients.Small localized lesions may be treated by wide excision and split-thickness skin grafting; however, most lesions require more extensive surgery.
Amputation has been the mainstay of treatment for large lesions showing extensive bone invasion. The associated morbidity is poorly

\section*{MALIGNANT MELANOMA}

\section*{Introduction}
-Melanoma is a tumor that develops as a result of the malignant transformation of melanocytes.
-Melanocytes cells are derived from the neural crest.
-Melanomas usually occur on the skin but can arise in other locations where neural crest cells migrate, such as in the gastrointestinal tract, eye or brain.
-Melanoma predominantly is an adult disease with a peak incidence in the $\mathbf{4}^{\text {th }}$ decade and no sex prevalence.
A patient's risk of developing a second primary melanoma after diagnosis of the first one is $\mathbf{3 - 5 \%}$.

\section*{Incidence}
-The incidence is estimated to be rising rapidly by almost $6 \%$ per year.

\section*{Morbidity and Mortality}
-Early diagnosis and treatment before metastasis most important in management.
While only $5 \%$ of skin cancers are melanomas, about two-thirds of all deaths from skin cancer are due to melanomas

\section*{Etiology/risk factors}

\section*{1.Family history}

Positive family history in $5-10 \%$ of patients With at least one affected relative, 2.2-fold higher risk

\section*{2.Personal characteristics}
-Blue eyes, fair and/or red hair, pale complexion
-Skin reaction to sunlight - Easily sunburned -Freckling
3.Benign and/or dysplastic melanocytic nevi - Number rather than size has better correlation
4.Immunosuppressive states - Transplant patients, hematologic malignancies

\section*{5.Sun exposure during adolescence}
- High UV-B radiation
- Low latitude
- Number of blistering sunburns
6.Atypical mole syndrome (formerly termed B-K mole syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma)

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Benign melanocytic nevi are markers of melanoma risk rather than direct precursors; however, dysplastic nevi are believed to degenerate over time into melanoma.
Lentigo maligna is believed to be a pre-invasive precursor of lentigo maligna melanoma, and at least $5 \%$ progress to malignancy

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Patients usually present with skin lesions that have changed in size, color, contour, or configuration. The acronym " ABCDE " is the hallmark of international public awareness campaigns and may be used to remember the physical characteristics suggestive of malignancy. ABCDE stands for
A-Asymmetry of shape
B-Border irregular

C-Color variations (especially red, white, and blue tones in a brown or black lesion) or deepening of pigmentation
D-Diameter greater than 6 mm (size), or recent increase in size
E-Elevated surface, erosions or ulcerations, bleeding ,crusting
Other symptoms of the lessions
- Itching, pain,ulcerate, Bleed, Develop satellites
- Location in areas of constant trauma or irritation ,lower limb or the back.

\section*{Pigmented Lesions}
-The appearance of a new pigmented nevus should arouse suspicion of melanoma.
-About one-third of all melanomas arise from pigmented nevi.
-Since the average white adult has 15-20 nevi, a clear idea of the indications for biopsy or excision should be developed.
Recognition and early excision of atypical pigmented lesions are potentially lifesaving, since surgery is the only effective treatment.

\section*{Benign /common naevi \\ Junctional nevi}
-Are usually small, circumscribed, light brown or black, flat or only slightly elevated, and rarely contain hair. They are found on all areas $f$ the body, and moles of the mucous membranes, genitalia, soles, and palms are usually of this type.
-The nevus cells are located in the epidermis and at the dermalepidermal junction.

\section*{Intradermal nevi}
-Range from small spots to extensive areas covering much of the body.
-Have variable shape and surface configuration, are usually brown or black, and often are slightly elevated.
-Nevus cells are confined to the dermis, and the lesions are basically benign.

Compound nevi have both junctional and intradermal elements.

\section*{Blue nevi}
-Are circumscribed, flat or dome-shaped, bluish-black lesions, usually on the hands, face, or arms.
-Although benign, they may closely resemble nodular melanoma and require diagnostic excisional biopsy.

\section*{Premalignant lesions}

\section*{Dysplastic nevi}

Are larger ( $5-12 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) than common nevi.
-They have macular and papular components, are variegated in color (tan-brown) on a pink base, and have indistinct, irregular edges.
-Unlike common nevi, dysplastic nevi are most prevalent on covered body areas, though they can appear anywhere. Any suspicious lesions should be excised. An accurate family history should be obtained in such cases, and first-degree relatives should be examined.

\section*{Congenital nevi}
-Occur in about $1 \%$ of newborns, and most lesions are small. -Along with dysplastic nevi, these lesions are now classified as precursors of melanoma.
