\section*{DIABETIC (NEUROPATHIC) ULCERS}

Ulceration is caused by several factors acting together, but particularly by neuropathathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in loss of the protective sensation of pain and in autonomic dysfunction, with sympathetic denervation, dry skin, and warm feet.
Other important component causes of ulceration include peripheral vascular disease,callus, edema, and deformity. The triad of neuropathy, deformity, and trauma is present in almost two thirds of patients with foot ulcers.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{History}

Information relating to ulcer history should be recorded in a structured format and may include
- year first ulcer occurred
- site of ulcer and of any previous ulcers
- number of previous episodes of ulceration
- time to healing in previous episodes
- time free of ulcers
- past treatment methods
(both successful and unsuccessful)
- previous operations on venous system
- previous and current use of compression
.Interrmittent claudication, varices, lack of sensation,pain Family hx of DM,HTN
Features of ischemic heart dz,retinopathy,nephropathy

\section*{Ulcer Assessment}

If the ulcer has been present for months and is asymptomatic and if foot pulses are palpable,neuropathy should be considered as a major cause.
However, given the variability of assessment of foot pulses, noninvasive assessment of the peripheral circulation is recommended if there is any suggestion of peripheral ischemia. Callus formation and a plantar site of ulceration also suggest neuropathy as a major contributory cause. A combination of lack of sensation, limited joint mobility, autonomic dysfunction resulting in dry skin, and repetitive high pressure may lead to callus formation.
The relative risk of ulcer development at an area of high pressure (i.e., the metatarsal heads, as compared with the mid-foot) is and that of an ulcer developing at a site of callus
Vascular status must be assessed pulses, parlour, parasthesia, pain, temperature

\section*{Investigations}
- Pulses
- BP
- Random blood sugar
- Doppler Ultrasound
- Arteriogram

\section*{Infection of the Ulcer}

Infection is usually a consequence, rather than a cause, of ulceration, which allows the entry and
multiplication of microorganisms.
A commonly accepted definition of foot infection is the presence of systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever, leukocytosis ) or purulent secretions, or two or more local symptoms or signs (redness, warmth, induration, pain, or tenderness).
Since foot infection has the potential to threaten the limb, appropriate diagnosis and therapy are urgently required. If infection is present, a deep-tissue specimen should be obtained aseptically, if possible; such specimens are superior to superficial swab specimens for the isolation of resistant organisms. Polymicrobial isolates, including aerobic and anaerobic species, are common.

\section*{Osteomyelitis}

The findings on plain radiographs are often suggestive of osteomyelitis (manifested as bone destruction or periosteal reaction, especially as compared with findings on prior films) and radiographs are therefore recommended by many experts when there is evidence of infection.
Histologic evaluation and culture of a bone-biopsy specimen are regarded as the gold standard
Although white-cell scans are sensitive for the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now considered the imaging test of choice when osteomyelitis is suspected; the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for osteomyelitis in diabetic patients are 90 percent or greater.

\section*{Management}

The principles of management of neuropathic ulcers include eradication of infection and removal of pressure from the ulcer.

\section*{General Care}

1-Glycemic control is important, since leukocyte function is impaired in patients with chronic hyperglycemia.
2-Patients should be advised to stop smoking, smoking may affect vascular factors, but also because smokers have higher rates of incisional-wound infections than nonsmokers or former smokers.
3-Do not go bearfoot- well fitting shoes Inspect the feet daily, especially between the toes
4-Keep the feet clean and dry
5- Seek help trim toenails, or if corns/callouses develop
6-Comply with medications
7- Avoid exposure to cold, friction, moisture between toes
8 - Aviod use of external heat (heat pad, hot water bottle, hydrotherapy)

\section*{Wound Management}
1.Sharp débridement-the removal of necrotic and senescent tissue as well as foreign and infected material from the wound
2. Treatment of local edema. Intermittent foot compression by a pneumatic pump results in a higher rate of healing at 12 weeks
3. Removal of Pressure-reducing mechanical stress, or offloading. Techniques for removing pressure include the use of casts or boots, half shoes, sandals, and felted foam dressings. Use of a total-contact cast (i.e., a non removable cast) over the involved limb has been shown to be superior to standard therapy and other techniques for removing pressure.
Contraindications to total contact casts and other un removable casts include infected or ischemic wounds.
4. Dressings-The development of dressings that promote a moist environment to assist healing has been a focus of care for chronic wounds.
The selection of a dressing involves matching the properties of the dressing (such as control of exudates) with the characteristics of the ulcer and the patient.
5.Infection control

The choice of antibiotic for infected foot ulcers is initially based on the pathogens presumed to be present. Commonly used broadspectrum antibiotics include clindamycin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin).
Intravenous antibiotic options for more serious infections (e.g., cellulitis) include imipenem, (ampicillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-azobactam), and broadspectrum cephalosporins Soft-tissue infections usually require one to two weeks of therapy, whereas osteomyelitis may require more than six weeks of antibiotics, often accompanied by surgical débridement of infected bone.

- Presentation
- Pathophysiology
- Investigations-Lab and Imaging
- Management-Medical
-Surgical

\section*{Definition}

Empyema is a localized or free collection of purulent material in the pleural space .It is an advanced Para pneumonic effusion. Para pneumonic Pleural effusions are divided into 3 based on pathogenesis

\section*{1.Uncomplicated pleural effusion}
-Exudative predominantly neutrophilic effusion that occurs as the lung interstitial fluid increases during pneumonia. These effusions are resolved with appropriate antibiotic treatment of pneumonia.

\section*{2. Complicated pleural effusion}

Bacterial invasion of the pleural space that leads to an increased number of neutrophils, pleural fluid acidosis, and elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration. These effusions often are sterile because bacteria are usually cleared rapidly from the pleural space

\section*{3. Thoracic empyema.}

Thoracic empyema is characterized by either aspiration of pus on thoracentesis or the presence of bacterial organisms on Gram stain. A positive culture is not required for diagnosis.

\section*{Etiology -Predisposition}
1. Pulmonary infection-Unresolved pneumonia - Acute bacterial
2. Pulmonary tuberculosis, mycotic
3. Bronchiectasis
4. Lung abscess
5. Subphrenic abscess
6. Trauma -Penetrating injury chest, Esophageal perforation
7. Iatrogenic- postoperative infection or aspiration of pleural fluid .Follow thoracocentesis, thoracotomy or thoracoscopy
8. Generalized sepsis
9. Adjacent infections
a) Retropharyngeal
b) Mediastinal abscess
c) Osteomyelitis of ribs
d) Para vertebral abscess

\section*{Bacteriology}
-Tubercula empyema
-Nontubercular empyema are Staphylococcus aureus , Pneumococci , E. coli , Pseudomonas , Klebsiella , and anaerobes.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

American Thoracic society identifies 3-stage development of empyema:
1. Exudative (acute) stage .
-The pleural inflammation results in increased permeability and a small fluid collection.
-The fluid is thin, contains few cellular elements mostly neutrophils, and is often sterile and amenable to thoracentesis.
-This stage lasts only $24-72 \mathrm{~h}$ and then progresses to the fibrinopurulent stage.

\section*{2. Fibrinopurulent (transitional)}
-invasion of the organism into the pleural space
-progressive inflammation
- polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte invasion.

There is an accumulation of protein and fibrinous material with formation of fibrin membranes, which forms partitions or loculations within the pleural space.
- There is decrease pleural fluid glucose and pH and increased protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
-This stage lasts for 7-10 days and often requires more aggressive treatment such as tube thoracostomy.

\section*{3. Organizing (chronic) stage.}
-A thick pleural peel is formed by resorption of fluid and as a result of fibroblast proliferation.
-The lung parenchyma becomes entrapped, forming a fibrothorax. Activation of the coagulation cascade is common with pleural empyema. The pleural inflammatory response favors increased procoagulant activity as well as depressed fibrinolytic activity, favoring fibrin deposition. Loculations result, with these fibrin strands being covered rapidly by a meshwork of fibroblasts that both proliferate and deposit basement membrane proteins onto the surface of the pleura. These proteins obscure the separation of the visceral and parietal pleura and lead to the formation of the pleural peel.
-This stage usually occurs within 2-4 weeks after the initial presentation
-Following timely initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, the inflammatory process resolves. Re-epithelialization of the pleura occurs with the migration of pleural mesothelial cells into areas of denudation.
However, inappropriate or delayed treatment leads to exuberant pleural inflammation resulting in pleural fibrosis, and restrictive lung disease.

\section*{Incidence:}
increased incidence of pneumonia and tuberculosis likely to cause increased incidence of empyema

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity:}

Early recognition of pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion, effective intervention to identify the infecting organism, and initiation of definitive therapy reduce the morbidity and complications associated with this process

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{History}

Most patients with empyema present with clinical manifestations of bacterial pneumonia.ie
1.Acute febrile response
2.pleuritic chest pain
3.cough
4.dyspnea
5. Hemoptysis

Some patients are severely systemically toxic or even comatose.May be cyanotic, hypotensive, dehydrated, and oliguric, weaknes.The inflammation of the pleural space may cause abdominal pain and vomiting.
Frequently, patients exhibit characteristic splinting of the affected side.Symptoms may be blunted, and fever may not be present in patients who are immunocompromised.

The therapy instituted depends on the :
- causative factor
- stage of empyema
- state of the underlying lung
- presence of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) if any,
- ability to obliterate the space
- condition of the patient

\section*{Physical}

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}

\section*{Laboratory}
1.FBC
2.Thoracocentesis done and fluid sent for:

NB Performing thoracentesis before the initiation of antibiotics increases the diagnostic yield of the fluid cultures and allows for more specific antimicrobial therapy
a)WBC counts usually $>15000 / \mathrm{dl}$ WBC \& differential count predominantly PMN'S
b)Gram stain and AFB
c)Culture and sensitivity Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures
d) Pleural fluid latex agglutination
e) Biochemistry Glucose, LDH, pH , protein, amylase, lipid stain or triglycerides,
Treatment should be initiated on the basis of the clinical course and should not wait for above tests.
Pleural fluid latex agglutination [or counter
immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for specific bacteria] may be helpful if the cause of the infection cannot be ascertained from culture results
3.Blood cultures
4.Sputum -AFB, cultures and Radionuclotide studies

\section*{Imaging}
1. CXR-Fetures of pleural effusion as obliteration of costophrenic angle and fluid level plus diffuse opacity.
Severe effusion may show displacement of the mediastinum to the contralateral hemithorax as well as scoliosis
2. Ultrasound for septation of fluids.
3. Complex fluid collections, chest CT imaging has emerged as the study of choice.

Chest CT imaging can be used to detect and define pleural fluid and image the airways, guide interventional procedures, and discriminate between pleural fluid and chest consolidation.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{-Medical}
-Surgical
-Combination of both medical and surgical mx is often employed.
-The objectives of treatment are to
a) Control infection
b) Drainage of the purulent fluid
c) Eradication of the sac to prevent chronicity and allow reexpansion of the affected lung to restore function The treatment needs to be individualized and it depends on the available clinical, radiological, and laboratory evidence.

\section*{Medical care}

General measures include:
-Increase in the protein and fluid intake.
-Physiotherapy and breathing exercises will help in early reexpansion of the lung following evacuation of the fluid.
-NSAIDS

\section*{Antibiotics}

An empiric selection of the most appropriate antibiotics is necessary before result of culture and sensitivity.
Base the choice on the most common pathogens causing pneumonia for the patient's age and geographic location and history.
The patient receives 10-14 days of intravenous antibiotics and receives treatment until he or she is afebrile, off supplemental oxygen, and appropriately responding to therapy. Followed by oral antibiotics for 1-3 weeks

\section*{1.Thoracentesis}

Thoracentesis may provide, both significant diagnostic information and therapeutic relief for parapneumonic effusions.
In cases of streptococcal infection, the pus is very thin and the volume is also small, with fluid pH above 7.2 , glucose above 40 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ and with LDH levels below $1000 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{l}$. In such cases, only a diagnostic needle aspiration suffices.
In cases tubercular etiology, the antitubercular chemotherapy started and the pus in the pleural space aspirated through a widebore needle.
A 6-month course with 4+2 drugs or a 9-month course with 3 drugs is recommended. The treatment may be required for a longer time in cases with associated Pott's spine.

\section*{2.Tube thoracostomy}

Chest tube drainage with an underwater seal is done for cases in stage 2.
Diagnostic thoracentesis and chest tube drainage are effective therapy in more than $50 \%$ of patients.
Prompt drainage of a free-flowing effusion prevents the development of loculations and a fibrous peel.
If the fluid is not free flowing, further radiological imaging may be required.

\section*{3.Interventional radiology}

The U/S or CT-Scan guided placement of small-bore catheters, specifically directed to the loculated pleural fluid collections, has helped to facilitate drainage. Radiologists can lyse adhesions
directly using imaging during the tube placement. Interventional radiologists have used fibrinolytics such as urokinase, streptokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) in complicated empyemas with loculations and ameliorated fibrous peel formation and fibrin deposition.

\section*{Surgical intervention}
-Chronic empyema, that may be caused by delayed medical attention, inadequate antibiotic therapy, inadequate drainage, presence of foreign body, infliction of postresectional space. -chronic pulmonary infection such as mismanaged tuberculosis. - Other causes of ICD failure include improper positioning of tube, improper selection of tube size, inadequate physiotherapy, and presence of Broncho Pulmonary fistula
-Multiloculated empyema or persistently symptomatic effusion is likely to require surgical intervention.

\section*{a). Rib resection}

Altho' not highly practiced rib resection becomes mandatory to gain adequate access while dealing with the chronic cases.
Rib resection becomes necessary if the pus is thick and loculated, or if the patient remains toxic after inter costal tube drainage.
This not only provides adequate exposure but also allows one to evacuate the pus, break up loculations and adhesions, and assess the need for decortication.
After cleaning the cavity thoroughly, a tube may be placed in its most dependent portion and attached to underwater seal drainage. A properly placed intercostal tube would be as effective as two or three tubes.

\section*{b) Open drainage}

In chronic cases with a regular discharge of thick pus, a wide bore tube may be left in place, open to atmospheric pressure. This is helpful in pts with chronic tubercular empyema, after prolonged ( $3-5$ weeks) chest tube drainage.

\section*{c) Thoracotomy and Decortication}
-Thoracotomy is done to remove the pleural peel and lyse the adhesions if the patient does not respond promptly to the treatment above.
- Decortication comprises removal of the organized inflammatory membrane. It comprises of two types of procedures:
1. Removal of the visceral peel alone, and
2. Empymectomy comprising of extrapleural dissection outside the parietal pleura and removal of the complete cavity. Length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotics, and long-term morbidity are reduced by this more aggressive approach with rapid resolution of symptoms, but it is a major operative procedure with increased cost and short-term morbidity. Thoracotomy and decortication is very effective, with a reported $95 \%$ success rate for patients with fibrinopurulent effusions, and is likely to remain a treatment of choice for advanced empyema.

\section*{d) Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS)}

Pre operative CT scan will help to assess the location and thickness of pleural peels and enable to site thoracoscopic ports more effectively.
Thoracoscopic debridement closely imitates open thoracotomy and drainage. However, not suitable in late stages of empyema due to thick pleura which needs to be removed. (Stage 3).

The VATS has proved to be an effective and less invasive replacement for the limited decortication procedure Its drawbacks:
-suboptimal decortication incase of bleeding
-inadvertent lung injury

\section*{e) Lobectomy and pneumonectomy}

Surgical excision of a lobe or the whole lung esp.where tuberculosis is prevalent.
In some patients, even after adequate decortication, the lung does not expand owing to underlying necrosis. In such cases, resection of the affected lung segment will be prudent.
Lung excision (complete or in part) is frequently required to prevent the other lung from being flooded with the secretions from the infected lung.
Also, rib excision may sometimes be required to have a good access to thorax in the advanced cases of empyema with crowding of the ribs.

\section*{Indications for pulmonary resection in cases of tubercular empyema.}
1. Resistant tuberculosis Relative indications for surgical intervention such as severe cavitation, bronchiectasis, or bronchial stenosis may contribute to the failure of chemotherapy i.
2. A mass lesion of the lung in an area of tubercular involvement. This helps for simultaneous diagnosis of the mass lesion and treatment of tuberculosis.
3. Massive life-threatening hemoptysis or recurrent severe hemoptysis.
4. A broncho-pleural fistula that does not respond to tube thoracostomy.

\section*{Complications}
1.Empyema necessitans-A swelling appears over the chest wall, which is in communication with the underlying empyema. It has a positive cough impulse. It usually does not require any additional treatment and heals spontaneously with adequate treatment of the underlying empyema.
2.Fibrothorax, is a rare complication seen in adolescents who have presented very late.
3.Broncho-pleural fistula (BPF
4.Long-term effects -suffer restrictive lung disease and abnormal spirometry.

\section*{Spread;}
1. Local-regional-Occurs through submucosal infiltration of the wall of the oesophagus into adjacent structures, along the length of the oesophagus in the submucosal lymphatics \& to regional lymph nodes. This is often discontinuous i.e. distant regional lymph nodes may be invaded even when local nodes are free of tumour, \& there may be satellite nodules in the oesophagus proximal to the main tumour.
2.Systemic (Haematogenous) - Mainly to the liver \& lungs, but practically any organ can be involved

\section*{Staging}

\section*{TNM Staging}

-Resp exam-TOF creates effusion and pneumonia.

\section*{INVESTIAGTIONS}

\section*{Laboratory}
1.FHG-Anemia can be due to bleeding or nutritional deficiency or can be secondary to chronic disease and pre op preparation
2.U/E/C pre op
3. Liver function tests Serum protein levels (albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin) may be low, reflecting the extent of malnutrition.
-Abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver metastases

\section*{Imaging}

\section*{1.Esophagoscopy and biopsy-Gold standard}

Allows visualization histological (or cytological) confirmation of suspected carcinoma.
It is important to measure the length of the lesion and the distance from the incisors for staging and treatment planning.
Typical tumours are friable and bleed easily. Multiple biopsies from suspicious areas should be performed.
Bronchoscopy may be done to check invasion of the bronchi

\section*{2.Barrium swallow-incase OGD absent}

Done early in course of dysphagia. Characteristic findings include
1.Rat tail appearance
2. Proximal dilatation.
3.Sholdering effects
4.Mucosal erosion/defects

\section*{3.CXR}
a)Check for mediastinal widening-invasion by tumor or lymphadenopathy
b)Pleural effusion indicate pleural dessimination
c) TOF pneumonic process features of aspiration pneumonia.
d)The diaphragm doming in involvement of phrenic nerve causing paralysis.
e)Lung nodules-lung metastasis or lung abcess
e)An esophageal air-fluid level-obstruction

\section*{4. Endoscopic ultrasonography}
-Endoscopic ultrasound improves the ability to determine wall penetration and abnormal lymph nodes.
- Used in pre-operative staging. Five distinct wall layers can be identified that correspond to the mucosa, lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, muscularis propria, and adventitia. Carcinoma appears as an irregular hypoechoic mass.Depth of penetration of the wall can be accurately assessed.
The ability to detect regional lymph-node involvement may be further enhanced by the use of endoscopic, ultrasonographically guided fine-needle aspiration, which has an accuracy of more than 90 percent at many centers

\section*{5.CT-Scan of the chest}

Local invasion of the tumour and extension. Used in staging of the tumour.

\section*{Other investigations}
a) Bronchoscopy should be done in lesions of the upper or middle $\frac{1}{3}$, where there is potential for tracheo-bronchial invasion.
b) Staging laparoscopy is useful for assessing Adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus, particularly if it is likely to extend below the phreno-oesophageal ligament. Also, transperitoneal spread \& liver metastasis

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
1.Benign papillomas, polyps, or granulomatous masses
2.Esophageal webs, rings and strictures
3.Achalasia cardia
4.Mediastinal tumours-Lymphoma

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

The goal of treatment in carcinoma of the oesophagus is two fold: palliation of dysphagia and cure of the cancer. The standard of therapy is oesophageal resection.
-However most patients present with advanced tumour which are unresectabe. Palliative management to relieve the dysphagia is instituted.
-Esophageal carcinoma is treated by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these methods.
- It is important to stage the lesion as accurately as possible before deciding on the treatment plan.
-Resectability of the primary lesion must first be determined. Nonresectability is suggested by:
1. Direct spread to the trachea-bronchial tree or aorta
2.Angulation of the esophageal axis.
3.Tracheoesophageal fistula
4.Hoarseness associated with vocal cord paralysis
5.Primary tumors larger than 10 cm are rarely resectable

\section*{A.SURGERY}

\section*{Mucosal resection at endoscopy-CIS}

For the carcinoma in situ

\section*{Types of Curative Subtotal Oesophagectomy;}

The, main determinants of the operation chosen are the surgeon's preference and level of the tumour.
The three most common approaches currently in use are:
1. Grey -Turner's Transhiatal oesophagectomy
2. Lewis' laparotomy and right thoracotomy
3.Sweets' left thoraco-abdominal

\section*{1.Grey -Turner's Trans-hiatal oesophagectomy}

Best used to remove upper-third or lower-third neoplasms The operation is done in a supine position with a single lumen endotracheal tube.
A laparotomy is performed first and the abdomen is explored.
The stomach is prepared as an oesophageal substitute.
The stomach is mobilized on the right gastric and gastroepiploic arteries. The omentum is divided, preserving the right gastroepiploic artery. The left gastric artery is double ligated.
The gastrohepatic omentum is divided with care taken to identify accessory arteries to the left lobe of liver.
The hiatus is dissected . It is helpful to open the hiatus anteriorly as described by Pinotti. This facilitates exposure of the distal oesophagus almost to the level of the carina.
The side of left neck is opened and the oesophagus exposed; The upper third of the oesophagus can be dissected under direct vision.Cancerous portio of oesophagus is removed and the stomach is brought up through the posterior mediastinal oesophageal bed and a cervical anastomosis performed.

\section*{2. Lewis' laparotomy and right thoracotomy}

Best for mid- or lower-third lesions.
An upper midline laparotomy is performed and the upper abdomen explored.
The stomach is mobilized as previously described. It is important to enlarge the hiatus to prevent compression of the stomach when it is brought into the chest.

Patient is then positioned for right thoracotomy. The stomach is then elevated up into the chest and a high intrathoracic anastomosis is made at the apex of the right chest.
3.-3 stage McKeown operation - As Ivor Lewis (above) but a third incision on the right of the neck is made to complete the cervical anastomosis. A neck incision is required if;
- lymph node dissection is to be done
- there are technical difficulties with an anastomosis at the thoracic inlet
- For upper \& middle $\frac{1}{3}$ tumours

\section*{4. Sweets' left thoraco-abdominal}

Best employed for gastro-oesophageal junction carcinomas or low oesophageal carcinomas. Tumours 35 cm or more from the incisors are ideally suited to this approach.
The patient is placed in the right lateral decubitus position. An oblique left upper quadrant laparotomy is performed to explore the gastro-oesophageal junction area and the liver.
Then a thoracoabdominal incision through the sixth or seventh interspace is performed. The diaphragm is incised circumferentially to avoid injury to the phrenic nerve branches. The stomach is mobilized as above.
The hiatus is dissected. A pyloromyotomy or pyloroplasty is then done according to the surgeon's preference. The oesophagus is then dissected in en-bloc fashion from the pericardium to aorta. Advantage of this approach is the excellent exposure of the gastro-oesophageal junction and the ease of mobilizing the stomach, especially in obese patients.

\section*{Post-op;}

A chest tube is left in place after thoracotomy
NPO for 1-2 days \& then perform a contrast swallow
(Methylene Blue, Gastrografin, Dilute Barium) to detect leakage. If present, NPO is maintained until it has healed

\section*{ADVANCED DISEASE (T3/4)}

\section*{Palliative therapy for Dysphagia}

\section*{1) Intubation}

For middle \& lower $\frac{1}{3}$ tumours; Not for upper $\frac{1}{3}$ as the tube may become displaced upwards \& may block the airway. It is inserted by;

\section*{i) Oesophagoscopy}

Pulsion tubes e.g.,
✓ Proctar Livingstone
✓ Atkinson
✓ Souttar tubes
At endoscopy dilate through the tumour mass and mount the tube and push through the tumour. Done under sedation .Are expensive tubes.
ii)Laparotomy

Traction tubes e.g.
✓ Celestin tube (rubber)-better for lower 1/3 tumours.
✓ Mousseau-Barbin tube (Plastic)
At endoscopy dilate through the tumour and push the tube up to the stomach.
Do laparatomy then open through the stomach, pull the lower edge (traction applied) until they cant move anymore. Can fix the lower edge to the stomach.

\section*{Complications of tubes}
a) Dislodged
b) Blocked with food
c) Overgrown and blocked by tumour
d) Aggravation of chest pain.
e) Haemorrhage
f) Perforation
-Furthermore, concomitant radiotherapy increases the complications of tubes e.g., bleeding, perforation.
-Therefore, intubation should be reserved for patients with extensive disease and a life expectancy limited to 1-2 months. -Patient should rest at 45 degrees to reduce reflux -Should take meals at least 3 hours before sleeping. Drink pure pineapple juice.
2) Laser therapy - a core of tumour is vaporized, opening the lumen without perforating the oesophagus.
3) Radiation therapy-For patients with unresectable disease and for poor operative candidates, radiation therapy may afford significant short-term palliation of pain and dysphagia. Better for upper third tumours which are mostly squamous cell carcinoma. During therapy, esophagitis may lead to worsening of dysphagia and odynophagia. Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy may achieve palliation in two-thirds of patients. The most common agents for treating esophageal cancer include 5fluorouracil, cisplatin, mitomycin, and vincristine.

\section*{4) Stenting}
5) Photodynamic therapy is a newer, experimental treatment for local esophageal cancer obliteration. Patients are injected with a photosensitizing chemical that is preferentially retained in cancer tissue. Under endoscopic guidance, a diffusing fiber attached to a tunable argon-pump dye laser is placed adjacent to the tumor. Laser activation emits non thermal light, which at the appropriate wave length causes selective necrosis of the sensitized tumor
6)Repeated dilatation-poor results
7)Sclerosis with absolute alcohol

\section*{Prognosis}

Resectable rate - 30\%
5YSR - 5-10\% (KNH - 25\%)

\section*{FISTULA-IN-ANO}

\section*{Definition}
-An anorectal fistula (Fistula-in-Ano) is an abnormal communication between the anus and the perianal skin.
-It occurs as hollow tract lined with granulation tissue connecting a primary opening inside the anal canal to a secondary opening in the perianal skin.
-Secondary tracts may be multiple and from the same primary opening.

\section*{Sex and Age}

The male-to-female ratio approx. 2:1
The mean age of patients is 38 years.

\section*{Etiology:}
-Fistula-in-ano is nearly always caused by a previous anorectal abscess.
-Anal canal glands situated at the dentate line afford a path for infecting organisms to reach the intramuscular spaces.
Other predisposing factors
1) Trauma
2) Crohn disease
3) Anal fissures
4) Anorectal Carcinoma
5) Radiation therapy
6) Infection -actinomycoses, tuberculosis, and chlamydial infections.
7) Prolapsed internal hemorrhoid
8) Acute appendicitis, salpingitis, diverticulitis
9) Immunosuppression

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

\section*{The cryptoglandular hypothesis}

The infection begins in cryptoglandular situated at the dentate line in the anal canal and progresses into the muscular wall of the anal sphincters to cause an anorectal abscess.
Following surgical or spontaneous drainage in the perianal skin, occasionally a granulation tissue-lined tract is left behind, forming the fistula in-ano which causes recurrent symptoms.

\section*{Classification of fistula in-ano}

\section*{Parks classification system}

The Parks classification system defines 4 types of fistula-in-ano that result from cryptoglandular infections.

\section*{1.Intersphincteric-commonest-70\%}

Common course - Via internal sphincter to the intersphincteric space and then to the perineum. They result from perianal abscesses

\section*{2. Transsphincteric $\mathbf{- 2 5 \%}$}

Common course - Low via internal and external sphincters into the ischiorectal fossa and then to the perineum. Originate from ischiorectal abscesses

\section*{3.Suprasphincteric $\mathbf{- 5 \%}$}

Common course - Via intersphincteric space superiorly to above puborectalis muscle into ischiorectal fossa and then to perineum. Result from supralevator abscesses

\section*{4. Extrasphincteric-1\%}

Bypass the anal canal and sphincter mechanism, passing through the ischiorectal fossa and levator ani muscle, and open high in the rectum

\section*{Current procedural terminology codes classification}

\section*{1.Subcutaneous}
2.Submuscular (intersphincteric, low transsphincteric)
3.Complex, recurrent (high transsphincteric, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric, multiple tracts, recurrent)
3.Second stage

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History (in order of prevalence)
1) Perianal discharge-intermittent or constant
2) Perianal pain-worse during defecation, may be constant
3) Swelling /lump in the perianal area
4) Bleeding in the perianal area
5) Diarrhea
6) Discoloration of skin surrounding the fistula
7) External opening in the perianal discharging
8) Fever

\section*{Past medical history}

Important points in the history that may suggest a complex fistula include the following:
-Inflammatory bowel disease
-Diverticulitis
-History of trauma
-Previous radiation therapy for prostate or rectal cancer
-Tuberculosis
-Immune suppression-Steroid therapy , HIV infection

\section*{Review of symptoms}
-Abdominal pain
-Weight loss
-Change in bowel habits

\section*{Physical examination}

Physical examination findings remain the mainstay of diagnosis.
- The examiner should observe the entire perineum
- external opening that appears as an open sinus or elevation of granulation tissue
- Spontaneous discharge via the external opening may be apparent or expressible upon digital rectal examination.

\section*{DRE}
- External Anal sphincter tone
- Tenderness on examaination
- Fibrous tract or cord beneath the skin.
- Bogginess-any abceses.
- Lateral or posterior induration suggests deep postanal or ischiorectal extension.

\section*{Differential diagnoses}

The following do not communicate with the anal canal:
- Perianal abscess
- Urethroperineal fistulas
- Abceses-Ischiorectal abscess,Submucous or high muscular abscess, Pelvirectal abscess (rare)
- Crohn's disease
- Carcinoma
- Retrorectal tumors
- Hidradenitis suppurativa
- Infected inclusion cysts
- Pilonidal disease
- Bartholin gland abscess in females

\section*{The Goodsall Rule}

Help to anticipate the anatomy of fistula-in-ano.
The rule states that fistulae with an external opening anterior to a plane passing transversely through the center of the anus will follow a straight radial course to the dentate line. Fistulae with their openings posterior to this line will follow a curved course to the posterior midline.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Lab Studies:}

No specific laboratory studies are required; the normal preoperative studies are performed based on age and comorbidities.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

These are not performed for routine fistula evaluation. They can be helpful when the primary opening is difficult to identify or in the case of recurrent or multiple fistulae to identify secondary tracts or missed primary openings.

\section*{1.Fistulography}

This involves injection of contrast via the internal opening, which is followed by anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique x-ray images to outline the course of the fistula tract.

\section*{2.Endoanal/endorectal ultrasound}

To help define muscular anatomy differentiating intersphincteric from transsphincteric lesions.

\section*{3. MRI}

MRI is becoming the study of choice when evaluating complex fistulae

\section*{4.CT scan}

A CT scan is more helpful in the setting of perirectal inflammatory disease than in the setting of small fistulae because it is better for delineating fluid pockets that require drainage than for small fistulae

\section*{Procedures}

\section*{Proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy}

Rigid sigmoidoscopy can be performed at the initial evaluation to help rule out any associated disease process in the rectum -Complete fistulectomy creates larger wounds that take longer to heal and offers no recurrence advantage over fistulotomy.
Perform a biopsy on any firm, suggestive tissue

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Medical}

Broad spectrum antibiotics

\section*{Surgery}

\section*{Fistulotomy}
-The laying-open technique (fistulotomy) is useful for $85-95 \%$ of primary fistulae (ie, submucosal, intersphincteric, low transsphincteric).
-A probe is passed into the tract through the external and internal openings.
-The overlying skin, subcutaneous tissue, and internal sphincter muscle are divided with a knife or electrocautery, thereby opening the entire fibrous tract.
-If the fistula tract courses higher into the sphincter mechanism, seton placement should be performed.

\section*{Fistulectomy}
-As above with Curettage performed to remove all granulation tissue in the tract base.

\section*{Seton placement}

A Seton can be placed alone, combined with fistulotomy, or in a staged fashion. This technique indicated in:
1.Complex fistulae -high transsphincteric, suprasphincteric ,extrasphincteric, multiple fistulae
2.Recurrent fistulae after previous fistulotomy
3.Anterior fistulae in female patients

\section*{4.Poor preoperative sphincter pressures}
5.Patients with Crohn disease or patients who are immunosuppressed

Setons have 2 purposes beyond giving a visual identification of the amount of sphincter muscle involved.
(1) drain and promote fibrosis
(2) Cut through the fistula.

Setons can be made from large silk suture, silastic vessel markers, or rubber bands that are threaded through the fistula tract.

\section*{Procedure}
_Pass the seton through the fistula tract around the deep external sphincter after opening the skin, subcutaneous tissue, internal sphincter muscle, and subcutaneous external sphincter muscle.
-The seton is tightened down and secured with a separate silk tie.
-With time, fibrosis occurs above the seton as it gradually cuts through the sphincter muscles and essentially exteriorizes the tract.
-The seton is tightened on subsequent office visits until it is pulled through over 6-8 weeks.

\section*{In complex multiple fistula}
-Colostomy may be fashioned
-Posterior Sagittal anorectoplasty done for multiple fistulectomies

\section*{Preoperative details:}
-Rectal irrigation with enemas should be performed on the morning of the operation.
-Administer preoperative antibiotics.
-Prone jackknife position with buttocks apart is the most advantageous position

\section*{Post-operative management}
1. Sitz baths, analgesics, and stool bulking agents (eg, bran, psyllium products).
2. Internal wound should not close prematurely, causing a recurrent fistula.

Digital examination findings can help distinguish early fibrosis.
3. Wound healing usually occurs within 6 weeks

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

\section*{Early postoperative}

Urinary retention
- Bleeding
- Fecal impaction
- Thrombosed hemorrhoids

\section*{Delayed postoperative}
- Recurrence
- Incontinence (stool)
- Anal stenosis: The healing process causes fibrosis of the anal canal. Bulking agents for stool help prevent narrowing.
- Delayed wound healing: Complete healing occurs by 12 weeks unless an underlying disease process is present (ie, recurrence, Crohn disease

\section*{GASTRIC CARCINOMA}

\section*{Predisposing factors}
1.H.pylori infection
2.Gasctic ulcers
3.Chronic gastritis-atrophic or pernicious anemia
4.Gastric adenomas
5.Cigarete smoking and alcohol consumption
6.Nitrosamines in the preservation of foods
8.Partial gastrectomy-bilous reflux
9.Barrets esophagus
10.Radiation therapy
11.Genetic Factors

\section*{Clinical presentation and management History}

Most gastric cancers present at an advanced stage. The presentations equally non-specific -5A's
(Asthenia, abdominal pain, Anorexia,Anaemia Achlorhydria)
1.Weight loss (asthenia) most common symptom
2. Abdominal pain .This may be epigastric, substernal, or back.

Abdominal pain may mimic that of benign peptic ulcer disease, with relief of pain obtained by ingesting antacids, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-blockers, and food. In other patients, pain is worse after eating
3. Anorexia and vomiting are present, especially if distal tumors cause pyloric obstruction.
There is also associated dyspepsia and early satiety.
4. Constipation- Because of reduced dietary intake, this is common.
5. Both acute and chronic upper gastrointestinal bleeding may occur, with hematemesis and melena, though frank hemorrhage occurs infrequently, usually in less than $10 \%$ of patients.
6. Anemia- Weakness and fatigue related to anemia and also due to weight loss due to decreased dietary intake.
Worsening angina pectoris and dyspnea may be related to progressive anemia.
7. Dysphagia is an important symptom of adenocarcinoma of the fundus of the stomach, which involves the cardioesophageal junction.
Symptoms suggestive of metastasis include:
-Jaundice may be present secondary to liver metastasis or extension of the cancer into the porta hepatis.
-Large bowel involvement by metastasis spreading through the gastrocolic ligament may be mistaken for primary colonic cancer and may cause large intestinal obstruction.
-Bone pain or neurologic symptoms of cord compression signal metastatic disease.

\section*{Predisposing factors}
-Alcohol intake
-Cigarette smoking
-History of treatment for PUD-gastric ulcer and H. pylori
-History of GIT cancer
-Familial history
-Diet
-Radiation

\section*{Physical examination}

May not reveal abnormality except in advanced disease.
1.Anemia
2.Jaundice may be present if liver metastases are extensive or positioned at the porta hepatis
3. Recent weight loss with temporal wasting and loss of muscle mass. May also be dehydrated
4. Lymph node enlargement, particularly in the left supraclavicular area (or Virchow's signal node) or the left side of the neck. Termed Troisier's sign
- Umbilical nodules indicate the presence of metastatic disease.(sister Mary Joseph's sign)
5. Palpable abdominal mass if the cancer is large or hepatic enlargement related to metastatic disease, gastric dilatation, and a succussion splash.
6. Malignant ascites can occur with metastatic gastric cancer.

7-Rectal examination may reveal a rectal "shelf" (Blumer's shelf). Metastases are thought to spread by gravity to the true pelvis and form the shelf noted on rectal examination.
-Rarely, acanthosis nigricans may be found on examination of the patient's skin, particularly in the axillae or other body folds. -ovarian metastases (Krukenberg tumor)
-Superficial thrombophlebitis on the legs (Trousseau's sign), It is also associated with pancreatic cancer.

\section*{Investigations}

Imaging
1.Gastroscopy, biopsy, and cytology-Gold standard
-Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy provides the best overall method of diagnosing gastric cancer.
-Both biopsy and brush cytologic evaluation should be done, because they are complementary.
In general, the more biopsies obtained, the higher the diagnostic yield. At least four to six biopsy specimens should be obtained from each separate lesion for histology.

\section*{2.Barium meal-double contrast(with Air)}

In absence of an upper GI endoscopy, this can be done. Some of the abnormalities noted include
-Lack of distensibility of the stomach
-An ulcerated mass or mass effect surrounding an ulcer
-A mass in any portion of the stomach
-Enlarged gastric folds
-Obstructing lesions at the cardioesophageal junction or at the pylorus.

\section*{3.Endoscopic ultrasonography}

Combines endoscopy and ultrasonography to produce detailed images of the stomach wall allowing an accurate assessment of depth of tumor invasion.
It is more accurate in assessing depth of cancer invasion and also appears to be more accurate in determining cancer spread to regional lymph nodes.

\section*{4. CT-scan}
-Used to evaluate gastric wall thickness, direct extension of tumor into adjacent organs, regional and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement, ascites, and liver metastases thus stage the tumour.
-CT has been shown to predict with reasonable accuracy which patients can undergo curative surgery and which tumors are unresectable.

\section*{5. Abdominal ultrasonography}

Seeding of peritoneum and in females the krunkenburg tumors can be visualized

\section*{6.Laparascopy}
-Stage of the tumour
-Assess Lymph node involvement
-Biopsy for diagnosis
-Peritoneal washout for cytology
-Check on the operability of the tumour

\section*{CXR-involvement}

\section*{Laboratory}
1. FHG-evaluation of the anemia-mcrocytic hypochromic picture due to chronic blood loss but may also be megaloblastic in pernicious anaemia.

\section*{2.Liver function tests in jaundiced patients}

Evaluation of the bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and 5'nucleotidase may indicate metastatic liver disease.

\section*{3.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)}

Concentration may be elevated in patients with gastric cancer, usually with advanced disease. If CEA level is elevated preoperatively and becomes normal after surgery, it can be used in follow-up evaluations lke in colonic cancer.
4. Stool test for occult blood is frequently positive, and melena occurs occasionally.

\section*{Staging of gastric cancer TNM \\ TX.TO,TIS}

T1 tumors invade to the submucosa
T2 invade the muscularis propria
T3 penetrate the serosa/adventitia
T4 invade adjacent structures.

\section*{Nodes}

N1 if there are metastases to peri gastric nodes
N2 if regional lymph nodes are involved
N3-IVC and Aorta nodes
MX-Metastasis can't be assessed.
M1-Presense of metastasis

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Surgery}

\section*{Gastrectomy}
-Early disease-mucosal
-Mucosal resection at endoscopy use of lugols iodine plus wide excision confined to $<2 \mathrm{~cm}$
-Enhanced by cold knife which is lazer tipped knife for resecting tumours.

\section*{Invasive tumour confined to stomach. \\ Issues are:}
a) Extent of gastric resection
b)Extent of lymph node resection.

\section*{Extent of gastric resection}

Adequate gastrectomy implies surgical margins in the stomach free of tumour.

Partial Gastrectomy
-Billroth surgery with Gastrojejunostomy. This is done when tumour is distal
-Adequate resection margins in the stomach are defined as an 8to $10-\mathrm{cm}$ proximal and distal clearance in the unstretched stomach.
-Failure to resect the stomach widely with microscopic clear margins is highly detrimental to survival. If the resection margin is not confirmed to be free of microscopic disease

\section*{Total gastrectomy}
-Proximal tumours-cardia and fundal tumours necessitates total gastrectomy.
-This carries a lower risk of recurrence or a second gastric cancer in long-term survivors.
-Total gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y esophago-jejunostomy to prevent alkaline reflux.
-The preferred method of reconstruction after total gastrectomy is as a Roux-en-Y with a $60-\mathrm{cm}$ Roux to prevent bile reflux.
-Gastric cancer at the cardia the tumour may infiltrate the lower oesophagus, and a $10-\mathrm{cm}$ oesophageal clearance is advised to be certain of clear resection margins.
-Thus surgery involves principles of gastric as well as oesophageal surgery, and in certain respects it should be regarded as a separate entity.

\section*{Extent of lymphadenectomy}

R0 gastrectomy does not remove any lymph node group,
R1 gastrectomy removes those nodes in group I (N1), which are predominantly perigastric lymph nodes, but leaves a large portion of the greater omentum. Nodes along the lesser curvature, greater curvature, sub-pyloric nodes,

R2 gastrectomy carries the same criteria for adequate gastric removal but includes lymphadenectomy to remove Group II (N2) nodes en bloc with stomach.
In general the entire greater omentum is removed, with the superior leaf of the transverse mesocolon, pancreatic capsule, and lesser omentum.
Lymph node dissection starts by removing the nodes along the gastroduodenal artery to its origin at the hepatic and is continued laterally to the porta hepatitis along the common hepatic artery. The nodes are cleared medially along the common hepatic artery to the coeliac axis which is cleared and continued along the splenic artery to the hilum of the spleen. Supra pancreatic and retropancreatic nodes and nodes along porto-hepatis

R3 gastrectomy attempts to remove nodes in Group III (N3) and involves pancreatic and splenic resection. Nodes involved include those along IVC and Aorta

\section*{Palliative surgery}

Palliative operation to relieve gastric outlet obstruction for unresectable tumours.
1. Billroth II -Resection of the distal stomach, closing the transected duodenum and stomach and restoring continuity by a gastrojejustomy to the posterior wall of the stomach-
2.Gastrostomy
3. Stents in gastro esophageal junction

Non-operative palliation, including laser therapy and intubation for dysphagia, and interstitial laser therapy for bleeding gastric cancers.

\section*{Radiotherapy}

Gastric adenocarcinoma has generally been regarded as radioresistant and, although it is less sensitive than squamous cell carcinoma, useful response and tumour shrinkage has been achieved in patients given palliative radiotherapy for malignant dysphagia.
The major limitation to radiotherapy has been the problem of achieving a dose that will spare adjacent normal tissue, including the liver and the small intestine

\section*{Chemotherapy}
-Gastrointestinal cancers are generally unresponsive to chemotherapy, but gastric cancers appear to be more sensitive than most and in particular respond better than colorectal cancer. -Despite evidence to suggest that combined chemotherapy is better, most studies have been performed with single agents. Mitomycin C, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and the nitrosoureas will produce tumour shrinkage in up to 30 per cent of patients with advanced disease.
-The combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and mitomycin $\underline{\mathrm{C}}$ at present represents the most effective regimen for advanced gastric cancer

\section*{Follow up}
1.CEA assay to detect recurrence of tumour
2. Follow endoscopies if mucosal resection at endoscopy.

\section*{Prevention of Gastric cancer}
1.Tripple therapy to eradicate H.pylori
2. Good nutrition-Vitamins C,E, A intake.
3. Endoscopy in strong family history or patients postgastrectomy.

\section*{HEAD INJURY}

Definition: Trauma to the head causing neurological manifestations.
Etiology: most common causes include motor vehicle accidents (eg, collisions between vehicles, pedestrians struck by motor vehicles, bicycle accidents), falls, assaults, sports-related injuries, and penetrating trauma.
The male-to-female ratio for TBI is nearly 2:1, and TBI is much more common in persons younger than 35 years.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF HEAD INJURIES.}

Head injuries can be classified according to.
1. Severity of the injury.
2. Anatomical classification
3. Pathological classification-penetrating or blunt injury
4. Primary and secondary brain injury.

\section*{A. SEVERITY OF INJURY}

Severity is assessed by the following methods notably:
Glasgow Coma Scale.
Score below 8 is considered to represent severe head injury while 8 to 12 is assessed as moderate head injury. 13 to 15 is mild head injury.

\section*{B. ANATOMICAL CLASSIFICATION}

\section*{Injury can involve one or more of the following.}

\section*{1 SCALP}

This consists of five layers; the first three layers are bound together and moved as a unit. The layers are:
S -Skin
C-Connective tissue: Dense
This is a fibro-fatty layer. The fibrous septa unite the skin to the underlying aponeurosis of the fronto-occipitalis muscle. The scalp vessels lie within this layer.
A- Aponeurosis of Galea
This is a thin fibrous sheath attached to the bellies of the Frontooccipitalis muscle. Deep to it is the sub aponeurotic space.
L- Loose connective(areolar) layer
-Occupying the sub aponeurotic space. This layer contains emissary veins. Is large potential space and can contain large amount of bleeds or pus following skull injury.
P Pericranium
Which is periosteum of the skull bone.
The scalp is very vascular and laceration can cause severe loss of blood. The vessels within the scalp do not constrict when injured because the wall is adherent to the surrounding fibre fatty tissue in the dense connective tissue layer. Bleeding can be controlled by applying pressure or suturing the scalp.

\section*{B. SKULL INJURIES}

Skull fractures are simple or compound. Simple if there is no communication between the fracture and the atmosphere, while the fracture is compound if there is such communication. Skull fractures are classified as follows:

\section*{Simple/Closed Fractures}
1. Linear or fissure fracture.

This involves the skull vault and can extend down to the base of the skull. The linear fracture indicates that there has been
significant injuries to the head. Management is usually hospital admission and close observation for any complications.
2. Comminuted fracture
3. Cracked pot fracture
4. Ping-pong fracture

This is a green stick fracture of the skull, it occurs in the first few months of life when the skull bones are still soft. It is caused after falls when the skull hit the edge of a blunt structure as the edge of a table. It shows as a deformity of the skull, it looks as a shallow trench on the surface of the skull. If large and showing as a significant deformity it can be easily treated by elevating the depressed bone fragment
5.Depressed fracture

Skull fragment pushed below the level of the skull. Significant depression is depression twice the thickness of the diploe. This can result in dural tear and laceration of the underlying brain. Skull fragments should be replaced to avoid the creation of skull defect and need for cranioplasty. The underlying dura should be repaired and any bleeding controlled. This is important in children below the age of 4 to avoid the complication of growing skull fracture.
Bone fragments should be replaced even in compound fractures and wound debrided.

\section*{Compound Fracture/open fracture e.g. Fracture Skull Base.}

This starts as vault linear fracture and extends into the skull base. It follows the weak points in the skull as the Cribriform plate, foramina and internal ear. Nerve injury can result involving the olfactory nerve, facial nerve. etc
If the fracture extends into the Cribriform plate and is associated with dural tear CSF leak can result and this is called rhinorrhea. If the fracture extends into the internal ear and the middle ear we can get otorrhea, which is CSF leak from the ear.

\section*{C.BRAIN INJURY}

Injury to the brain is either localised or diffuse and can be either primary or secondary.

\section*{PRIMARY BRAIN NJURY}

Injury directly due to the insult and occurring at the time of the injury
-Brain concusion-temporary physiological disruption of brain function.
-Brain contusion-Small petechie and hemorrhages
-Brain laceration-obvious deformity
Localised injury
-Deformation of the brain at the point of impact.
-Associated with dural laceration and underlying brain contusion or laceration. Usually there is a localized surrounding oedema around the site of the impact.
Diffuse injury
This carries a greater risk of damage to the brain and the mechanisms involved in this injury are:
Acceleration/deceleration injury.
In acceleration injury the head is put into motion from a stand still position, as a result of which the different layers of the brain travels at different velocities with shearing effects and rotation of the brain within the skull.
-The shearing stresses between different layers of the brain result in petechial haemorrhages as well as diffuse axonal injury involving the white matter and brain stem. In deceleration injury
the head is brought to a stand still from a moving position as in falls. The same mechanism applies.
The extent of the diffuse injury and the axonal damage determines the outcome.
-The more severe the injury is, more brain damage occurs with more axonal injury. This would be associated with higher morbidity and mortality.
Penetrating injury
-High velocity or slow velocity injury as a result of penetration with sharp objects.
-The base of the skull is thin bone and could easily be penetrated especially in children.
-This result in skull base fracture and damage to the brain overlying that area.
Compression injury
The head is compressed between two solid objects as in motor vehicle accidents. The result is multiple linear fractures particularly in the weak areas of the skull base resulting in multiple cranial nerve injuries.

\section*{SECONDARY BRAIN INJURY}

This results as consequence to the primary brain injury and this includes :

\section*{A. INTRACRANIAL HAEMATOMAS. Include}

\section*{1 Epidural haematoma}
-Epidural hematomas are located between the inner table of the skull and the dura. Usually due to laceration of middle meningeal artery.
-They are typically biconvex (lentiform) in shape because their outer border follows the inner table of the skull and their inner border is limited by locations at which the dura is firmly adherent to the skull.
-Up to 10\% of epidural hematomas may be venous in origin.
- In about 60 or $70 \%$ of cases there is an associated skull fracture.
-Usually located in the temporal area. Occasionally it is in the frontal, parietal or posterior fossa region.
-As it is an arterial bleed the clot can get to a significant size within a short period of time with rapid rise in the intracranial pressure. If untreated there is a high rate of morbidity and mortality but effective and early treatment can result in complete recovery. In these cases there is no diffuse brain injury and the injury is localised to the area where the fracture and the haematoma is. The aim of the management is to evacuate the clot as soon as possible and control the bleeding meningeal vessel. In most cases this is an acute condition, however occasionally the bleeding is a result of venous tear and the blood clot develops slowly. This is particularly the case in the frontal and occipital regions. The clot is evacuated through a craniotomy but in acute situations where there are no facilities for major neurosurgical procedure a burr hole should be done to release the intracranial clot and reduce the intracranial pressure. Only $1 / 3$ pts present with Classic "lucid interval," normal brain function after the insult followed by focal neurologic deficits later.

\section*{2 Subdural hematoma}

This is the result of tear in one of the bridging veins between the surface of the cortex and the dural sinuses. The blood collects gradually and slowly as the bleed is of venous origin. Their outer edge is convex, while their inner border is usually irregularly concave. Subdural hematomas are not limited by the intracranial suture lines; this is an important feature that aids in their differentiation from epidural hematomas.

\section*{Acute subdural haematomas}

Are rare in children. Subdural hematomas are more common in alcoholics and patients $>50 \mathrm{yr}$, in whom the head injury may have been relatively trivial, even forgotten. As the brain atrophies over time, the bridging veins become more exposed and, as a result, are more easily injured.These haematomas are usually a part of severe and diffuse brain injury. It causes significant morbidity and mortality because of associated diffuse brain injury. Causes increased ICP with transtentorail or tonsilar herniation, widening pulse pressure, pupils in mid position or dilated and fixed, spastic hemiplegia with hyperreflexia, quadrispasticity, decorticate rigidity, or decerebrate rigidity (due to progressive rostral-caudal neurologic deterioration).

Chronic subdural hematomas may not produce symptoms until several weeks after trauma. Although early diagnosis (2 to 4 wk after trauma) may be suggested by delayed neurologic deterioration, later diagnosis can be overlooked because of the time lapse between trauma and the onset of symptoms and signs. Subdural hematomas are more common in alcoholics and patients > 50 yr. Increasing daily headache, fluctuating drowsiness or confusion (which may mimic early dementia), and mild-tomoderate hemiparesis are typical. In infants, chronic subdural hematomas can cause head circumference to enlarge, suggesting hydrocephalus. MRI scans are diagnostic; CT scans are less consistently

\section*{3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage}

The subarachnoid bleeding itself does not usually cause neurologic damage, but hydrocephalus and cerebral vasospasm, which are delayed complications typically seen days to weeks following subarachnoid hemorrhage, can lead to neurologic impairment. Subarachnoid hemorrhages that occur because of trauma are typically located over gyri on the convexity of the brain. The subarachnoid hemorrhages that result from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm are usually located in the subarachnoid cisterns at the base of the brain.

\section*{4.Intraventricular haemorrhage}

\section*{B. BRAIN OEDEMA}

Children are prone to develop significant oedema and this does not always occur as a result of severe head injury.
Brain edema could be localised around an area of brain damage or diffuse as seen in diffuse axonal brain injury.
Intracranial Pressure - Normal $\sim 0-10 \mathrm{mmHg}(5-18 \mathrm{cmH} 2 \mathrm{O})$ Monro-Kellie Doctrine - "The total volume of intracranial contents must remain constant" The cranial cavity normally contains a brain weighing approximately $1400 \mathrm{gm}, 75 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood, and 75 mL of CSF. Addition of a mass e.g. a haematoma results in the squeezing out of an equal volume of CSF \& venous blood to maintain the ICP. However, when this compensatory mechanism is exhausted, there is an exponential increase in ICP for even a small additional increase in the volume of the haematoma
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure $=M A P-I C P=\sim 770 \mathrm{mmHg}$
** Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) $=D B P+1 / 3$ Pulse pressure
** Pulse pressure $=S B P-D B P=\sim 50 \mathrm{mmHg}(<\sim 1 / 2 \mathrm{SBP})$ Cerebral Blood Flow - ~ 50mL/100gm of brain/minute; $<5 \mathrm{~mL} / 100 \mathrm{gm}$ of brain/minute - there is cell death or irreversible damage.

Auto regulation maintains CPP between $50-160 \mathrm{mmHg}$. $<50 \mathrm{mmHg}$, the CBF declines steeply, $\&>160 \mathrm{mmHg}$, there is passive dilatation of the cerebral vessels \& an increase in CBF

\section*{C. INFECTION}

This can occur in compound skull fractures and skull base fractures. Rhinorrhea and ottorrhea prophylactic $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ generation Cephalosporin

\section*{D. HYDROCEPHALUS}

Hydrocephalus can be caused by blockage of the ventricular system by blood clot in cases of intra-ventricular haemorrhage or due to cicatrisation and fibrosis of sub-arachnoid space or the arachnoid villi along the sagittal sinus from deposition of blood products.

\section*{E .CSF LEAK}

This is a result of skull fractures crossing the nasal sinuses. In case of ethmoid sinuses -rhinorrhea and fracture internal ear and the middle ear with rupture of tympanic membrane cause otorrhea. Often these leaks are temporary and spontaneous closure within one leak occurs. If it persists then surgical intervention should be considered.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{History}

Detail description of the event leading to injury to the head either from the relatives or from the patient.
-Aetiology-RTA, Assault, Fall, Missiles, Explosive. Detail of exact mechanism leading to head injury.
-Site of trauma, any wounds
-Any history of bleeding
-Signs of shock-diziness,confusion,sweating
-Any history of loss of consciousness
-History of headache, vomiting, Blurring of vision-increased ICP -History of otorrhea or rhinorrhea
-Any lateralizing signs-loss of power in the limbs or loss of sensation.
-History of alcohol or other drug consumption raise the risk of intracranial bleeding and cloud the mental status assessment.
-The history of previous head injuries-Premorbid illness -DM, HTN, Epilepsy

\section*{Physical examination}

Suspect significant head trauma in any traumatized patient with cranial hematomas or lacerations or with altered sensorium with or without focal neurologic findings.
Obtain complete vital signs, including core temperature.
The GCS is the mainstay for rapid neurologic assessment in acute head injury. Both initial and worst GCS post resuscitation scores have correlated significantly with 1-year outcomes following severe head injury
A. Examine the scalp carefully for evidence of trauma .Inspect the head, and palpate carefully for scalp lacerations, subgaleal hematomas, ecchymoses, and deformity. Inspect neck, chest, abdomen, back, and extremities-tenderness, pain, and deformity are often signs of associated injuries that require specific early treatment
B. Any clear fluid in the ear canal or coming from the nares must be assumed to be cerebrospinal fluid. If the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid, a dipstick glucose test will usually be positive, since
cerebrospinal fluid contains glucose and mucus does not. Falsenegative results may occur in patients with hypoglycemia. C. Blood behind the eardrum, a post auricular hematoma (Battle's sign), suggest basilar skull fracture
or bilateral circum orbital hematomas ("raccoon eyes")

\section*{Neurologic Examination}

\section*{CN Exam-Systemic exam}
-Anosmia -shearing of the olfactory nerves at the cribriform plate. If accompanied by rhinorrhea, risk of ascending meningitis. -Abnormal postresuscitation pupillary reactivity correlates with a poor 1-year outcome. A unilaterally dilated pupil with or without ipsilateral cranial nerve (CN) III paralysis may indicate impending herniation.
-CN VI palsies may indicate raised intracranial pressure. --CN VII palsy, particularly in association with decreased hearing, may indicate a fracture of the temporal bone.
-Dysphagia raises the risk of both aspiration and inadequate nutrition.
-Focal motor findings may be manifestations of a localized contusion or, more ominously, an early herniation syndrome. -Flexor or extensor posturing obviously implies extensive intracranial pathology or raised intracranial pressure. In the chronic phase, motoric manifestations typically include spasticity or, more unusually, akinesia and rigidity
-Dilated or constricted pupils-Pupillary dilatation may occur when transtentorial compression occurs and parasympathetic tone of the pupil is totally lost. Conversely, pinpoint pupils after head injury may indicate loss of sympathetic tone resulting from a lesion in the brain stem caudal to the oculomotor nuclei (eg, pontine hemorrhage).

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS IN HEAD INJURIES}

1 Plain skull x-ray
This is useful in screening head injuries. It is indicated if there is a loss of consciousness or localised contusion or swelling over the head. Plain skull x-ray shows skull fractures and intracranial air. Patients with skull fractures should be admitted to hospital for observation.
AP ,lateral and Town views-OccipitoFrontal

\section*{2 CT scan}

\section*{Indications}
a. All moderate to Severe head injury GCS below 12
b. History of loss of consciousness or decreasing level of consciousness
d. Post-traumatic seizure
c. Lateralizing signs-weakness of limb or un reactive pupil
f. Type of injury-Penetrating injury Or Skull fractures
h. Otorrhea and rhinorrhea

\section*{3. MRI}

This examination is useful to show long term effects of head injury. Depending on the availability it also could be used in investigating acute cases.

\section*{4. Beta transferrin}

This is a test for an enzyme which is only found in CSF. It is the optimum test for CSF leak.

\section*{Other Important Baseline Tests}
1.PCV
2.Urea and electrolytes
3.Arterial blood gases
4.Blood alcohol level
5.Random blood glucose

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{INITIAL MANAGEMENT-Primary Survey}
$1^{\text {st }}$ is $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{D}$ of resuscitation plus vital signs

\section*{1. Airway and cervical spine.}

Maintain cervical spine immobilization in all unconscious or symptomatic (neck pain or tenderness) patients.
i)-Inspect mouth remove debris by sweeping through
ii)Chin lift/jaw thrust (tongue is attached to the jaw) and always airway in tongue falling back
To perform a chin lift, place two fingers under the mandible and gently lift upward to bring the chin anterior. During this manoeuvre, be careful not to hyperextend the neck. Care should be given to neck stabilization, if appropriate.
The jaw thrust is performed by manually elevating the angles of the mandible to obtain the same effect.
iii) Guedel airway/nasopharyngeal airway to secure airway.

Insert the oral airway into the mouth behind the tongue; it is usually inserted upside down until the palate is encountered and is then rotated 180 degrees.
iv) Intubations; keep the neck immobilized in neutral position.

Intubate all unconscious patients (GCS < 9) to secure airway. Use sedation and short acting neuromuscular blockade if necessary. If not possible
v)Tracheostomy
vii)cricothyrotomy

\section*{2. Breathing: Oxygenation and ventilation.}

LOOK OUT for the five major problems that may impair breathing -ie
6. Tension pneumothorax-put through a needle
7. Massive pneumothorax-chest tubes insertion
8. Sucking wounds-strap the open wound
9. Flail chest-positive pressure ventilation
10. Cardiac tamponade
6. Airway obstruction

1 Inspect (LOOK)
Inspection of respiratory rate is essential. Are any of the following present?
- Cyanosis
-Any signs of respiratory distress- Use of accessory muscles, flaring of alae nasae, subcostal recession
-Inspect Chest- movements, Penetrating injury, Presence of flail chest, Sucking chest wounds
2 Palpate (FEEL)
-Tracheal shift
-Broken ribs
-Subcutaneous emphysema.
-Chest expansion
3.Percussion

For dullness is useful for diagnosis of haemothorax and pneumothorax.
4 Auscultate (LISTEN)
-Pneumothorax (decreased breath sounds on site of injury)
-Detection of abnormal sounds in the chest.
If available, maintain the patient on oxygen until complete stabilization is achieved
-If a you suspect a tension pneumothorax, introduce a large-bore needle into the pleural cavity through the second intercostal space, mid clavicular line, to decompress the tension and allow time for the placement of an intercostal tube
- If intubation in one or two attempts is not possible, a cricothyroidotomy should be considered a priority

\section*{3. Circulation and arrest of bleeding.}
"Shock" is defined as inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. In the trauma patient, it is most often due to haemorrhage and hypovolaemia.
The diagnosis of shock is based on clinical findings:
1) Hypotension
2) Hypothermia
3) Tachycardia
4) Tachypnoea
5) Cool extremities
6) Decreased capillary refill
7) Pallor
8) Decreased urine production

Haemorrhagic (hypovolaemic)
Shock is due to acute loss of blood or fluids. The amount of blood loss after trauma is often poorly assessed and in blunt trauma is usually underestimated. Remember:
-Large volumes of blood may be hidden in the abdominal and pleural cavity
-Femoral shaft fracture may lose up to 2 litres of blood
-Pelvic fracture often loses in excess of 2 litres of blood.
Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate heart function. This may result from
-Myocardial contusion (bruising)
-Cardiac tamponade
-Tension pneumothorax (preventing blood returning to heart)-
- Penetrating wound of the heart
-Myocardial infarction.
Assessment of the jugular venous pressure is essential in these circumstances and an ECG should be recorded, if available.
Neurogenic shock
Is due to the loss of sympathetic tone, usually resulting
from spinal cord injury. The classical presentation is hypotension without reflex tachycardia or skin vasoconstriction.
Septic shock
Is rare in the early phase of trauma, but is a common cause of late death (via multi-organ failure) in the weeks following injury. It is most commonly seen in penetrating abdominal injury and burns patients.

\section*{Resuscitation}
-First priority is to stop any obvious bleeding by Sub fascial gauze pack placement and Manual compression on the proximal artery. Carefully applied compressive dressing of the entire injured limb can be done.Then
-Vascular access 2 large bore size 16 on the 2-basilic veins Fluids: infuse $0.9 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ initially 2 L to run as fact as possible through 2 large bore IV lines in the antecubital fossa then reassess
Resuscitation action
-Insert an intercostal drainage tube as a matter of priority, and before chest X-ray if respiratory distress exists, to drain the chest pleura of air and blood
-When indications for intubation exist but the trachea cannot be intubated, consider using a laryngeal mask airway or direct access via a cricothyroidotomy.
-Resuscitate to goal of mean arterial pressure (MAP) $>90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ to maintain a presumptive cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) $>70$ 80 mmHg
-Urinary catheter insertion and monitor the input and output chart at least $30-50 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour or $0.5 / \mathrm{kg} /$ hour of urine flow
-Asses by vital signs, pallor, sweating, anxiety ,skin warmth clammy, input and output
-Blood transfusion must be considered when the patient has persistent haemodynamic instability despite fluid (colloid/crystalloid) infusion.
If type specific or cross matched blood is not available, use group O negative packed red blood cells. Transfusion should, however, be seriously considered if the haemoglobin level is less than 7 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{dl}$ and the patient is still bleeding.

\section*{4.Neurological dysfuction}
