\section*{VOLVULUS OF THE CAECUM}
-Caecal volvulus is much less common than volvulus of the sigmoid colon, accounting for $33 \%$ compared to sidmoid $65 \%$ of large bowel obstruction.
-It carries a mortality of 20 per cent. In this condition the caecum remains mobile and shares a common mesentery with the ileum. -It is therefore free to rotate, usually clockwise, out of the right iliac fossa to the mid- or left side of the upper abdomen, producing a closed loop obstruction of the ascending colon and distal ileum.

\section*{Presentation and clinical features}
-Caecal volvulus may present as a fulminant condition with intestinal strangulation secondary to mesenteric torsion or, less dramatically, with features of intestinal obstruction. Rarely it is a chronic intermittent condition. The peak age of presentation is 30 to 40 years of much younger than that for sigmoid volvulus, and it is more common in females. There often appear to have been a triggering event, such as a recent laparotomy and it is well recognized following gynaecological procedures.
Occasionally it can occur secondary to an obstructing colonic carcinoma and, like sigmoid volvulus, it may be related to a high fibre intake.
The presenting symptoms are usually non-specific. Abdominal pain is almost invariably present and nausea, vomiting, constipation, and distension will occur in about one-third of patients. In thin patients it may be possible to palpate the resonant distended caecum in the central or upper abdomen while the right iliac fossa is empty.

\section*{Radiology}

The key to the diagnosis of caecal volvulus, as with sigmoid volvulus, is the plain abdominal radiograph. The caecum typically assumes a gas-filled comma shaped facing inferiorly and to the right.
Other radiological appearances are of non-specific colonic obstruction or of small bowel obstruction.
A barium enema may be useful to exclude any other predisposing colonic lesion and on occasions it has been effective in reducing the volvulus.

\section*{Treatment}

The mainstay of treatment for this condition is surgery and, unlike sigmoid volvulus, endoscopic deflation has little place. Prompt caecal resection is mandatory in those with caecal perforation or infarction and this is usually possible with a primary ileocaecal anastomosis.
In severely ill patients, however, it may be expedient to exteriorize the proximal and distal bowel ends following resection, as an ileostomy and mucous fistula. These can then be anastomosed at a second operation 6 weeks later. The mortality in patients with gangrenous bowel is as high as 40 per cent.

\section*{SNAKE BITES}

At presentation of casualty $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$ of resuscitation ,some of the venomous snakes can complicate with hemorrhagic shock,cardiotoxicity

\section*{Secondary survey}

1-History of the snake bites and if possible establishes whether it was venomous or not.
2-Examination of the wound inflicted can give indication whether the snake was venomous or not. Nonvenomous snakes do not produce fang marks, but rather rows of tiny puncture wounds or scratches.
3-Removal of any tight clothing on the limb or tourniquet that had been applied.
4- Obtain IV access in the non-affected limb and keep on IV fluids
5-Take vital signs continuously monitor
6-Clean the bitten part and irrigate with copious amounts of water.
7-Elevate the limb as much as possible.
8-Provide analgesia
9-Administer tetanus toxoids
10-Give prophylactic antibiotics
11-Measure circumference of the bitten part at several levels, comparing these with similar measurements carried out once on the unaffected side.
-Monitor for any continued swelling.
12-If anti venom available this can be given in the IV fluid infusion and run slowly looking out for any allergic reactions.
13-If there is continued swelling of the limb even with elevation, then fasciotomy may be necessary to prevent occurrence of compartment syndrome.

\section*{Initial investigations}
1.Full blood count-Hb ,can draw blood for GXM
2.LFT-Liver transaminases ,serum bilirubin
3.Urea,electrolyte and creatinine

Urinalysis-protenuria and hematuria
4.Creatine kinase
5.Coagulation profile- platelet count, clotting time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level
6. ECG studies.

Manage any complications as appropriate:
Abnormal coagulation profile-Fresh frozen plasma transfusion.
Hemolytic anemia-Whole blood transfusion
Shock-IV fluid-crystalloids and Colloids

\section*{SPINAL DYSRAPHISM/SPINA BIFIDA}
-Spectrum of abnormalities of development of spinal vertebrae and the spinal cord, ranging from the absence of a single vertebral spinous process to craniospinal rachischisis (failure of neural tube closure incompatible with life)
-All of these conditions have in common a failure of the bony spinal column to close fully, defining bifid spine. The frequent associated defects include:

\section*{A.Spina bifida occulta}
-Usually an incidental radiographic diagnosis representing incomplete closure of the posterior laminar arches without involvement of the nervous tissue.
-Affects about 30 per cent of the population.

\section*{B.Occult spinal dysraphism}
-The bony anomaly is associated with a number of abnormalities within the spinal canal. These include
a) Thick filum terminale
b) Intradural epidermoid and dermoid cysts
c) Intradural lipoma (lipomyelomeningocele)
d) Teratoma
e) Dias-temato-myelia (local midline splitting of the spinal cord with interruption by a midline bony or fibrous peg)
f) Combination of abnormalities.
-Intradural pathology causing a tethered spinal cord is often associated with some type of overlying skin abnormality, such as hyperpigmentation, dermal sinus tract, or a hairy patch.
-There are generally no other associated central nervous system anomalies (such as hydrocephalus or the Chiari malformation) in occult spinal dysraphism. The spinal cord is usually normal except in relationship to the distal tethering(diastematomyelia)

\section*{C.Open neural tube defects}

Spina bifida cystica- protrusion of a sac through the defect in the posterior lamina of the vertebral column.This sac can contain meninges or meninges plus neural tissue. Thus
i) Meningoceles, where there is a cystic outpouching of rudimentary meninges with an underlying intact spinal cord ii) Myelomeningocele, where the malformed neural tube is present at the base of or within the cyst.
iii) Myelorachis-chisis, where the malformed neural tube is splayed over a number of spinal segments, without meningeal or skin coverage.

\section*{Incidence and epidemiology}
-Incidental spinal bifida occulta is found in up to 30 per cent of the general population and has no clinical significance.
-The incidence of occult spinal dysraphism is unknown; however, its clinical presentation as the tethered spinal cord syndrome is uncommon
-The incidence of myelomeningocele is approximately 1 per 1000 live births.
Sex
-Higher incidence in females.(menigomyeloceles)

\section*{Risk factors}
-Largely unknown
-However it tends to occur in families
-General population risk of myelomeningocele is $0.1 \%$ but previous child with the defect risk is $5 \%$.
-Environmental factors- intake of drugs during pregnancy as well as radiation exposure early in pregnancy may play a role. Thus
1.1st trimester valproic acid and derivatives (valproate sodium) use
2. previous children with spina bifida or close relative born with the defect
3.Insufficient maternal levels of folic acid

However greater than $\mathbf{9 0}$ \% of spina bifida infants there no above risk factors thus sporadic.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

The symptoms associated with dysraphism vary with the degree of malformation of the underlying neural tissue. Spinal bifida occulta
-Frequently seen as an incidental finding on routine spine radiographs, most commonly at the L5 and S1 levels.
-In itself, it is of no neurological significance.
-When it is associated with overlying skin abnormalities, especially hypertrichosis, cutaneous haemangiomas, lipomas, or a sinus tract, an occult intraspinal lesion should be suspected.

Occult spinal dysraphism
-These abnormalities may be noted at birth or during childhood, with the overlying skin abnormalities above Patient may be asymptomatic for many years. Some of these children (and, occasionally, adults) develop a progressive neurological deficit involving the lumbosacral roots-the tethered cord syndrome. This appears as bowel or bladder difficulty, foot or leg weakness muscle atrophy, sensory loss, pes cavus and scoliosis.

\section*{Open neural tube defects}
-Present at birth, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1000 live births, although this shows regional variation.
-An infant with a meningocele is usually neurologically normal
-In myelomeningocele neurological deficits are present at birth, these deficits become more severe as more of the placode becomes involved.
-These lesions are most common in the lumbosacral area, causing abnormalities of bowel and bladder function, as well as variable degrees of leg weakness and sensory loss.
-Lesions higher in the spinal cord will be accompanied by relatively more severe deficits.
-In addition to the local neurological deficits, affected infants are at risk of meningitis precipitated by contamination of cerebrospinal fluid from incompetent dura.
NB Spina bifida is most common in the lower thoracic, lumbar, or sacral region and usually extends for 3 to 6 vertebral segments.

\section*{Associated abnormalities of spinal bifida}
A)Brain anomalies associated with myelomeningocele include
- Hydrocephalus-Chiari and other intracranial malformations - 80 per cent of infants with myelomeningoceles have hydrocephalus
- Agenesis of the corpus callosum
- Lobar agenesis
- Polymicrogyria
- Rim-cortex (holoprosencephaly)
- Intracranial cysts and lipomas
- Encephaloceles.
B)Musculoskeletal
- Hip dislocations
- Club feet
- Kyphoscoliosis
- Rib cage anomalies
C)Genitourinary
- Hydronephrosis
- Hydroureters
- Horse shoe kidneys
- Un-descended testis
D)Cardiopulmonary
- VSD,ASD
c)Gastrointestinal systems
- Malrotations
- Emphaloceles
- Merckels diverticulum
-The likelihood of associated somatic anomalies increases with the severity of the neural tube defect; however, on average a child can be expected to have more than one abnormality.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Prenatal}
-Family history of spina bifida is an indication for further evaluation of an unborn child. This by:
- Antenatal ultrasonography
- Maternal serum and amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels measurements.
-An open spinal column or a meningocele sac are readily apparent on an obstetrical ultrasound examination. --Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels can be associated with myelomeningocele and should prompt a close ultrasonographic examination.
Counselling the parents of a spina bifida child is of the utmost importance, particularly when the diagnosis is made antepartum. Open discussion of possible outcome with option for abortion should be carried out.

\section*{Post natal}

\section*{Evaluation of spina bifida}
1. Spinal x-ray
2. spinal MRI

\section*{Other abnormalities}
1.Plain x-ray and CT scan of the head to evaluate for hydrocephalus ,Chiari malformations and other associated cerebral malformations eg encephaloceles Ultrasonography has role in evaluation of hydrocephalus in cases with open fontanels.

\section*{Urinary system}
1.Abdominal ultrasound-also evaluate GIT anomalies
2.IVU
3.BUN and creatinine
-urinalysis, urine culture may be done for evaluation of UTI

\section*{Cardiac}

Echocardiography

\section*{Musculoskeletal}

Image the area affected Hip x-ray, foot x-ray

\section*{Complications}
1. If not well covered with skin, the sac can easily rupture, increasing the risk of meningitis.
2. When the spinal cord or lumbosacral nerve roots are involved, as is usual, varying degrees of paralysis occur below the involved level.
Since this paralysis occurs in the fetus, congenital orthopedic problems can present at birth (eg, clubfoot, arthrogryposis, dislocated hip). The paralysis usually affects bladder and rectal functions, and the resulting GU disorder can eventually lead to severely damaged kidneys.
3. Kyphosis, sometimes associated with spina bifida, can hinder surgical closure and prevent the patient from lying supine.
4. Hydrocephalus occurs commonly and may be related to aqueductal stenosis or an Arnold-Chiari malformation.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Treatment}

Spina bifida oculta
Has no neurological implications and re-assuarnce and councelling of the patients.

\section*{Occult spinal dysraphism}

Patients presenting with progressive deterioration of neurological function then immediate complete evaluation of the spine and surgery to decompress or release the tethered cord is indicated. Midline cutaneous stigmata require complete evaluation and the presence of occult dysraphism require planning for surgery even if no neurological signs are present

Myelomengingocele
Requires multidisciplinary approach with specialists from several disciplines.
Initially important are
- Neurosurgical
- Urologic
- Orthopedic
- Pediatric
- social service evaluations.
-Thorough evaluation of the infant and counseling of the family should generally precede intervention.
-It is important to assess the type, level, and extent of the lesion; the infant's general health status and associated deficits; the family's strengths, desires, and resources; and the community resources, including ongoing care.
Once evaluation is complete, a decision can be made on how aggressive treatment should be.
If the defect is leaking CSF, antibiotics and urgent neurosurgical evaluation and repair will reduce the risk of meningeal or ventricular infection.
However with already manifest neurological deficit with good skin cover then early surgery does not improve the function but its only for cosmetic function. Parents should be counseled about this.
With compromised urinary and fecal continence then at point of repair of bony defect then urine ad feccal diversion procedures could be attempted. Fecal incontinence may necessitate the fashioning of permanent colostomy.
Other congenital anomaly-interval management as appropriate.
Hydrocephalus may require a shunt procedure

Hdronephrosis-nephrostomy may be done to preserve the existing parenchymal tissue. Kidney function must be followed closely, and UTI should be treated promptly.

Obstructive uropathy at either the bladder outlet or ureteral level must be treated vigorously, especially when infection occurs.

Orthopedic care should begin early. If a clubfoot is present,serial casting should start birth .The hip joints should be checked closely for dislocation. Other continuing orthopedic concerns are scoliosis, pathologic fractures, development of pressure sores, and muscle weakness and spasm, which may cause further deformities.

\section*{SPINAL INJURY}

\section*{Definition}

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an insult to the spinal cord resulting in a change, either temporary or permanent, in its normal motor, sensory, or autonomic function

\section*{Background}

Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) usually have permanent and often devastating neurologic deficits and disability.
The goals for the emergency physician are to
1.Establish the diagnosis
2.Initiate treatment to prevent further neurologic injury from either pathologic motion of the injured vertebrae or secondary injury from the deleterious effects of cardiovascular instability or respiratory insufficiency

\section*{Pathophysiology}

\section*{Anatomy}

The spinal cord is divided into 31 segments, each with a pair of anterior (motor) and dorsal (sensory) spinal nerve roots. On each side, the anterior and dorsal nerve roots combine to form the spinal nerve as it exits from the vertebral column through the neuroforamina.
Spinal cord ends at lower margin of the L1 vertebral body. Thereafter, the spinal canal contains the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spinal nerves that comprise the cauda equina.
Therefore, injuries below L1 are not considered SCIs because they involve the segmental spinal nerves and/or cauda equine.
The spinal cord organized into a series of tracts or neuropathways that carry motor (descending) and sensory (ascending) pathways.
The corticospinal tracts are descending motor pathways located anteriorly within the spinal cord. Axons extend from the cerebral cortex in the brain as far as the corresponding segment, where they form synapses with motor neurons in the anterior (ventral) horn. They decussate (cross over) in the medulla prior to entering the spinal cord.
The dorsal columns are ascending sensory tracts that transmit light touch, proprioception, and vibration information to the sensory cortex. They do not decussate until they reach the medulla.
The lateral spinothalamic tracts transmit pain and temperature sensation. These tracts usually decussate within 3 segments of their origin as they ascend.
The anterior spinothalamic tract transmits light touch.
Autonomic function traverses within the anterior interomedial tract.
Sympathetic nervous system fibers exit the spinal cord between C7 and L1, while parasympathetic system pathways exit between S2 and S4.

\section*{Injury manifestation}
-Injury to the corticospinal tract or dorsal columns, respectively, results in ipsilateral paralysis or loss of sensation of light touch, proprioception, and vibration. -------injury to the lateral spinothalamic tract causes contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation
-Anterior cord injury causes paralysis and incomplete loss of light touch sensation (anterior spinothalamic spared.)
-Spinal shock is defined as the complete loss of all neurologic function, including reflexes and rectal tone, below a specific level that is associated with autonomic dysfunction.
-Autonomic function is transmitted in the anterior interomedial tract. Progressively higher spinal cord lesions or injury causes increasing degrees of autonomic dysfunction(lower exit of roots -Neurogenic shock refers to the hemodynamic triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and peripheral vasodilation resulting from autonomic dysfunction and the interruption of sympathetic nervous system control in acute SCI. It does not usually occur with SCI below the level of T6.

\section*{Blood supply}
-The blood supply of the spinal cord consists of 1 anterior and 2 posterior spinal arteries.
-The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two thirds of the cord. injury to this vessel results in dysfunction of the corticospinal, lateral spinothalamic, and autonomic interomedial pathways.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome involves paraplegia, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and autonomic dysfunction. -The posterior spinal arteries primarily supply the dorsal columns. -The anterior and posterior spinal arteries arise from the vertebral arteries in the neck and descend from the base of the skull. Various radicular arteries branch off the thoracic and abdominal aorta to provide collateral flow
-At any given level of the spinal cord, the central part is a watershed area. Cervical hyperextension injuries may cause ischemic injury to the central part of the cord, causing a central cord syndrome.

\section*{Etiology}

SCIs may be primary or secondary.

\section*{Primary SCIs}

Arise due to direct effect of the trauma on the spine.
This follows compression or severe angulation of the vertebral spine.
This leads to mechanical disruption, transection, or distraction of neural elements. This injury usually occurs with fracture and/or dislocation of the spine.
However, primary SCI may occur in the absence of spinal fracture or dislocation just by severe distraction thus the term SCIWORA (spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality) Penetrating injuries due to bullets or weapons may also cause primary SCI. More commonly, displaced bony fragments cause penetrating spinal cord and/or segmental spinal nerve injuries. Extradural pathology may also cause a primary SCI. Spinal epidural hematomas or abscesses cause acute cord compression and injury.
Spinal cord compression from metastatic disease is a common oncologic emergency.

\section*{Secondary SCI's}
-Vascular injury to the spinal cord caused by arterial disruption, arterial thrombosis, or hypoperfusion due to shock are the major causes of secondary SCI.
-Anoxic or hypoxic effects compound the extent of SCI.
-Movement around unstable spinal column causing further injury

\section*{Spinal cord injuries syndromes}
1. Complete cord injury complete loss of motor and sensory function below the level of the traumatic lesion.
2. Incomplete cord injury partial loss of sensory and/or motor function below the level of injury.
The incomplete SCI syndromes are further characterized clinically as follows:
a) Anterior cord syndrome involves variable loss of motor function and pain and/or temperature sensation, with preservation of proprioception.
B) Brown-Séquard syndrome(hemi-section cord) ipsilateral loss of proprioception and motor function, with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.
c) Central cord syndrome usually involves a cervical lesion, with greater motor weakness in the upper extremities than in the lower extremities.
The pattern of motor weakness shows greater distal involvement in the affected extremity than proximal muscle weakness.
Sensory loss is variable, and the patient is more likely to lose pain and/or temperature sensation than proprioception and/or vibration.
Dysesthesias, especially those in the upper extremities (eg, sensation of burning in the hands or arms), are common. Sacral sensory sparing usually exists.
d) Conus medullaris syndrome is a sacral cord injury with or without involvement of the lumbar nerve roots. This syndrome is characterized by areflexia in the bladder, bowel, and to a lesser degree, lower limbs. Motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs is variable.
e) Cauda equina syndrome involves injury to the lumbosacral nerve roots and is characterized by an areflexic bowel and/or bladder, with variable motor and sensory loss in the lower limbs. Because this syndrome is a nerve root injury rather than a true SCI, the affected limbs are areflexic. This injury is usually caused by a central lumbar disk herniation.
A spinal cord concussion is characterized by a transient neurologic deficit localized to the spinal cord that fully recovers without any apparent structural damage.

\section*{Spinal shock}
-Spinal shock is a state of transient physiological (rather than anatomical) reflex depression of cord function below the level of injury with associated loss of all sensorimotor functions. Present with:
1.Hypotension
2.Hypothermia
3.Bradycardia
4.Flaccid paralysis
5.Loss of sensation
6.Areflexia or depressed reflexes
7.Urinary and bladder incontinence.
8. Sweating .
9.Sometimes sustained priapism develops.

These symptoms tend to last $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$. Until the return of the bulbocarvenosus reflex and the anal wink. The diagnosis of complete spinal cord injury cannot be made until the period of spinal shock is over, as evidenced by the return of the bulbocavernosus reflex. To elicit this reflex, the clinician digitally examines the patient's rectum, feeling for contraction of the anal sphincter while squeezing the glans penis or clitoris.

Sex:
The male-to-female ratio is approximately 2.5-3.0:1.

\section*{Age:}

About $80 \%$ of males with SCIs are aged $18-25$ years. SCIWORA occurs primarily in children.

\section*{Motor testing for spinal level:}
- C5 - Elbow flexors (biceps, brachialis) and shoulder abduction

- S3 - Ischial tuberosity
- S4-5-Perianal area (taken as one level.

Neurogenic shock Neurogenic shock is manifested by the triad of hypotension, bradycardia, and hypothermia. Shock tends to occur more commonly in injuries above T6, secondary to the disruption of the sympathetic outflow from T1-L2 and to unopposed vagal tone, leading to decrease in vascular resistance with associated vascular dilatation. Neurogenic shock needs to be differentiated from spinal and hypovolemic shock. Hypovolemic shock tends to be associated with tachycardia

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{History}
-Ascertaining the mechanism of injury is also important in identifying the potential for spinal injury.Fall with neck hyperextension/flexion, back trauma etc.
-Symptoms related to the vertebral column (most commonly pain) and any motor or sensory deficits.
-Hemorrhagic shock may be difficult to diagnose because the clinical findings may be affected by autonomic dysfunction.. -To distinguish hemorrhagic shock from neurogenic shock: Neurogenic shock occurs only in the presence of acute SCI above T6. Hypotension and/or shock with acute SCI at or below T6 are caused by hemorrhage.

\section*{Physical exam:}
-As with all trauma patients, initial clinical evaluation begins with a primary survey.-ABCDE.An SCI must be considered concurrently. Spinal exam should involve:
a)Pulmonary function - respiratory rate, cyanosis, respiratory distress, air entry bilaterally, added sounds, chest wall expansion, abdominal wall movement, cough, and chest wall and/or pulmonary injuries. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and pulse oximetry
Respiratory dysfunction is ultimately dependent on preexisting pulmonary comorbidity, the level of SCI, and any associated chest wall or lung injury. Any or all of the following determinants of pulmonary function may be impaired in the setting of SCI:
1.Loss of ventilatory muscle function from denervation and/or associated chest wall injury
2.Lung injury, such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pulmonary contusion
3.Decreased central ventilatory drive that is associated with head injury or exogenous effects of alcohol and drugs.
b)CVS-Pulse rate and volume, BP (hemorrhagic or neurogenic shock
c)Temperature-Hypothermia-spinal shock
d)Thorough Neurological Examination

Spinal level or decide whether complete or incomplete injury
Motor exam-Bulk, Tone, Power, Reflexes, Co-ordination In all patients, assessment of deep tendon reflexes and perineal evaluation is critical. The presence or absence of sacral sparing is a key prognostic indicator.
The sacral roots may be evaluated by documenting the following:
-Perineal sensation to light touch and pinprick
-Bulbocavernous reflex (S3 or S4)
-Anal wink (S5)
-Rectal tone
-Urine retention or incontinence
-Priapism
Sensory testing-pain,tempetature,crude and fine touch and proprieception.
Neurologic level of injury - Most caudal level at which both motor and sensory levels are intact, with motor level as defined above and sensory level defined by a sensory score of 2
Sensory level - Most caudal dermatome with a normal score of 2/2 for both pinprick and light touch

Motor level - Determined by the most caudal key muscles that have muscle strength of 3 or above while the segment above is normal (= 5)

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1.Hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels may be measured initially and monitored serially to detect or monitor sources of blood loss.
2.Perform urinalysis to detect associated genitourinary injury

Imaging
Plain x-Ray
-The standard 3 views of the cervical spine are recommended: 1.Anteroposterior
2.Lateral view
3.Odontoid view-open mouth x-ray

Other oblique views include depressed shoulder view
-Anteroposterior and lateral views of the thoracic and lumbar spine are recommended.
-The cervical spine radiographs must include the C7-T1 junction to be considered adequate

\section*{CT Scan}

CT scanning is reserved for delineating bony abnormalities or fracture.

\section*{MRI}

MRI is best for suspected spinal cord lesions, ligamentous injuries, or other nonosseous conditions.
MRI may be used to evaluate nonosseous lesions, such as extradural spinal hematoma; abscess or tumor; and spinal cord hemorrhage, contusion, and/or edema.

\section*{Motor strengths and sensory testing}

The extent of injury is defined by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (modified from the Frankel classification), using the following categories:
A - Complete: No sensory or motor function is preserved in sacral segments S4-S5.
B - Incomplete: Sensory, but not motor, function is preserved below the neurologic level and extends through sacral segments S4-S5.
C - Incomplete: Motor function is preserved below the neurologic level, and most key muscles below the neurologic level have muscle grade less than 3 .
D - Incomplete: Motor function is preserved below the neurologic level, and most key muscles below the neurologic level have muscle grade greater than or equal to 3 .
E - Normal: Sensory and motor functions are normal.

\section*{MANAGEMENT Starts at the site of injury follow: Principles of management}
1. The injury must be recognized.
2. Measures to prevent further damage ("secondary" injury) and to detect deteriorating neurologic function so that corrective measures can be taken.
3. The patient must be maintained in optimal condition to allow the greatest possible nervous system repair and recovery.
4. Evaluation and rehabilitation of the patient must be actively pursued to maximize the function of surviving but dysfunctional nervous tissue

\section*{Pre-hospital}
-ABC of resuscitation
-stabilize and immobilize the spine thus cervical collum and transport patient on hard board.
Transportation can by ambulances in short distances but if possible air lift is better to avoid movements that would interfere with splinting.

\section*{Casualty}
-Keep the cervical collar and patient on the backboard
-Resuscitation following ABCDE should be done. Airway
Securing the airway while keeping the cervical column in place may be challenging
-The cervical spine must be maintained in neutral alignment at all times. Clearing of oral secretions and/or debris is essential to maintain airway patency and to prevent aspiration. The modified jaw thrust and insertion of an oral airway may be all that is required to maintain an airway in some cases. However, intubation may be required in others.

\section*{Breathing}

Management for pulmonary complications and/or injury in patients with SCI includes supplementary oxygen for all patients and chest tube thoracostomy for those with pneumothorax and/or hemothorax

\section*{Circulation}
-Hypotension may be hemorrhagic and/or neurogenic in acute SCI. This should be urgently corrected to prevent secondary SCI Judicious fluid replacement with isotonic crystalloid solution to a maximum of 2 liters is the initial treatment of choice. Overzealous crystalloid administration may cause pulmonary edema because these patients are at risk for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Adequate perfusion with the following parameters should be maintained
- Systolic blood pressure (BP) should be $90-100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Systolic.
- Heart rate should be $60-100$ beats per minute in normal sinus rhythm. Hemodynamically significant bradycardia may be treated with atropine.
- Urine output should be more than $30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$. Placement of a Foley catheter to monitor urine output is essential
- Prevent hypothermia.

NB Associated head injury occurs in about $25 \%$ of SCI patients. A careful neurologic assessment for associated head injury is compulsory

\section*{In patient management involves-}
1.Prevention of secondary injury-splints, corticosteroid, oxygen
2.Analgesia
3.Bladder care-Condom catheter
4.Bowel care
5.Skin care
6.Physiotherapy chest and limbs

\section*{1)Spilnts}

Optimal immobilization is obtained by placing the patient supine (face up) on a firm, flat surface (eg, rigid, long spine board) without a pillow and with lateral motion of the neck restricted by a rigid cervical collar (Philadelphia), lateral neck rolls connected
with tape across the forehead, or traction. Traction is the most effective method .
-Skull traction with a $3-\mathrm{kg}(7-\mathrm{lb})$ weight on a rope off the end of the bed provides the best means of emergency splinting and traction.
-Thoracolumbar orthosis TLO only used for injuries below T6,not used above T6
-Halos jacket used for cervical fractures used to hold the cervical spine and thorax
-Submental mandible occipital strut)SiMO)
-Logrolling the patient to the supine position is safe to facilitate diagnostic evaluation and treatment at least five people needed for leg rolling.

\section*{2)Steroids}
-Treat all SCI patients within 3 hours of injury with the following steroid protocol: methylprednisolone $\mathbf{3 0 ~ m g} / \mathbf{k g}$ bolus over $\mathbf{1 5}$ minutes and an infusion of methyl prednisolone at $\mathbf{5 . 4 ~ m g} / \mathbf{k g} / \mathbf{h}$ for 23 hours beginning 45 minutes after the bolus. Significant improvement in motor function and sensation in patients with complete or incomplete SCIs noted

\section*{3)Analgesics}
-Use analgesics appropriately and aggressively to maintain the patient's comfort if he or she has been lying on a hard backboard for an extended period.
Start of opiod analgesia initially then NSAIDS

\section*{4)Bladder care: Condom catheter}

Monitor input output of fluids initially. Also if loss of bladder function
5)Bowel care -Manual evacuation by sweeping thro the rectum which cause irritation or the use of enemas(warm soap enema)

\section*{6-+NG tube}
-Placement of a nasogastric tube for decompression. Ileus is common This may also be used for nutritional support.

\section*{7-Anti emetics}

Aspiration pneumonitis is a serious complication in the SCI patient with compromised respiratory function. Antiemetics should be used aggressively

\section*{8-Skin care}

Prevent pressure sores-Denervated skin is particularly prone to pressure necrosis.
-Remove belts and back pocket keys or wallets.
-Turn the patient every $1-2$ hours.
-Pad all extensor surfaces.
-Use pneumatic mattresses, continuous motion or ripple mattress.
-Good nursing care to prevent wetness-ZNO

\section*{9-Pysiotherapy-both chest and limbs}

Prevention of contractures and maintenance of range of motion are important in all patients with spinal cord injury and should begin immediately following the injury.
Chest physiotherapy to prevent pneumostatic pneumonia

\section*{SURGICAL TREATMANT}

The vertebral divided into column (Dennis)
1. Anterior column -include anterior $2 / 3$ of the body, anterior longitudinal ligament, annular ligament and nucleas polposus anterior half.
2.Middle column-posterior 1/3 of the body and PLLplus the nucleus polposus and the annular ligament upto facet joint 3.Posterior column-include lamina, the spinous process and the ligaments plus the ligamnetum flavum.
Instability after fractures occur if involvement of at least two columns or most of the anterior column

\section*{Types of fractures include.}
1.Anterior wedge fracture
2.Posterior wedge fracture
3.Burst fracture
4.Subluxation-displaced not out of articulation
5.Dislocation
6.Fracture of spinous process, pedicles, transverse process

\section*{Decompression}

Indications for decompression-If a patient has an incomplete spinal cord injury and evidence of continued neural element compression, decompression may be indicated. At the time of surgery, stabilization in the form of fusion, Often accompanied by instrumentation, may be performed.
If decompression is felt to be indicated, the surgical approach used should depend on where the compression lies. Similar neurologic outcomes have been reported with anterior decompression and posterolateral decompression. retropulsed bone can be removed or pushed back into place

\section*{Surgical stabilization}

In a patient who has a burst fracture in which the posterior elements remain intact, treatment may consist of an anterior vertebrectomy, strut grafting, and fusion without instrumentation. Such a patient can be braced post-operatively without undue risk of graft displacement or spinal instability.
Use of rods and pedicle screws
Use of cages to stabilize burst fracture

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATION}

\section*{CERVICAL INJURY}

Jefferson Injury- 4 fragment fracture of C1.due to shearing and rotation and present with neurological injury
Upper cervical fractures the spinal canal is large and accommodates rotation rarely present with neurological deficits. Management by halos jacket.
Hangman injury-hyperextension fractures of C2 pedicle plus fracture of disc between C3 and C4.
Classification
Type 1-undisplaced fracture of C2.
Type 2-displacement less than 3 cm
Type 3-displacement greater than 3 cm and C2and C3 articulation disrupted
Types 1and 2 managed by a Philadelphia collar while type 3 managed by halos jacket which prevents movement in all planes.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS of spinal injury}
1. Neurologic deterioration is the extension of the sensory deficit cephalad.
2. Pressure sores-Careful and frequent turning of the patient is required to prevent pressure sores.
3. Aspiration peumonitis-Nasogastric decompression of the stomach is mandatory.
4. Hypothermia Prevent hypothermia by using external rewarming techniques and/or warm humidified oxygen.
5.Pulmonary complications in SCI are common. Pulmonary complications are directly correlated with mortality, and both are related to the level of neurologic injury. Pulmonary complications of SCI include the following:
-Atelectasis secondary to decreased vital capacity and decreased functional residual capacity
-Ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to sympathectomy and/or adrenergic blockade
-Increased work of breathing because of decreased compliance
-Decreased coughing, which increases the risk of retained secretions, atelectasis, and pneumonia
-Muscle fatigue
6.Muscle wasting,joint stiffness and contactures

Philadelphia collar only prevents extension-flexion movement at the neck, rotational and sideway movement can occur.

\section*{SUB-ARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE}

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refers to extravasation of blood into the subarachnoid space between the pial and arachnoid membranes.
It comprises half of spontaneous atraumatic intracranial hemorrhages, the other half consist of bleeding that occurs within the brain parenchyma.
NB the most common cause of SAH is head trauma. However, the familiar medical use of the term SAH refers to nontraumatic (or spontaneous) hemorrhage, which usually occurs in the setting of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM).
Its devastating condition with high morbidity and mortality

\section*{Etiology}

Rupture of "berry," or saccular, aneurysms of the basal vessels of the brain comprises 77\% of nontraumatic SAH cases Aneurysms mostly arise from the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and from the major branches of the anterior portion of the circle of Willis.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Congenital and acquired factors are thought to play a role in occurrence of aneurysm.
Aneurysms usually occur at the branching sites on the large cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis. The early precursors of aneurysms are small outpouchings through defects in the media of the arteries.
These defects are thought to expand as a result of hydrostatic pressure from pulsatile blood flow and blood turbulence, which is greatest at the arterial bifurcations. A mature aneurysm has a paucity of media, replaced by connective tissue, and has diminished or absent elastic lamina.
The rate of rupture is directly related to the size of the aneurysm. Aneurysms with a diameter of 5 mm or less have a $2 \%$ risk of rupture, whereas $40 \%$ of those $6-10 \mathrm{~mm}$ have already ruptured upon diagnosis.
Brain injury from cerebral aneurysm formation can occur in the absence of rupture via compressive forces that cause injury to local tissues and/or compromise of distal blood supply (mass effect).
When an aneurysm ruptures, blood extravasates under arterial pressure into the subarachnoid space and quickly spreads through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spinal cord. Blood released under high pressure may directly cause damage to local tissues. Blood extravasation causes a global increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). Meningeal irritation occurs.
Congenital defects in the muscle and elastic tissue of the arterial media in the vessels. These defects lead to microaneurysmal dilatation.
Aneurysms are acquired lesions related to hemodynamic stress on the arterial walls at bifurcation points and bends.
AVMs are the second most identifiable cause of SAH, accounting for 10\% of cases of SAH

\section*{Risk factors for aneurismal SAH:}
1.Hypertension - Fibromuscular dysplasia, polycystic kidney disease, and aortic coarctation
2. Increased blood flow - Cerebral arteriovenous malformation
(AVM); persistent carotid-basilar anastomosis; ligated, aplastic, or hypoplastic contralateral vessel
3.Blood vessel disorders - Atherosclerosis ,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Moyamoya disease, and granulomatous angiitis
4.Genetic - Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome
5.Congenital - Persistent fetal circulation and hypoplastic/absent arterial circulation
6. Metastatic tumors to cerebral arteries - Atrial myxoma, choriocarcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma 7.Infectious Bacterial, fungal
Use of oral contraceptives ,Hormone replacement therapy, Hypercholesterolemia and alcohol consumtion may contribute to HTN or atherosclerosis.
.Saccular or berry aneurysms are specific to the intracranial arteries because their walls lack an external elastic lamina and contain a very thin adventitia-factors that may predispose to the formation of aneurysms. An additional feature is that they lie unsupported in the subarachnoid space.

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity:}

As many as $60 \%$ of patients die in the first 30 days as the result of SAH.

Sex: The incidence of SAH is slightly higher in women than in men.

Age: The mean age for SAH is 50 years.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History
The signs and symptoms of SAH range from subtle prodromal events, which often are misdiagnosed, to the classic presentation of catastrophic headache.
A)Sentinel, or "warning," leaks that produce minor blood leakage
Sentinel leaks produce sudden focal or generalized head pain that may be severe. In addition to headaches, sentinel leaks may produce nausea, vomiting, photophobia, malaise, or, less commonly, neck pain.Signs of raised ICP don't occur

\section*{B)Aneurysmal rapture SAH}

The classic symptoms and signs of aneurysmal rupture into the subarachnoid space comprise one of the most pathognomonic presentations in all of clinical medicine
1.A sudden onset of very severe headache, often described as the "worst headache of my life"
2.Nausea and/or vomiting
3. Symptoms of meningeal irritation, including nuchal rigidity and pain, back pain, and bilateral leg pain (but may take several hours to manifest).
4. Photophobia and visual changes are common.
5. A sudden loss of consciousness (LOC) occurs at the ictus in as many as $45 \%$ of patients as ICP exceeds cerebral perfusion pressure. LOC often is transient; however some patients are comatose for several days, depending on the location of the aneurysm and the amount of bleeding.
6. Seizures during the acute phase

\section*{c)Mass effect}

Expanding aneurysm or hemorrhage, characteristic features based upon aneurysm location. 1.Posterior communicating artery/internal carotid artery - Focal, progressive retro-orbital headaches and oculomotor nerve palsy
2.Middle cerebral artery - Contralateral face or hand paresis, aphasia (left side), contralateral visual neglect (right side)
3.Anterior communicating artery - Bilateral leg paresis and bilateral Babinski sign
4.Basilar artery apex - Vertical gaze, paresis, and coma
5.Intracranial vertebral artery/posterior inferior cerebellar artery Vertigo, components of lateral medullary syndrome.

\section*{Physical Examination}
1.Focal neurologic signs hemiparesis, aphasia, hemineglect, cranial nerve palsies, and memory loss
2. Ophthalmologic examination may reveal subhyaloid retinal hemorrhages and papilledema.
3. Blood pressure elevation is observed in about .BPoften becomes labile as ICP increases. Brabycardia may occur
4. Temperature elevation, secondary to chemical meningitis.

\section*{Hunt and Hess grading system of SAH}

Grade 1 - Asymptomatic or mild headache
Grade 2 - Moderate-to-severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and no neurological deficit other than possible cranial nerve palsy
Grade 3 - Mild alteration in mental status (confusion, lethargy), mild focal neurological deficit
Grade 4 - Stupor and/or hemi paresis
Grade 5 - Comatose and/or decerebrate

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Indications for surgical management have been described recently and include the following:
For patients with a mild- or intermediate-grade SAH (Hunt and Hess 1-3), surgical treatment (Surgical clipping) is strongly recommended because the risks of SAH complications greatly exceed the risk of surgical complications For patients with a poor grade of SAH (Hunt and Hess grades 4-
5) The overall outcome is poor, with or without surgical intervention.
Patients with a higher grade of SAH or poor medical status that do not qualify for early surgery may be candidates for delayed surgery or endovascular obliteration of the aneurysm. Other indications of surgey
- Large and giant aneurysm
- Wide-necked aneurysms
- Vessels emanating from the aneurysm dome
- Mass effect or hematoma associated with the aneurysm
- Recurrent aneurysm after coil embolization

\section*{Indications for endovascular treatment}

Endovascular treatment with the Guglielmi detachable coil system
- Patients with poor clinical grade
- Patients who are medically unstable
- In situations where aneurysm location imparts an increased surgical risk, such as cavernous sinus and many basilar tip aneurysms
- Small-neck aneurysms in the posterior fossa
- Patients with early vasospasm
- Cases where the aneurysm lacks a defined surgical neck (although these are also difficult to "coil")
- Patients with multiple aneurysms in different arterial territories if surgical risk is high

\section*{Location of aneurysm rupture}

Approximately $85 \%$ of saccular aneurysms occur in the anterior circulation. The most common sites of rupture are as follows:
-The internal carotid artery, including the posterior communicating junction (41\%)
-The anterior communicating artery/anterior cerebral artery (34\%)
-The middle cerebral artery (20\%)
-The vertebral-basilar arteries (4\%)
-Other arteries (1\%)

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1.CBC count - For evaluation of possible infection or hematologic abnormality
2.Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) - For evaluation of possible coagulopathy
3.Serum electrolytes - To establish a baseline for detection of future complications
4.Blood type and screen - In case intraoperative transfusion is required or in the setting of massive hemorrhage
5.Cardiac enzymes - For evaluation of possible myocardial ischemia
6.Arterial blood gas (ABG) - Assessment is necessary in cases with pulmonary compromise

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1. CT scan: the location of the hemorrhage and the mass effects of the hemorrhage on the ventricles.
2. LP If diagnosis not clear, do lumbar puncture after funduscopy to rule out raised ICP.
D-dimer assay: can be used to discriminate SAH from traumatic LP.
After 24 hours, CSF samples may demonstrate a polymorphonuclear and mononuclear polycytosis secondary to chemical meningitis caused by the degradation products of subarachnoid blood.
3. Cerebral angiography can provide the following important surgical information in the setting of SAH: a)Cerebrovascular anatomy
b)Aneurysm location and source of bleeding
c)Aneurysm size and shape, as well as orientation of the aneurysm dome and neck
d)Relation of the aneurysm to the parent artery and perforating arteries
e) Presence of multiple or mirror aneurysms (identically placed aneurysms in both the left and right circulations)

\section*{Other Tests}
1. Transcranial Doppler studies are useful in the detection and monitoring of arterial vasospasm.
2. Chest radiograph: All patients with SAH should have a baseline chest radiograph to serve as a reference point for evaluation of possible pulmonary complications.
3, Evaluation of ventricular wall motion via echocardiogram may be necessary in cases with suspected myocardial ischemia.
4.ECG- NonspecificST and T wave changes Decreased PR intervals, Increased QRS intervals,Increased QT intervals,Presence of U waves

\section*{Medical Management}

The initial management of patients with SAH is directed at patient stabilization. Assess the level of consciousness and airway, as well as breathing and circulation (ABCs). Endotracheal intubation should be performed for patients presenting with coma, depressed level of consciousness, inability to protect their airway, or increased ICP. Intravenous (IV) access should be obtained, including central and arterial lines. A shortacting benzodiazepine, such as midazolam, should be administered prior to all procedures

\section*{Hypertension control}

The traditional treatment of ruptured cerebral aneurysms included strict blood pressure control, with fluid restriction and antihypertensive therapy.
The current recommendations advocate the use of antihypertensive agents when the mean arterial pressure (MAP) exceeds 130 mm Hg .
Intravenous beta-blockers, which have a relatively short half-life, can be titrated easily and do not increase ICP. Beta-blockers are the agents of choice in patients without contraindications. Most clinicians avoid the use of nitrates, such as nitroprusside or nitroglycerin, which elevate ICP. Hydralazine and calcium channel blockers have a fast onset and lead to relatively less increase in ICP than do nitrates.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have a relatively slow onset and are not first-line agents in the setting of acute SAH.

\section*{Increased ICP}
1.Patients with signs of increased ICP or herniation should be intubated and hyperventilated. Minute ventilation should be titrated to achieve a $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ of $30-35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Avoid excessive hyperventilation, which may potentiate vasospasm and ischemia. 2.Osmotic agents (eg, mannitol), which can decrease ICP dramatically ( $50 \%$ after 30 min postadministration) Loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) also can decrease ICP 3.The use of IV steroids (eg, Decadron) is controversial

Additional medical management is directed to prevent and treat the following common complications of SAH:
- Rebleeding
- Vasospasm
- Hydrocephalus
- Hyponatremia
- Seizures
- Pulmonary complications
- Cardiac complications

\section*{Rebleeding}

Is the most dreaded early complication of SAH. The greatest risk of rebleeding occurs within the first 24 hours of rupture.The overall mortality rate from rebleeding is reported to be as high as 78\%.
Measures to prevent rebleeding include the following: 1.Bedrest in a quiet room
2. Analgesia, preferably with a short-acting and reversible agent such as fentanyl: Pain is associated with a transient elevation in blood pressure and increased risk of rebleeding.
3.Sedation (used with caution to avoid distorting subsequent neurologic evaluation) with a short-acting benzodiazepine such as midazolam
4.Stool softeners
5.Antifibrinolytics have been shown to reduce the occurrence of rebleeding.
However, outcome likely does not improve because of a concurrent increase in the incidence of cerebral ischemia

\section*{Cerebral vasospasm}

The delayed narrowing of the large capacitance vessels at the base of the brain, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in survivors of nontraumatic SAH.
-Vasospasm is reported to occur in as many as $70 \%$ of patients .Most commonly, this occurs 4-14 days after the hemorrhage.
-Vasospasm can lead to impaired cerebral auto regulation and may progress to cerebral ischemia and infarction. Measures used for prevention of vasospasm include the following:
1.Maintenance of normovolemia, normothermia, and normal oxygenation are paramount to vasospasm prophylaxis. Volume status should be monitored closely, with avoidance of volume contraction, which can predispose to vasospasm.
2.Prophylaxis with oral nimodipine:
-Calcium channel blockers have been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic neurological deficits, and nimodipine has been shown to improve overall outcome within 3 months of aneurysmal SAH.
-Nimodipine may prevent the ischemic complications of vasospasm by the neuroprotective effect of blockading the influx of calcium into damaged neurons.
-Should be used cautiously to avoid the deleterious effects of hypotension.
If vasospasm becomes symptomatic use of hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilutional ( HHH ) therapy.
There is demonstrated improved cerebral blood flow and resolution of the ischemic effects of vasospasm with this therapy. Initiation of HHH therapy requires placement of a pulmonary artery catheter in order to guide volume expansion and inotropic or vasopressor therapy.
This therapy should be reserved for patients with aneurysms secured by surgical clipping or endovascular techniques in order to reduce the risk of rebleeding.
Hypervolemia may be achieved by using packed erythrocytes, isotonic crystalloid, and colloid and albumin infusions in conjunction with vasopressin injection. Corticosteroids may be of some benefit; however, such treatment remains controversial.
The hematocrit should be maintained at $30-35 \%$ via hemodilution or transfusion in order to optimize blood viscosity and oxygen delivery.
Aggressive hypertensive therapy with inotropes and vasopressors (eg, dobutamine) can be initiated, if warranted

\section*{Hydrocephalus}

Acute type Occurs within the first 24 hours after hemorrhage. This condition can precipitate life-threatening brainstem compression and occlusion of blood vessels. Hydrocephalus presents as a relatively abrupt mental status change, including lethargy, stupor, or coma. CT scan differentiates hydrocephalus from rebleeding.
Treatment for acute hydrocephalus includes external ventricular drainage, depending on the severity of clinical neurologic dysfunction or CT scan findings.

Chronic hydrocephalus usually the communicating type

\section*{Hyponatremia}

Elevated levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have been implicated in recent studies of post-SAH hyponatremia. Use of slightly hypertonic sodium chloride (1.5\% sodium chloride) at rates above maintenance requirements usually is efficacious for SAH-induced hyponatremia. Avoid fluid restriction in patients with SAH .

\section*{Seizures}

Agents used for seizure prophylaxis include the following: Phenytoin, the agent of choice, can achieve rapid therapeutic concentrations when loaded intravenously, and it does not cause alterations in consciousness. Phenobarbital produces a sedative effect, which may mask the neurological evaluation; phenobarbital is used less frequently than phenytoin.

\section*{Acute pulmonary edema and hypoxia}

Are almost universal in severe SAH.
Neutrogenic in origin and unrelated to HHH therapy; however, the latter is associated with an increased risk of fluid overload. Treatment of acute pulmonary edema may include the use of gentle diuresis, dobutamine, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Cardiac dysfunction occurs in a significant number of people with SAH. Neurogenic sympathetic hyperactivity, as well as increased levels of systemic catecholamines, has been implicated in SAH-associated cardiac dysfunction. Arrhythmias occur in as many as $90 \%$ of patients and most commonly include the following
-Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs)
-Bradyarrhythmias Supraventricular tachycardia
-Arrhythmias are most prevalent in the first 48 hours following SAH. Only a small percentage of arrhythmias (usually those associated with hypokalemia) are life threatening

\section*{SUB-DURAL HAEMATOMA}

A subdural hematoma (SDH) is classified by the amount of time that has elapsed from the inciting event, if known, to the diagnosis. When the inciting event is unknown, the appearance of the hematoma on CT scan or MRI can help date the hematoma.
1. Acute SDHs are less than 72 hours old and are hyperdense compared to the brain on CT scan.
2. Subacute SDHs are 3-20 days old and are isodense or hypodense compared to the brain.
3. Chronic SDHs are older than 20 days and are hypodense compared to the brain.

An acute SDH commonly is associated with extensive primary brain injury. This diffuse parenchymal injury correlates strongly with the outcome of the patient
The presence of brain atrophy or loss of brain tissue due to any cause, such as old age, alcoholism, or stroke, provides a potential space between the dura and the brain surface for a SDH to form

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

\section*{Acute subdural hematoma}

The usual mechanism to produce an acute SDH is high-speed impact to the skull. This causes brain tissue to accelerate relative to a fixed dural structure, which, in turn, tears bridging veins. This mechanism also leads to associated contusions, brain edema, and diffuse axonal injury.
The ruptured blood vessel often is a vein connecting the cortical surface to the dural sinuses. Alternatively, a cortical vessel can be damaged by direct laceration. An acute SDH due to a ruptured cortical artery may be associated with only minor head injury, and no cerebral contusions may be associated.

\section*{Chronic subdural hematoma}

A higher incidence of chronic SDH exists in men. The male-tofemale ratio is $2: 1$. Most adults with chronic SDH are older than 50 years.
$25-50 \%$ of chronic SDH pts have no identifiable history of head trauma. If a patient does have a history of head trauma, it usually is mild.
The average time between head trauma and chronic SDH diagnosis is 4-5 weeks.

\section*{Risk factors for a chronic SDH}
1.Chronic alcoholism
2.Epilepsy
3.Coagulopathy
4.Arachnoid cysts
5.Anticoagulant therapy (including aspirin)
6.Cardiovascular disease (hypertension, arteriosclerosis),
7.Thrombocytopenia
8.Diabetes
9.Severe dehydration
10.Extremes of ages

Clinical presentation often is insidious, with symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, balance problems, cognitive dysfunction and memory loss, motor deficit (such as a hemiparesis), headache, or aphasia. Acute presentation also is possible, as in the case of a patient who presents with a seizure.

Neurologic examination may demonstrate hemiparesis, papilledema, hemianopsia, or third cranial nerve dysfunction, such as an unreactive dilated pupil or a laterally deviated eye of limited movement. In patients aged 60 years or older, hemiparesis and reflex asymmetry are common presenting signs. In patients younger than 60 years, headache is a common presenting symptom. Chronic SDHs are observed bilaterally in $8.7-32 \%$ of cases.

\section*{Indications for surgery}

Emergent surgical evacuation should occur in patients with an acute SDH larger than 5 mm in thickness (as measured by axial CT scan) and causing any neurological signs, such as lethargy, unresponsiveness (coma), or focal neurological deterioration. Surgery for chronic SDH is indicated if SDH is symptomatic or producing significant mass effect on imaging studies

\section*{Lab Studies:}
-To determine whether defective coagulation was involved in the formation of the acute SDH and to correct any coagulation abnormalities a prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and a platelet count should be performed. A bleeding time may detect platelet dysfunction. -Routine trauma lab studies that aid in the initial assessment include hemoglobin, electrolytes, and a drug/alcohol screen. Obviously, the drug and alcohol screens are important in correlating the neurological examination with the imaging studies.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
a)Computed tomography scan of the head without contrast Acute SDH appears on CT scan as a crescent-shaped hyperdense area between the inner table of the skull and the surface of the cerebral hemisphere

\section*{Medical therapy:}

\section*{Acute subdural hematoma}

Small acute SDHs less than 5 mm thick on axial CT images, without sufficient mass effect to cause midline shift or neurological signs, can be followed clinically . Hematoma resolution should be documented by serial imaging because an acute SDH that is treated conservatively can evolve into a chronic hematoma. Emergent medical treatment of an acute SDH causing impending transtentorial herniation is the bolus administration of mannitol (in the patient who is adequately fluid resuscitated with an adequate blood pressure). Surgical evacuation of the lesion is the definitive treatment and should not be delayed.

\section*{Chronic subdural hematoma}

Without mass effect on imaging studies and no neurological symptoms or signs except mild headache, a chronic SDH can be followed with serial scans and may resolve.
No medical therapy has been shown to be effective in expediting rapid resolution of acute or chronic SDHs

\section*{Surgical therapy:}

Acute subdural hematoma
Surgery for acute SDH consists of a large craniotomy (centered over the thickest portion of the clot) to decompress the brain, stop any active subdural bleeding, and evacuate any intraparenchymal hematomas in the immediate vicinity of the acute SDH.

The craniotomy exposure should include the sylvian fissure because this can be a likely source of a ruptured cortical vessel. If brain injury and edema are associated, an intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor should be placed.

\section*{Chronic subdural hematoma}

Liquefied chronic SDHs commonly can be treated with drainage through 1-2 burr holes. Burr holes are placed so that conversion to a craniotomy is possible if needed. A closed drainage system sometimes is left in the subdural space for 24-72 hours postoperatively. Small catheter drainage via twist drill craniotomy at the bedside also has been described as adequate treatment.
A nonliquified chronic SDH cannot be decompressed adequately by burr holes and must be removed by craniotomy.
Bilateral chronic hematomas must be drained from both sides, usually during the same operation through burr holes placed on each side of the head.

\section*{Preoperative details:}

Phenytoin (Dilantin) is administered to decrease the risk of developing early posttraumatic seizures (within the first 7 d after the injury). Patients have an estimated risk of greater than 20\% for developing posttraumatic epilepsy after an acute SDH. Phenytoin only should be continued for 7 days after the injury because it is not effective in preventing late posttraumatic seizures (beginning 1 wk or more after the injury).

\section*{Acute subdural hematoma}

After the evacuation of an acute SDH, medical treatment is aimed at controlling the ICP below 20 mm Hg and maintaining the cerebral perfusion pressure above $60-70 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. These parameters are vital to maintain during the perioperative period. Within 24 hours of removing an acute SDH, a follow-up CT scan should be obtained routinely

\section*{TESTICULAR TORSION}

Testicular torsion refers to twisting of the spermatic cord structures, either in the inguinal canal or just below the inguinal canal.
It is a surgical emergency because it causes strangulation of gonadal blood supply with subsequent testicular necrosis and atrophy.
Acute scrotal swelling in children and adolescent indicates torsion of the testis until proven otherwise.
Types
1. Extravaginal torsion: This type manifests in the neonatal period and most commonly develops prenatally in the spermatic cord, proximal to the attachments of the tunica vaginalis.
2.Intravaginal torsion: This type occurs within the tunica vaginalis, usually in older children.

\section*{Etiology:}

Extravaginal torsion: The testes may freely rotate prior to the development of testicular fixation via the tunica vaginalis within the scrotum.
Intravaginal torsion: Normal testicular suspension ensures firm fixation of the epididymal-testicular complex posteriorly and effectively prevents twisting of the spermatic cord. Torsion is usually spontaneous and idiopathic but some predisposing factors include:
1. Bell-clapper deformity lack of fixation posteriorly to the tunica by the testis, resulting in the testis being freely suspended within the tunica vaginalis.
2.A large mesentery between the epididymis and the testis
3. History of trauma in $20 \%$ of patients
4. 1/3 have had prior episodic testicular pain which may denote previous torsion that rotated
5. Contraction of cremasteric muscle or dartos muscles shortens the spermatic cord and may initiate testicular torsion may play a role and is stimulated by trauma, exercise, cold, sexual stimulate.
6. Cryptochirdism.
7. Testicular atrophy-post infectious or traumatic.

\section*{Age}

Tends to occur in young men-it is uncommon in men over 25 years of age and rare in men over 30 years of age. It peaks at 1418 years.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Torsion of the spermatic cord interrupts blood flow to the testis and epididymis. The thick walled arteries initially remain patent as venous congestion occur leading which lead ischemia and infarction of the testis.
The degree of torsion may vary from $180-720^{\circ}$. Increasing testicular and epididymal congestion promotes progression of torsion.
The extent and duration of torsion prominently influence both the immediate salvage rate and late testicular atrophy.
Testicular salvage most likely occurs if the duration of torsion is less than 4-6 hours. If 24 hours or more elapse, testicular necrosis develops in most patients.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

Prenatal torsion manifests as a firm, hard, scrotal mass, which does not transilluminate in an otherwise asymptomatic newborn
male. The scrotal skin characteristically fixes to the necrotic gonad

Presentation in older patients
1The sudden onset of severe testicular pain followed by inguinal and/or scrotal swelling
2.Nausea and vomiting may occur
3.Fever may occur
4.Testis may be high in scrotum with a transverse lie
5..Scrotum is enlarged, red, erythematous and echymosis may be evident
6. Absence of cremasteric reflex

\section*{Differential Diagnosis of scrotal swelling and pain.}
1.Trauma: History of injury and examination may reveal a hematoma. Urinalysis may show hematuria
2. Viral Orchitis: Mumps virus and the enteroviruses may cause acute unilateral or bilateral orchitis. In orchitis due to mumps virus, there is usually associated parotitis.
3. Urolithiasis: Rarely, patients with urolithiasis present with pain localized mainly in the scrotum; however, in most cases, back or flank pain has preceded the scrotal pain, or there is a history of nephrolithiasis. Ureteric colic radiates to the testis. .In such cases, the testicle and epididymis are normal to palpation. Hematuria is an important diagnostic clue. The diagnosis may be confirmed by excretory urography.
4. Incarcerated Hernia: Inguinal hernias incarcerated in the scrotum may cause scrotal pain that may be confused with testicular pain.
Bowel sounds are heard in the scrotum early in incarceration; if the hernia strangulates bowel sounds are no longer audible. Intestinal hernia is almost always associated with clinical findings of intestinal obstruction .Nausea, abdomian pain and vomiting. Ultrasonography is diagnostic.

\section*{5. Epididymitis, orchitis, epididymo-orchitis}
-These conditions most commonly occur from the reflux of infected urine or from sexually acquired disease caused by gonococci and Chlamydia
-Tends to occur in sexually active men over 20 of age.
-There may be a history of urinary tract infection or urethritis and urethral discharge.
-Pain begins gradually and is less severe than in testicular torsion
- Often associated with systemic signs and symptoms associated with urinary tract infection
-Patients occasionally develop these conditions following excessive straining or lifting and the reflux of urine-chemical epididymitis
-Prehn's sign may be helpful in differentiating between torsion and epididymitis: If pain is reduced when the scrotum is lifted over the symphysis pubica, the pain is due to epididymitis; if pain increases, the cause is probably torsion.
-Physical examination reveals a tender epididymis, often unilateral and often with erythema and edema of the scrotal skin. Early on, the testicle may be normal or minimally tender. Later edema and erythema worsens and becomes very tender.
-Urinalysis or microscopic examination of urethral mucus will show leukocytes in most cases of epididymitis, indicating preceding urinary tract infection or urethritis.
-A complete urological evaluation (ie, renal sonography, urodynamic study) is necessary in prepubertal boys with acute epididymitis.
Organisms in younger men-STD like-Chlamydia and gonorrhea Older men-Gram-ve organisms.
Treatment consists of bed rest, scrotal elevation, NSAIDS for pain relief and antibiotics(broad spectrum- augmented penicilins or $2^{\text {nd }}$ cepahalosporins)

\section*{6.Torsion of testicular or epididymal appendage}

This condition usually occurs in children aged 7-12 years. Systemic symptoms are rare. Usually, localized tenderness occurs but only in the upper pole of the testis.
Occasionally, the blue dot sign is present in light-skinned boys

\section*{7.Hydrocele}

Usually associated with patent processus vaginalis Painless swelling is usually present.
Scrotal contents can be visualized with transillumination.

Scrotal enlargement occurs, only rarely accompanied by pain.
Presentation is rarely acute.

\section*{Others}
9.Acute varicocele-feel like a bag of worms
10.Henoch-Schonlein purpura
11.Scrotal abscess

\section*{12.Leukemic infiltrate}

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}

To rule out differential diagnosis and confirm testicular torsion.

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1.FHG,Urinalysis and culture

If no clinical evidence of testicular torsion, a urinalysis and culture may help exclude urinary tract infection and epididymitis. If testicular torsion is clinically suggested, perform immediate surgical exploration, regardless of laboratory studies because a negative finding upon exploration of the scrotum is more acceptable than the loss of a salvageable testis.

\section*{Imaging}

Should not delay emergent surgical treatment of patients with high probability of testicular torsion (ie, patients under 18 years of age with acute unilateral testicular pain and no signs or recent history of urinary tract infection).
a) Spermatic cord block-Anesthetizing the scrotal contents will facilitate accurate examination. Inject lidocaine without epinephrine ( $2 \%$ ), $5-10 \mathrm{~mL}$, around the spermatic cord at the external inguinal ring.
b) Scrotal colour Doppler sonogram is usually diagnostic by verifying arterial flow.
c) Radionuclide scan-In epididymitis, scanning of the scrotum after intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99m sodium pertechnate reveals increased scrotal uptake on the affected side, whereas torsion shows decreased uptake.Rign or hallo sign in torsion ,only outer part is perfused inner part ischemic.
d) U/S-can differentiate between swelling of the testis and swelling of the epididymis and show if there is an incarcerated hernia. Ultrasonography can also detect the presence of varicocele and testicular cysts and masses
Aspiration of abscesses may also be done.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Emergency exploratory surgery is indicated if torsion is clinically suspected.
Even if its not torsion some relief usually come from decompression of swelling.
Salvage of testis only possible 4-6 hours after onset of torsion. -operation through the midline scrotal raphe.
-Enter the ipsilateral scrotal compartment; then, deliver and untwist the testis.
-Evaluate the testis for viability. Signs of a viable testis after detorsion include

✓ Return of color to pink
✓ Return of Doppler flow
✓ Arterial bleeding after incision of tunica albuginea.
-If the testis is not viable, remove all the necrotic testis to avoid prolonged, debilitating pain and tenderness. Retention of a necrotic testis may exacerbate the potential for subfertility, presumably because of development of an autoimmune phenomenon which also affect the contralateral testis.
-To prevent subsequent torsion, fix the contralateral testis to the scrotal wall with 3-4 non absorbable sutures. (Orchidopexy). This is also important because bilateral involvement --ie, the "bell clapper" deformity (lack of fixation of the cord structures by the testicular mediastinum) --and the high incidence of recurrent torsion and infertility in bilateral cases.

\section*{Complications}
1. Delay of more than $4-6$ hours between onset of symptoms and the time of surgical (or manual) detorsion reduces the salvage rate to $55-85 \%$.
2. Retention of an injured testis can induce pathologic changes to the contralateral testis.
3.Recurence if orchidopexy not done
4.Infertity
