\section*{ABDOMINAL WALL DEFECTS}

\section*{CONGENITAL UMBILICAL HERNIA}

\section*{Definition}
-Fascial defect at the umbilicus is frequently present in the newborn, particularly in premature infants.

\section*{Pathology}
-The defect may have invagination of the intestines or omentum with an overlying skin covering
-Its size may actually increase with increase in intra-abdominal pressure.
-Protrusion of bowel through the umbilical defect rarely results in incarceration in childhood
-most dangerous defects are less than 2 cm .

\section*{Etiology}
-Unknown

\section*{Incidence}
-Incidence thus decreases with age as the natural tendency is to close spontaneously.
-Is very common 1;1000
-Majority $.50 \%$ are small defects less than 1 cm in size-belly button umbilical hernia in those < 2years.

\section*{Race}
-The incidence is highest in blacks.

\section*{Clinical presentation}
-Most asymptomatic.
-Omentum trapped in the hernia causes reflex vomiting without intestinal obstruction.
-Classical presentation is reducing mass in the umbilical area with or without vomiting associated with intermittent abdominal pain.
-the hernia may become obstructed, strangulated and present as acute abdomen.

\section*{Course}
- In most children, the umbilical ring progressively diminishes in size and eventually closes.
- -Fascial defects less than 1 cm in diameter close spontaneously by 5 years of age in $95 \%$ of cases.
-When the fascial defect is greater than 1.5 cm in diameter, it seldom closes spontaneously.
-Surgical repair is indicated when
1) The intestine becomes incarcerated
2) Symptomatic hernia.
3) when the fascial defect is greater than 1 cm , in girls over 2 years
4) All children over 4 years of age.
5) Cosmesis
-In girls must be repaired because the defect may worsen in pregnancy.
-some patients with umbilical defects develop acquired umbilical hernia due to increase in abdominal pressure due to ascitis

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity}
-Intestinal obstruction and infection
$-2-12 \%$ recurrence after the corrective operation.

\section*{OMPHALOCELE}

\section*{Introduction}
-Omphalocele is a congenital defect of the peri-umbilical abdominal wall in which the coelomic cavity is covered only by peritoneum and amnion (membrane covering).
-There are two kinds of omphalocele: fetal and embryonic. -Fetal omphalocele is a small abdominal defect ( $<4 \mathrm{~cm}$ wide) with herniation of bowel into a sac of amnion that has the umbilical vessels located at the apex of the sac. This is due to
failure in development n the periumbilical abdominal wall after the first 8 weeks of gestation.
Other anomalies are present in less than $10 \%$ of these patients. About 15\% of congenital abdominal wall defects are fetal omphaloceles.
-Embryonic omphalocele is due to failure of abdominal wall closure in the embryonic stage of development (before the eighth week).
-It is characterized by a wide abdominal wall defect, usually greater than 4 cm in width, in which the amnion does not protrude far beyond the abdomen, and the umbilical cord joins the abdominal wall at the perimeter of the defect rather than at the apex.
-Liver as well as bowel is herniated. Multiple anomalies are present in 50\% of these cases, such as
- Congenital heart defects (20\%) (tetralogy of Fallot; atrial septal defect)
- Trisomies 21, D, and E;
- Diaphragmatic hernia
- Renal anomalies.
- Pentalogy of Cantrell -omphalocele is is epigastric in position and there is a defect in the diaphragm and pericardium, allowing pericardial herniation of bowel, a split or shortened lower sternum, ventricular septal defect, and diverticulum from the heart--and a small thorax which may result in pulmonary hypoplasia
- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, in which a midabdominal omphalocele is associated with a baby who is large for gestational age and who has macroglossia, visceromegaly of the kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas, hypoglycemia in early infancy, and a high frequency of hepatoblastoma, Wilms' tumor, or adrenocortical carcinoma; and
- Hypogastric omphalocele associated with cloacal exstrophy and spinal dysraphism.

\section*{Treatment}
-Omphaloceles with small abdominal defects can be treated by excising the omphalocele sac and reapproximating the linea alba and skin.
- Acute management of omphalocele involves covering the defect with a sterile dressing soaked with warm saline to prevent fluid loss.
- A nasogastric tube should be placed on suction to minimize intestinal distention and allow decompression
-Intravenous fluids and glucose, and antibiotics
-- A central venous catheter is required to monitor central venous pressure and blood gases in anticipation of postoperative hypovolemia from third space losses and for TPN.
-An umbilical artery catheter can be maintained without interfering with the repair.
-A bladder catheter can be used to monitor intra-abdominal pressure.
- Most large embryonic omphaloceles cannot be closed without staging the procedure which gradual reduction of the omphalocele contents into the abdominal cavity and a secondary closure.
-Without removing the amniotic sac, a silicone rubber sheet is formed into a tube (silastic silo), which is sutured to the skin at the perimeter of the omphalocele membrane.
-The silo is progressively compressed to invert the amniotic sac and its contents into the abdomen and to bring the edges of the linea alba together by stretching the abdominal wall muscles.
-This requires a number of days.
- Postoperatively, third-space fluid losses may be extensive; fluid and electrolyte therapy, therefore, must be carefully monitored.

\section*{GASTROSCHISIS}

\section*{Introduction}

Gastroschisis is a defect in the abdominal wall that usually is to the right of a normal insertion of the umbilical cord. There is no membrane or sac and no liver or spleen outside the abdomen.
-Gastroschisis is associated with no anomalies except intestinal atresia.
-The herniation is thought to occur as a rupture through an ischemic portion of the abdominal wall.
-It is probably produced by rupture of an embryonic omphalocele sac in utero.
-The remnants of the amnion are usually reabsorbed. The skin may continue to grow over the remnants of the amnion, and there may be a bridge of skin between the defect and the cord.
- The small and large bowel herniate through the abdominal wall defect.
-Having been bathed in the amnionic fluid, and with compression of the blood supply at the abdominal defect, the bowel wall has a very thick, shaggy membrane covering it.
-The loops of intestine are usually matted together, and the intestine appears to be abnormally short.
-The membrane thickens during delay in surgical closure and compromises the outcome

\section*{Complications}
-Since the bowel has not been contained intra-abdominally, the abdominal cavity fails to enlarge, and it frequently cannot accommodate the protuberant bowel.
-Over 70\% of the infants are premature, but associated anomalies occur in less than $10 \%$ of cases.
-Nonrotation of the midgut is present.
-Intestinal atresia occurs frequently, because segments of intestine that have herniated through the defect become infarcted in utero.

\section*{Treatment \& Prognosis}
-Small defects may be closed primarily after manually stretching the abdominal cavity.
-Frequently, a staged approach is required. Initially, the bowel should be covered by forming a tube from silicone-coated fabric and incorporating the protuberant bowel into the tube (silo). The end of the tube is tied off. As edema and shaggy membrane of the protuberant intestine are absorbed, the bowel will readily reduce into the abdominal cavity.
-A gastrostomy is valuable in postoperative care of the baby, because gastrointestinal function is often slow to return.
-The death rate for infants with gastroschisis has been greatly reduced by this technique.
-Poor gastrointestinal function and episodes of sepsis, presumably from compromised bowel, may occur.
- Total parenteral nutrition may be necessary for several weeks.

NB.
Diagnosis may be done in utero of the last 2 disorders by doing an U/S-at 16 and 32 weeks
-Alpha fetal protein raised in both cases.
-Cytology on the amniotic fluid for other associated disorders.

\section*{ACUTE APPENDICITIS}

\section*{Definition}

Appendicitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the vermiform appendix that subsequently spreads to its other parts.

\section*{Frequency}

The incidence of acute appendicitis is around $7 \%$ of the population

\section*{Age}

Persons of any age may be affected, with highest incidence occurring between 15-30 years of age.

\section*{Sex}

Before puberty and after $30 \mathrm{yrs}-\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{F}$ incidence Teenagers \& young adults - M:F - 3:2(slight male predominance)

\section*{Relevant Anatomy}

The appendix is a wormlike extension of the cecum, and its average length is $8-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ (ranging from $2-20 \mathrm{~cm}$ ).
This organ appears during the fifth month of gestation, and its wall has an inner mucosal layer, 2 muscular layers, and a serosa. Several lymphoid follicles are scattered in its mucosa. The number of follicles increases when individuals are aged 820 years.
The inner muscular layer is circular, and the outer layer is longitudinal and derives from the taenia coli.
Taenia coli converge on the posteromedial area of the cecum. This site is the appendiceal base.
The appendix runs into a serosal sheet of the peritoneum called the mesoappendix. Within the mesoappendix courses the appendicular artery, which is derived from the ileocolic artery. Sometimes, an accessory appendicular artery (deriving from the posterior cecal artery) may be found.
The vasculature of the appendix must be addressed to avoid intraoperative hemorrhage.
The position of appendix vary thus the nonspecific signs and symptoms of appendicitis.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Subrowol $1.5 \%$}
\end{figure}

\section*{Etiology}

Appendicitis is caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. The causes of the obstruction include:
1) Lymphoid hyperplasia secondary to irritable bowel disease (IBD) or infections (more common during childhood and in young adults)
2) Fecal stasis and fecaliths (more common in elderly patients)
3) Parasites
4) Foreign bodies
5) Neoplasm-carcinoids, lymphoma, carcinoma of caecum.
6) Strictures

NB
Lymphoid hyperplasia may also related to Crohn disease, mononucleosis, amebiasis, measles, and GI and respiratory infections.
Fecaliths are solid bodies within the appendix that form after precipitation of calcium salts and undigested fiber in a matrix of dehydrated fecal material

\section*{Pathophysiology}
-Independent of the etiology, obstruction causes an increase in pressure within the lumen due to continuous secretion of fluids and mucus from the mucosa and the stagnation of this material. At the same time, intestinal bacteria within the appendix multiply, leading to the recruitment of white cells and the formation of pus and even higher intraluminal pressure.
-If appendiceal obstruction persists, intraluminal pressure rises ultimately above that of the appendiceal veins, leading to venous outflow obstruction. As a consequence, appendiceal wall ischemia begins, resulting in a loss of epithelial integrity and allowing bacterial invasion of the appendiceal wall.
-Various specific bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can be responsible agents of infection that affect the appendix, including Gram - bacilli, Viruses-adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, actinomycosis, Mycobacteria species, Histoplasma species, Schistosoma species, pinworms, and Strongyloides stercoralis -Uncorrected this leads to gangrene and perforation of the appendix. As this process continues, a peri appendicular abscess or peritonitis may occur.
-In neonates (due to a poorly developed omentum), the elderly (omentum shrinks in size) \& the immunocompromised , the condition is not controlled lead free bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity and generalised peritonitis.
-In the rest, the greater omentum \& loops of small bowel become adherent to the inflamed appendix, walling off the spread of peritoneal contamination, resulting in a phlegmonous mass \& eventually may form a paracaecal abscess.
Rarely appendiceal inflammation resolves leaving a distended mucous-filled organ - mucocele of the appendix.

\section*{Symptoms}
1) Abdominal pain (100\%) - periumbilical then right-lowerquadrant (RLQ). Pain lessened with flexion at the hip.
2) Anorexia (almost 100\%)
3) Nausea (90\%)
4) Vomiting (75\%)-mild
5) Obstipation-inability to pas stool and flatus
6) Diarrhea-mild
7)Appendix next to bladder or ureter, inflammation may cause urinary symptoms of frequency, dysuria and (microscopic) pyuria

\section*{Physical examination}
-Vitals-fever and tachycardia
-Dehydration

\section*{Do full abdominal examination and DRE}

\section*{Inspection}

Complicated appendix-movement with respiration may be absent, distension of the abdomen

\section*{Palpation}
-Maximal tenderness at "McBurney's point" 2/3 distance from umbilicus to Anterior superior iliac spine
-RLQ tenderness and rebound tenderness
-Voluntary contraction (guarding)
-Involuntary contraction (rigidity)

\section*{Signs include:}

1-Pointing sign patient may localize a region in the RLQ where pain is maximal.(parietal peritoneum irritation)
2-Rovsing's sign - RLQ pain with palpatory pressure in LLQ
3-Psoas sign-pain with right thigh extension in retroperitoneal or retrocecal appendicitis
4-Obturator sign-pain with internal rotation of flexed right thigh in pelvic appendicitis
5- Dunphy sign- Increasing pain with cough
6- Blumberg sign -Rebound tenderness related to peritoneal irritation elicited by deep palpation with quick release. When patient is on moving trolley patient feels pain.
-Retrocecal appendix-flank tenderness in RLQ

\section*{Auscultation}

Bowel sounds-may absent in perforated appendix-paralytic ileus.May be increased in appendicitis associated with obstruction at caecum

\section*{DRE}

Pelvic appendix-anterior and suprapubic pain on rectal exam.
Blood in examining finger
NB Signs of peritoneal inflammation in the right iliac fossa are often absent in the early stages of the illness.

The patient should be asked to cough, blow the abdominal wall out and draw it in; all of these cause pain if the parietal peritoneum is inflamed

\section*{Pathology}

Gross:In the early stages of the disease, the appendix grossly appears edematous with dilation of the serosal vessels As time passes, the appendiceal wall grossly appears thickened, the lumen appears dilated, and a serosal exudate (fibrinous or fibrinopurulent) may be observed as granular roughening.

Micro: neutrophil infiltrate of the mucosal and muscularis layers extending into the lumen

\section*{Investigations}

Usually a clinical diagnosis, investigations more useful in atypical presentations to rule out other differentials and confirm the diagnosis

\section*{Laboratory}

\section*{1.FHG}

A mild elevation of WBCs (ie, $>12,000 / \mathrm{mL}$ ) is a common finding in patients with acute appendicitis especially neutrophilia.Values greater than 17,000 cells indicate complicated appendicitis.
Otherwise, the WBC count has low specificity.

\section*{2.Urinalysis}

Differentiating appendicitis from urinary tract conditions. Mild pyuria may occur in patients with appendicitis because of the relationship of the appendix with the right ureter. Severe pyuria is a more common finding in UTI.
Hematuria in ureteric colic.
Glycosuria in Diabetic ketoacidosis
Urobilinogen in acute porphyria

\section*{3.U/E/C}

Detect any deranged electrolytes- Vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia. Correction done.
Renal Pyelonephritis and colic R/o

\section*{4.C-reactive protein and ESR}

C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis. This protein is physiologically produced by the liver when bacterial infections occur and rapidly increases within the first 12 hours
5.Liver and pancreatic function tests (eg, Transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum lipase, amylase) R/o Acute pancreatitis and cholecystitis
6.Pregnacy test-in females of childbearing age

\section*{Imaging}

Used in differential diagnosis and to detect complications.
1.Abdomianl x-ray: gas-filled appendix; radiopaque fecalith or ureteric calculi; deformed cecum; air-fluid levels a perforated appendix may allow sufficient free gas to escape to be revealed on plain X-rays
2. Barium enema-non-filling appendix; RLQ mass effect
3. Ultrasound-distended and thick walled appendix.
-Non distendable appendix.
-Using U/S probe to press appendix causes tenderness
-Up to $90 \%$ sensitive and $95 \%$ specific for appendicitis
-Rule out other differentials as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic abscess, endometriosis, ureteric colic inflamed gall bladder
4. CT scan for peri- appendiceal abscess and wall of appendix .May be used in obese patients where ultrasonography may be hampered

\section*{5. Diagnostic laparoscopy}

Convergence of teniae coli is detected at the base of the appendix, beneath the Bauhin valve (ie, the ileocecal valve. Can be converted to therapeutic by doing laparoscopic appendisectomy.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Supportive}
1.Analgesics-diclofenac
2.NG tube
5.Maintenance fluids and correction of electrolytes
4. Pre-op antibiotics broad spectrum antibiotic; cefoxitin, cefotetan plus Metrodidazole.
Gangrenous or perforating appendicitis - broadened antibiotic coverage for aerobic and anaerobic enteric pathogen.

\section*{Definitive}
-Immediate appendectomy; open or laparoscopic.
-Drainage of abscess, if present

\section*{Open appendectomy}
-Prior to incision, the surgeon should carefully perform a physical examination of the abdomen to detect any mass and to determine the site of the incision

\section*{Incisions}
a) Gridiron Centred on McBurney's point perpendicular to line joining ASIS \& umbilicus.Difficult to extend, more difficult to close \& provides poorer access to the pelvis \& peritoneal cavity

\begin{figure}

\section*{C) Rutherford Morison's incision}

Useful if the appendix is para- or retrocaecal \& fixed It is possible to convert the Gridiron incision to a Rutherford Morison by cutting the internal oblique \& transversus muscles in the line of the incision)

\section*{Procedure}

Incision go through the following layers
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/86c13d56-2793-4303-b812-214597661c62-10.jpg?height=725&width=780&top_left_y=1270&top_left_x=1078)
-Character of any peritoneal fluid is noted; if purulent, collected for M/C/S.
-Retractors are gently placed into the peritoneum.
-The cecum is identified exteriorized by a moist gauze sponge or Babcock clamp
- Appendix is identified by following the taenia coli until their convergence at base of caecum.
-Mesoappendix is held between clamps, divided, and ligated.
-The appendix is clamped proximally about 5 mm above the cecum to avoid contamination of the peritoneal cavity and is cut above the clamp by a scalpel.
-The appendix stump may be inverted into the cecum with the use of a purse string suture or z-stitch
-The cecum is placed back into the abdomen. The abdomen is irrigated.
When evidence of free perforation exists, peritoneal lavage with several liters of warm saline is recommended.
-The use of a drain is not commonly required in patients with acute appendicitis, but obvious abscess with gross contamination requires drainage.
-The wound closure begins by closing the peritoneum with a running suture. Then, fascial layers are reapproximated and closed with a continuous or interrupted absorbable suture. Lastly, the skin is closed with subcutaneous sutures.

\section*{NB.}

Incase of normal appendix, other causes of the differentials ruled out, including ovarian pathology, Meckel diverticulum, sigmoid disease, and cholecystitis. Regardless of the findings, appendectomy should be performed.
This because the patient will have a RLQ incision and in case of another acute abdomen acute appendicitis may not be considered.

\section*{Laparoscopic appendisectomy}
-3 cannulae are placed during the procedure.
-Two of them have a fixed position (ie, umbilical and suprapubic).
-The third is placed in the right periumbilical region position may vary.
-Umbilical incision for placement of a Hasson cannula or Veress needle
-Pneumoperitoneum ( $10-14 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) is established and maintained by insufflating carbon dioxide.
-Through the access, a laparoscope is inserted to view the entire abdomen cavity.
-Trocar is introduced suprapubic allow the introduction of instruments (eg, incisors, forceps, stapler).
-Another trocar is placed in the right periumbilical for insertion of an atraumatic grasper to expose the appendix. - The appendix may be removed through the umbilical or the suprapubic cannula using a laparoscopic pouch to prevent wound contamination.
- Peritoneal irrigation is performed with antibiotic or saline solution

\section*{Advantages}
1.Decreased postoperative pain
2.Shorter time to return to usual activities
3.Lower incidence of wound infections or dehiscence. This procedure is cost effective but may require more operative time compared with open appendectomy

\section*{ANAL FISSURES}

\section*{Definition}
-Superficial linear tear in the squamous epith. of the anal canal distal to the dentate line.
-Most commonly caused by passage of a large, hard stool.
- In the short-term, usually involves only the epithelium and, in the long-term, involves the full thickness of the anal mucosa.

\section*{Occurrence}
-Anal fissures are common in infancy, and they represent the most common cause of bright rectal bleeding at any age.
-If not promptly diagnosed and treated, these small tears and their occasionally associated superficial infection cause severe anorectal pain during bowel movements and set in motion a cycle of stool negativism, constipation, and increasing pain with subsequent defecation.

\section*{Etiology-Not exactly known But:}
1.Trauma -passage of hard stool(constipation)
-anal intercourse
- rectal examination speculum
2. Low-fiber diets- lacking in raw fruits and vegetables
3. Prior anal surgery -scarring from the surgery may cause either stenosis or tethering of the anal canal

\section*{4.Chronic diarrhea}
5.Habitual use of cathartics
6.Abnormalities in internal sphincter tone - hypertonicity and hypertrophy of the internal anal sphincter, leading to elevated anal canal and sphincter resting pressures
-Most patients with anal fissures have an elevated resting pressure, and this resting pressure returns to normal levels after surgical sphincterotomy.
- Pain accompanies each bowel movement as this raw area is stretched and the injured mucosa is abraded by the stool. -The internal sphincter also begins to spasm when a bowel movement is passed, which has 2 effects. First, the spasm itself is painful; second, the spasm further reduces the blood flow to the posterior midline and the anal fissure, contributing to the poor healing rate.

\section*{Pathopysiology}
-Constipation thought to cause initial trauma causing acute fissures.
-Acute anal fissures are superficial and are not normally associated with skin tag formation.
-Chronic anal fissure is associated with the development of both anal tags and polyps (hypertrophied anal papillae) as a result of inflammatory edema.
- Chronic sub epithelial infection at the fissure results in fibrosis and, in rare instances, anal stenosis.
- The torn edges of the anal epithelium become undermined and the ulcer deepens, exposing fibres of the internal sphincter muscle.
- A vicious cycle ensues in which subepithelial inflammation causes spasm of the internal sphincter, inhibiting free drainage of the infected fissure and permitting continued inflammation, resulting in a small, chronic, inadequately drained abscess.
- The reflex relaxation of the internal sphincter that normally follows defecation is lost in patients with anal fissure; instead contraction of the internal sphincter occurs.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{History}

Relatively specific dx usually on history alone.

1-Severe pain during a bowel movement, with the pain lasting minutes - hours afterward.
-The pain leading to a cycle of worsening constipation, harder stools, and more anal pain.
2-Bright red blood on the toilet paper or stool but no significant bleeding
3- Mucous anal discharge and pruritus ani are also common.
History of chronic anal fissure is typically cyclical; periods of acute pain are followed by temporary healing, only to be succeeded by further acute pain.

\section*{PHYSICAL}

The patient should be examined in the left lateral position.
Visual examination may disclose a posterior oedematous tag and, on parting the buttocks, an associated fissure may be seen..
-Note depth of fissure and its orientation to the midline, often described using clock orientation of hour hand.
-Majority of tears are found in the posterior midline. Fissures occurring off the midline should raise the possibility of other etiologies. Sigmoidoscopy should be undertaken, under anaesthesia to exclude specific causes of fissure, IBD (esp. Crohn's disease), anal syphilis, anal herpes, anal carcinoma, lymphoma, anoreceptive intercourse (with or without HIV infection), and, in children, sexual abuse.
-Rectal examination is generally difficult to tolerate because of sphincter spasm and pain.
-Acute fissures are erythematous and bleed easily.
-With chronic fissures, classic fissure triad may be seen.
a. Deep ulcer
b. Sentinel pile-skin tag
c. Enlarged anal papillae

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

The goals of treatment are to relieve the constipation and pain thus to break the cycle of hard bowel movement, associated pain, and worsening constipation and spasm of internal anal sphincter.

\section*{Medical therapy}
-Initial therapy for an anal fissure is medical in nature, and more than $\mathbf{8 0 \%}$ of acute anal fissures resolve without further therapy.
-Softer bowel movements are easier and less painful for the patient to pass.

\section*{First-line medical therapy}
1.Diet modification increase -water and fibres-fruits and vegetables.
2.Stool-bulking agents/Stool softeners -such as fiber supplementation and stool softeners-polyethylene glycol 2. Laxatives are used as needed to maintain regular bowel movements.-Lactulose
3. Mineral oil may be added to facilitate passage of stool without as much stretching or abrasion of the anal not used for long.
3. Sitz baths after bowel movements - symptomatic relief as they relieve painful internal sphincter muscle spasm.

\section*{$\mathbf{2}^{\text {nd }}$ medical therapy}

Topical application of $0.2 \%$ nitroglycerin (NTG) ointment directly to the internal sphincter.
NTG ointment is thought to relax the internal sphincter and to help relieve some of the pain associated with sphincter spasm; it also is thought to increase blood flow to the anal mucosa. main adverse effects are headache and dizziness; could be used directly before bedtime.

Others -hydrocortisone cream, lignocaine gels, Proctosedyl ointment (cinchocaine anaesthetic 0.5 per cent and hydrocortisone 0.5 per cent).

Newer therapy for acute and chronic anal fissures is botulinum toxin.
The toxin is injected directly into the internal anal sphincter and, in effect, performs a chemical sphincterotomy. The effect lasts approximately 3 months, until the nerve endings regenerate. This 3-month period may allow acute fissures (and sometimes chronic fissures) to heal and symptoms to resolve. Recurrence indicates need for surgery.

\section*{Surgical therapy:}

Surgical therapy is usually reserved for acute anal fissures that remain symptomatic after 3-4 weeks of medical therapy and for chronic anal fissures. Few chronic fissures heal spontaneously or from medical therapy and is indication for surgery

\section*{Sphincter dilatation}
controlled anal stretch or dilatation under general anesthetic. This is performed because one of the causative factors for anal fissure is thought to be a tight internal anal sphincter; stretching it helps correct the underlying abnormality, thus allowing the fissure to heal..

\section*{Lateral internal sphincterotomy}

Current surgical procedure of choice. Done under general or spinal anesthesia.
The purpose of an internal sphincterotomy is to cut the hypertrophied internal sphincter, thereby releasing tension and allowing the fissure to heal.
Sphincterotomies are normally performed in the lateral quadrants as most fissures are posterior or anterior and cuts would not heal due to impaired blood supply.
Only the internal sphincter is cut; the external sphincter is not cut and must not be injured.
In chronic anal fissures, excision of the fissure in conjunction with the lateral sphincterotomy may be done. an advancement flap may be performed to cover the defect in the mucosa.

\section*{Follow-up care}
stool softeners and fiber supplementation after the surgery

\section*{Complications from surgery}

Infection
Bleeding
Anal abscess
fistula development,
the most feared-incontinence.
Recurrence of fissure

\section*{ANORECTAL ABSCESS}

\section*{Definition}

Anorectal abscess represents an infection of the soft tissues surrounding the anal canal, with formation of a discrete abscess cavity.
Often associated with formation of a fistulous track.

\section*{Etiology}
-Arise from obstruction of anal crypts.
-Infection of the now static glandular secretions results in suppuration and abscess formation within the anal gland. The abscess typically forms initially within the intersphincteric space and then spreads along adjacent potential spaces as ischiorectal, supralevetor or submucosal.
In about 20 per cent of patients there is a clear predisposing cause, IBD, anorectal cancer, anal fissure, complicated haemorrhoids, or local trauma

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
-Basic mechanism is the obstruction of anal crypts.
-Usually, from 4-10 anal glands are drained by respective crypts at the level of the dentate line.
-Obstruction of anal crypts results in stasis of glandular secretions and, when subsequently infected, suppuration and abscess formation within the anal gland results.
-The abscess typically forms in the intersphincteric space and can spread along various potential spaces.
-Common organisms implicated in abscess formation include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, and Bacteroides species
-Less common causes of anorectal abscess that must be considered in the differential diagnosis include tuberculosis, cancer, Crohn disease, trauma, leukemia, and lymphoma

\section*{Classification of anorectal abscess}

\section*{1.Perianal abscesses}

The most common type of anorectal abscesses, $60 \%$ of cases. These superficial collections of purulent material are located beneath the skin of the anal canal and do not transverse the external sphincter

\section*{2.Ischiorectal}

An ischiorectal abscess forms when suppuration transverses the external sphincter into the ischiorectal space.

\section*{3.Intersphincteric}

Intersphincteric abscesses result from suppuration contained between the internal and external anal sphincters

\section*{4. Supralevator.}

A supralevator abscess results either from suppuration extending cranially through the longitudinal muscle of the rectum from an origin in the intersphincteric space to reach above the levators or as a result of primary disease in the pelvis (eg, appendicitis, diverticular disease, gynecological sepsis).

\section*{5.Horseshoe abscesses}

Rare, result from circumferential infiltration of pus within the intersphincteric planes.

\section*{Clinical}

Locations of abscess perianal $60 \%$, ischiorectal $20 \%$, intersphincteric 5\%, supralevator 4\%, and submucosal 1\% Clinical presentation correlates with the anatomical location of the abscess

\section*{History}

Pain is a prominent initial feature of perianal and superficial ischiorectal abscesses, followed by local signs of inflammation. Perianal pain often is exacerbated by movement and increased perineal pressure from sitting or defecation. Pts also complain of dull perianal discomfort and pruritus
Such symptoms are less evident or may even be absent with deep infections, which tend to develop insidiously with pyrexia and systemic upset.

\section*{Physical}

Superficial lesions produce obvious signs of acute inflammation.
Perianal abscess, there is a localized; fluctuant, red, hot, and tender swelling close to the anus. Such signs are more diffuse in patients with ischiorectal sepsis, where fluctuance is a late finding.
Other features that might be noted are skin necrosis, if there is gross swelling and crepitus if a gas-forming organism is present.
-Deeper infections produce less obvious abnormalities, and these are only apparent on digital rectal examination.- a fluctuant indurated mass may be encountered.
-Optimal physical assessment of an ischiorectal abscess may require anesthesia to alleviate patient discomfort that would otherwise limit the extent of the examination.

\section*{Investigations}
clinical suspicion of an intersphincteric or supralevator abscess may require confirmation by CT scan, MRI, or anal ultrasonography

\section*{Management \\ Medical}

Systemic broad spectrum antibiotics - change appropriately with the results of culture and sensitivity.

\section*{Surgery}

This is achieved by incision and drainage after the patient has been examined under an appropriate anesthetic.
For ischiorectal and perianal abscess a cruciate incision with probing of the abscess to break the pus loculations
The cavity should be curetted and necrotic tissue excised

\section*{Post-op}
-Sitz baths
-Analgesia
-Antibiotics
-Stool softeners.

\section*{ANORECTAL MALFORMATIONS}

\section*{Introduction}

The spectrum of anorectal malformations ranges from simple anal stenosis to the persistence of a cloaca.

\section*{Incidence}

Ranges from 1 in 4000 to 5000 live births, being slightly more common in males.
The most common defect in both males and females is an imperforate anus with a fistula between the distal bowel and the urethra in males or the vestibule of the vagina in females.
Low lesions are much more common than high lesions.
May occur as part of the VACTREL group of anomalies;
-Vertebral body segmentation defects - Hemivertebra, Sacral agenesis, spina bifida ,scoliosis, kyphosis.
-Anorectal malformations.
-Cardiovascular - PDA, VSD
-Tracheo-Esophageal anomalies TOF,esopahageal atresia
-Radial ray hypoplasia; unilateral Renal agenesis or ectopia
-Limb anomalies-amelia, phalyngeal anomalies-reduction or addition anomalies

\section*{Embryology}

From the 4th to 7th weeks, the Primitive cloaca, derived from the primitive hind gut (endoderm) is divided by the urorectal septum by its cauadal growth into:
Ventral cloaca (urogenital sinus) - gives rise to the urinary bladder, urethra \& vestibule of the vagina
Dorsal cloaca(anorectal canal) - gives rise to the rectum \& anal canal which fuses with the Proctodeum (an invagination of the ectoderm which eventually breaks down by the 8th week) to give rise to the anus
-Failure of the urorectal septum to form results in a fistula between the bowel and urinary tract (in males) or the vagina (in females).
-The urorectal septum divides the cloacal membrane into the urogenital (anteriorly) and anal (membrane posteriorly). Complete or partial failure of the anal membrane to resorb results in an anal agenesis or stenosis.
-The perineum also contributes to development of the external anal opening and genitalia by formation of cloacal folds that extend from the anterior genital tubercle to the anal membrane.
-The perineal body is formed by fusion of the cloacal folds between the anal and urogenital membranes. Breakdown of the cloacal membrane anywhere long its course results in the external anal opening being anterior to the external sphincter (ie, anteriorly displaced anus).
-Management of anorectal anomalies requires that the level of the rectal pouch and presence of fistula to the urinary tract or vagina be determined; this is important in early management. Evaluating the location of a fistula can be performed at a later time.

\section*{Clinical presentation}
1.Absence of anal opening
-Anorectal (or anal) agenesis without fistula
-Anal stenosis/agenesis
2. Single perineal opening with Rectovaginal \& Urethral openings immediately behind the clitoris - Cloaca
3.Failure to pass stool/meconium
4.Passing meconium/stool/air;
-Per urethra (mixed with urine).
-Per vagina.
-Ectopic point in perineum.
5.Abdominal distension and Vomiting
6. Associated conditions - oesophageal atresia, duodenal atresia, and cardiovascular defects.

\section*{Physical examination}
-A piece of gauze is placed around the tip of the penis can be used to check for particles of meconium filtered through this gauze. The presence of meconium in the urine and a flat bottom (flat perineum with short sacrum) are considered indications to create a protective colostomy.
-The presence of a single perineal orifice is pathognomonic of a cloaca. A palpable pelvic mass (hydrocolpos) reinforces the suspicions of a cloaca.
-The diagnosis of a vestibular fistula can be established by a careful separation of the labia to see the vestibule. Examination to exclude other abnormalities.

\section*{Investigations}
1. Baby gram-X-ray showing head to toe. Air in the abdomen may indicate small intestinal atresia
2.No Fistula - Invertogram - X-ray with head down hips flexed at 90 degrees and legs flexed at 90 degrees
Baby held for several minutes to allow air to pass into the rectal pouch
(Alternative - Prone cross-table lateral view)
Best done after $16-24 \mathrm{hr}$ of life - At birth the bowel is not distended; therefore, clinical and radiologic evaluations are not reliable during the first 16-24 hr of life.
To find out the level of the rectal atresia by viewing how far the gas has reached in relation to area where sphincter should be (Put a coin)

High lesions are above the levator. Intermediate lesions are characterized by the rectal pouch ending within the levator, low lesions, the rectal pouch has completely traversed the levator musculature, and a fistula usually is evident on the skin within the midline (ie, anteriorly displaced anus)
2.Fistula - Colostogram - Should be done under pressure to illustrate any fistula

\section*{3.Abdominal U/S}

During the first 24 hrs of life, all these patients need an abdominal ultrasound evaluation to identify an obstructive uropathy especially in patients with;
-Cloaca (Cervix faces posteriorly not downwards thus may obstruct the ureters)
-Rectovesical (Bladder neck) fistula
-Rectoprostatic urethral fistula

\section*{4..Perineal U/S or MRI}

If required, the level of the rectal pouch can be delineated more definitively by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. Perineal ultrasonography may be useful in determining the distance between the rectal pouch and the anal skin, In general, a lesion can be considered to be low if the distance from the rectal pouch to the skin, as determined by ultrasonography, is less than 1 cm .

\section*{Evaluation for other anomalies:}

1-Chest x-ray
2-Lumbosacral x-ray
3-Abdominal pelvic ultrasonography
4-Kidney Ureter Bladder KUB x-ray
5-IVU
6-Echocardiography and ECG
7-Passage of nasogastric tube
Congenital anorectal anomalies often co-exist with other lesions, and the VATER or VACTERL association must be considered.
Bony abnormalities of the sacrum and spine occur in about one third of patients with anorectal anomalies and consist of absent, accessory, or hemivertebrae and/or an asymmetric or short sacrum.
The absence of two or more vertebrae is associated with poor prognosis in terms of bowel and bladder continence. Occult dysraphism of the spinal cord also may be present, and it consists of tethered cord, lipomeningocele, or fat within the filum.
-Vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis are the most common abnormalities, but other findings such as horseshoe, dysplastic, or absent kidney as well as hypospadias or cryptorchidism also must be considered.
-The higher the anorectal malformation, the more frequent the associated urologic abnormalities. In patients with persistent cloacas or rectovesical fistula, the likelihood of a genitourinary abnormality is approximately $90 \%$.

\section*{SURGICAL MANAGEMENT}

The newborn infant with a low lesion can have a primary, singlestage repair procedure on the perineum without need for a colostomy. Three basic approaches may be used.
For anal stenosis with a normal location of the anal opening, only simple serial dilatation is necessary.
This should be performed daily (12-Fr size for newborn infants), and the size of the dilator should be increased progressively. Over
several months, the anus ultimately will admit an index finger easily, and the dilatations can be discontinued.
If the anal opening is anterior to the external sphincter (ie, anteriorly displaced anus) with a small distance between the opening and the center of the external sphincter and perineal body also is intact, a cutback anoplasty is performed.
Infants with intermediate or high lesions require a colostomy as the first part of a three-stage reconstruction. In males without fistulae fashioning of a colostomy is an emergency procedure.

NB. In females with a afistulae a colostomy may be fashioned at 3 months-times when food starts to solidify and cant go through the fistulae.
The colon is completely divided junction of the descending and sigmoid colon region(this is because of good blood supply, length of gut good mobilization)
The proximal bowel as brought out as colostomy and the distal bowel as a mucous fistula.

The second-stage procedure usually is performed
2-3 months later.
Posterior saggital anorectoplasty it consists
-Surgically dividing the rectourinary or rectovaginal fistula
"-Pull-through" of the terminal rectal pouch into the normal anal position.
The patient is left with the protective colostomy to afford healing of the new anal anastomosis.
In males, a urinary catheter remains in place to maintain the lumen of the urethra after repair of the rectourinary fistula.
The third and final stage is performed a few months after the second stage, and it consists of colostomy closure. Anal dilatations are begun 2 weeks after the pull-through procedure and continue for several months after the colostomy closure. A 12-Fr dilator is used for newborns, which is increased up to 14or $16-\mathrm{Fr}$ for older infants.
All stages of the surgery should be complete before 1 year of age when toilet training id meant to commence.
Alternative is an extended posterior saggital anorectovaginoplasty

\section*{Summary}

PSARP + Abdominal approach
1.Rectovesical (Bladder neck) fistulae in males
2.Rectoprostatic urethral fistula
3. $\geq 3 \mathrm{~cm}$ Cloaca

PSARP only;
1.Rectobulbar urethral fistula
2.Anal Agenesis $<1 \mathrm{~cm}$ (No colostomy)
3.Perineal fistula (No colostomy)
4. $<3 \mathrm{~cm}$ Cloaca (Rectovaginal \& Rectovestibular fistula)

\section*{Post-operative management}
i)-4th day - Sitz baths to remove any bacteria
ii)-10th day - When the wound has healed, start daily Hegars dilatation - Always start the previous days dilator then increase to the next size - to prevent stenosis. Aim for a size in keeping with the child's age (or mother's index finger).
Once the size has been achieved, the mother is taught how to digitally dilate at home for some time.
iii)-Confirm adequacy of anus before closure of colostomy
iv)-If there is faecal soiling, reassess the sphincter by performing anal mapping under GA
-If rectum misplaced, then put a colostomy \& redo PSARP -If rectum is appropriately placed, then manage the patient medically - constipating diet \& high daily enema

\section*{Prognostic factors}
1.High lesions have poorer prognosis compared to low lesions High-Females-Cloacal complex, rectovaginal fistula, rectocutaneous fistula

Males-Rectovesical fistula, rectoprostatic fistua(commonest lesion)
2. Timing of the surgery-earlier surgeries have better results.
3.Bony abnormalities are associated with poorer prognosis, 4.Number of operations-first attempt operation would achieve best results
5.Timing of colostomy-done early to avoid megacolon and peristalsis
