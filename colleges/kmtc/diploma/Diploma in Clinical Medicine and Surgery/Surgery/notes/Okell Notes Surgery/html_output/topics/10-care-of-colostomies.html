                            <li>To divert the fecal stream in preparation for resection of an inflammatory, obstructive, or perforated lesion or following traumatic injury;</li>
                            <li>To protect a distal anastomosis following resection.</li>

                        <h3>Classification by function</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Temporary colostomies:</strong> created to divert stool from injured or diseased portions of the large intestine, allowing rest and healing before closure of colostomy and anastomosis of the colon is done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Permanent colostomies:</strong> performed when the distal bowel (bowel at the farthest distance) must be removed or is blocked and inoperable.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Classification by nature of stoma</h3>
                        
                        <h4>1. Loop colostomy</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This colostomy is created by bringing a loop of bowel through an incision in the abdominal wall.</li>
                            <li>The loop is held in place outside the abdomen by a plastic rod slipped beneath it.</li>
                            <li>An incision is made in the loop to allow the passage of stool through the loop colostomy.</li>
                            <li>The supporting rod is removed approximately 7-10 days after surgery, when healing has occurred that will prevent the loop of bowel from retracting into the abdomen.</li>
                            <li>A loop colostomy is most often performed for creation of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Terminal or end colostomy (Hartman's colostomy)</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The colon is divided and the proximal end is brought out (functional part) while the distal end closed and left intra abdominal (dysfunctional part).</li>
                            <li>The functioning end of the intestine (the section of bowel that remains connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the surface of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing the intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the skin.</li>
                            <li>The surface of the stoma is actually the lining of the intestine, usually appearing moist and pink.</li>
                            <li>An end colostomy is usually a permanent ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or another pathological condition.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Double barrel colostomy</h4>
                        <p>(Also Divided colostomy / Paul-Mickulicz colostomy)</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Involves the creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal wall by exteriorizing both ends of the divided colon.</li>
                            <li>The proximal stoma is the functional end that is connected to the upper gastrointestinal tract and will drain stool.</li>
                            <li>The distal stoma, connected to the rectum and also called a mucous fistula, drains small amounts of mucus material.</li>
                            <li>This is most often a temporary colostomy performed to rest an area of bowel, and to be later closed.</li>

                            <li>Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes until patient is awake then 30 minutes until patient gets to the ward then every 4 hours</li>
                            <li>IV fluids (NS and Dextrose) at least 500 mls every 6 hours</li>
                            <li>Continue prophylactic antibiotics</li>
                            <li>Analgesia - 1 mg/kg of pethidine then introduce IM NSAIDs as decrease pethidine dose.</li>

                        <h4>Stoma management</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The patient is instructed how to support the operative site during deep breathing and coughing</li>
                            <li>The stoma is observed for color and amount of wound drainage. Initially, the colostomy will drain bloody mucus.</li>
                            <li>Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously until the patient's diet is can gradually be resumed, beginning with liquids with the return of bowel sounds. Usually within 72 hours, passage of gas and stool through the stoma begins. Initially the stool is liquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to take solid foods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Counseling:</strong> All patients should be counseled about colostomy before surgery and counseling and education continued after the surgery both within the ward and even after discharge. The counseling should also include the spouse and the family members to ensure support of the patient and to continue his usual lifestyle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Education:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Determination of appropriate pouching supplies</li>
                                    <li>Proper application of the pouch on the stoma to avoid leakage</li>
                                    <li>Schedule of how often to change the pouch</li>
                                    <li>Regular assessment and meticulous care of the skin</li>

                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Continued care of colostomy after discharge</h3>
                        
                        <h4>1. Skin care</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Frequent Cleaning of the area around the stoma with soap and water and adequate drying.</li>
                            <li>The skin around the stoma may be protected by application of water repellants as zinc oxide and Vaseline.</li>
                            <li>To make sure that the colostomy bag fits snugly around the stoma to avoid leakage to the surrounding skin</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Control of odor</h4>
                        <p>Well managed colostomy should not have disturbing odor. This should be achieved by:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Prompt changing of the colostomy bags to avoid filling with effluent and leakage.</li>
                            <li>Avoid diet with spices causes' bad odor.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning the skin around the stoma</li>
                            <li>General hygiene of the body</li>
                            <li>Use of deodorants incase all this fails.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Diet</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Patient is encouraged to take a balanced diet and to increase his fluid intake because of loss of water through the effluents.</li>
                            <li>Avoid spices in food which give the effluents bad smell.</li>
                            <li>Avoid food with lots of roughage as vegetables which increases the amounts of effluent discharged.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>4. Lifestyle</h4>
                        <p>As much as possible, Patient should continue with the normal lifestyle.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Should continue with his work or employment as normal.</li>
                            <li>Should continue to have normal sexual function without hindrance</li>
                            <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> You can shower or bathe with the pouch on or off.</li>
                            <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Use waterproof tape around the stoma</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifting:</strong> Heavy lifting should be avoided and if previous job involved this then should change job.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>5. Social support</h4>
                        <p>Patient should be supported by the family thus the importance counseling spouse and family. Should be linked to colostomy society and associations for social support and continued education</p>

                        <h4>6. When to consult a doctor</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Change in stoma color, swelling or bleeding.</li>

                            <li><strong>Gangrene of stomal tissue:</strong> Caused by inadequate blood supply, this complication is usually visible 12-24 hours after the operation and may require additional surgery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stomal Stenosis:</strong> Narrowing at the opening of the stoma. Often associated with infection around the stoma or scarring. Mild stenosis can be removed under local anesthesia. Severe stenosis may require surgery for reshaping the stoma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stomal Retraction:</strong> Stoma is flush with the abdomen surface or has moved below it. Caused by insufficient stomal length, this complication may be managed by use of special pouching supplies. Elective revision of the stoma is also an option.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stomal Prolapse:</strong> Stoma increases length above the surface of the abdomen. Most often results from an overly large opening in the abdominal wall or inadequate fixation of the bowel to the abdominal wall. Surgical correction is required when blood supply is compromised.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parastomal hernia:</strong> Bowel causing bulge in the abdominal wall next to the stoma. This is due to placement of the stoma where the abdominal wall is weak or creation of an overly large opening in the abdominal wall. The use of an ostomy support belt and special pouching supplies may be adequate. If severe, the defect in the abdominal wall should be repaired and the stoma moved to another location.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parastomal abscess formation</strong></li>
                            <li>Infection/sepsis</li>
