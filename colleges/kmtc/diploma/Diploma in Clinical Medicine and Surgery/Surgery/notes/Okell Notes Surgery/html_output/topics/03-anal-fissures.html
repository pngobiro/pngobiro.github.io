                        <p>If not promptly diagnosed and treated, these small tears and their occasionally associated superficial infection cause severe anorectal pain during bowel movements and set in motion a cycle of stool negativism, constipation, and increasing pain with subsequent defecation.</p>

                                    <li>Most patients with anal fissures have an elevated resting pressure, and this resting pressure returns to normal levels after surgical sphincterotomy.</li>
                                    <li>Pain accompanies each bowel movement as this raw area is stretched and the injured mucosa is abraded by the stool.</li>
                                    <li>The internal sphincter also begins to spasm when a bowel movement is passed, which has 2 effects. First, the spasm itself is painful; second, the spasm further reduces the blood flow to the posterior midline and the anal fissure, contributing to the poor healing rate.</li>

                            <li>Acute anal fissures are superficial and are not normally associated with skin tag formation.</li>
                            <li>Chronic anal fissure is associated with the development of both anal tags and polyps (hypertrophied anal papillae) as a result of inflammatory edema.</li>

                        <p>History of chronic anal fissure is typically cyclical; periods of acute pain are followed by temporary healing, only to be succeeded by further acute pain.</p>

                        <h3>PHYSICAL</h3>
                        <p>The patient should be examined in the left lateral position.<br>
                        Visual examination may disclose a posterior oedematous tag and, on parting the buttocks, an associated fissure may be seen.</p>

                            <li>Note depth of fissure and its orientation to the midline, often described using clock orientation of hour hand.</li>
                            <li>Majority of tears are found in the posterior midline. Fissures occurring off the midline should raise the possibility of other etiologies. Sigmoidoscopy should be undertaken, under anaesthesia to exclude specific causes of fissure, IBD (esp. Crohn's disease), anal syphilis, anal herpes, anal carcinoma, lymphoma, anoreceptive intercourse (with or without HIV infection), and, in children, sexual abuse.</li>
                            <li>Rectal examination is generally difficult to tolerate because of sphincter spasm and pain.</li>
                            <li>Acute fissures are erythematous and bleed easily.</li>
                            <li>With chronic fissures, classic fissure triad may be seen.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The goals of treatment are to relieve the constipation and pain thus to break the cycle of hard bowel movement, associated pain, and worsening constipation and spasm of internal anal sphincter.</p>

                        <h3>Medical therapy</h3>
                        <p>Initial therapy for an anal fissure is medical in nature, and more than <strong>80%</strong> of acute anal fissures resolve without further therapy.<br>
                        Softer bowel movements are easier and less painful for the patient to pass.</p>

                        <h4>First-line medical therapy</h4>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Diet modification increase - water and fibres - fruits and vegetables.</li>
                            <li>Stool-bulking agents/Stool softeners - such as fiber supplementation and stool softeners - polyethylene glycol</li>
                            <li>Laxatives are used as needed to maintain regular bowel movements. - Lactulose</li>
                            <li>Mineral oil may be added to facilitate passage of stool without as much stretching or abrasion of the anal not used for long.</li>
                            <li>Sitz baths after bowel movements - symptomatic relief as they relieve painful internal sphincter muscle spasm.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>2<sup>nd</sup> medical therapy</h4>
                        <p>Topical application of 0.2% nitroglycerin (NTG) ointment directly to the internal sphincter.<br>
                        NTG ointment is thought to relax the internal sphincter and to help relieve some of the pain associated with sphincter spasm; it also is thought to increase blood flow to the anal mucosa. main adverse effects are headache and dizziness; could be used directly before bedtime.</p>
                        <p>Others - hydrocortisone cream, lignocaine gels, Proctosedyl ointment (cinchocaine anaesthetic 0.5 per cent and hydrocortisone 0.5 per cent).</p>
                        <p>Newer therapy for acute and chronic anal fissures is botulinum toxin.<br>
                        The toxin is injected directly into the internal anal sphincter and, in effect, performs a chemical sphincterotomy. The effect lasts approximately 3 months, until the nerve endings regenerate. This 3-month period may allow acute fissures (and sometimes chronic fissures) to heal and symptoms to resolve. Recurrence indicates need for surgery.</p>

                        <h3>Surgical therapy:</h3>
                        <p>Surgical therapy is usually reserved for acute anal fissures that remain symptomatic after 3-4 weeks of medical therapy and for chronic anal fissures. Few chronic fissures heal spontaneously or from medical therapy and is indication for surgery</p>

                        <h4>Sphincter dilatation</h4>
                        <p>controlled anal stretch or dilatation under general anesthetic. This is performed because one of the causative factors for anal fissure is thought to be a tight internal anal sphincter; stretching it helps correct the underlying abnormality, thus allowing the fissure to heal..</p>

                        <h4>Lateral internal sphincterotomy</h4>
                        <p>Current surgical procedure of choice. Done under general or spinal anesthesia.<br>
                        The purpose of an internal sphincterotomy is to cut the hypertrophied internal sphincter, thereby releasing tension and allowing the fissure to heal.<br>
                        Sphincterotomies are normally performed in the lateral quadrants as most fissures are posterior or anterior and cuts would not heal due to impaired blood supply.<br>
                        Only the internal sphincter is cut; the external sphincter is not cut and must not be injured.<br>
                        In chronic anal fissures, excision of the fissure in conjunction with the lateral sphincterotomy may be done. an advancement flap may be performed to cover the defect in the mucosa.</p>

                        <h4>Follow-up care</h4>
                        <p>stool softeners and fiber supplementation after the surgery</p>

                        <h4>Complications from surgery</h4>
