                        <p>Appendicitis is inflammation of the inner lining of the vermiform appendix that subsequently spreads to its other parts.</p>

                        <h3>Frequency</h3>
                        <p>The incidence of acute appendicitis is around 7% of the population</p>

                        <h3>Age</h3>
                        <p>Persons of any age may be affected, with highest incidence occurring between 15-30 years of age.</p>

                        <h3>Sex</h3>
                        <p>Before puberty and after 30 yrs - M=F incidence<br>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The appendix is a wormlike extension of the cecum, and its average length is 8-10 cm (ranging from 2-20 cm).<br>
                        This organ appears during the fifth month of gestation, and its wall has an inner mucosal layer, 2 muscular layers, and a serosa. Several lymphoid follicles are scattered in its mucosa. The number of follicles increases when individuals are aged 8-20 years.<br>
                        The inner muscular layer is circular, and the outer layer is longitudinal and derives from the taenia coli.<br>
                        Taenia coli converge on the posteromedial area of the cecum. This site is the appendiceal base.<br>
                        The appendix runs into a serosal sheet of the peritoneum called the mesoappendix. Within the mesoappendix courses the appendicular artery, which is derived from the ileocolic artery. Sometimes, an accessory appendicular artery (deriving from the posterior cecal artery) may be found.<br>
                        The vasculature of the appendix must be addressed to avoid intraoperative hemorrhage.<br>
                        The position of appendix vary thus the nonspecific signs and symptoms of appendicitis.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Etiology</h3>
                        <p>Appendicitis is caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. The causes of the obstruction include:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Lymphoid hyperplasia secondary to irritable bowel disease (IBD) or infections (more common during childhood and in young adults)</li>
                            <li>Fecal stasis and fecaliths (more common in elderly patients)</li>
                            <li>Parasites</li>
                            <li>Foreign bodies</li>
                            <li>Neoplasm-carcinoids, lymphoma, carcinoma of caecum.</li>
                            <li>Strictures</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">NB</h4>
                            <p>Lymphoid hyperplasia may also related to Crohn disease, mononucleosis, amebiasis, measles, and GI and respiratory infections.<br>
                            Fecaliths are solid bodies within the appendix that form after precipitation of calcium salts and undigested fiber in a matrix of dehydrated fecal material</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Independent of the etiology, obstruction causes an increase in pressure within the lumen due to continuous secretion of fluids and mucus from the mucosa and the stagnation of this material. At the same time, intestinal bacteria within the appendix multiply, leading to the recruitment of white cells and the formation of pus and even higher intraluminal pressure.</p>
                        <p>If appendiceal obstruction persists, intraluminal pressure rises ultimately above that of the appendiceal veins, leading to venous outflow obstruction. As a consequence, appendiceal wall ischemia begins, resulting in a loss of epithelial integrity and allowing bacterial invasion of the appendiceal wall.</p>
                        <p>Various specific bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites can be responsible agents of infection that affect the appendix, including Gram - bacilli, Viruses-adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, actinomycosis, Mycobacteria species, Histoplasma species, Schistosoma species, pinworms, and Strongyloides stercoralis</p>
                        <p>Uncorrected this leads to gangrene and perforation of the appendix. As this process continues, a peri appendicular abscess or peritonitis may occur.</p>
                        <p>In neonates (due to a poorly developed omentum), the elderly (omentum shrinks in size) & the immunocompromised, the condition is not controlled lead free bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity and generalised peritonitis.</p>
                        <p>In the rest, the greater omentum & loops of small bowel become adherent to the inflamed appendix, walling off the spread of peritoneal contamination, resulting in a phlegmonous mass & eventually may form a paracaecal abscess.<br>
                        Rarely appendiceal inflammation resolves leaving a distended mucous-filled organ - mucocele of the appendix.</p>

                        <p>A mild elevation of WBCs (ie, >12,000/mL) is a common finding in patients with acute appendicitis especially neutrophilia. Values greater than 17,000 cells indicate complicated appendicitis.<br>
                        Otherwise, the WBC count has low specificity.</p>

                        <h4>2. Urinalysis</h4>
                        <p>Differentiating appendicitis from urinary tract conditions. Mild pyuria may occur in patients with appendicitis because of the relationship of the appendix with the right ureter. Severe pyuria is a more common finding in UTI.<br>
                        Hematuria in ureteric colic.<br>
                        Glycosuria in Diabetic ketoacidosis<br>

                        <p>C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis. This protein is physiologically produced by the liver when bacterial infections occur and rapidly increases within the first 12 hours</p>

                        <h4>5. Liver and pancreatic function tests</h4>
                        <p>(eg, Transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum lipase, amylase) R/o Acute pancreatitis and cholecystitis</p>

                            <li>Character of any peritoneal fluid is noted; if purulent, collected for M/C/S.</li>
                            <li>Retractors are gently placed into the peritoneum.</li>
                            <li>The cecum is identified exteriorized by a moist gauze sponge or Babcock clamp</li>
                            <li>Appendix is identified by following the taenia coli until their convergence at base of caecum.</li>
                            <li>Mesoappendix is held between clamps, divided, and ligated.</li>
                            <li>The appendix is clamped proximally about 5 mm above the cecum to avoid contamination of the peritoneal cavity and is cut above the clamp by a scalpel.</li>
                            <li>The appendix stump may be inverted into the cecum with the use of a purse string suture or z-stitch</li>
                            <li>The cecum is placed back into the abdomen. The abdomen is irrigated.
                                <br>When evidence of free perforation exists, peritoneal lavage with several liters of warm saline is recommended.</li>
                            <li>The use of a drain is not commonly required in patients with acute appendicitis, but obvious abscess with gross contamination requires drainage.</li>
                            <li>The wound closure begins by closing the peritoneum with a running suture. Then, fascial layers are reapproximated and closed with a continuous or interrupted absorbable suture. Lastly, the skin is closed with subcutaneous sutures.</li>

Regardless of the findings, appendectomy should be performed. This because the patient will have a RLQ incision and in case of another acute abdomen acute appendicitis may not be considered.</p>

                            <li>Trocar is introduced suprapubic allow the introduction of instruments (eg, incisors, forceps, stapler).</li>
