                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Cystic hygromas are multiloculated cystic structures that are benign in nature.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>They form as the result of budding lymphatics and, thus, may occur anywhere in the body, although they are most frequently encountered in the <strong>neck (75%)</strong> and <strong>axilla (20%)</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Cystic hygromas frequently abut and/or encompass neurovascular structures.</li>
                            <li>Surgical excision remains the therapy of choice and usually is performed shortly after diagnosis.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Lymphatic channels are formed from a series of clefts that develop in the mesenchyme around the sixth week of gestation. From these channels, sacs are formed that establish drainage with the venous system.<br>
                        Failure to establish venous drainage results in dilated disorganized lymph channels, which, in the largest form, present as cystic hygromas.</p>

                        <p>Most cystic hygromas are evident at birth (65%), with the remainder evident by the time the individual is aged 2 years.</p>

                            <li>Fetal cystic hygromas have almost a 50% association with chromosomal disorders such as aneuploidy.</li>

                            <li>Some cystic hygromas can occur in otherwise healthy fetuses and babies.</li>

                            <li>Physical examination may reveal extension into adjacent structures (eg, oral cavity).</li>
                            <li>Examine neck for tracheal deviation or other evidence of impending airway obstruction.</li>
                            <li>Closely inspect the tongue, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx because any involvement may lead to airway obstruction.</li>

                            <p>To assess risk, evaluate for tracheal deviation and involvement of the oropharynx, airway, and pharynx. Often the tongue, base of tongue, and supraglottic larynx are involved. Secure the airways in patients with high risk of obstruction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Risk of Infection:</strong> Approximately 16%. Infection may result in additional swelling, pain, fever, and localized erythema.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk of Hemorrhage:</strong> Approximately 13%. Consider this complication in an enlarging painful cystic hygroma in a patient with evidence of acute blood loss.</p>

                        <h3>Medical Care</h3>
                        <p>The medical treatment includes injection of sclerosing agents and/or steroids.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Treat an infection with intravenous antibiotics and perform definitive surgery once the infection has resolved.</li>
                            <li>Some infected cystic hygromas may improve with use of a sclerosing agent, such as <strong>OK-432</strong> (contains penicillin and streptococci).</li>
                            <li><strong>Absolute alcohol</strong> as a sclerosing agent has been used with some success; works well in vascular malformations.</li>
                            <li>If unresectable lesions are small cysts, they may not respond to sclerosis. Recurrent disease may also respond poorly.</li>
                            <li>Medical therapies are being studied for in utero application to avoid delivery difficulties.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Surgical Care</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>mainstay of therapy is surgical excision</strong>.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The goal is to remove the lymphangioma completely or as much as possible, sparing all vital neurovascular structures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> Premature infants of small size and those with involvement of crucial neurovascular structures (eg, facial nerve). In such infants, <strong>delay surgery until the child is aged 2 years</strong> to allow growth to facilitate excision without increased morbidity.</li>
                            <li>Many newborns who have cervical hygromas with stable airways and food ways can be observed (especially parotid hygromas).</li>
                            <li><strong>Do not attempt drainage</strong> of the cyst because it increases the risk of infection and causes increased difficulty during resection (thin walls are hard to locate when not fluid filled).</li>
                            <li>Tracheotomy may be necessary to secure the airway when obstruction is observed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Complications of Excision</h3>
