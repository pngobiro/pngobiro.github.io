                            <p>Although humans consume a variety of carbohydrates, digestion breaks down complex carbohydrates into a few simple monomers (monosaccharides) for metabolism: glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose constitutes about 80% of the products and is the primary structure that is distributed to cells in the tissues, where it is broken down or stored as glycogen.</p>
                            <p>In aerobic respiration, the main form of cellular respiration used by humans, glucose and oxygen are metabolized to release energy, with carbon dioxide and water as by products. Most of the fructose and galactose travel to the liver, where they can be converted to glucose.</p>

                                        <strong>Step 1: Phosphorylation of glucose</strong><br>
                                        In the first step of glycolysis, the glucose is initiated or primed for the subsequent steps by phosphorylation at the <span class="math-inline">C_6</span> carbon. The process involves the transfer of phosphate from the ATP to glucose forming Glucose-6-phosphate in the presence of the enzyme hexokinase. This step is also accompanied by considerable loss of energy as heat.

                                        Glucose 6-phosphate is reversibly isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate by the enzyme Phosphohexoisomerase. This reaction involves a shift of the carbonyl oxygen from C1 to C2, thus converting an aldose into a ketose.

                                        This step is the second priming step of glycolysis, where fructose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-1, 6-diphosphate in the presence of the enzyme phosphofructokinase. Like in Step 1, the phosphate is transferred from ATP while some amount of energy is lost in the form of heat as well.

                                        <strong>Step 4: Cleavage of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate</strong><br>
                                        This step involves the unique cleavage of the C-C bond in the fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate. The enzyme fructose diphosphate aldolase catalyzes the cleavage of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate between <span class="math-inline">C_3</span> and <span class="math-inline">C_4</span> resulting in two different triose phosphates: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an aldose) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a ketose).

                                        Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can be readily degraded in the subsequent steps of glycolysis, but dihydroxyacetone phosphate cannot be. Thus, it is isomerized into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate instead. In this step, dihydroxyacetone phosphate is isomerized into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the presence of the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase.

                                        Step 6 is one of the three energy-conserving or forming steps of glycolysis. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is converted into 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate by the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase). In this process, NAD⁺ is reduced to coenzyme NADH by the H⁻ from glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate.

                                        This step is the ATP-generating step of glycolysis. It involves the transfer of phosphate group from the 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase, thus producing ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate.

                                        This is the second energy-generating (ATP) step of glycolysis. Phosphoenolpyruvate is converted into an enol form of pyruvate by the enzyme pyruvate kinase.

                            <h3>Pyruvic Acid</h3>
                            <p>Pyruvic acid (<span class="math-inline">CH_3COCOOH</span>) is the simplest of the alpha-keto acids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate, the conjugate base, <span class="math-inline">CH_3COCOO^-</span>, is a key intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell.</p>
                            <p>Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry. It is the output of the metabolism of glucose known as glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate, which are then used to provide further energy, in one of two ways. Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle).</p>
                            <p>Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis.</p>
                            
                            <p>If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactate in animals and ethanol in plants and microorganisms. Pyruvate from glycolysis is converted by fermentation to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme NADH in lactate fermentation, or to acetaldehyde (with the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase) and then to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.</p>

                                <h3>Gluconeogenesis</h3>
                                <p>Gluconeogenesis is the reverse process of glycolysis. It involves the conversion of non-carbohydrate molecules into glucose. The non-carbohydrate molecules that are converted in this pathway include pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, alanine, and glutamine.</p>
                                <p>This process occurs when there are lowered amounts of glucose. The liver is the primary location of gluconeogenesis, but some also occurs in the kidney. The liver is the organ that breaks down the various non-carbohydrate molecules and sends them out to other organs and tissues to be used in Gluconeogenesis.</p>
                                <p>This pathway is regulated by multiple different molecules. Glucagon, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and ATP encourage gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is inhibited by AMP, ADP, and insulin.</p>

                                <h3>Glycogenolysis</h3>
                                <p>Glycogenolysis refers to the breakdown of glycogen. In the liver, muscles, and the kidney, this process occurs to provide glucose when necessary. A single glucose molecule is cleaved from a branch of glycogen, and is transformed into glucose-1-phosphate during this process. This molecule can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate, an intermediate in the glycolysis pathway.</p>
                                <p>Glucagon in the liver stimulates glycogenolysis when the blood glucose is lowered, known as hypoglycemia. The glycogen in the liver can function as a backup source of glucose between meals. Adrenaline stimulates the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscle during exercise. In the muscles, glycogen ensures a rapidly accessible energy source for movement.</p>

                                <h3>Glycogenesis</h3>
                                <p>Glycogenesis refers to the process of synthesizing glycogen. In humans, excess glucose is converted to glycogen via this process. Glycogen is a highly branched structure, consisting of glucose, in the form of glucose-6-phosphate, linked together. The branching of glycogen increases its solubility, and allows for a higher number of glucose molecules to be accessible for breakdown.</p>
                                <p>Glycogenesis occurs primarily in the liver, skeletal muscles, and kidney. The Glycogenesis pathway consumes energy, like most synthetic pathways, because an ATP and a UTP are consumed for each molecule of glucose introduced.</p>

                                <p>The pentose phosphate pathway (also called the phosphogluconate pathway and the hexose monophosphate shunt) is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides.</p>
                                <p>While the pentose phosphate pathway does involve oxidation of glucose, its primary role is anabolic rather than catabolic. The pathway is especially important in red blood cells (erythrocytes).</p>

This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in the body that can lead to health problems, some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.</p>
