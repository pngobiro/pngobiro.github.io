                                    <p>Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing fats. The majority of lipids found in the human body from ingesting food are triglycerides and cholesterol.</p>

                            <p>Lipid metabolism is often considered as the digestion and absorption process of dietary fat; however, there are two sources of fats that organisms can use to obtain energy: from consumed dietary fats and from stored fat. Vertebrates (including humans) use both sources of fat to produce energy for organs such as the heart to function.</p>
                            <p>Since lipids are hydrophobic molecules, they need to be solubilized before their metabolism can begin. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system.</p>

Triglycerides present on the VLDL undergo lipolysis by the cellular lipases of target tissues, which yields glycerol and free fatty acids.

                            <p>In the body, stores of fat are referred to as adipose tissue. Intracellular triglycerides are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Each step of hydrolysis leads to the removal of one fatty acid.</p>

                            <p>Lipid metabolism disorders are illnesses where trouble occurs in breaking down or synthesizing fats. These disorders are associated with an increase in the concentrations of plasma lipids in the blood such as LDL cholesterol, VLDL, and triglycerides which most commonly lead to cardiovascular diseases.</p>
                            <p>As a result of such defects, lipids may become deposited in the walls of blood vessels, which can lead to <strong>atherosclerosis</strong> (a disease characterized by abnormal thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries).</p>
