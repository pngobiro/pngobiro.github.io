                                    <p>The body maintains a relatively large free amino acid pool in the blood (approximately 35-65 mg/decilitre), even during fasting; tissues have continuous access to individual amino acids for the synthesis of proteins and essential amino acid derivatives, such as neurotransmitters. The amino acid pool also provides the liver with substrates for gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. The free amino acid pool is derived from dietary amino acids and the proteolysis of body proteins. All useful nitrogen in the body is derived from amino acids.</p>

                            <p>Proteins in the body are constantly synthesized and degraded, partially draining and refilling the cellular amino acid pools.</p>
                            <p>As a source of energy, amino acid carbon skeletons are directly oxidized, or, in the starved state, converted to glucose and ketone bodies, and then oxidized.</p>
                            <p>Nitrogen must be removed (deamination) before the carbon skeletons of amino acids are oxidized.</p>
                            <p>The liver is the major site of amino acid oxidation, but most tissues can oxidize the branched chain amino acids (i.e., leucine, isoleucine, and valine).</p>

                            <p>Amino acid metabolism disorders are hereditary metabolic disorders. Hereditary disorders occur when parents pass the defective genes that cause these disorders to their children. In most hereditary metabolic disorders, both parents of the affected child carry a copy of the abnormal gene. Because usually two copies of the abnormal gene are necessary for the disorder to occur, usually neither parent has the disorder. Some hereditary metabolic disorders are X-linked, which means only one copy of the abnormal gene can cause the disorder in boys. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and have many functions in the body. Hereditary disorders of amino acid processing (metabolism) can result from defects either in the breakdown of amino acids or in the body's ability to get amino acids into cells. Because these disorders cause symptoms early in life, newborns are routinely screened for several common amino acid disorders. Newborns should be commonly screened for</p>

                            <h3>Phenylketonuria (PKU)</h3>
                            <p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by decreased activity of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), is an enzyme that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine, a precursor (something that precedes: In biological processes, a substance from which another, usually more active or mature substance is formed) of several important hormones and skin, hair, and eye pigments.</p>
                            <p>Decreased PAH activity results in, accumulation of phenylalanine and a decreased amount of tyrosine and other metabolites. Phenylalanine is consequently converted to phenyl pyruvic acid (a ketone) which accumulates in the blood hence causing PKU. Persistent high levels of phenyl pyruvic acid in the blood in turn result in progressive developmental delay, a small head circumference, behaviour disturbances, and seizures. Due to a decreased amount of the pigment melanin, persons with PKU tend to have lighter features, such as blond hair and blue eyes.</p>

                            <p>Tyrosinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by disruptions in the multistep process that breaks down the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins. If untreated, tyrosine and its byproducts build up in tissues and organs, which can lead to serious health problems.</p>
                            <p>Classic (hepatorenal or type I) tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency of fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase enzyme (FAH), the last enzyme in tyrosine catabolism.</p>
                            <p>Symptoms and physical findings associated with tyrosinemia type I appear in the first months of life and include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), fever, diarrhea, vomiting, an abnormally enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), and yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes</p>

                            <p>Homocystinuria is caused by a defect in cystathionine beta-synthase (or β-synthase), an enzyme that participates in the metabolism of methionine, which leads to an accumulation of homocysteine. Symptoms include a pronounced flush of the cheeks, a tall, thin frame, lens dislocation, vascular disease, and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis).

                            <p>Non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a rare, genetic, metabolic disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme system that breaks down the amino acid glycine, resulting in an accumulation of glycine in the body's tissues and fluids.</p>
                            <p>Non-ketotic hyperglycinemia is caused by elevated levels of the neurotransmitter glycine in the central nervous system, which in turn are caused by a defect in the enzyme system responsible for cleaving the amino acid glycine.</p>

                            <h3>Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)</h3>
                            <p>Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare but serious inherited condition. It means the body cannot process certain amino acids (the "building blocks" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine. Normally, our bodies break down protein foods such as meat and fish into amino acids</p>
                            <p>Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a disorder of branched-chain amino acid metabolism that leads to the accumulation of leucine, isoleucine, valine and their corresponding oxoacids in body fluids one result being a characteristic maple syrup smell to the urine of some patients. The classic form of MSUD presents in infancy with lethargy and progressive neurological deterioration characterized by seizures and coma. Unlike most organic acidemias, prominent acidemia is rare. Treatment involves restricting proteins and feeding with formulas deficient in the branched-chain amino acids. Persons with MSUD may have intellectual disability despite therapy, but early and careful treatment can result in normal intellectual development. Milder forms of MSUD may be treated with simple protein restriction or administration of thiamin (vitamin B₁)</p>

                            <h3>Alkaptonuria</h3>
                            <p>Alkaptonuria, or "black urine disease", is a very rare inherited disorder that prevents the body from fully breaking down two protein building blocks (amino acids) called tyrosine and phenylalanine. It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited disorder. It occurs when your body cannot produce enough of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase (HGD). This enzyme is used to break down a toxic substance called homogentisic acid.</p>
                            <p>In alkaptonuria the body is unable to utilize homogentisate, an intermediate of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This metabolic aberration results in accumulation of homogentisate and its oxidation products in the body and their abnormal excretion in the urine. Due to oxidation of homogentisate, the urine becomes dark brown or black when exposed to air. In childhood, alkaptonuria is usually benign and there are no associated physical disturbances. In older individuals the disease may result in osteoporosis, arthritis, and changes in pigmentation. The occurrence of black urine has been known for centuries.</p>

                            <h3>Albinism</h3>
                            <p>Albinism is a rare group of genetic disorders that cause the skin, hair, or eyes to have little or no black color. Albinism is also associated with vision problems.</p>
                            <p>Albinism, the most easily recognized error of amino acid metabolism, results from an inherited inability of the body to form the pigment melanin. Ordinarily, tyrosine is converted to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) which in turn undergoes numerous chemical changes to form melanin. Grossly, albinism may be subdivided into total albinism and partial albinism or partial baldness. In the former there is a lack of pigmentation throughout the entire body while in partial albinism the absence of pigment is limited to well-defined areas of the skin. The lack of pigmentation in total albinos is so striking that their existence has been recorded since ancient times.</p>

                                    <p>Albinism is a genetic disorder that results in decreased production of a pigment called melanin in the skin, hair, and eyes, resulting in light color or no color. There are several genetic mutations that cause albinism. This condition occurs throughout the world; it affects 1 in 20,000 Americans and is more common in other parts of the world, such as in Zimbabwe, Africa, where 1 in 1,000 people have some form of albinism. Currently there is no cure for albinism, however it can be managed using sunscreen, protective clothing, eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, or eye surgery for eye abnormalities. The impact of this condition on people's lives can be devastating, so it is important to foster a positive and tolerant environment to promote the emotional and mental well-being of those who are affected.</p>
