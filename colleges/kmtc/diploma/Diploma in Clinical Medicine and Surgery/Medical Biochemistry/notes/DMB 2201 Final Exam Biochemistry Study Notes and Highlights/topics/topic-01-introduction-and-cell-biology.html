                            <p>Biochemistry is the study of the chemical basis of life. A biomolecule or biological molecule can be defined as a molecules or organic compounds essential for life. Biomolecules are organic compounds which are compounds of carbon hydrogen and oxygen but other elements include nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus are also common. The cell is the basic unit of life and the enzyme catalyzed reactions that take place within the cell that are essential for life are called metabolism. Metabolism can be anabolism which is buildup of biological molecules from simple precursors and uses energy as ATP and catabolism which is breakdown of complex biomolecules into simple precursors like respiration which causes energy synthesis as ATP.</p>

                            <h3>Structural hierarchy of an organism</h3>
                            <p>The bio-monomers are used to form macromolecules (biopolymers) by covalent bonding. The macromolecules (proteins, Lipids, nucleic acids and polysaccharides) form supramolecular assemblies (e.g. membranes) which in turn organize into organelles, cells, tissues, organs and finally the whole organism.</p>

                            <h3>Functional groups</h3>
                            <p>These are the reactive groups in biomolecules and they determine most of the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds. Functional groups are also important in chemical identification of the different biomolecules. Carbon can form single, double and triple with other carbons and can form carbon chains like linear, branched and circular. It can also bond with other elements like nitrogen, oxygen, Sulphur e.t.c</p>

                            <h3>Structure of biological membranes</h3>
                            <p>The fluid mosaic model was first proposed by S.J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson in 1972 to explain the structure of the plasma membrane. The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of components —including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—that gives the membrane a fluid character. Plasma membranes range from 5 to 10 nm in thickness. The proportions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane vary with cell type. For example, myelin contains 18% protein and 76% lipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76% protein and 24% lipid. The major components are the phospholipid bilayer with the polar head groups facing outward towards the aqueous solution and the hydrophobic tails facing each other. The membrane is hydrophobic and can allow only non-polar substances to dissolve through. Polar substances have to be transported by specific transport proteins.</p>

                            <p>Proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes. Integral proteins (some specialized types are called integrins) are, as their name suggests, integrated completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer. Single-pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 20-25 amino acids. Some span only part of the membrane—associating with a single layer—while others stretch from one side of the membrane to the other, and are exposed on either side. Some complex proteins are composed of up to 12 segments of a single protein, which are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane.</p>

                            <p>Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2-60 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other and self and non self. The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane: The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane describes the plasma membrane as a fluid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane called glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic and attracts large amounts of water to the surface of the cell. This aids in the interaction of the cell with its watery environment and in the cell's ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water.</p>

                                    <p>A drug passes through membranes more readily if it is uncharged. Thus, for a weak acid, the uncharged, protonated HA (in acidic solution e.g. in stomach) can permeate through membranes, and A- (in basic solution e.g. in the small intestines) cannot.

                            <p>Aggrecans are a type of proteoglycan, which refers to a molecule made of carbohydrates (repeating disaccharide units known as glycosaminoglycans or GAGs) attached to a protein core. Aggrecan is specific to cartilage and forms large aggregates with hyaluronic acid. The aggregates are negatively charged and pull water into the ECM which allows cartilage to resist compressive forces more easily. Collagen fibres provide the tissue with very high tensile strength and ensure that aggrecan molecules are trapped in the ECM. Elastic fibres (elastin) provide elasticity and flexibility. Therefore, depending on the function of the cartilage the ratio of collagen fibres to elastic fibres changes.</p>

At the interface between an epithelium and Connective tissue, the matrix forms the basal lamina, a thin but tough mat that plays an important part in controlling cell behavior</p>
                            <p>Two main classes of extracellular macromolecules that make up the matrix are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are linked to protein to form proteoglycans and fibrous proteins of two functional types:</p>

Each polypeptide subunit or alpha chain is twisted into a left handed helix of three residues per turn, 3 of these α-chains are then wounded into a right handed super helix forming a rod-like molecule of 1.4 nm in diameter and about 300 nm long. A striking characteristic of collagen is the occurrence of glycine residues at every third position of the triple helical portion of the alpha chain.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Glycine</strong> is the only amino acid small enough to be accommodated in the limited space available down the central core of the triple helix. This repeating structure represented as (Gly-x-y)n is an absolute requirement for the formation of triple helix. While x and y can be any other amino acid, about 100 of the X positions are proline and 100 of the Y positions are hydroxyl proline. These two amino acids provide rigidity on the collagen molecule. Collagen fibers are further stabilized by the formation of covalent cross-links. These cross links form through the action of lysyl oxidase, a copper dependant enzyme. Type IV collagen the best characterized example of a collagen which is an important component of basement membranes where it forms a mesh like network.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Elastin</strong>- It is a connective tissue protein that is responsible for properties of extensibility and elastic recoil in tissues. Although not as widespread as collagen, elastin is present in large amounts, particularly in tissues that require these physical properties e.g. lung, blood vessels and elastic ligaments and small amounts in ear and skin.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Fibrillin</strong> is a large glycoprotein (about 350 kDa) that is a structural component of microfibrils 10-12 nm fibers found in many tissues.

                                    <p>Nucleus is the largest cellular organelle, surrounded by a double membrane (nuclear envelope). The outer membrane is continuous with the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. At certain intervals, the two nuclear membranes have nuclear pores with a diameter of about 90 nm. These pores permit the free passage of the products synthesized in the nucleus into the surrounding cytoplasm. Nucleus contains DNA, that stores genetic information. Eukaryotic DNA is associated with basic protein (histones) in the ratio of 1:1, to form nucleosomes. An assembly of nucleosomes constitutes chromatin fibres of chromosomes. Thus, a single human chromosome is composed of about a million nucleosomes. The number of chromosomes is a characteristic feature of the species. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), compactly packed in the nucleus. The nucleus of the eukaryotic cell contains a dense body known as nucleolus. It is rich in RNA, particularly the ribosomal RNA which enters the cytosol through nuclear pores, it is site of ribosome synthesis. The ground material of the nucleus is often referred to as nucleoplasm. The chromosomes mostly appear as threadlike structures in the nucleus called chromatin and only appear as condensed chromosomes during cell division.</p>

                                    <h4>Golgi apparatus</h4>
                                    <p>The Golgi apparatus has flattened cisternae similar to those of the ER but arranged in a stack. Vesicles that bud from the ER with cargo destined for secretion, for the plasma membrane or for other organelles, fuse with the Golgi stack at the cis end. The proteins, lipids and sterols synthesized in the ER are exported to the Golgi apparatus to complete maturation (for example, the final stages of membrane protein glycosylation occurs here) this is called posttranscriptional modification. Eg. phosphorylation, glycosylation, sulfation, addition of galactose and sialic acid, append proteins to glycosaminoglycans, thus creating proteoglycans. Protein modifications may form a signal sequence that determines the final destination of the protein. For example, the Golgi apparatus adds a mannose-6-phosphate label to proteins destined for lysosomes. The mature products are then sorted into vesicles that bud from the Golgi for transport to their final destination from the trans end. Golgi proteins control the morphology of the Golgi and vesicle trafficking. Achondrogenesis type 1A is caused by mutation of golgin GMAP-210, which disrupts the Golgi architecture, particularly in bone cells. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite used experimentally to disrupt the secretion pathway as a method of testing Golgi function.</p>

                                    <p>The mitochondria are the centres for the cellular respiration and energy metabolism. They are regarded as the power houses of the cell and site for aerobic respiration and they have variable size and shape. The inner membrane is folded to form cristae (Latin - crests) which occupy a larger surface area. The internal chamber of mitochondria is referred to as matrix or mitosol. The components of electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (flavoprotein, cytochromes b, c1, c, a and a3 and coupling factors) are buried in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The matrix contains several enzymes concerned with the energy metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids (e.g. citric acid cycle, β-oxidation). The matrix enzymes also participate in the synthesis of heme and urea. Mitochondria are the principal producers of ATP in the aerobic cells.</p>

Lysosomes are actively involved in digestion of cellular substances—namely proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Lysosomal enzymes are categorized as hydrolases. These include the following enzymes (with substrate in brackets) α-glucosidase (glycogen) Cathepsins (proteins), Lipases (lipids), Ribonuclease (sRNA). The pH of the lysosomal matrix is more acidic (pH < 5) than the cytosol (pH-7) and this facilitates the degradation of different compounds</p>

                            <p><strong>Ribosomes</strong>- They are the site for protein synthesis. They use Messenger-RNA as a template for synthesis of peptides. They have a small subunit and a large subunit. They are two main types 70S (30S and 50S subunits are found in prokaryotes while the 80S ribosomes (40S and 60S subunits are found in eukaryotes). In eukaryotes ribosomes found free in cytoplasm are used to synthesize internal proteins while those bound to RER synthesize proteins for external and membrane proteins (except for lysosomal proteins).</p>

These tubular structures resist bending and stretching, and are polar with plus and minus ends. Their minus ends are anchored in the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC), a complex of centrioles, γ-tubulin and other proteins, with their plus ends extending into the cell. At their plus ends, repeated cycles of assembly and dis assembly permit rapid changes in length. Microtubules form a 'highway', transporting organelles and vesicles through the cytoplasm. The two major microtubule associated motor proteins (kinesin and dynein) allow movement of cargo towards the plus and minus ends, respectively. During cell division, the MTOC forms the mitotic spindle. Drugs that disrupt microtubule assembly (e.g. colchicine and vinca alkaloids and albendazole binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of β-tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules) or stabilize microtubules (taxanes) preferentially kill dividing cells by preventing mitosis. They have a 9+0 for non-motile forms and 9+2 structure for motile forms.</span>

They make cell-to-cell contacts with adjacent cells via desmosomes, and with basement matrix via hemidesmosomes. Their function is structural integrity; they are prominent in cellular tissues under stress and their disruption in genetic disease can cause structural defects or cell collapse. More than 40 different types of proteins polymerize to form intermediate filaments specific to particular cell types. For example, keratin intermediate fibres are found only in epithelial cells whilst vimentin is in mesothelial (fibroblastic) cells. Lamin intermediate filaments form the nuclear membrane skeleton in most cells.</span>

The actin microfilament network controls cell shape, prevents cellular deformation, and is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, in cell movements such as crawling and cytokinesis (cell division), and in intracellular vesicle transport. Bundles of actin filaments form the structural core of cellular protrusions such as microvilli, lamellipodia and filopodia. Actin microfilament bundles within the cell can associate with myosin II to form contractile stress fibres, similar to muscle sarcomeres. Stress fibres are often found as circumferential belts around the apical surfaces of epithelial cells where cells associate with adjacent cells via adherens junctions, permitting reaction to external stresses as a cellular sheet. Stress fibres also form where actin interacts via accessory proteins with the extracellular matrix at sites of focal adhesion. This occurs when cells move and is prominent during inflammation, wound healing and metastasis. During cytokinesis, actin-myosin II bundles form the contractile ring separating dividing cells. Like microtubules, microfilaments are polar, so can be used to transport secretory vesicles, endosomes and mitochondria, powered by motor proteins, including myosin I and V</span>

Centrioles play a role in organizing microtubules that serve as the cell's skeletal system. They help determine the locations of the nucleus and other organelles within the cell. They also form spindle fibres.</p>
