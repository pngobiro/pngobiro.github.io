                            <p>There are different systems for communicating with the internal and external environments. Internal communication involves mainly the nervous and endocrine systems; these are important in the maintenance of homeostasis and regulation of vital body functions. Communication with the external environment involves the special senses, and verbal and non-verbal activities, and all of these also depend on the nervous system.</p>
                            <p>All communication systems involve receiving, collating and responding to appropriate information.</p>

                            <h3>Internal communication</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Communication and the nervous system</h4>
                            <p>The nervous system is a rapid communication system. The main components are shown in Figure 1.8.</p>
                            
                            <p>The central nervous system consists of:</p>

                            <p>The somatic (common) senses are pain, touch, heat and cold, and they arise following stimulation of specialized sensory receptors at nerve endings found throughout the skin.</p>

                            <h4>Communication and the endocrine system</h4>
                            <p>The endocrine system consists of a number of endocrine glands situated in different parts of the body. They synthesise and secrete chemical messengers called hormones that circulate round the body in the blood. Hormones stimulate target glands or tissues, influencing metabolic and other cellular activities and regulating body growth and maturation. Endocrine glands detect and respond to levels of particular substances in the blood, including specific hormones. Changes in blood hormone levels are controlled by negative feedback mechanisms (Fig. 1.3).</p>
                            <p>The endocrine system provides slower and more precise control of body functions than the nervous system.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Verbal communication</strong>- Sound is a means of communication and is produced in the larynx as a result of blowing air through the space between the vocal cords during expiration. Speech is the manipulation of sound by contraction of the muscles of the throat and cheeks, and movements of the tongue and lower jaw.</p>

                            <p>Cellular receptors can broadly categorize into internal receptors, cell-surface receptors, ion channel receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and enzyme-linked receptors. While most cell receptor binding is by a chemical ligand, two notable exceptions are viruses which are pathogenic that can bind host cellular receptors to infect a cell, and bacterial components, which can bind receptors on immune cells to cause an immune response. Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling.</p>
                            
                            <p>Chemical signals are released by a signaling cell and received by a target cell. Target cells have proteins called receptors, which bind to signaling molecules and cause a response. Signaling molecules that bind to receptors are called ligands. Ligands and receptors are specific for each other; a receptor will typically bind only to its specific ligand. There are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: autocrine signaling, paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions</p>

                            <h3>Types of cell receptors</h3>
                            <p><strong>(i). Receptors that are ion channels</strong>- Facilitated diffusion of ions takes place through proteins, or assemblies of proteins, embedded in the plasma membrane. These transmembrane proteins form a water-filled channel through which the ion can pass down its concentration gradient. The transmembrane channels that permit facilitated diffusion can be opened or closed. They are said to be "gated"; some types of gated ion channels:</p>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">ligand-gated</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Ligand-gated ion channels</h4>
                            <p>Many ion channels open or close in response to binding a small signaling molecule or "ligand". Some ion channels are gated by extracellular ligands; some by intracellular ligands. In both cases, the ligand is not the substance that is transported when the channel opens.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>External ligands</strong> - External ligands (shown here in green) bind to a site on the extracellular side of the channel.</p>
                            <p><strong>Receptor-operated channels</strong> - These are found in the post-synaptic membrane and open when they bind the neurotransmitter. Example: NMDA receptors. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These are not channels but they trigger a release of Ca from the endoplasmic reticulum as described above. They are activated by various hormones and neurotransmitters (as well as bitter substances on taste cells in the tongue).</p>

                                    <p><strong>Acetylcholine (ACh)</strong>. The binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at certain synapses opens channels that admit Na and initiate a nerve impulse or muscle contraction.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)</strong>. Binding of GABA at certain synapses designated GABA in the central nervous system admits Cl ions into the cell and inhibits the creation of a nerve impulse</p>

                                    <h4>Internal ligands</h4>
                                    <p>Internal ligands bind to a site on the channel protein exposed to the cytosol. <strong>Examples</strong>: "Second messengers", like cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), regulate channels involved in the initiation of impulses in neurons responding to odors and light respectively. ATP is needed to open the channel that allows chloride (<span class="math-inline">Cl<sup>-</sup></span>) and bicarbonate (<span class="math-inline">HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></span>) ions out of the cell. This channel is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although the energy liberated by the hydrolysis of ATP is needed to open the channel, this is not an example of active transport; the ions diffuse through the open channel following their concentration gradient.</p>

                            <p><strong>(ii). G-protein-linked receptors</strong> bind to a ligand and activate an associated G-protein. The activated G-protein then interacts with a nearby membrane protein, which may be an ion channel or an enzyme. All G-protein-linked receptors have seven transmembrane domains, but each receptor has a specific extracellular domain and G-protein-binding site. G proteins are so-called because they bind the guanine nucleotides GDP and GTP. They are heterotrimers (i.e., made of three different subunits) associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane and transmembrane receptors of hormones, etc. These are called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The three subunits are: Gα, which carries the binding site for the nucleotide. At least 20 different kinds of Gα molecules are found in mammalian cells, Gβ, and Gγ</p>
                            
                            <p>In the inactive state, Gα has GDP in its binding site. When a hormone or other ligand binds to the associated GPCR, an allosteric change takes place in the receptor. This triggers an allosteric change in Gα causing GDP to leave and be replaced by GTP. GTP activates Gα causing it to dissociate from GβGγ (which remain linked as a dimer). Activated Gα in turn activates an effector molecule e.g. adenylyl cyclase - an enzyme in the inner face of the plasma membrane which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into the "second messenger" cyclic AMP (cAMP). Activated Gα is a GTPase so it quickly converts its GTP to GDP. This conversion, coupled with the return of the Gβ and Gγ subunits, restores the G protein to its inactive state.</p>

                                    <p>As its name suggests, it hydrolyzes phospholipids — specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) which is found in the inner layer of the plasma membrane.

It recruits Protein Kinase C (PKC) — a calcium-dependent kinase that phosphorylates many other proteins that bring about the changes in the cell. As its name suggests, activation of PKC requires calcium ions. These are made available by the action of the other second messenger — IP3- inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3): This soluble molecule diffuses through the cytosol and binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum causing the release of calcium ions (Ca) into the cytosol. The rise in intracellular calcium triggers the response.</p>
                                    <p>Example: The calcium rise is needed for NF-AT (the "nuclear factor of activated T cells") to turn on the appropriate genes in the nucleus. The remarkable ability of tacrolimus and cyclosporine to prevent graft rejection is due to their blocking this pathway. The binding of an antigen to its receptor on a B cell (the BCR) also generates the second messengers DAG and IP.</p>

                            </h2>

                            <p><strong>(iii). Enzyme-linked receptors</strong> are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. In some cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. Other enzyme-linked receptors have a small intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme. Enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helix in the peptide strand. One example of an enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor. A kinase is an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from ATP to another protein. The tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules. Tyrosine kinase receptors contain kinase - an enzyme which transfers phosphate molecules. In the case of tyrosine kinase, phosphate molecules are transferred to the amino acid tyrosine. When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain of a tyrosine kinase receptor, the receptor dimerises with its neighbouring receptor. Dimerisation triggers phosphorylation of the tyrosine molecules on the intracellular domain of the receptor. Phosphorylated tyrosine molecules are involved in many different signalling cascades which are crucial for various processes such as cell division and wound healing.</p>

                            <p><strong>(iv). Internal receptors</strong>- intracellular (or internal) receptors are found inside the cell, in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Their ligands tend to be small, hydrophobic (i.e. lipid-soluble) molecules, which can diffuse across the plasma membrane by themselves. Once inside the cell, these ligands bind to their specific intracellular receptor to form a ligand-receptor complex, which will then bind to DNA in the nucleus and directly affect gene transcription and protein synthesis. Like cell surface receptors, intracellular receptors also have three core domains. These comprise a ligand-binding domain, DNA binding domain and an amino terminus (which interacts with the gene transcription machinery). Examples of ligands which bind to intracellular receptors include sex hormones, thyroid hormones and the fat-soluble vitamins. endogenous ligands bind to receptors to gain access into cells, but viruses can also do the same. Instead of receptor binding triggering a physiological signalling cascade, a virus binding to, and hijacking, a receptor facilitates infection by granting the virus entry into the cell. For example, HIV infects CD4 T cells and macrophages by binding to their CD4 receptor. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, enters cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor found in various organs including the lung, heart and kidneys.</p>
