                            <h3>Glycolysis</h3>
                            <p>Glycolysis – is the oxidation of glucose to 2 pyruvate. It takes place in the cytosol of the cell. It occurs in 10 steps. Phases of Glycolysis- Glycolysis can be considered as a two part process. Firstly, energy is consumed to generate high energy intermediates, which then go on to release their energy during the second phase.</p>

                            <p>Anaerobic respiration takes place in tissues which are deficient of oxygen where in animals pyruvate id converted to L-lactic acid. The lactic acid is formed in muscles during strenuous exercise which causes muscle pain and fatigue. Accumulation of lactic acid in blood causes lactic acidosis. In yeast Pyruvate is converted to acetaldehyde and then to ethanol. In bacteria pyruvate is converted to other organic acids like D-lactic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, butanoic acid etc.</p>
                            
                            <p>In situations where cells' oxygen demands increase above supply (i.e. ischaemia), glycolysis will quickly occur, producing lactic acid. This may occur physiologically, such as in the muscles during intense exercise, or pathologically, for example in ischaemic heart disease or when a malignant tumour outgrows its blood supply.</p>

                                    <p>Symptoms typical of metabolic acidosis include nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and rapid breathing. Treatment is difficult, as there is little evidence to support the use of sodium bicarbonate solutions (to balance the pH) or direct removal of lactate (via haemofiltration). Treatment is therefore supportive and would depend on the aetiology; if medication is the cause it may need to be withdrawn and certain mitochondrial disorders may require adapted diets. Excessive anaerobic glycolysis produces large quantities of lactic acid. This can exit the cell and enter the bloodstream, and in sufficient amounts can cause lactic acidosis. At this point, serum pH is reduced which can lead to organ dysfunction if severe and untreated.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cancer and Glycolysis</strong>- Tumour cells have a very high rate of glycolysis. This is advantageous to the tumour if it outgrows its blood supply, as it can quickly produce energy from anaerobic glycolysis, allowing fast tumour growth. It is also clinically advantageous in the detection and treatment of cancer. PET scans depict radioactive glycolytic intermediates in cancer cells, allowing visual detection of metastases. Drugs targeted at glycolysis are also used in the treatment of cancer in chemotherapy. An example is imatinib (Gleevec) which reduces the synthesis of hexokinase so that less glucose is trapped in the cell.</p>

                            <p>Aerobic respiration- takes place in the mitochondria matrix. Pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria matrix from the cytosol and then converted to acetyl coenzyme A by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Acetylcoenzyme A (acetylCoA) joins the tricarboxylic acid pathway and through a series of oxidation reactions (loss of electrons and hydrogens) forms reducing equivalents NADH and <span class="math-inline">FADH<sub>2</sub></span> which donate their electrons to the electron transport chain</p>

                            <h3>Tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCA), Krebs cycle or citric acid pathway</h3>
                            <p>While the primary role of the TCA cycle is production of NADH and <span class="math-inline">FADH<sub>2</sub></span>, it also produces molecules that supply various biosynthetic processes. These enter or exit the cycle at various points depending on demand. For example, alpha-ketoglutarate can leave the cycle to be converted into amino acids, and succinate can be converted to haem synthesis.</p>
                            
                            <p>Each cycle produces:</p>

                            <p>Each molecule of glucose produces two molecules of pyruvate, which in turn produce two molecules of acetyl-coA. Therefore, each molecule of glucose produces double the net output of each cycle.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>The TCA Cycle is regulated</strong> Metabolites: Products of the cycle provide negative feedback on the enzymes that catalyse it. For example, NADH inhibits the majority of the enzymes found in the TCA cycle. Citrate: Inhibits phosphofructokinase, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This reduces the rate of production of pyruvate and therefore of acetyl-coA. Calcium: Accelerates the TCA cycle by stimulating the link reaction.</p>
                            <p><strong>Defects of the TCA Cycle</strong> - There are in fact no known defects of the TCA cycle that are compatible with life. This highlights the importance of this step in ATP production for sustaining life.</p>

                            <h3>Electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation</h3>
                            <p>Electron transport chain consists of four protein complexes I, II, III and IV embedded in the inner mitochondria membrane. Each contains structural features that allow complexes to readily accept and release electrons. Complex I accepts electrons from NADH and complex II from <span class="math-inline">FADH<sub>2</sub></span>. The electrons flow through a series of electron acceptors and donor including cytochromes and the final electron acceptor is oxygen which is converted to water. Oxygen accepts its electrons from complex IV (cytochrome oxidase). Inhibitors like cyanide, azide and carbon monoxide inhibit cytochrome oxidase and are lethal poisons. The electrons, meanwhile, combine with the hydrogen ions and oxygen to form water by Complex IV. However, this process is not perfect. Electrons can leak out of electron transport chain and can reduce oxygen, which can produce free radicals such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.</p>

                            <p><strong>Oxidative phosphorylation</strong> –as electrons flow through the electron transport chain they generate energy which pumps <span class="math-inline">H<sup>+</sup></span> ions from the matrix to the intermembrane space creation a proton gradient. This protons flow back into the mitochondria through complex V called ATP synthase enzyme providing energy to convert ADP + Pi to ATP through a phosphorylation reaction. Each NADH generates 3ATP and each <span class="math-inline">FADH<sub>2</sub></span> 2 ATP. Most ATP in the body is made in this way.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Uncouplers</strong> are inhibitors that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation but not the electron transport chain e.g. Pathological Uncoupling- Uncoupling can also occur pathologically. In contrast to uncoupling proteins, some chemicals increase the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to protons without a need of a protein. This is seen in 2,4-dinitrophenol poisoning, where the membrane becomes more permeable to protons. This is also seen in salicylate, which is a by-product of aspirin poisoning. Administration of these drugs results in overheating as the protons diffuse through the membrane and not through ATP synthase. This means less ATP is produced, in favour of heat.</p>

Examples of such functions include: breathing, circulation, digestion and absorption of nutrients and cellular processes. The BMR is controlled by thyroid hormones triiodothyronine <span class="math-inline">(T<sub>3</sub>)</span> and thyroxine <span class="math-inline">(T<sub>4</sub>)</span> Hyperthyroidism causes weight loss, increased heart rate and blood pressure, hand tremors. Hypothyroidism causes weight gain, low heart rate, hypotension, enlarged thyroid.</p>

                            <p>Gluconeogenesis – synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. The substrates are lactate, amino acids, glycerol, propionic acid etc. the main glucogenic organ is the liver and kidney. Blood glucose level should be maintained within the normal range. If the blood sugar level drops during starvation, glucagon is released and stimulates gluconeogenesis which is almost the reverse of glycolysis except for the three non reversible reactions. E.g. the liner converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose catalyzed by glucose 6 phosphatase enzyme and the glucose is released to the blood to prevent hypoglycemia. The muscles lack this enzyme so gluconeogenesis in muscles end with glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis is one the major contributors to the hyperglycaemia seen in diabetic patients as cells 'feel' starved of nutrients and so send out hormonal signals to increase glucose levels in the blood via gluconeogenesis.</p>
