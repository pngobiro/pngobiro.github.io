                            <p>Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology. Other biocatalysts are catalytic RNA molecules, called ribozymes. Enzymes that work inside the cells that synthesise them are called intracellular enzymes and those which work outside the cells that synthesize it are extracellular enzymes.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Constitutive enzymes</strong> are These enzymes are produced in constant amounts without regard to the physiological demand or the concentration of the substrate. <strong>Inducible enzyme</strong> one whose production requires or is stimulated by a specific small molecule, the inducer, which is the substrate of the Enzymes or of a substance resembling its substrate. Enzymes can regulate metabolic pathways and these enzymes are regulatory enzymes which are usually allosteric enzymes. In some genetic disorders, there may be a deficiency one or several enzymes (E.g. albinism).</p>
                            
                            <p>According to IUPAC enzymes have a common name which we use for day to day use like trypsin and a systematic name based on the reaction they catalyse. The systematic name removes confusion and enzymes are classified into 7 classes and an EC: number like EC:2,3,4,1 where the first number is the class, second the subclass, third sub-sub-class and the fourth the serial number of the enzyme.</p>

                            <p>Enzymes are globular proteins and they may be tertiary or quaternary protein. They are larger than their substrate and the substrate binds to a specific site called the active site. The active site has a substrate binding site and the catalytic site. The active site is a hydrophobic cleft on the enzyme lined by amino acids required for substrate binding and catalysis. The active site has specific symmetry that is responsible for its specificity. Even though most of the enzymes contain thousands of amino acids only 2-4 amino acids are directly involved in the catalysis.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Allosteric site:</strong> Additional sites other than the active site for the binding of allosteric modulators. Allosteric modulators are involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity and can be activators or inhibitors.</p>
                            
                            <p>Simple enzymes contain amino acids only in their active form while complex proteins contain a cofactor to be active. The protein part alone (apoenzyme) is inactive and combined to the cofactor forms the holoenzyme (active).</p>

                            <h3>Mode of action of enzymes</h3>
                            <p>the enzyme must bind to the substrate at the active site to form an enzyme substrate complex before it is converted to product. Enzymes find an alternative pathway in converting substrate to product. Enzyme reduces the activation energy of the reaction. The minimum energy that must be input to a chemical system, containing potential reactants, in order for a chemical reaction to occur. For a chemical reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate, there should exist an appreciable number of molecules with energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. The activation energy of a reaction is denoted as <strong>Ea</strong>.</p>

                            <p>enzymes work best at the optimum temperature. Low temperatures below optimum deactivate the enzyme and high temperatures above optimum denature the enzymes. In humans the optimum temperature is close to normal body temperature. Enzymes are very sensitive to heat and temperature. (They are <strong>thermo-labile</strong>.). At higher temperature (60-70°C), the enzyme is destroyed or denatured. Do you know an enzyme active at very high temperature? It is Taq-Polymerase used in PCR reactions. The optimum temperature for Taq-polymerase is 75 to 80°C.</p>

                            <p>it is a substance that slows down or blocks the catalytic activity of an enzyme. inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Inhibitors can bind reversibly of irreversibly.</p>

                            <p>Feedback inhibition is a specific type of allosteric enzymatic activity regulation mechanism in cells. In some multi-enzyme pathways, the regulatory enzyme is specifically inhibited by the end product of the pathway whenever the concentration of the end product exceeds the cell's requirements. This type of regulation by the end product inhibiting to the first enzyme of the multi-enzymatic pathway is called feedback inhibition. Example of allosteric feedback inhibition is the biosynthesis of L-isoleucine from L-threonine in bacteria</p>

                            <h3>Feedback regulation</h3>
                            <p>A type of enzymatic activity regulation. Here the end product of an enzymatic pathway directly inhibit the synthesis of concerned enzyme by interfering with the gene of that enzyme. Enzyme is not directly inhibited by the end product. End product reduces the concentration of enzyme by inhibiting the synthesis of new enzyme molecules. Best example is the reduction of HMG CoA reductase enzyme by dietary cholesterol which is the key rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.</p>

                            <h3>Isoenzymes</h3>
                            <p>Isoenzymes (also known as isozymes) are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same chemical reaction. Believed to be originating from closely linked genes or from multiple gene loci. Evolution from a single form possibly due to long-term mutations. They vary with respect to their kinetic parameters, electrophoretic mobility, and localization. They all have independent action. E.g. Lactate dehydrogenase have 5 isoenzymes (LDH1, LDH2, LDH3, LDH4 &amp; LDH5). They can be used to identify the specific affected tissues. They can be differentiated from each other and can be clinically quantified in the lab. Phosphodiesterase enzymes are found in a number of isoenzymes inhibited by different substances and found in different tissues in the body.</p>
