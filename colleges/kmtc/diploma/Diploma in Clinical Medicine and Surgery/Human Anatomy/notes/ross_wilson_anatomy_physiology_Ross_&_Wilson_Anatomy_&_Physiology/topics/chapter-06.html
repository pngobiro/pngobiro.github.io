                            <p>The body cells are bathed in interstitial (tissue) fluid, which leaks constantly out of the bloodstream through the permeable walls of blood capillaries. It is therefore very similar in composition to blood plasma. Most of the fluid escaping from the bloodstream is reabsorbed into the venous ends of the blood capillaries, but the excess, along with any particulate matter including cell debris and bacteria, is removed by a network of thin-walled lymphatic capillaries. This prevents the tissues from becoming swollen, but as the drained fluids are filtered through lymph nodes, which are packed with immune cells, it also fulfils an important defence function, monitoring the health of the tissues and alerting the immune system to invaders. Like blood capillaries, the lymphatic capillaries merge to form progressively larger and larger lymphatic vessels, which eventually empty into a major vein, returning the escaped fluids to the bloodstream.</p>

                            <p>The lymphatic system (Fig. 6.1) consists of:</p>

                            <h3>Tissue drainage</h3>
                            <p>Every day, around 21 litres of fluid from plasma, carrying dissolved substances and some plasma protein, escape from the arterial end of the capillaries and into the tissues. Most of this fluid is returned directly to the bloodstream via the capillary at its venous end but the excess, about 3–4 litres of fluid, is drained away by the lymphatic vessels. If this did not happen, the tissues would rapidly become waterlogged, and the cardiovascular system would begin to fail as the blood volume fell.</p>

                            <h3>Absorption in the small intestine</h3>
                            <p>Breakdown products of fat and fat-soluble materials, e.g. the fat-soluble vitamins, are absorbed into the central lacteals (lymphatic vessels) of the villi (Ch. 12; p. 330).</p>

                            <h3>Immunity</h3>
                            <p>The lymphatic organs are concerned with the production and maturation of lymphocytes, the white blood cells responsible for immunity (Ch. 15). Bone marrow is therefore considered to be lymphatic tissue, since lymphocytes are produced there.</p>

                            <h3>Lymph</h3>
                            <p>Lymph is a clear watery fluid, identical in composition to interstitial fluid and similar in composition to plasma, although it contains much less protein. Lymph transports the plasma proteins that seep out of the capillary beds back to the bloodstream. It also carries away larger particles, e.g. bacteria and cell debris from damaged tissues, which can then be filtered out and destroyed in the lymph nodes. Lymph contains lymphocytes (defence cells, p. 412), which circulate in the lymphatic system, allowing them to patrol the different regions of the body. In the lacteals of the small intestine, fats absorbed into the lymphatics give the lymph there (now called chyle) a milky appearance.</p>

                            <h3>Lymph capillaries</h3>
                            <p>These originate as blind-ended tubes in the interstitial spaces (Fig. 6.2). They have the same structure as blood capillaries, i.e. a single layer of endothelial cells, but their walls are more permeable to all interstitial fluid constituents, including proteins and cell debris. The tiny capillaries join up to form larger lymph vessels.</p>
                            <p>Nearly all tissues have a network of lymphatic vessels, important exceptions being the central nervous system, the cornea of the eye, the bones and the most superficial layers of the skin.</p>

                            <h3>Larger lymph vessels</h3>
                            <p>Lymph vessels are often found running alongside the arteries and veins serving the area. Their walls are about the same thickness as those of small veins and have the same layers of tissue, i.e. a fibrous covering, a middle layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue, and an inner lining of endothelium. Like veins, lymph vessels have numerous cup-shaped valves to ensure that lymph flows in a one-way system towards the thorax (Fig. 6.3).</p>

                            <p>Lymph vessels become larger as they join together, eventually forming two large ducts, the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, which empty lymph into the subclavian veins.</p>

                            <h4>Thoracic duct</h4>
                            <p>This duct begins at the <strong>cisterna chyli</strong>, which is a dilated lymph channel situated in front of the bodies of the first two lumbar vertebrae. The duct is about 40 cm long and opens into the left subclavian vein in the root of the neck. It drains lymph from both legs, the pelvic and abdominal cavities, the left half of the thorax, head and neck, and the left arm (see Fig. 6.1).</p>

                            <h4>Right lymphatic duct</h4>
                            <p>This is a dilated lymph vessel about 1 cm long. It lies in the root of the neck and opens into the right subclavian vein. It drains lymph from the right half of the thorax, head and neck and the right arm (see Fig. 6.1).</p>

                            <h3>Circulation of lymph</h3>
                            <p>There is no 'pump', like the heart, involved in the onward movement of lymph, but the muscle layer in the walls of the large lymph vessels has an intrinsic ability to contract rhythmically (the lymphatic pump).</p>
                            <p>In addition, lymph vessels are compressed by activity in adjacent structures, such as contraction of muscles and the regular pulsation of large arteries. This 'milking' action on the lymph vessel wall helps to push lymph along.</p>
                            <p>Changes in thoracic pressure associated with the respiratory cycle also assist lymph movement. At the peak of inspiration, when the pressure in the chest is at its lowest, lymph is 'sucked' along the right lymphatic duct and so increases lymph flow into the subclavian vein.</p>

                            <h3>Lymph nodes</h3>
                            <p>Lymph nodes are oval or bean-shaped organs that lie along the length of lymph vessels, often in groups. The lymph drains through a number of nodes, usually 8–10, before returning to the venous circulation. These nodes vary considerably in size: some are as small as a pinhead and the largest are about the size of an almond.</p>

                            <h4>Structure</h4>
                            <p>Lymph nodes (Fig. 6.4) have an outer capsule of fibrous tissue that dips down into the node substance, forming partitions or <strong>trabeculae</strong>. The main substance of the node consists of reticular and lymphatic tissue. Reticular cells produce the network of fibres that provide internal structure within the lymph node. The lymphatic tissue is packed with immune and defence cells, including lymphocytes and macrophages.</p>

                            <p>As many as four or five afferent lymph vessels may enter a lymph node, but only one efferent vessel carries lymph away from the node. Each node has a concave surface called the hilum, where its artery enters and its vein and the efferent lymph vessel leave.</p>

                            <p>Lymph from the upper limbs passes through nodes situated in the elbow region, then through the deep and superficial <strong>axillary nodes</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Lymph from organs and tissues in the thoracic cavity drains through groups of nodes situated close to the mediastinum, large airways, oesophagus and chest wall. Most of the lymph from the breast passes through the axillary nodes.</p>
                            <p>Lymph from the pelvic and abdominal cavities passes through many lymph nodes before entering the cisterna chyli. The abdominal and pelvic nodes are mainly situated close to the blood vessels supplying the organs and also to the main arteries, i.e. the aorta and the external and internal iliac arteries.</p>
                            <p>The lymph from the lower limbs drains through deep and superficial nodes, including groups of nodes behind the knee (<strong>popliteal nodes</strong>) and in the groin (<strong>inguinal nodes</strong>).</p>

                            <h4>Functions</h4>
                            <p><strong>Defence</strong><br>
                            Lymph flows slowly through lymph nodes and is filtered by the reticular and lymphatic tissue as it passes. Particulate matter may include bacteria, dead and live phagocytes containing ingested microbes, cells from malignant tumours, worn-out and damaged tissue cells and inhaled particles. Organic material is destroyed in lymph nodes by macrophages and antibodies. Some inorganic inhaled particles cannot be destroyed by phagocytosis. These remain inside the macrophages, either causing no damage or killing the cell. Material not filtered out and dealt with in one lymph node passes on to successive nodes, and by the time lymph enters the blood it has usually been cleared of foreign matter and cell debris. In some cases where phagocytosis of bacteria is incomplete, they may stimulate inflammation and enlargement of the node (lymphadenopathy).</p>

                            Some lymphocytes finish their maturation process in lymph nodes and activated T- and B-lymphocytes (p. 412) multiply here. Antibodies produced by sensitised B-lymphocytes enter lymph and blood draining the node.</p>

                            <h3>Tonsils</h3>
                            <p>Tonsils (Fig. 6.7) are uncapsulated collections of lymphoid tissue located strategically in the back of the mouth and the throat, ideally placed to intercept swallowed or inhaled antigens. They are generally largest in childhood and regress with age. Their structure features deep pits or clefts to trap bacteria, which are then destroyed by the defence cells packed into the tonsil. There are three main groups of tonsils.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids)</strong><br>
                            These lie at the back of the nasal cavity, on the upper posterior wall of the pharynx. In childhood, they can swell as a result of respiratory infections and partially block the nasal passageways, interfering with breathing. For this reason, they may be removed (tonsillectomy).</p>

                            <p><strong>Palatine tonsils</strong><br>
                            These lie on the pharyngeal wall at the back of the mouth. They too can swell, causing troublesome obstruction of the airways, and may have to be removed.</p>

                            <p><strong>Lingual tonsils</strong><br>
                            These are collections of lymphoid tissue at the back and sides of the tongue.</p>

                            <h3>Spleen</h3>
                            <p>The spleen (Fig. 6.8; see also Fig. 4.13) contains reticular and lymphatic tissue, and is the largest lymph organ. It lies in the left hypochondriac region of the abdominal cavity between the fundus of the stomach and the diaphragm. It is purplish in colour and varies in size in different individuals, but is usually about 12 cm long, 7 cm wide and 2.5 cm thick. It weighs about 200 g.</p>

                            <h4>Structure</h4>
                            <p>The spleen is slightly oval in shape with the hilum on the lower medial border (Fig. 6.9). The anterior surface is covered with peritoneum. It is enclosed in a fibroelastic capsule that dips into the organ, forming trabeculae. The cellular material, consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages, is called <strong>splenic pulp</strong>, and lies between the trabeculae. <strong>Red pulp</strong> is the part suffused with blood, and <strong>white pulp</strong> consists of areas of lymphatic tissue where there are sleeves of lymphocytes and macrophages around blood vessels.</p>

                            <p>Blood passing through the spleen flows in sinusoids (p. 83), which have distinct pores between the endothelial cells, allowing it to come into close association with splenic pulp. This is essential for removing ageing or damaged cells from the bloodstream, one of the spleen's functions.</p>

                            <h4>Functions</h4>
                            <p><strong>Phagocytosis</strong><br>
                            As described in Chapter 4 (p. 66), old and abnormal erythrocytes are destroyed mainly in the spleen, and the breakdown products, bilirubin (see Fig. 12.37) and iron, are transported to the liver via the splenic and portal veins. Other cellular material, e.g. leukocytes, platelets and bacteria, is phagocytosed in the spleen.</p>
                            <p>Unlike lymph nodes, the spleen has no afferent lymphatics entering it, so it is not exposed to diseases spread by lymph.</p>

                            <p><strong>Storage of blood</strong><br>
                            The spleen contains up to 350 mL of blood, and in response to sympathetic stimulation can rapidly return most of this volume to the circulation, e.g. in haemorrhage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Immune response</strong><br>
                            The spleen contains T- and B-lymphocytes, which are activated by the presence of antigens, e.g. in infection. Lymphocyte proliferation during serious infection can cause enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly).</p>

                            <p><strong>Erythropoiesis</strong><br>
                            The spleen and liver are important sites of fetal blood cell production, and the spleen can also fulfil this function in adults in times of great need.</p>

                            <h3>Thymus gland</h3>
                            <p>The thymus gland lies in the upper part of the mediastinum behind the sternum and extends upwards into the root of the neck (Fig. 6.10). It weighs about 10–15 g at birth and grows until puberty, when it begins to atrophy. Its maximum weight, at puberty, is between 30 and 40 g and by middle age it has returned to approximately its weight at birth.</p>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Structure</h4>
                            <p>The thymus consists of two lobes joined by areolar tissue. The lobes are enclosed by a fibrous capsule that dips into their substance, dividing them into lobules that consist of an irregular branching framework of epithelial cells and lymphocytes.</p>

                            <h4>Functions</h4>
                            <p>Lymphocytes originate from stem cells in red bone marrow (see Fig. 4.3). Those that enter the thymus develop into T-lymphocytes (p. 412).</p>
                            <p>Thymic processing produces mature T-lymphocytes that can distinguish 'self' tissue from foreign tissue, and also provides each T-lymphocyte with the ability to react to only one specific antigen from the millions it will encounter. T-lymphocytes then leave the thymus and enter the blood. Some enter lymphoid tissues and others circulate in the bloodstream. T-lymphocyte production, although most prolific in youth, probably continues throughout life from a resident population of thymic stem cells.</p>
                            <p>The maturation of the thymus and other lymphoid tissue is stimulated by <strong>thymosin</strong>, a hormone secreted by the epithelial cells that form the framework of the thymus gland. Shrinking of the gland begins in adolescence and, with increasing age, the effectiveness of the T-lymphocyte response to antigens declines.</p>

                            <h3>Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue</h3>
                            <p>Throughout the body, at strategically placed locations, are collections of lymphoid tissue that, unlike the spleen and thymus, are not enclosed within a capsule. They contain B- and T-lymphocytes, which have migrated from bone marrow and the thymus, and are important in the early detection of invaders. However, as they have no afferent lymphatic vessels, they do not filter lymph, and are therefore not exposed to diseases spread by lymph. <strong>Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue</strong> (MALT) is found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, in the respiratory tract and in the genitourinary tract, all systems of the body exposed to the external environment.</p>
                            <p>The main groups of MALT are the tonsils (described earlier) and aggregated lymphoid follicles (Peyer's patches, see Fig. 12.25), which are large collections of lymphoid tissue in the small intestine.</p>

                            <h3>Spread of disease</h3>
                            <p>The materials most commonly spread via the lymph vessels from their original site to the circulating blood are fragments of tumours and infected material.</p>

                            <h4>Infection</h4>
                            <p>Pathogens may enter lymph vessels from infected tissues. If the defensive cells in the lymph nodes are unable to destroy all the microbes, the infection may spread from node to node, and eventually reach the bloodstream.</p>

                            <p><strong>Lymphangitis</strong><br>
                            This occurs in some acute bacterial infections in which the microbes in the lymph draining from the area infect and spread along the walls of lymph vessels; for example, in acute <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> infection of the hand, a red line may be seen extending from the hand to the axilla. This is caused by an inflamed superficial lymph vessel and adjacent tissues. The infection may be stopped at the first lymph node or may spread through the lymph drainage network to the blood.</p>

                            <h4>Tumours</h4>
                            <p><strong>Malignant disease</strong><br>
                            Malignant tumours shed cells into the surrounding interstitial fluid, which drains into local lymphatic vessels and carries the tumour cells to the nearest set of lymph nodes. Here, if tumour cells arrive in sufficient numbers, they can establish secondary growths (metastases). From local lymph nodes, the tumour usually spreads to further lymph nodes and/or via the bloodstream to distant organs.</p>

                            <h3>Lymphatic obstruction</h3>
                            <p>When a lymph vessel is obstructed, lymph accumulates distal to the obstruction (lymphoedema). The amount of resultant swelling and the size of the area affected depend on the size of the vessel involved. Lymphoedema usually leads to low-grade inflammation and fibrosis of the lymph vessel and further lymphoedema. The most common causes are tumours and surgical removal of lymph nodes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Tumours</strong><br>
                            Tumours can compress lymph vessels, blocking lymph flow and tissue drainage. A tumour may also grow into, and block, a lymph vessel or node, obstructing lymph flow.</p>

                            <p><strong>Surgery</strong><br>
                            In some surgical procedures, lymph nodes are removed because cancer cells may have already spread to them. This aims to prevent growth of secondary tumours in local lymph nodes and further spread of the disease via the lymphatic system, e.g. axillary nodes may be removed during mastectomy (breast removal), which can obstruct lymph drainage and cause lymphoedema of the affected arm.</p>

                            <h3>Lymphadenitis</h3>
                            <p>Acute lymphadenitis (acute infection of lymph nodes) is usually caused by microbes transported in lymph from other areas of infection. The nodes become inflamed, enlarged and congested with blood, and chemotaxis (directed movement of defensive cells into infected or damaged tissues) attracts large numbers of phagocytes. If lymph node defences (phagocytes and antibody production) are overwhelmed, the infection can cause abscess formation within the node. Adjacent tissues may become involved, and infected materials may be transported through other nodes and into the blood.</p>
                            <p>Acute lymphadenitis is secondary to a number of conditions. Minor lymphadenitis accompanies many infections and indicates the normal proliferation of defence cells. More serious infection occurs in, for example, measles, typhoid and cat-scratch fever, and wound or skin infections. Chronic lymphadenitis occurs following unresolved acute infections, and in tuberculosis, syphilis and some low-grade infections.</p>

                            <h4>Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever)</h4>
                            <p>This is a highly contagious viral infection, usually of young adults, spread by direct contact. During the incubation period of 7–10 days, viruses multiply in the epithelial cells of the pharynx. They subsequently spread to cervical lymph nodes, then to lymphoid tissue throughout the body. Clinical features include tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A common complication is myalgic encephalitis (chronic fatigue syndrome, p. 198).</p>

                            <h3>Lymphomas</h3>
                            <p>These are malignant tumours of lymphoid tissue and are classified as either Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphomas.</p>

                            <h4>Hodgkin lymphoma</h4>
                            <p>Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a group of diseases that almost always presents with painless enlargement of lymph nodes throughout the body, as lymphoid tissue within them proliferates. The superficial lymph nodes in the neck are often the first to be noticed. The disease is malignant and the cause is unknown. Males are more commonly affected than females and the two age groups displaying the highest incidence are 20–35 years and 50–70 years. The prognosis varies considerably but the pattern of spread is predictable because the disease spreads from one node to the next and to adjacent tissues, following local lymphatic channels. The effectiveness of treatment depends largely on the stage of the disease at which it begins, but is often curable, especially if caught early. The disease leads to reduced immunity because lymphocyte function is depressed, and recurrent infection is therefore common. As lymph nodes enlarge, they may compress adjacent tissues and organs. Anaemia and changes in leukocyte numbers occur if the bone marrow is involved. It is rare for the disease to spread to non-lymphoid tissues or organs.</p>

                            <h4>Non-Hodgkin lymphomas</h4>
                            <p>Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) constitute a group of lymphomas that are more common than HL; they may be associated with immunodeficiency states and certain viral infections, including HIV (p. 418). NHLs include multiple myeloma and Burkitt lymphoma, and may occur in any lymphoid tissue or in bone marrow. They are classified according to the type of cell involved and the degree of malignancy, i.e. low, intermediate or high grade. Low-grade tumours consist of well-differentiated cells and disease progress is slow, death occurring after a period of years. High-grade lymphomas consist of poorly differentiated cells and disease progress is rapid, death occurring in weeks or months. Some low- or intermediate-grade tumours change their status to high grade with increased rate of progress.</p>
                            <p>The expanding lymph nodes may compress adjacent tissues and organs. Immunological deficiency leads to increased incidence of infections, and if the bone marrow or spleen (or both) is involved there may be varying degrees of anaemia and leukopenia.</p>

                            <h3>Splenomegaly</h3>
                            <p>This is enlargement of the spleen, and is usually secondary to other conditions, including infections, circulatory disorders, blood diseases and malignant neoplasms.</p>

                            <h4>Infections</h4>
                            <p>The spleen may be infected by blood-borne microbes or by local spread of infection. The red pulp becomes congested with blood, and phagocytes and plasma cells accumulate within. Acute infections are rare.</p>
                            <p><strong>Chronic infections</strong><br>
                            Some chronic infections cause splenomegaly but this is usually less severe than with acute infections. The most commonly occurring primary infections include tuberculosis (p. 291), typhoid fever (p. 355), malaria and infectious mononucleosis (see earlier).</p>

                            <h4>Circulatory disorders</h4>
                            <p>If blood flow through the liver is impeded – by fibrosis in liver cirrhosis, for example, or portal venous congestion in right-sided heart failure – blood backing up through the portal circulation can cause congestion and enlargement of the spleen.</p>

                            <h4>Blood disease</h4>
                            <p>Splenomegaly may be caused by blood disorders. The spleen enlarges to deal with the extra workload associated with removing damaged, worn-out and abnormal blood cells in, for example, haemolytic and macrocytic anaemia, polycythaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia (Ch. 4).</p>
                            <p>Splenomegaly may itself cause blood disorders. When the spleen is enlarged for any reason, especially in portal hypertension, excessive and premature haemolysis of red cells or phagocytosis of normal white cells and platelets leads to marked anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.</p>

                            <h4>Tumours</h4>
                            <p>Benign and primary malignant tumours of the spleen are rare but blood-spread tumour fragments from elsewhere in the body may cause metastases. Splenomegaly caused by infiltration of malignant cells is characteristic of some conditions, especially chronic leukaemia, HL and NHL.</p>

                            <p>Enlargement of the thymus gland is associated with some autoimmune diseases, such as thyrotoxicosis and Addison's disease.</p>
                            <p>Tumours are rare, although pressure caused by enlargement of the gland may damage or interfere with the functions of adjacent structures, e.g. the trachea, oesophagus or veins in the neck.</p>
                            <p>In myasthenia gravis (p. 472), most patients have either thymic hyperplasia (the majority) or thymoma (a minority), although the role of thymic function in this disorder is not understood.</p>
