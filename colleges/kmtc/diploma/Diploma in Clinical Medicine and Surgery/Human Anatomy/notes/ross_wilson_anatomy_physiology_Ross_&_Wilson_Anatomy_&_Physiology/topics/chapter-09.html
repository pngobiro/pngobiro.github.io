                            <p>The endocrine system consists of glands, which are widely separated and have no physical connections with each other (Fig. 9.1). Endocrine glands are groups of secretory cells surrounded by extensive networks of capillaries that facilitate diffusion of hormones (chemical messengers) from the secretory cells into the bloodstream. They are also referred to as <strong>ductless glands</strong> because hormones diffuse directly into the bloodstream. Hormones are then carried in the bloodstream to target tissues and organs that may be distant, where they influence cell growth and metabolism.</p>

                            <p>Homeostasis of the internal environment is maintained partly by the autonomic nervous system and partly by the endocrine system. The autonomic nervous system is concerned with rapid changes, while endocrine control is generally involved in slower and more precise adjustments.</p>

                            <p>The main endocrine glands are shown in Fig. 9.1, although many other organs and tissues also secrete hormones as a secondary function. For example, adipose tissue produces leptin (Table 9.4, p. 247), which is involved in the regulation of appetite, and the heart secretes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, Table 9.4, p. 247), which acts on the kidneys.</p>
                            <p>Although the hypothalamus is classified as a part of the brain rather than an endocrine gland, it controls the pituitary gland and indirectly influences many others.</p>
                            <p>The ovaries and the testes secrete hormones associated with the reproductive system after puberty; their functions are described in Chapter 18. The placenta, which develops to nourish the developing fetus during pregnancy, also has an endocrine function, which is outlined in Chapter 5.</p>
                            <p>The most important endocrine glands are explored in the early sections of this chapter. Some hormones, e.g. prostaglandins, do not travel to remote organs but act locally instead and some of these are considered briefly on page 248. Changes in endocrine functions that accompany ageing are explored. Problems that arise when abnormalities occur are caused by the over- or under-activity of endocrine glands and are explained in the final sections of the chapter.</p>

                            <h3>Overview of hormone action</h3>
                            <p>When a hormone arrives at its target cell, it binds to a specific receptor, where it acts as a switch influencing chemical or metabolic reactions inside the cell. Receptors for peptide hormones are situated on the cell membrane and those for lipid-based hormones are located inside cells. Examples of peptide and lipid-based hormones are shown in Box 9.1.</p>

                            <p>The level of a hormone in the blood is variable and self-regulating within its normal range. A hormone is released in response to a specific stimulus and usually its action reverses or negates the stimulus through a <strong>negative feedback mechanism</strong> (p. 35). This may be controlled either indirectly through the release of hormones by the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland, e.g. steroid and thyroid hormones, or directly by blood levels of the stimulus, e.g. insulin and glucagon, which are determined by plasma glucose levels.</p>
                            <p>The effect of a <strong>positive feedback mechanism</strong> is amplification of the stimulus and increasing release of the hormone until a particular process is complete and the stimulus ceases, e.g. release of oxytocin during labour (p. 239).</p>

                            <p>The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus act as a unit, regulating the activity of most of the other endocrine glands. The pituitary gland lies in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone below the hypothalamus, to which it is attached by a stalk (Fig. 9.2). It is the size of a pea, weighs about 500 mg and consists of two main parts that originate from different types of cell. The <strong>anterior pituitary</strong> is composed of glandular tissue secreting hormones because it is an upgrowth of glandular tissue from the pharynx, and the <strong>posterior pituitary</strong> is composed of nervous tissue because it is a downgrowth of nervous tissue from the brain. There is a network of nerve fibres between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary (Fig. 9.3).</p>

                            <p><strong>Arterial blood</strong><br>
                            Arterial supply is from branches of the internal carotid artery. The anterior lobe is supplied indirectly by blood that has already passed through a capillary bed in the hypothalamus (see later), and the posterior lobe is supplied directly.</p>
                            <p><strong>Venous drainage</strong><br>
                            Venous blood, containing hormones from both lobes, leaves the gland in short veins that enter the venous sinuses between the layers of dura mater.</p>

                            <h4>The influence of the hypothalamus on the pituitary gland</h4>
                            <p>The hypothalamus controls release of hormones from both the anterior and posterior pituitary but in different ways that are explained in the next sections.</p>

                            <h3>Anterior pituitary</h3>

                            This network of vessels transports blood from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, where it enters a network of tiny sinusoids (p. 83) that are in close contact with the secretory cells, permitting easy passage of hormones into the bloodstream. As well as providing oxygen and nutrients, this blood transports releasing and inhibiting hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. These hormones specifically influence secretion and release of other hormones formed in the anterior pituitary (Table 9.1).</p>

                            <p>Some of the hormones secreted by the anterior lobe stimulate or inhibit secretion by other endocrine glands (target glands) while others have a direct effect on target tissues.

                            <p>Secretion of an anterior pituitary hormone follows stimulation of the gland by a specific releasing hormone produced by the hypothalamus and carried to the gland through the pituitary portal system already described. The whole system is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism (Ch. 2): that is, when the level of a hormone in the blood supplying the hypothalamus is low it produces the appropriate releasing hormone, which stimulates release of a trophic hormone by the anterior pituitary. This in turn stimulates the target gland to produce and release its hormone. As a result, the blood level of that hormone rises and inhibits secretion of its releasing factor by the hypothalamus (Fig. 9.4).</p>

                            <p><strong>Growth hormone</strong><br>
                            Growth hormone (GH) is the most abundant hormone synthesised by the anterior pituitary. It stimulates growth and division of most body cells, i.e. has anabolic effects, especially on those in the bones and skeletal muscles.<br>
                            Its secretion is highest in childhood and adolescence, accelerating cell division, increasing tissue mass and driving the rapid body growth taking place at this time. In adult life, GH controls growth and regeneration of nearly all body tissues, especially skeletal muscle and bone. It also regulates aspects of metabolism in many organs, e.g. liver, intestines and pancreas. It stimulates protein synthesis, especially for tissue growth and repair, promotes breakdown of fats and increases blood glucose levels (Ch. 12).<br>
                            Its release is stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and suppressed by growth hormone release inhibiting hormone (GHRIH), also known as somatostatin, both of which are secreted by the hypothalamus.<br>
                            GH secretion is controlled by a negative feedback system; it is inhibited when the blood level rises and also when GHRIH is released by the hypothalamus. GHRIH also suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and gastrointestinal secretions, e.g. gastric juice, gastrin and cholecystokinin (Ch. 12).<br>
                            Secretion of GH is greater at night during deep sleep and is also stimulated by hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), exercise and anxiety. Ongoing sleep disturbances in children, e.g. in childhood asthma, can lead to restriction of normal growth.<br>
                            GH is a stress hormone and, as such, is released during situations such as starvation and trauma.</p>

                            <p><strong>Prolactin</strong><br>
                            This hormone, also known as lactogenic hormone, is secreted during pregnancy to prepare the breasts for lactation (milk production) after childbirth. The blood level of prolactin is stimulated by prolactin releasing hormone (PRH) released from the hypothalamus and it is lowered by prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH, dopamine) and by an increased blood level of prolactin. Immediately after birth, suckling stimulates prolactin secretion and lactation. The resultant high blood level is a factor in reducing the incidence of conception during lactation.<br>
                            Prolactin, together with oestrogens, corticosteroids, insulin and thyroxine, is involved in initiating and maintaining lactation. Prolactin secretion is related to sleep, rising during any period of sleep, night or day.</p>

                            <p><strong>Thyroid stimulating hormone</strong><br>
                            Release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is stimulated by thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. It stimulates growth and activity of the thyroid gland, which secretes the hormones thyroxine ($T_4$) and tri-iodothyronine ($T_3$). Secretion is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism: i.e. when the blood level of thyroid hormones is high, secretion of TSH is reduced, and vice versa (Fig. 9.4). Exposure to cold is a powerful stimulant of TSH secretion, leading to increased thyroid hormone release and an increase in metabolic rate.</p>

                            <p><strong>Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (corticotrophin)</strong><br>
                            Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus promotes synthesis and release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary. This stimulates growth and activity of the adrenal cortex, increasing the output of adrenocortical steroid hormones, especially cortisol.<br>
                            ACTH levels are highest at about 8 a.m. and fall to their lowest about midnight, although high levels sometimes occur at midday and 6 p.m. This circadian rhythm is maintained throughout life. It is associated with sleep patterns and adjustment to changes takes several days, e.g. following changing work shifts or travelling to a different time zone (jet lag).<br>
                            Secretion is also regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, being suppressed when the blood level of ACTH rises (Fig. 9.4). Other factors that stimulate secretion include hypoglycaemia, exercise and other stressors, e.g. emotional states and fever.</p>

                            <p><strong>Gonadotrophins</strong><br>
                            Just before puberty, two gonadotrophins (sex hormones) are secreted in gradually increasing amounts by the anterior pituitary in response to hypothalamic release of luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), also known as gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH). Rising levels of these hormones at puberty promotes maturation of the reproductive organs. In both males and females the hormones responsible are:</p>

                            FSH stimulates production of gametes (ova or spermatozoa) by the gonads (the ovary in the female and the testis in the male).</p>
                            <p><em>In females</em><br>
                            LH and FSH control the secretion of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone during the menstrual cycle (see Figs 18.9 and 18.10). As the levels of oestrogen and progesterone rise, secretion of LH and FSH is suppressed.</p>
                            <p><em>In males</em><br>
                            LH, also called interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH), stimulates the interstitial cells of the testes to secrete the hormone testosterone (Ch. 18).</p>

                            <h3>Posterior pituitary</h3>
                            <p>The posterior pituitary is formed from nervous tissue and consists of nerve cells surrounded by supporting glial cells called pituicytes. These neurones have their cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and their axons form a bundle known as the hypothalamohypophyseal tract (see Fig. 9.3A). Posterior pituitary hormones are synthesised in the nerve cell bodies, transported along the axons and stored in vesicles within the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary (see Fig. 9.3B).</p>
                            <p>Unlike in the anterior pituitary, where secretion is stimulated by hormones, nerve impulses from the hypothalamus trigger exocytosis of the vesicles, releasing posterior pituitary hormones into the bloodstream.</p>
                            <p>Oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) are the hormones released from axon terminals within the posterior pituitary (see Fig. 9.3B). These hormones act directly on non-endocrine tissue.</p>

                            <p><strong>Oxytocin</strong><br>
                            Oxytocin stimulates two target tissues during and after childbirth (parturition): uterine smooth muscle and the muscle cells of the lactating breast.<br>
                            During childbirth the posterior pituitary releases increasing amounts of oxytocin into the bloodstream in response to increasing stimulation of sensory stretch receptors in the uterine cervix as the baby's head progressively dilates it. Sensory impulses are generated and transmitted to the hypothalamus, stimulating the posterior pituitary to release more oxytocin. In turn, this stimulates more forceful uterine contractions and greater stretching of the uterine cervix as the baby's head is forced further downwards. This is an example of a positive feedback mechanism, which stops soon after the baby is delivered when distension of the uterine cervix is greatly reduced (Fig. 9.5).</p>

                            <p>The process of milk ejection also involves a positive feedback mechanism. Suckling generates sensory impulses that are transmitted from the breast to the hypothalamus, triggering release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. On reaching the lactating breast, oxytocin stimulates contraction of the milk ducts and myoepithelial cells around the glandular cells, ejecting milk. Suckling also inhibits the release of prolactin inhibiting hormone (PIH), prolonging prolactin secretion and lactation.</p>
                            <p>Oxytocin levels rise during sexual arousal in both males and females. This increases smooth muscle contraction, which is associated with glandular secretion and ejaculation in males. In females, contraction of smooth muscle in the vagina and uterus promotes movement of sperm towards the uterine tubes. It is believed that the smell of oxytocin may be involved in social recognition and bonding between mother and newborn baby.</p>

                            <p><strong>Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin)</strong><br>
                            The main effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is to reduce urine output (diuresis is the production of large volumes of urine). ADH acts on the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, increasing their permeability to water (Ch. 13). This results in increased reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate and a corresponding reduction in the volume of urine produced. ADH secretion is determined by the osmotic pressure of the blood circulating to the osmoreceptors, which lie in the hypothalamus close to the supraoptic nucleus (see Fig. 9.3A).<br>
                            As osmotic pressure rises, e.g. as a result of dehydration, secretion of ADH increases. More water is therefore reabsorbed by the kidneys and the urine output is reduced. This means that the body retains more water and the rise in osmotic pressure is reversed. Conversely, when the osmotic pressure of the blood is low, e.g. after a large fluid intake, secretion of ADH is reduced, less water is reabsorbed and more urine is produced (Fig. 9.6).</p>
                            <p>At high concentrations, e.g. after severe blood loss, ADH causes smooth muscle contraction, especially vasoconstriction in small muscular arteries (arterioles). This has a pressor effect, raising systemic blood pressure; the alternative name of this hormone, vasopressin, reflects this effect.</p>

                            <p>The thyroid gland (Fig. 9.7) is situated in the neck in front of the larynx and trachea at the level of the 5th, 6th and 7th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebrae. It is a highly vascular gland that weighs about 25 g and is surrounded by a fibrous capsule. It resembles a butterfly in shape, consisting of two lobes, one on either side of the thyroid cartilage and upper cartilaginous rings of the trachea. The lobes are joined by a narrow isthmus, lying in front of the trachea. The lobes are roughly cone shaped and are about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide.</p>

                            <p>The gland is composed of largely spherical follicles formed from cuboidal epithelium (Fig. 9.8). These secrete and store colloid, a thick, sticky protein material. Between the follicles are parafollicular cells (sometimes called C-cells), found singly or in groups. They secrete the hormone calcitonin.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood and nerve supply.</strong> The arterial blood supply to the gland is through the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The superior thyroid artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and the inferior thyroid artery is a branch of the subclavian artery.<br>
                            The venous return is by the thyroid veins, which drain into the internal jugular veins.<br>
                            The recurrent laryngeal nerves pass upwards, close to the lobes of the gland, and lie near the inferior thyroid artery, especially on the right side (see Fig. 9.7).</p>

                            <h4>Thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine</h4>
                            <p>Iodine is essential for the formation of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine ($T_4$) and tri-iodothyronine ($T_3$), so numbered as these molecules contain four and three atoms of iodine, respectively. The main dietary sources of iodine are seafood, vegetables grown in iodine-rich soil and iodinated table salt. The thyroid gland selectively takes up iodine from the blood, a process called <strong>iodine trapping</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Thyroid hormones are synthesised as large precursor molecules called thyroglobulin, the major constituent of colloid. The release of $T_3$ and $T_4$ into the blood is stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary.</p>
                            <p>Secretion of TSH is stimulated by thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus and secretion of TRH is stimulated by exposure to cold, exercise, stress, malnutrition, low plasma glucose levels and sleep. TSH secretion depends on the plasma levels of $T_3$ and $T_4$ because it is these hormones that control the sensitivity of the anterior pituitary to TRH. Through the negative feedback mechanism, increased levels of $T_3$ and $T_4$ decrease TSH secretion and vice versa (Fig. 9.9). Dietary iodine deficiency greatly increases TSH secretion causing proliferation of thyroid gland cells and enlargement of the gland (goitre, see Fig. 9.17).</p>

                            <p>Secretion of $T_3$ and $T_4$ begins in about the 3rd month of fetal life and increases at puberty and in women during the reproductive years, especially during pregnancy. Otherwise, it remains fairly constant throughout life. Of the two thyroid hormones, $T_4$ is much more abundant. However, it is less potent than $T_3$, which is more physiologically important. Most $T_4$ is converted into $T_3$ inside target cells.</p>
                            <p>Thyroid hormones enter the cell nucleus and regulate gene expression, i.e. they increase or decrease protein synthesis (Ch. 17). They enhance the effects of other hormones, e.g. adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine). $T_3$ and $T_4$ affect most cells of the body by:</p>

Physiological effects of $T_3$ and $T_4$ on the heart, skeletal muscles, skin and digestive and reproductive systems are more evident when there is under-activity or over-activity of the thyroid gland and can be profound in childhood (Table 9.3).</p>

                            <p>These glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH, also known as parathormone), which regulates blood calcium levels. When these fall, secretion of PTH is increased and vice versa.</p>
                            <p>PTH secretion increases blood calcium levels by releasing calcium stored in bone via a dual action: it stimulates osteoclasts (bone-destroying cells) and increases calcium reabsorption from the renal tubules.</p>
                            <p>PTH and calcitonin from the thyroid gland act in a complementary manner to maintain blood calcium levels within the normal range. Calcium is essential for:</p>

                            <p>The medulla is completely surrounded by the adrenal cortex. It develops from nervous tissue in the embryo and is part of the sympathetic nervous system (Ch. 7). When stimulated by its extensive sympathetic nerve supply, the glands release the hormones <strong>adrenaline</strong> (epinephrine, 80%) and <strong>noradrenaline</strong> (norepinephrine, 20%).</p>
                            
                            <h4>Adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine)</h4>
                            <p>Noradrenaline is the postganglionic neurotransmitter of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (see Fig. 7.44). Adrenaline and some noradrenaline are released into the blood from the adrenal medulla during stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. These hormones prolong and augment stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Structurally, they are very similar, which explains their similar effects. Together they potentiate the fight or flight response by:</p>

                            <p>The hormones in each group have different actions, but as they are structurally similar, their actions may overlap.</p>

                            <h4>Glucocorticoids</h4>
                            <p>Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the main glucocorticoid but small amounts of corticosterone and cortisone are also produced. Glucocorticoids are essential for life, regulating metabolism, the inflammatory and immune responses, and responses to stress (see Fig. 9.12). Secretion is controlled through a negative feedback system involving the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. It is stimulated by ACTH from the anterior pituitary and by stress (Fig. 9.13). Cortisol secretion shows marked circadian variation, peaking between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. and being lowest between midnight and 3 a.m. When the sleep/wake pattern is changed, e.g. in night shift working, it takes several days for ACTH/cortisol secretion to readjust (p. 238). Glucocorticoid secretion increases in response to stress (Figs 9.12 and 9.13), including infection and surgery.</p>

                            <p>When corticosteroids are administered in the treatment of common disorders, e.g. asthma, the high circulating levels exert a negative feedback effect on the hypothalamus and pituitary that can completely suppress natural secretion of CRH and ACTH, respectively.</p>

                            <h4>Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone)</h4>
                            <p>Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid. It is involved in maintaining water and electrolyte balance. Through a negative feedback system it stimulates the reabsorption of sodium ($Na^+$) by the renal tubules and excretion of potassium ($K^+$) in the urine. Sodium reabsorption is also accompanied by retention of water and therefore aldosterone is involved in the regulation of blood volume and blood pressure too.</p>
                            <p>Blood potassium levels regulate aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. When blood potassium levels rise, more aldosterone is secreted (Fig. 9.14). Low blood potassium has the opposite effect. Angiotensin (see next section) also stimulates the release of aldosterone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system</strong><br>
                            When renal blood flow is reduced or blood sodium levels fall, the enzyme renin is secreted by kidney cells. Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to angiotensin 1. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), formed in small quantities mainly in the lungs, converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, which stimulates secretion of aldosterone. Angiotensin 2 causes vasoconstriction and increases blood pressure, closing the negative feedback loop (Fig. 9.14).</p>

                            <h4>Sex hormones (gonadocorticoids)</h4>
                            <p>Sex hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex are mainly androgens (male sex hormones), although the amounts produced are insignificant compared with those secreted by the testes and ovaries in late puberty and adulthood (Ch. 18).</p>

                            <h3>The adrenal glands and the stress response</h3>
                            <p>A stressor is any effect on the body, either internal or external, that disturbs homeostasis. Stressors can be major or minor, and physical or psychological. They include infection, exercise, trauma, surgery, disease, emotional states, fasting, extremes of temperature and sleep deprivation.</p>
                            <p>Immediate responses to short-term stress include activation of the 'fight or flight' response (p. 189). This is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the principal effects are shown in Fig. 9.12.</p>
                            <p>Longer-term stress leads to release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the release of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, providing a more prolonged response to stress (Fig. 9.12).</p>

                            <p>Insulin is a polypeptide hormone consisting of about 50 amino acids. Body cells require glucose to fuel their metabolic activities but glucose does not freely cross the cell membrane. All body cells have insulin receptors on their plasma membranes, and in the presence of insulin can actively import glucose. Insulin also has an essential function in lowering raised blood nutrient levels, not only glucose but also amino acids and fatty acids. These are anabolic effects, i.e. they promote storage of nutrients. When nutrients, especially glucose, are in excess of immediate needs, insulin promotes their storage by:</p>

                            <p>A number of body tissues not normally described as endocrine glands secrete substances that act on local tissues. Some of these are described here.</p>

                            <h4>Histamine</h4>
                            <p>This is synthesised and stored by mast cells in the tissues and basophils in blood. It is released as part of inflammatory responses, especially when these are caused by allergy (p. 417), increasing capillary permeability and causing vasodilation. It also acts as a neurotransmitter, causes contraction of smooth muscle of the bronchi and alimentary tract, and stimulates the secretion of gastric juice.</p>

                            <h4>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)</h4>
                            <p>Serotonin (5-HT) is present in platelets, in the brain and in the intestinal wall. It stimulates intestinal secretion and contraction of smooth muscle, and its role in haemostasis (blood clotting) is outlined in Chapter 4. It is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is known to influence mood.</p>

                            <h4>Prostaglandins</h4>
                            <p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are lipid substances found in most tissues. They act on neighbouring cells but their actions are short-lived as they are quickly metabolised and their blood levels are negligible. Prostaglandins have potent and wide-ranging physiological effects in:</p>

                            <p>The most common cause is prolonged hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH), usually by a hormone-secreting pituitary tumour. The conditions are occasionally due to excess growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secreted by the hypothalamus. As the tumour increases in size, compression of nearby structures may lead to hyposecretion of other pituitary hormones (from both lobes) and damage to the nearby optic nerves (see Fig. 9.2), causing visual disturbances. The effects of excess GH include:</p>

                            <p><strong>Gigantism</strong><br>
                            This occurs in children when there is excess GH while epiphyseal cartilages of long bones are still growing, i.e. before ossification of bones is complete. It is evident mainly in the bones of the limbs, and affected individuals may grow to heights of 2.1 to 2.4 m, although body proportions remain normal (Fig. 9.15).</p>

                            <p><strong>Acromegaly</strong><br>
                            This means 'large extremities' and occurs in adults when there is excessive GH secretion after ossification is complete. The bones become abnormally thick and there is also thickening of the soft tissues. These changes are most noticeable as coarse facial features (especially excessive growth of the lower jaw), an enlarged tongue and excessively large hands and feet (Fig. 9.16).</p>

                            <p>This is caused by a tumour that secretes large amounts of prolactin. It leads to galactorrhoea (inappropriate milk secretion), amenorrhoea (cessation of menstruation) and sterility in women and impotence in men.</p>

                            <h3>Hyposecretion of anterior pituitary hormones</h3>
                            <p>The number of hormones involved and the extent of hyposecretion vary. <strong>Panhypopituitarism</strong> is the absence of all anterior pituitary hormones. Causes of hyposecretion include:</p>

                            <p><strong>Pituitary necrosis</strong><br>
                            Also known as postpartum necrosis or Sheehan's syndrome, this occurs following hypotensive shock associated with severe haemorrhage during or after childbirth. The arrangement of its blood supply makes the anterior pituitary unusually susceptible to a fall in systemic blood pressure. Failure of lactation precedes the other effects, which include deficient stimulation of target glands and consequent hypofunction of all or some of the thyroid, adrenal cortex and gonads. The outcome depends on the extent of pituitary necrosis and hormone deficiency. In severe cases, glucocorticoid deficiency may be life-threatening or fatal.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pituitary dwarfism (Lorain–Levi syndrome)</strong><br>
                            This is caused by severe deficiency of GH, and possibly of other hormones, in childhood. The individual is of small stature but is normally proportioned and cognitive development is not affected. Puberty is delayed and there may be episodes of hypoglycaemia. The condition may be due to genetic abnormality or a tumour.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fröhlich's syndrome</strong><br>
                            In this condition there is panhypopituitarism but the main effects are associated with deficiency of GH, FSH and LH. In children the effects are diminished growth, lack of sexual development, obesity with female distribution of fat and learning disabilities. Obesity and sterility are the main features in a similar condition in adults. It may arise from a tumour of the anterior pituitary and/or the hypothalamus but in most cases the cause is unknown.</p>

                            <h3>Disorders of the posterior pituitary</h3>
                            <h4>Diabetes insipidus</h4>
                            <p>In this relatively rare condition there is hyposecretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary. It is usually secondary to damage to the hypothalamus by, for example, trauma, tumour or encephalitis. Occasionally, it occurs when the renal tubules fail to respond to ADH. Water reabsorption by the renal tubules is impaired, leading to excretion of excessive amounts of dilute urine, often more than 10 litres daily, causing dehydration and extreme thirst (polydipsia). Water balance is disturbed unless fluid intake is greatly increased to compensate for excess losses.</p>

                            <p>Abnormal thyroid function may arise not only from thyroid disease but also from disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus; in addition, insufficient dietary iodine impairs synthesis of thyroid hormones. The main effects are caused by an abnormally high or low basal metabolic rate.</p>

                            <h3>Hyperthyroidism</h3>
                            <p>This syndrome, also known as <strong>thyrotoxicosis</strong>, arises as the body tissues are exposed to excessive levels of $T_3$ and $T_4$. The main effects are due to increased basal metabolic rate (see Table 9.3).<br>
                            In older adults, cardiac failure is another common consequence, as the ageing heart must work harder to deliver more blood and nutrients to the hyperactive body cells. The main causes of hyperthyroidism are:</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>Exophthalmos</strong><br>
                            This is protrusion of the eyeballs that gives the appearance of staring; it is due to the deposition of excess fat and fibrous tissue behind the eyes (Fig. 9.18), and is often present in Graves' disease. Effective treatment of hyperthyroidism does not completely reverse exophthalmos, although it may lessen after 2–3 years. In severe cases the eyelids become retracted and may not completely cover the eyes during blinking and sleep, leading to drying of the conjunctiva and predisposing to infection. It does not occur in other forms of hyperthyroidism.</p>

                            <p><strong>Toxic nodular goitre</strong><br>
                            In this condition, one or two nodules of a gland that is already affected by goitre (see Fig. 9.17) become active and secrete excess $T_3$ and $T_4$, causing the effects of hyperthyroidism (see Table 9.3). It is more common in women than men and after middle age. As this condition affects an older age group than Graves' disease, arrhythmias and cardiac failure are more common. Exophthalmos does not occur in this condition.</p>

                            <h3>Hypothyroidism</h3>
                            <p>Prevalent in older adults, this condition is five times more common in females than males. Deficiency of $T_3$ and $T_4$ in adults results in an abnormally low metabolic rate and other effects shown in Table 9.3. There may be accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the subcutaneous tissues, causing swelling (non-pitting oedema), especially of the face, hands, feet and eyelids (<strong>myxoedema</strong>). The most common causes are autoimmune thyroiditis, severe iodine deficiency (see Goitre) and healthcare interventions, e.g. antithyroid drugs, surgical removal of thyroid tissue or ionising radiation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Autoimmune thyroiditis</strong><br>
                            The most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism is <strong>Hashimoto's disease</strong>. It is more common in women than men and, like Graves' disease, is an organ-specific autoimmune condition. Autoantibodies that react with thyroglobulin and thyroid gland cells develop and prevent synthesis and release of thyroid hormones, causing hypothyroidism. Goitre is sometimes present.</p>

                            <p><strong>Congenital hypothyroidism</strong><br>
                            This is a profound deficiency or absence of thyroid hormones that becomes evident a few weeks or months after birth. Hypothyroidism is endemic in parts of the world where the diet is severely deficient in iodine and contains insufficient for synthesis of $T_3$ and $T_4$. Absence of thyroid hormones results in profound impairment of growth and cognitive development. Unless treatment begins early in life, cognitive impairment is permanent and the individual typically has disproportionately short limbs, a large, protruding tongue, coarse, dry skin, poor abdominal muscle tone and, often, an umbilical hernia.</p>

                            <h3>Simple goitre</h3>
                            <p>This is enlargement of the thyroid gland without signs of hyperthyroidism. It is caused by a relative lack of $T_3$ and $T_4$ and the low levels stimulate secretion of TSH, resulting in hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (see Fig. 9.17). Sometimes the extra thyroid tissue is able to maintain normal hormone levels, but if not, hypothyroidism develops. Causes are:</p>

                            <p>The enlarged gland may cause pressure damage to adjacent tissues, especially if it lies in an abnormally low position, i.e. behind the sternum. The structures most commonly affected are the oesophagus, causing dysphagia; the trachea, causing dyspnoea; and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness.</p>

                            Single adenomas are fairly common and may become cystic. Sometimes the adenoma secretes hormones and hyperthyroidism may develop. The tumours may become malignant, especially in older adults.</p>

                            This is caused by hypocalcaemia because low blood calcium levels increase excitability of peripheral nerves. There are very strong painful spasms of skeletal muscles, causing characteristic inward bending of the hands, forearms and feet (see Fig. 9.19). In children there may also be laryngeal spasm and seizures.</p>

                            <h3>Hyposecretion of glucocorticoids</h3>
                            <p>Inadequate cortisol secretion causes diminished gluconeogenesis, low blood glucose levels, muscle weakness and pallor. This may be primary, i.e. due to disease of the adrenal cortex, or secondary, due to deficiency of ACTH from the anterior pituitary. In primary deficiency there is also hyposecretion of aldosterone (see later), but in secondary deficiency aldosterone secretion is not usually affected because aldosterone release is controlled by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (p. 245).</p>

                            <h3>Hypersecretion of mineralocorticoids</h3>
                            <p>Excess aldosterone affects kidney function, with consequences elsewhere:</p>

                            <p><strong>Primary hyperaldosteronism</strong><br>
                            This is due to excessive secretion of mineralocorticoids, independent of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. It is usually caused by a tumour affecting only one adrenal gland.</p>
                            <p><strong>Secondary hyperaldosteronism</strong><br>
                            This is caused by over-stimulation of normal glands by the excessively high blood levels of renin and angiotensin that result from low renal perfusion or low blood sodium.</p>

                            <h3>Hyposecretion of mineralocorticoids</h3>
                            <p>Hypoaldosteronism results in failure of the kidneys to regulate sodium, potassium and water excretion, leading to:</p>

                            <p>There is usually hyposecretion of other adrenal cortical hormones, as in Addison's disease.</p>

                            <h3>Chronic adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease)</h3>
                            <p>This is due to destruction of the adrenal cortex, which results in hyposecretion of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. The most common causes are development of autoantibodies to cortical cells, metastases (secondary tumours) and infections. Autoimmune disease of other glands can be associated with Addison's disease, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis and hypoparathyroidism. The most important effects are:</p>

                            <p>This is characterised by sudden severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) and, in severe cases, circulatory collapse. It is precipitated when an individual with chronic adrenocortical insufficiency is subjected to stress, e.g. an acute infection.</p>

                            <h3>Diabetes mellitus</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common endocrine disorder. The primary sign is hyperglycaemia, which is accompanied by varying degrees of disruption of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. DM is caused by complete absence of, relative deficiency of or resistance to the hormone insulin. Box 9.2 shows the classification of diabetes. Primary DM is categorised as type 1 or type 2. In secondary DM, the disorder arises as a result of other conditions, and gestational diabetes develops in pregnancy. The worldwide increase in DM over the past few decades has been described as an epidemic. The global prevalence in adults over 18 years has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014, representing an increase in those affected from 108 million to 422 million over the same period (WHO, 2016). Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, including viral infections, are implicated in both types. Table 9.5 shows some distinguishing features of types 1 and 2 DM.</p>

There is severe deficiency or absence of insulin secretion due to destruction of $\beta$-islet cells of the pancreas by autoantibodies. Treatment with insulin is required.</p>

                            <p>Its onset is gradual, often over many years, and it frequently goes undetected until signs are found on routine investigation or a complication occurs. Insulin secretion may be below or above normal. Body cells are unable to extract glucose from the extracellular fluid, and there are two main reasons for this. First, inadequate insulin levels means that activation of the insulin-mediated glucose transport mechanisms in the plasma membrane is deficient. Secondly, insulin receptors on the cell surface may become dysfunctional (insulin resistance), so even in the presence of normal or elevated blood glucose and insulin levels, the cells cannot extract the insulin they require. Treatment involves diet and/or drugs, although sometimes insulin injections are required.</p>

                            <p><strong>Glycosuria and polyuria</strong><br>
                            The concentration of glucose in the glomerular filtrate is the same as in the blood and, although DM raises the renal threshold for glucose, it is not all reabsorbed by the tubules. The glucose remaining in the filtrate raises its osmotic pressure, water reabsorption is reduced and the volume of urine is increased (polyuria). This results in electrolyte imbalance and excretion of urine of high specific gravity. Polyuria leads to dehydration, extreme thirst (polydipsia) and increased fluid intake.</p>

                            <p><strong>Weight loss</strong><br>
                            The cells are essentially starved of glucose because, in the absence of insulin, they are unable to extract it from the bloodstream, leading to derangement of energy metabolism as cells must use alternative pathways to produce the energy they need.

                            This nearly always affects people with type 1 DM.<br>
                            In the absence of insulin to promote normal intracellular glucose metabolism, alternative energy sources must be used instead and increased breakdown of fat occurs (see Fig. 12.43). Ketones, including acetone and butyrate, are released as by-products. The liver has a limited capacity to metabolise these ketones, and normal buffering systems maintain pH balance so long as the levels of ketone bodies are not excessive. Ketosis (p. 346) develops as ketone bodies accumulate. Excretion of ketones is via the urine (ketonuria) and/or the lungs, giving the breath a characteristic smell of acetone or 'pear drops'.</p>
                            <p>Ketoacidosis is a medical emergency, indicating severely deranged cell metabolism secondary to insulin deficiency. It may be due to stressors such as pregnancy, infection or acute illness, or missed or inadequate doses of insulin, especially when requirements are increased. Severe and dangerous ketoacidosis may occur without loss of consciousness. When worsening ketosis swamps the compensatory buffer systems, control of acid-base balance is lost; the blood pH falls and ketoacidosis occurs. If this is untreated, the consequences are:</p>

                            <p>These increase with the severity and duration of hyperglycaemia and represent significant causes of morbidity (poor health) and mortality (death) in people with both type 1 and type 2 DM.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cardiovascular disturbances</strong><br>
                            DM is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disorders. Blood vessel abnormalities (angiopathies) may still occur even when the disease is well controlled.</p>
                            <p><em>Diabetic macroangiopathy</em><br>
                            The most common lesions are atheroma and calcification of the tunica media of the large arteries. In type 1 DM these changes may occur at a relatively early age. The most common consequences are serious and often fatal:</p>

                            <p><strong>Renal failure</strong><br>
                            Chronic kidney disease is due to diabetic nephropathy (p. 386) and is a common cause of death.</p>

                            <p><strong>Visual impairment and blindness</strong><br>
                            Diabetic retinopathy (p. 229) is the most common cause of blindness in adults between 30 and 65 years in developed countries. DM also increases the risk of early development of cataracts (p. 229) and other visual disorders.</p>

                            <p><strong>Diabetic foot</strong><br>
                            Many factors commonly present in DM contribute to the development of this serious situation. Disease of large and small blood vessels impairs blood supply to and around the extremities. If peripheral neuropathy is present, sensation is reduced and a small injury to the foot may go unnoticed, especially when there is visual impairment. In DM, healing is slower and injuries easily worsen if aggravated, e.g. by chafing shoes, and often become infected. An ulcer may form (Fig. 9.21) and the healing process is lengthy, if it occurs at all. In severe cases the injured area ulcerates and enlarges, and may become gangrenous, sometimes to the extent that amputation is required.</p>
