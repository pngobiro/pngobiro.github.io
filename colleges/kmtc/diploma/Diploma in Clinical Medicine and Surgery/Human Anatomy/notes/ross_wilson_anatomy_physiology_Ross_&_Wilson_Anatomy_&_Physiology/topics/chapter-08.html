                            <p>The special senses are hearing, sight, smell, taste and balance; all have specialised sensory receptors that collect and transmit information to specific areas of the brain. Incoming nerve impulses from the ears, eyes, nose and mouth are integrated and coordinated within the brain, allowing perception of this information. Up to 80% of what we perceive comes from external sensory stimuli. The first sections of this chapter explore the special senses, while the later ones consider the effect of ageing and problems that arise when disorders occur in the structures involved in hearing and vision.</p>

                            <p>The ear is the organ of hearing and is also involved in balance. It is supplied by the cochlear branch of the 8th cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve, which responds to the vibrations generated by sound waves and transmits this information to the brain.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of the auricle (pinna), the structures that form the ear are encased within the petrous portion of the temporal bone.</p>

                            <h3>Structure</h3>
                            <p>The ear is divided into three distinct parts (Fig. 8.1): the outer ear, middle ear (tympanic cavity) and inner ear.</p>
                            <p>The outer ear collects sound waves and directs them to the middle ear, which in turn transfers them to the inner ear. The inner ear converts the sound waves into nerve impulses, which are transmitted to the auditory cortex (hearing area) of the brain.</p>

                            <h4>Outer ear</h4>
                            <p>The outer ear consists of the auricle (pinna) and the external acoustic meatus (auditory canal).</p>

                            <p><strong>Auricle (pinna)</strong><br>
                            The auricle is the visible part of the ear that projects from the side of the head. It is composed of fibroelastic cartilage and covered with skin. It is deeply grooved and ridged; the most prominent outer ridge is the helix.<br>
                            The lobule (earlobe) is the soft pliable part at the lower extremity, composed of fibrous and adipose tissue richly supplied with blood.</p>

                            <p><strong>External acoustic meatus (auditory canal)</strong><br>
                            This is a slightly 'S'-shaped tube about 2.5 cm long, extending from the auricle to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The lateral third is embedded in cartilage and the remainder lies within the temporal bone. It is lined with skin continuous with that of the auricle. There are numerous ceruminous glands and hair follicles, with associated sebaceous glands, in the skin of the lateral third. Ceruminous glands are modified sweat glands that secrete cerumen (earwax), a sticky material containing protective substances including the bactericidal enzyme lysozyme and immunoglobulins. Foreign materials, e.g. dust, insects and microbes, are prevented from reaching the tympanic membrane by wax, hairs and the curvature of the meatus. Movements of the temporomandibular joint during chewing and speaking 'massage' the cartilaginous meatus, moving the wax towards the exterior.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>tympanic membrane</strong> (eardrum) (Fig. 8.2) completely separates the external acoustic meatus from the middle ear. It is oval shaped with the slightly broader edge upwards and is formed by three layers of tissue: an outer covering of hairless skin, a middle layer of fibrous tissue and an inner lining of mucous membrane continuous with that of the middle ear.</p>

                            <p>This is an irregular-shaped air-filled cavity within the petrous portion of the temporal bone (Fig. 8.3; see also Fig. 8.1). The cavity, its contents and the air sacs that open out of it are lined with either simple squamous or cuboidal epithelium.</p>

                            <p>The oval window is covered by part of a small bone called the stapes and the round window by a fine sheet of fibrous tissue.</p>

                            <p>Air reaches the cavity through the <strong>pharyngotympanic (auditory or Eustachian) tube</strong>, which links the nasopharynx and middle ear. It is about 4 cm long and lined with ciliated columnar epithelium. The presence of air at atmospheric pressure on both sides of the tympanic membrane is maintained by the pharyngotympanic tube and this enables the membrane to vibrate when sound waves strike it. The pharyngotympanic tube is normally closed but when there is unequal pressure across the tympanic membrane, e.g. at high altitude, it is opened by swallowing or yawning and the ears 'pop', equalising the pressure again.</p>

                            <p><strong>Auditory ossicles</strong><br>
                            These are three very small bones, only a few millimetres in size, that form a chain across the middle ear from the tympanic membrane to the oval window (Fig. 8.3; see also Fig. 8.1). Between the bones there are synovial joints that allow the bones to vibrate within the air-filled tympanic cavity. The ossicles are held in place by fine ligaments and are named according to their shapes.</p>

                            <p>The inner ear (Fig. 8.4) or <strong>labyrinth</strong> (meaning 'maze') contains the organs of hearing and balance. It is described in two parts: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. It is divided into three main regions:</p>

                            <p>The inner ear is formed from a network of channels and cavities in the temporal bone (the <strong>bony labyrinth</strong>). Within the bony labyrinth, like a tube within a tube, is the <strong>membranous labyrinth</strong>, a network of fluid-filled membranes that lines and fills the bony labyrinth (Fig. 8.4).</p>

                            This is lined with periosteum. Within the bony labyrinth, the membranous labyrinth is suspended in a watery fluid called <strong>perilymph</strong>.</p>

                            This is filled with <strong>endolymph</strong>.</p>

                            This is the expanded part nearest the middle ear. The oval and round windows are located in its lateral wall. It contains two membranous sacs, the <strong>utricle</strong> and the <strong>saccule</strong>, which are important in balance (p. 212).</p>

                            <p><strong>Semicircular canals</strong><br>
                            These are three tubes arranged so that one is situated in each of the three planes of space. They are continuous with the vestibule and are also important in balance (p. 212).</p>

                            This resembles a snail's shell. It has a broad base where it is continuous with the vestibule and a narrow apex, and it spirals round a central bony column.</p>

                            <p>In cross-section the bony cochlea has two compartments containing perilymph: the scala vestibuli, which originates at the oval window, and the scala tympani, which ends at the round window. The two compartments are continuous with each other and Fig. 8.6 shows the relationship between these structures. The cochlear duct, which is an extension of the membranous labyrinth, lies between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, is triangular in cross-section and contains the organs of hearing. On the basilar membrane, or base of the triangle, there are supporting cells and specialised cochlear hair cells containing auditory receptors. These cells form the <strong>spiral organ (of Corti)</strong>, the sensory organ that responds to vibration by initiating nerve impulses that are then perceived as hearing within the brain. The auditory receptors are dendrites of afferent (sensory) nerves that combine, forming the cochlear (auditory) part of the vestibulocochlear nerve (8th cranial nerve), which passes through a foramen in the temporal bone to reach the hearing area in the temporal lobe of the cerebrum (see Fig. 7.20).</p>

                            <h3>Physiology of hearing</h3>
                            <p>Sound is carried as pressure (sound) waves in the air, which travel at about 340 metres per second. The auricle, because of its shape, collects and concentrates sound waves and directs them along the auditory canal, causing the tympanic membrane to vibrate. Tympanic membrane vibrations are transmitted and amplified through the middle ear by movement of the ossicles (Fig. 8.6). At their medial end the footplate of the stapes rocks to and fro in the oval window, setting up fluid waves in the perilymph of the scala vestibuli. Some of the force of these waves is transmitted along the length of the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, but most of the pressure is transmitted into the cochlear duct. This causes a corresponding wave motion in the endolymph, resulting in vibration of the basilar membrane and stimulation of the auditory receptors in the hair cells of the spiral organ. The nerve impulses generated pass to the brain in the cochlear (auditory) portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The fluid wave is finally expended into the middle ear by vibration of the membrane of the round window. The vestibulocochlear nerve transmits the impulses to the auditory nuclei in the medulla, where they synapse before they are conducted to the auditory area in the temporal lobe of the cerebrum (see Fig. 7.20). Because some fibres cross over in the medulla and others do not, the left and right auditory areas of the cerebrum receive impulses from both ears.</p>

                            <p>Sound waves have the properties of pitch and volume (Fig. 8.7). <strong>Pitch</strong> is determined by the frequency of the sound waves and is measured in hertz (Hz). Sounds of different frequencies stimulate the basilar membrane (see Fig. 8.6A) at different places along its length, allowing discrimination of pitch. The basilar membrane close to the oval window is sensitive to high-pitched sounds, whereas the region towards the tip of the cochlea is responsive to lower-pitched sounds.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>volume</strong> depends on the magnitude of the sound waves and is measured in decibels (dB). The greater the amplitude of the wave created in the endolymph, the greater is the stimulation of the auditory receptors in the hair cells in the spiral organ, enabling perception of sounds with different volume. Long-term exposure to excessive noise causes hearing impairment because it damages the sensitive hair cells of the spiral organ.</p>

                            <p>There are three semicircular canals, one lying in each of the three planes of space. They are situated above, beside and behind the vestibule of the inner ear and open into it.</p>
                            <p>The semicircular canals, like the cochlea, are composed of an outer bony wall and inner membranous tubes or ducts. The membranous ducts contain endolymph and are separated from the bony wall by perilymph.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>utricle</strong> is a membranous sac that is part of the vestibule, and the three membranous ducts open into it at their dilated ends, the <strong>ampullae</strong>. The <strong>saccule</strong> is a part of the vestibule and communicates with the utricle and the cochlea.</p>
                            <p>In the walls of the utricle, saccule and ampullae are fine, specialised epithelial cells with minute projections, called <strong>hair cells</strong>. Among the hair cells there are receptors on sensory nerve endings, which combine, forming the vestibulocochlear nerve.</p>

                            <h3>Physiology of balance</h3>
                            <p>The semicircular canals and the vestibule (utricle and saccule) are concerned with balance, or equilibrium. The arrangement of the three semicircular canals, one in each plane, allows perception not only of the position of the head in space but also of the direction and rate of any movement. Any change of position of the head causes movement in the endolymph bathing the hair cells, which distorts them and stimulates the sensory receptors in the utricle, saccule and ampullae. The resultant nerve impulses are transmitted by the vestibular nerve, which joins the cochlear nerve to form the vestibulocochlear nerve. The vestibular branch passes first to the vestibular nucleus, then to the cerebellum.</p>
                            <p>The cerebellum also receives nerve impulses from the eyes and proprioceptors (sensory receptors) in the skeletal muscles and joints. The cerebellum coordinates incoming impulses from the vestibular nerve, the eyes and proprioceptors. Thereafter, impulses are transmitted to the cerebrum and skeletal muscles, enabling perception of body position and any adjustments needed to maintain posture and balance. This maintains upright posture and fixing of the eyes on the same point, independently of head movements.</p>

                            <p>The eye is the organ of sight. It is situated in the orbital cavity, a bony socket built into the bones of the face and supplied by the optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve). It is almost spherical in shape and about 2.5 cm in diameter. The space between the eye and the orbital cavity is occupied by adipose tissue. The bony walls of the orbit and the fat within it protect the eye from injury.</p>
                            <p>Structurally, the two eyes are separate but, unlike the ears, some of their activities are coordinated so that they normally function as a pair. It is possible to see with only one eye (monocular vision) but three-dimensional vision is impaired when only one eye is used, especially in relation to the judgement of speed and distance.</p>

                            <h3>Structure</h3>
                            <p>Internally, the eye is divided into two chambers, the anterior and the posterior chambers, with the lens of the eye, the ciliary body and the suspensory ligaments (Fig. 8.8) separating them. The anterior chamber is filled with a clear, watery fluid called <strong>aqueous humour</strong>, and the posterior chamber is filled with a jelly-like substance called <strong>vitreous humour</strong> (vitreous body).</p>

                            <h4>Sclera and cornea</h4>
                            <p>The <strong>sclera</strong>, or white of the eye, forms the outermost layer of the posterior and lateral aspects of the eyeball and is continuous anteriorly with the cornea. It is a firm fibrous membrane that maintains the shape of the eye and gives attachment to the extrinsic muscles of the eye (see Table 8.1, p. 221).</p>
                            <p>Anteriorly the sclera continues as a clear transparent epithelial membrane, the <strong>cornea</strong>. Light rays pass through the cornea to reach the retina. The cornea is convex anteriorly and is involved in refracting (bending) light rays to focus them on the retina.</p>

                            <h4>Choroid</h4>
                            <p>The choroid (Fig. 8.9; see also Fig. 8.8) lines the posterior five-sixths of the inner surface of the sclera. It is very rich in blood vessels and is deep chocolate brown in colour. Light enters the eye through the pupil, stimulates the sensory receptors in the retina (see below) and is then absorbed by the choroid.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <h4>Ciliary body</h4>
                            <p>The ciliary body is the anterior continuation of the choroid, consisting of ciliary muscle (circular smooth muscle fibres) and secretory epithelial cells. The lens is attached to the ciliary body by radiating suspensory ligaments, like the spokes of a wheel (see Fig. 8.10). Contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle fibres, which are attached to these ligaments, determine the size and thickness of the lens.</p>
                            <p>The epithelial cells secrete aqueous humour, which circulates through the anterior chamber to nourish its structures.</p>
                            <p>The ciliary body is supplied by parasympathetic branches of the oculomotor nerve (3rd cranial nerve). Stimulation causes contraction of the ciliary muscle and accommodation of the eye (p. 218).</p>

                            <h4>Iris</h4>
                            <p>The iris is the visible coloured ring at the front of the eye and extends anteriorly from the ciliary body, lying behind the cornea and in front of the lens. It divides the anterior chamber of the eye into anterior and posterior cavities, which contain aqueous humour secreted by the ciliary body. The iris is composed of pigment cells and two layers of smooth muscle fibres, one circular and the other radiating (see Fig. 8.9). In the centre is an aperture called the <strong>pupil</strong>.</p>
                            <p>The iris is supplied by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Parasympathetic stimulation constricts the pupil and sympathetic stimulation dilates it (see Figs 7.45 and 7.44, respectively).</p>
                            <p>The colour of the iris is genetically determined and depends on the number of pigment cells present. Albinos have no pigment cells and people with blue eyes have fewer than those with brown eyes.</p>

                            <h4>Lens</h4>
                            <p>The lens (Fig. 8.10) is a highly elastic circular biconvex body, lying immediately behind the pupil. It consists of fibres enclosed within a capsule and is suspended from the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament. Its thickness is controlled by the ciliary muscle through the suspensory ligament. The lens bends (refracts) light rays reflected into the eye from objects in the visual field. It is the only structure in the eye that can vary its thickness, and therefore its refractory power, to focus light rays on the retina.</p>
                            <p>When the ciliary muscle contracts, it releases its pull on the lens, increasing its thickness. The nearer the object being viewed, the thicker the lens becomes to allow focusing (see Fig. 8.18).</p>

                            <h4>Retina</h4>
                            <p>The retina is the innermost lining of the eye (see Fig. 8.8). It is an extremely delicate structure composed of several layers of nerve cell bodies and their axons, lying on a pigmented layer of epithelial cells. The light-sensitive layer consists of sensory receptor cells, <strong>rods</strong> and <strong>cones</strong>, which contain photosensitive pigments that convert light rays into nerve impulses.</p>
                            <p>The retina lines about three-quarters of the eyeball and is thickest at the back. It thins out anteriorly to end just behind the ciliary body. Near the centre of the posterior part is the <strong>macula lutea</strong>, or yellow spot (Figs 8.11A and 8.12). In the centre of the yellow spot is a little depression called the <strong>fovea centralis</strong>, consisting only of cones. Towards the anterior part of the retina there are fewer cones than rods.</p>
                            <p>About 0.5 cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea all the retinal nerve fibres converge to form the optic nerve. The small area of retina where the optic nerve leaves the eye is the <strong>optic disc</strong> or <strong>blind spot</strong>. It has no light-sensitive cells.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood supply to the eye</strong><br>
                            Arterial supply is from the ciliary arteries and the central retinal artery. These are branches of the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery.<br>
                            Venous drainage is by a number of veins, including the central retinal vein, which eventually empty into a deep venous sinus.<br>
                            The central retinal artery and vein are encased in the optic nerve, which enters the eye at the optic disc (see Fig. 8.8).</p>

                            <h3>Interior of the eye</h3>
                            <p>The anterior chamber of the eye, i.e. the space between the cornea and the lens, is incompletely divided into anterior and posterior cavities by the iris (see Fig. 8.8). Both cavities contain a clear aqueous fluid, <strong>aqueous humour</strong>, secreted into the posterior cavity by the ciliary glands. It circulates in front of the lens, through the pupil into the anterior cavity, and returns to the venous circulation through the <strong>scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm)</strong> in the angle between the iris and cornea (see Fig. 8.8). The intraocular pressure remains fairly constant between 1.3 and 2.6 kPa (10 and 20 mmHg), as production and drainage rates of aqueous humour are equal. An increase in this pressure causes glaucoma (p. 228). Aqueous humour supplies nutrients and removes wastes from the transparent structures in the front of the eye that have no blood supply, i.e. the cornea, lens and lens capsule.</p>
                            <p>Behind the lens and filling the posterior chamber of the eyeball is the <strong>vitreous body</strong>. This is a soft, colourless, transparent, jelly-like substance composed of 99% water, mineral salts and mucoprotein. It maintains sufficient intraocular pressure to support the retina against the choroid and prevent the eyeball from collapsing.</p>
                            <p>The eye keeps its shape because of the intraocular pressure exerted by the vitreous body and the aqueous humour.</p>

                            <h4>Optic nerves (second cranial nerves)</h4>
                            <p>The fibres of the optic nerve (Fig. 8.13) originate in the retina and converge to form the optic nerve about 0.5 cm to the nasal side of the macula lutea at the optic disc. The nerve pierces the choroid and sclera before passing backwards and medially through the orbital cavity. It then passes through the optic foramen of the sphenoid bone, backwards and medially to meet its counterpart from the other eye at the optic chiasma.</p>

                            <p><strong>Optic chiasma</strong><br>
                            This is situated immediately in front of and above the pituitary gland, which lies in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone (see Fig. 9.2). In the optic chiasma the nerve fibres of the optic nerve from the nasal side of each retina cross over to the opposite side. The fibres from the temporal side do not cross but continue backwards on the same side. This crossing over provides both cerebral hemispheres with sensory input from each eye.</p>

                            <p><strong>Optic tracts</strong><br>
                            These are the pathways of the optic nerves, posterior to the optic chiasma (see Fig. 8.13). Each tract consists of the nasal fibres from the retina of one eye and the temporal fibres from the retina of the other. The optic tracts pass backwards to synapse with nerve cells of the lateral geniculate bodies of the thalamus. From there the nerve fibres proceed backwards and medially as the optic radiations, to terminate in the visual area of the cerebral cortex in the occipital lobes of the cerebrum (see Fig. 7.20). Other neurones originating in the lateral geniculate bodies transmit impulses from the eyes to the cerebellum, where, together with impulses from the semicircular canals of the inner ears and from the skeletal muscles and joints, they contribute to the maintenance of posture and balance.</p>

                            <h3>Physiology of sight</h3>
                            <p>Light waves travel at $300,000,000$ metres per second ($\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$), or about 186,000 miles per second. This is much greater than the speed of sound in air (about $340 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$) and explains why we see lightning before hearing thunder.</p>
                            <p>Light is reflected into the eyes by objects within the field of vision. White light is a combination of all the colours of the visual spectrum (rainbow), i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. This is demonstrated by passing white light through a glass prism that refracts (bends) the rays of the different colours to a greater or lesser extent, depending on their wavelengths (Fig. 8.14). Red light has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest.</p>

                            <h4>Refraction of the light rays</h4>
                            <p>When light rays pass from a medium of one density to a medium of a different density, they are refracted. Fig. 8.14 shows how a glass prism separates a beam of white light into its constituent colours, by refracting each wavelength to a different degree. In the eye the biconvex lens refracts and focuses light rays (Fig. 8.16). This principle is used to focus light on the retina. Before reaching the retina, light rays pass successively through the conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous fluid, lens and vitreous body. These structures are all denser than air and, with the exception of the lens, they have a constant refractory power, similar to that of water. This means that although they all refract light rays entering the eye, their ability to do this is fixed and so cannot be adjusted to assist in focusing.</p>

                            <p><strong>The electromagnetic spectrum</strong><br>
                            The electromagnetic spectrum is broad but only a small part is visible to the human eye. Beyond the long end are infrared waves (heat), microwaves and radio waves. Beyond the short end are ultraviolet (UV) rays, X-rays and gamma rays. UV light is not normally visible because it is absorbed by a yellow pigment in the lens. Following removal of the lens (cataract extraction), it is usually replaced with an artificial one to prevent long-term damage to the retina from UV light rays.</p>
                            <p>A specific colour is perceived when only one wavelength is reflected by the object and all the others are absorbed, e.g. an object appears red when it reflects only red light. Objects appear white when they reflect all wavelengths of light into the eye, and black when they absorb all the light hitting them and so reflect nothing.</p>

                            <p>In order to achieve clear vision, light reflected from objects within the visual field is focused on to the retina of each eye. The processes involved in producing a clear visual image are:</p>

                            <p>Light rays reflected from an object are refracted by the lens when they enter the eye, as shown in Fig. 8.16, although the image on the retina is actually upside down (Fig. 8.17).

                            <p><strong>Lens</strong><br>
                            The lens is a biconvex elastic transparent body suspended behind the iris from the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament (see Fig. 8.10) and is the only structure in the eye able to change its refractive power. Light rays entering the eye need to be refracted to focus them on the retina. Light from distant objects needs least refraction and, as the object comes closer, the amount of refraction needed increases. To focus light rays from near objects on the retina, the refractory power of the lens must be increased - by <strong>accommodation</strong>. To do this, the ciliary muscle contracts, moving the ciliary body inwards towards the lens. This lessens the pull on the suspensory ligaments and allows the lens to bulge, increasing its convexity and focusing light rays on the retina (Fig. 8.18B).</p>
                            <p>To focus light rays from distant objects on the retina, the circular ciliary muscle relaxes, increasing its pull on the suspensory ligaments. This makes the lens thinner and focuses light rays from distant objects on the retina (Fig. 8.18A).</p>

                            <p><strong>Size of the pupils</strong><br>
                            Pupil size contributes to clear vision by controlling the amount of light entering the eye. In bright light the pupils are constricted and in dim light they are dilated (Fig. 8.19).</p>
                            <p>If the pupils were dilated in bright light, too much light would enter the eye and damage the sensitive retina. In dim light, if the pupils were constricted, insufficient light would enter the eye to activate the light-sensitive pigments in the rods and cones, which stimulate the nerve endings in the retina, enabling vision.</p>
                            <p>The iris consists of one layer of circular and one of radiating smooth muscle fibres. Contraction of the circular fibres constricts the pupil, and contraction of the radiating fibres dilates it. The size of the pupil is controlled by the autonomic nervous system; sympathetic stimulation dilates the pupils and parasympathetic stimulation constricts them.</p>

                            In order to focus on near objects, i.e. within about 6 metres, accommodation is required and the eye must make the following adjustments:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">convergence</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>

                            <p><em>Constriction of the pupils.</em> This assists accommodation by reducing the width of the beam of light entering the eye so that it passes through the central curved part of the lens (see Fig. 8.17).</p>
                            <p><em>Convergence (movement of the eyeballs).</em> Light rays from nearby objects enter the two eyes at different angles and for clear vision they must stimulate corresponding areas of the two retinae. Extrinsic muscles move the eyes and to obtain a clear image they also rotate them so that they converge on the object viewed. This coordinated muscle activity is under autonomic control. When there is voluntary movement of the eyes, both eyes move and convergence is maintained. The nearer an object is to the eyes, the greater the eye rotation needed to achieve convergence; for example, focusing near the tip of one's nose gives the appearance of being 'cross-eyed'. If convergence is not complete, the eyes are focused on different objects or on different points of the same object. There are then two images sent to the brain and this can lead to double vision, or diplopia. If convergence is not possible, the brain tends to ignore the impulses received from the divergent eye (see Squint, p. 229).</p>
                            <p><em>Changing the refractory power of the lens.</em> Changes in the thickness of the lens are made to focus light on the retina. The amount of adjustment depends on the distance of the object from the eyes, i.e. the lens is thicker for near vision and at its thinnest when focusing on objects more than 6 metres away (see Fig. 8.18). Looking at near objects 'tires' the eyes more quickly, owing to the continuous use of the ciliary muscle. The lens loses its elasticity and stiffens with age, a condition known as presbyopia (p. 225).</p>
                            <p><em>Distant vision.</em> Objects more than 6 metres away from the eyes are focused on the retina without adjustment of the lens or convergence of the eyes.</p>

                            <h4>Functions of the retina</h4>
                            <p>The retina is the light-sensitive (photosensitive) part of the eye. The light-sensitive nerve cells are the rods and cones, and their distribution in the retina is shown in Fig. 8.11A. Light rays cause chemical changes in light-sensitive pigments in these cells and they generate nerve impulses, which are conducted to the occipital lobes of the cerebrum via the optic nerves (see Fig. 8.13).</p>

                            <p><strong>Rods</strong><br>
                            The rods are much more light-sensitive than the cones (see Fig. 8.11), so they are used when light levels are low. Stimulation of rods leads to monochromic (black and white) vision. Rods outnumber cones in the retina by about 16:1 and are much more numerous towards the periphery.</p>

                            <p><strong>Cones</strong><br>
                            The cones are sensitive to light and colour; bright light is required to activate them and give sharp, clear colour vision. Cones are concentrated at the macula lutea, which is the spot on the retina where light rays fall from an object in the direct field of vision. This means that whatever is being directly observed is seen in detail, brightly coloured and in sharp focus. Cone numbers fall sharply and rod numbers rise on the retina peripheral to the macula lutea.</p>

                            <p><strong>Rhodopsins</strong><br>
                            This is a family of light-sensitive pigments, found in both rods and cones, which are broken down (bleached) when they absorb light hitting the cell. Degradation of the rhodopsin molecule generates an action potential. Following bleaching, the rhodopsin molecule has to be reassembled before it is functional again. There is only one type of rhodopsin in rods, absorbing at a single wavelength, which is why rods give monochromatic vision. Cones, however, have one of three different rhodopsins, absorbing at three different wavelengths and giving rise to so-called red, blue and green cones. Colour perception depends on the combination of red, blue and green cones stimulated. A good supply of vitamin A is needed for adequate rhodopsin production.</p>

                            <p><strong>Colour blindness</strong><br>
                            This is a common condition that affects more men than women. Although affected individuals see colours, they cannot always differentiate between them, as the light-sensitive pigments (to red, green or blue) in cones are abnormal. There are different forms but the most common is red-green colour blindness, which is transmitted a by sex-linked recessive gene (see Fig. 17.11); greens, oranges, pale reds and browns all appear to be the same colour and can be distinguished only by their intensity.</p>

                            <p><strong>Dark adaptation</strong><br>
                            When exposed to bright light, the rhodopsin within the sensitive rods is completely degraded. This does not affect vision in good light, when there is enough light to activate the cones. However, moving into a darkened area where the light intensity is insufficient to stimulate the cones causes temporary visual impairment while the rhodopsin is being regenerated within the rods: 'dark adaptation'. When regeneration of rhodopsin has occurred, normal sight returns.<br>
                            Sudden exposure to bright light, e.g. a camera flash, causes immediate bleaching of rhodopsin in rods and cones, and temporary blindness until the rhodopsin is regenerated.<br>
                            It is easier to see a dim star in the sky at night if the head is turned slightly away from it because light of low intensity is then focused on an area of the retina where there is a greater concentration of rods. If a dim star is looked at directly, the light intensity is not sufficient to stimulate the less sensitive cones in the area of the macula lutea. In dim evening light, colours cannot be distinguished because the light intensity is insufficient to stimulate colour-sensitive pigments in cones.</p>

                            <p><strong>Binocular vision</strong><br>
                            Binocular or stereoscopic vision enables three-dimensional views, although each eye 'sees' a scene from a slightly different angle (Fig. 8.20). The visual fields overlap in the middle but the left eye sees more on the left than can be seen by the other eye and vice versa. The images from the two eyes are integrated in the cerebrum so that only one image is perceived.<br>
                            Binocular vision provides a much more accurate assessment of one object relative to another, e.g. its distance, depth, height and width. People with monocular vision may find it difficult, for example, to judge the speed and distance of an approaching vehicle.</p>

                            <h4>Extraocular muscles of the eye</h4>
                            <p>These include the muscles of the eyelids and those that move the eyeballs. The eyeball is moved by six extrinsic muscles, attached at one end to the eyeball and at the other to the walls of the orbital cavity. There are four straight (rectus) muscles and two oblique muscles (Fig. 8.21).</p>
                            <p>Moving the eyes to look in a particular direction is under voluntary control but coordination of movement, needed for convergence and accommodation to near or distant vision, is under autonomic (involuntary) control. Movements of the eyes resulting from the action of these muscles are shown in Table 8.1.</p>

                            <p><strong>Eyebrows</strong><br>
                            These are two arched ridges of the supraorbital margins of the frontal bone. Numerous hairs (eyebrows) project obliquely from the surface of the skin. They protect the eyeball from sweat, dust and other foreign bodies.</p>

                            <p><strong>Eyelids (palpebrae)</strong><br>
                            The eyelids are two movable folds of tissue situated above and below the front of each eye. On their free edges are short, curved hairs: the eyelashes. The layers of tissue that form them are:</p>

                            <p><strong>Conjunctiva</strong><br>
                            This is a fine transparent membrane that lines the eyelids and the front of the eyeball (Fig. 8.22). Where it lines the eyelids it consists of highly vascular columnar epithelium. Corneal conjunctiva consists of avascular stratified epithelium, i.e. epithelium without blood vessels. When the eyelids are closed the conjunctiva becomes a closed sac. It protects the delicate cornea and the front of the eye. When eyedrops are administered, they are placed in the lower conjunctival sac. The medial and lateral angles of the eye, where the upper and lower lids come together, are called the medial canthus and the lateral canthus, respectively.</p>

                            <p><strong>Eyelid margins</strong><br>
                            Along the edges of the lids are numerous sebaceous glands, some with ducts opening into the hair follicles of the eyelashes and some on to the eyelid margins between the hairs. <strong>Tarsal glands</strong> are modified sebaceous glands embedded in the tarsal plates with ducts that open on to the inside of the free margins of the eyelids. They secrete an oily material, spread over the conjunctiva by blinking, which delays evaporation of tears.</p>

                            <p><strong>Functions</strong><br>
                            The eyelids and eyelashes protect the eye from injury:</p>

                            <p><strong>Lacrimal gland</strong><br>
                            The lacrimal glands are exocrine glands situated in recesses in the frontal bones on the lateral aspect of each eye, just behind the supraorbital margin. Each gland is approximately the size and shape of an almond, and is composed of secretory epithelial cells. The glands secrete tears composed of water, mineral salts, antibodies (immunoglobulins, Ch. 15) and lysozyme, a bactericidal enzyme.</p>
                            <p>The tears leave the lacrimal gland by several small ducts and pass over the front of the eye under the lids towards the medial canthus, where they drain into the two <strong>lacrimal canaliculi</strong>; the opening of each is called the <strong>punctum</strong>. The two canaliculi lie one above the other, separated by a small red body, the <strong>caruncle</strong>. The tears then drain into the <strong>lacrimal sac</strong>, which is the upper expanded end of the <strong>nasolacrimal duct</strong>. This is a membranous canal approximately 2 cm long, extending from the lower part of the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity, opening at the level of the inferior concha. Normally, the rate of secretion of tears keeps pace with the rate of drainage. When a foreign body or other irritant enters the eye, the secretion of tears is greatly increased and the conjunctival blood vessels dilate. Secretion of tears is also increased in emotional states, e.g. crying, laughing.</p>

                            <p><strong>Functions</strong><br>
                            The fluid that fills the conjunctival sac is a mixture of tears and the oily secretion of tarsal glands, which is spread over the cornea by blinking. The functions of this fluid include:</p>

                            <p>The sense of smell, or <strong>olfaction</strong>, originates in the nasal cavity. The human sense of smell is less acute than in other animals. Many animals secrete odorous chemicals called pheromones, which play an important part in chemical communication in, for example, territorial behaviour, mating and the bonding of mothers and their newborn. The role of pheromones in humans is unknown.</p>

                            <h4>Olfactory nerves (first cranial nerves)</h4>
                            <p>These are the sensory nerves of smell. They originate as chemoreceptors (specialised olfactory nerve endings) in the mucous membrane of the roof of the nasal cavity above the superior nasal conchae (Fig. 8.24). On each side of the nasal septum nerve fibres pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to the olfactory bulb, where interconnections and synapses occur. From the bulb, bundles of nerve fibres form the olfactory tract, which passes backwards to the olfactory area in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex in each hemisphere, where the impulses are interpreted and odour perceived.</p>

                            <h4>Physiology of smell</h4>
                            <p>All odorous materials give off volatile molecules, which are carried into the nose with inhaled air, and even very low concentrations, when dissolved in mucus, stimulate the olfactory chemoreceptors.</p>
                            <p>The air entering the nose is warmed and convection currents carry eddies of inspired air to the roof of the nasal cavity. 'Sniffing' concentrates volatile molecules in the roof of the nose. This increases the number of olfactory receptors stimulated and thus perception of the smell. The sense of smell and the sense of taste are closely related; the sense of smell may affect the appetite. If the odours are pleasant the appetite may improve and vice versa. When accompanied by the sight of food, an appetising smell increases salivation and stimulates the digestive system (Ch. 12). The sense of smell may create powerful and long-lasting memories, especially for distinctive odours, e.g. hospital smells, or favourite or least-liked foods.</p>
                            <p>Inflammation of the nasal mucosa prevents odorous substances from reaching the olfactory area of the nose, causing loss of the sense of smell (<strong>anosmia</strong>). The usual cause is a cold.</p>

                            <p><strong>Adaptation</strong><br>
                            When an individual is continuously exposed to an odour, perception of it decreases and stops within a few minutes. This loss of perception affects only that specific odour.</p>

                            <p><strong>Taste buds</strong> contain chemoreceptors (sensory receptors) that are found in the <strong>papillae</strong> of the tongue and are widely distributed in the epithelia of the tongue. There are three types of papillae (Fig. 8.25 A).</p>
                            <p><strong>Vallate papillae</strong> are the largest, and are visible at the base of the tongue arranged in an inverted V shape. There are about 10 of this type.</p>
                            <p><strong>Fungiform papillae</strong> are located mainly around the tip and edges of the tongue, and are more numerous than the vallate papillae.</p>

                            <p>Taste buds consist of small sensory nerve endings of the glossopharyngeal, facial and vagus nerves (cranial nerves VII, IX and X). Some of the cells have hair-like cilia on their free border, projecting towards tiny pores in the epithelium (Fig. 8.25 C). The sensory receptors are highly sensitive and stimulated by very small amounts of chemicals that enter the pores dissolved in saliva. Nerve impulses are generated and conducted along the glossopharyngeal, facial and vagus nerves before synapsing in the medulla and thalamus. Their final destination is the taste area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex, where taste is perceived (see Fig. 7.20).</p>

                            <h4>Physiology of taste</h4>
                            <p>Four fundamental sensations of taste have been described: sweet, sour, bitter and salt; however, others have also been suggested, including metallic and umami (a Japanese 'savoury' taste). However, perception varies widely and many 'tastes' cannot be easily classified. It is thought that all taste buds are stimulated by all 'tastes'. Taste is impaired when the mouth is dry because substances can be 'tasted' only when in solution.</p>
                            <p>The sense of taste is closely linked to the sense of smell. For example, when a person has a cold, it is common for food to taste bland and unappealing. In addition, taste triggers salivation and the secretion of gastric juice (Ch. 12). The sense of taste also has a protective function, e.g. when foul-tasting food is eaten, reflex gagging or vomiting may be induced.</p>

                            <p>Changes in hearing and vision that occur as part of normal ageing are almost universal and often accompanied by diminished senses of taste and smell. The number of olfactory receptors reduces around the age of 50, diminishing the sense of taste; older adults may complain of their food being bland while children can find the same food too spicy. In a similar way, older adults may not smell (perceive) weak odours. The effect of changes associated with ageing on hearing and vision are considered here.</p>

                            <h4>Presbycusis</h4>
                            <p>This form of hearing impairment accompanies the ageing process and is therefore common in older adults. Degenerative changes in the sensory cells of the spiral organ result in sensorineural hearing loss (p. 226). Perception of high-frequency sound is impaired first and later low-frequency sound may also be affected. Difficulty in discrimination develops, e.g. following a conversation, especially in the presence of background noise.</p>

                            <h4>Vision</h4>
                            <p>Presbyopia and cataracts are common consequences of normal ageing.</p>

                            <p><strong>Presbyopia</strong><br>
                            Age-related changes in the lens lead to loss of accommodation as the lens loses its elasticity and becomes firmer. This prevents focusing of light on the retina, giving blurred vision. Correction is achieved using glasses with convex lenses for near vision, e.g. reading (see Fig. 8.29).</p>

                            <p><strong>Cataracts</strong><br>
                            Cataracts arise when there is opacity of the lens (Fig. 8.26). Weak light rays cannot easily pass through a less transparent or cloudy lens and this is the reason why many older adults use brighter light for reading and may also experience difficulty with night vision. It is most commonly age-related, occurring as a result of exposure to predisposing factors that include UV light, X-rays and cigarette smoke. There are also other important causes of cataracts (p. 229).</p>

                            <h4>Conductive hearing impairment</h4>
                            <p>This occurs when an abnormality of the outer or middle ear impairs conduction of sound waves to the oval window; common examples are listed in Box 8.1.</p>

                            <p><strong>Otosclerosis</strong><br>
                            This is a common cause of progressive conductive hearing loss in young adults, which may affect one ear but is more commonly bilateral. It is usually hereditary, and more common in females than males; it often worsens during pregnancy. Abnormal bone develops around the footplate of the stapes, fusing it to the oval window and reducing the ability to transmit sound waves across the tympanic cavity.</p>

                            <p><strong>Serous otitis media</strong><br>
                            Also known as 'glue ear', or secretory otitis media, this is a collection of fluid (effusion) in the middle ear cavity. Causes include:</p>

                            <p>The air normally present in the middle ear is absorbed and negative pressure develops, causing retraction of the tympanic membrane. Thereafter, fluid is drawn into the low-pressure cavity from surrounding blood vessels, causing conductive hearing loss.</p>
                            <p>Adults experience hearing loss and blockage of the ear, which is usually painless. In preverbal children, however, this is a common cause of hearing impairment, which may manifest as delayed speech and/or achievement of developmental milestones. Secondary infection can complicate this condition in both adults and children.</p>

                            <h4>Sensorineural hearing impairment</h4>
                            <p>This is the more prevalent form of hearing impairment and is the result of a disorder of the nerves of the inner ear or the central nervous system, e.g. the cochlea, cochlear branch of the vestibular nerve or the auditory area of the cerebrum. Noise-induced hearing loss is one cause of sensorineural hearing impairment, which may arise as a consequence of:</p>

                            <p>Other causes are listed in Box 8.1. Risk factors for congenital sensorineural hearing impairment include family history, exposure to intrauterine viruses, e.g. maternal rubella, and acute hypoxia at birth.</p>

                            <h4>Meniere's disease</h4>
                            <p>In this condition there is accumulation of endolymph, causing distension and increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth with destruction of the sensory cells in the ampulla and cochlea. It is usually unilateral at first but both ears may be affected later. The cause is not known. Meniere's disease is associated with recurrent episodes of incapacitating dizziness (vertigo), nausea and vomiting, lasting for several hours. Periods of remission vary from days to months. During and between attacks there may be continuous ringing in the affected ear (tinnitus). Loss of hearing is experienced during episodes, which may gradually become permanent over a period of years as the spiral organ is destroyed.</p>

                            <h3>Ear infections</h3>
                            <p><strong>External otitis</strong><br>
                            Infection by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the usual cause of localised inflammation (boils) in the auditory canal. More generalised inflammation may be caused by prolonged exposure to bacteria or fungi or by an allergic reaction to, for example, soaps, hair sprays or hair dyes.</p>

                            <p><strong>Acute otitis media</strong><br>
                            This is inflammation of the middle ear cavity, usually caused by upward spread of microbes from an upper respiratory tract infection via the auditory tube. It is very common in children and is accompanied by severe earache. Occasionally, it spreads inwards from the outer ear through a perforation in the tympanic membrane.</p>
                            <p>Bacterial infection leads to the accumulation of pus and the outward bulging of the tympanic membrane. Sometimes the tympanic membrane ruptures and pus discharges from the middle ear (otorrhoea). The spread of infection may cause mastoiditis and labyrinthitis. As the petrous portion of the temporal bone is very thin, the infection may spread through the bone and cause meningitis (p. 197) and brain abscess.</p>

                            <p><strong>Chronic otitis media</strong><br>
                            In this condition there is permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane following acute otitis media (especially when recurrent, persistent or untreated) and mechanical or blast injuries. As healing occurs, stratified epithelium from the outer ear sometimes grows into the middle ear, forming a <strong>cholesteatoma</strong>. This is a collection of desquamated epithelial cells and purulent material. Continued development of cholesteatoma may lead to:</p>

                            <p><strong>Labyrinthitis</strong><br>
                            This complication of middle ear infection may be caused by development of a fistula from a cholesteatoma. It is accompanied by vertigo, nausea and vomiting, and nystagmus. In some cases the spiral organ is destroyed, causing sudden profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.</p>

                            <p><strong>Motion sickness</strong><br>
                            This occurs when the brain receives conflicting sensory information; the visual information received from the eye does not match the information from the semicircular canals of the inner ear about one's position in relation to the environment. It causes nausea and vomiting in some people, and is usually associated with travel, e.g. by car, boat or aeroplane.</p>

                            <h3>Inflammatory conditions</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Stye</h4>
                            <p>Also known as hordeolum, this is an acute and painful bacterial infection of sebaceous or tarsal glands of the eyelid margin. The most common cause is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. A 'crop' of styes may occur due to localised spread to adjacent glands. Infection of tarsal glands may block their ducts, leading to cyst formation (chalazion), which may damage the cornea.</p>

                            <h4>Blepharitis</h4>
                            <p>This is chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins, usually caused by bacterial infection or allergy, e.g. staphylococcal infection or seborrhoea (excessive sebaceous gland secretion). If ulceration occurs, healing by fibrosis may distort the eyelid margins, preventing complete closure of the eye. This may lead to drying of the eye, conjunctivitis and possibly corneal ulceration.</p>

                            <h4>Conjunctivitis</h4>
                            <p>Inflammation of the conjunctiva may be caused by irritants, such as smoke, dust, wind, cold or dry air, microbes or antigens, and may be acute or chronic (Fig. 8.27). Corneal ulceration is a rare complication.</p>

                            <p><strong>Infection</strong><br>
                            This is highly contagious and in adults is usually caused by strains of staphylococci, streptococci or <em>Haemophilus</em>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Neonatal conjunctivitis</strong><br>
                            Sexually transmitted disease in the mother, including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and genital herpes, can infect the newborn infant's eyes as the baby passes through the birth canal.</p>
                            <p><strong>Allergic conjunctivitis</strong><br>
                            This may be a complication of hay fever or be caused by a wide variety of airborne antigens, e.g. dust, pollen, fungus spores, animal dander, cosmetics, hair sprays or soaps. The condition sometimes becomes chronic.</p>

                            <h4>Trachoma</h4>
                            <p>This chronic inflammatory condition is caused by <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and is a common cause of sight loss in developing countries. Deposition of fibrous tissue in the conjunctiva and cornea leads to eyelid deformity and corneal scarring as the eyelashes rub against the surface of the eye. The microbes are spread by poor hygiene, e.g. communal use of contaminated washing water, cross-infection between mother and child, or contaminated towels and clothing.</p>

                            <h4>Corneal ulcer</h4>
                            <p>This is local necrosis of corneal tissue, usually associated with corneal infection (keratitis) following trauma (e.g. abrasion), or infection spread from the conjunctiva or eyelids. Causative organisms include staphylococci, streptococci and herpes viruses. Acute pain, injection (redness of the cornea), photophobia and lacrimation interfere with sight during the acute phase. In severe cases, extensive ulceration or perforation and healing by fibrosis can cause opacity of the cornea, requiring corneal transplantation.</p>

                            <h3>Glaucoma</h3>
                            <p>This is a group of conditions in which intraocular pressure rises due to impaired drainage of aqueous fluid through the scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm) in the angle between the iris and cornea in the anterior chamber (Fig. 8.28). Persistently raised intraocular pressure may damage the optic nerve by mechanical compression or by compression of its blood supply, causing ischaemia. Damage to the optic nerve impairs vision, the extent of which varies from some visual impairment to complete loss of sight.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the primary glaucomas described here, the condition is occasionally congenital or secondary to other causes, e.g. anterior uveitis or a tumour.</p>

                            <p><strong>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)</strong><br>
                            There is a gradual painless rise in intraocular pressure with progressive loss of vision. Peripheral vision is lost first but may not be noticed until only central (tunnel) vision remains. As the condition progresses, atrophy of the optic disc occurs, leading to irreversible loss of vision. It is commonly bilateral and occurs mostly in people over 40 years of age. The cause is not known but there is a familial tendency.</p>

                            <p><strong>Acute closed-angle glaucoma</strong><br>
                            This is most common in people over 40 years of age and usually affects one eye. During life the lens gradually increases in size, pushing the iris forwards. In dim light, when the pupil dilates, the lax iris bulges still further forwards and may come into contact with the cornea, blocking the scleral venous sinus (canal of Schlemm) and suddenly raising the intraocular pressure. Sudden severe pain, photophobia, headache, nausea and blurred vision accompany an acute attack. It may resolve spontaneously if the iris responds to bright light, constricting the pupil and releasing the pressure on the scleral venous sinus. After repeated attacks, spontaneous recovery may be incomplete and vision is progressively impaired.</p>

                            <p><strong>Chronic closed-angle glaucoma</strong><br>
                            The intraocular pressure rises gradually without symptoms. Later, peripheral vision deteriorates, followed by atrophy of the optic disc and loss of sight.</p>

                            <h3>Strabismus (squint, cross-eye)</h3>
                            <p>In normal binocular vision, the eyes are aligned so that each eye sees the same image, meaning that both eyes send very similar images to the brain. In strabismus, only one eye is directed at the observed object and the other diverges (is directed elsewhere). The result is that two quite different images are sent to the brain, one from each eye. It is caused by one-sided extrinsic muscle weakness or impairment of the cranial nerve (III, IV or VI) supply to the extrinsic muscles. In most cases the image from the squinting eye is suppressed by the brain; otherwise there is double vision (diplopia).</p>

                            <h3>Presbyopia</h3>
                            <p>See page 225.</p>

                            <h3>Cataract</h3>
                            <p>This is opacity of the lens, which impairs vision, especially in poor light and darkness when weak light rays can no longer pass through the cloudy lens to the retina (see Fig. 8.26). Although most commonly age-related (p. 225), this condition can also be congenital or secondary to other conditions, e.g. ocular trauma, uveitis or diabetes mellitus. The most common cause of visual impairment worldwide, cataracts can affect one or both eyes. The extent of visual impairment depends on the location and extent of the opacity. Congenital cataract may be idiopathic, or due to genetic abnormality or maternal infection in early pregnancy, e.g. rubella. Early treatment is required to prevent permanent loss of sight.</p>

                            <h3>Retinopathies</h3>
                            <h4>Vascular retinopathies</h4>
                            <p>Occlusion of the central retinal artery or vein causes sudden, painless unilateral loss of vision, as these vessels provide the sole arterial supply and venous drainage. Arterial occlusion is usually due to embolism from, for example, atheromatous plaques or endocarditis. Venous occlusion is usually associated with increased intraocular pressure in, for example, glaucoma, diabetes mellitus or hypertension. The retinal veins become distended and retinal haemorrhages occur.</p>

                            <h4>Diabetic retinopathy</h4>
                            <p>This occurs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (p. 255) and is the most common cause of blindness in adults aged between 30 and 65 years in developed countries. Changes in retinal blood vessels increase with the severity and duration of hyperglycaemia. Capillary microaneurysms develop and later there may be proliferation of blood vessels. Haemorrhages, fibrosis and secondary retinal detachment may follow and, over time, there may be severe retinal degeneration and loss of vision.</p>

                            <h4>Retinopathy of prematurity</h4>
                            <p>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) affects premature babies. Risk factors include birth before 32 weeks' gestation, birth weight of less than 1500 g, requirement for oxygen therapy and serious illness. There is abnormal development of retinal blood vessels and formation of fibrovascular tissue in the vitreous body, causing varying degrees of interference with light transmission. The prognosis depends on the severity and many cases resolve spontaneously. In severe cases there may also be haemorrhage in the vitreous body, retinal detachment and loss of vision.</p>

                            <h3>Retinal detachment</h3>
                            <p>This painless condition occurs when a tear or hole in the retina allows fluid to accumulate between the layers of retinal cells or between the retina and choroid. It is usually localised at first but as fluid collects the detachment spreads. There are visual disturbances, often spots before the eyes or flashes of light due to abnormal stimulation of sensory nerves, and progressive loss of vision, sometimes described as a 'shadow' or 'curtain'. In many cases the cause is unknown but it may be associated with trauma to the eye or head, tumours, haemorrhage, cataract surgery when intraocular pressure is reduced, or diabetic retinopathy.</p>

                            <h3>Retinitis pigmentosa</h3>
                            <p>This is a group of hereditary diseases in which there is degeneration of the retina that mainly affects the rods. Progressive impairment of peripheral vision, especially in dim light, usually becomes apparent in early childhood. Over time this leads to tunnel vision and, eventually, loss of sight.</p>

                            <h3>Tumours</h3>
                            <p><strong>Choroidal malignant melanoma</strong><br>
                            This is the most common ocular malignancy in adults, occurring between 40 and 70 years of age. Vision is not normally affected until the tumour causes retinal detachment or secondary glaucoma, usually when well advanced. The tumour spreads locally in the choroid, and blood-borne metastases usually develop in the liver.</p>

                            <p><strong>Retinoblastoma</strong><br>
                            This is the most common malignant tumour in children. A small number of cases are familial. It is normally evident before the age of 4 years and usually affects one side. The condition presents with a squint and enlargement of the eye. As the tumour grows, visual impairment develops and the pupil looks pale. It spreads locally to the vitreous body and may grow along the optic nerve, invading the brain.</p>

                            <p>In the emmetropic or normal eye, light from near and distant objects is focused on the retina (Fig. 8.29A).</p>

                            <p><strong>Myopia</strong><br>
                            This abnormality is also called nearsightedness or shortsightedness. Because the eyeball is too long, distant objects are focused in front of the retina (Fig. 8.29B). Close objects are focused normally but distant vision is blurred. Correction is achieved using a biconcave lens (Fig. 8.29D).</p>

                            <p><strong>Hyperopia</strong><br>
                            This abnormality is also called farsightedness or longsightedness. It causes a near image to be focused behind the retina because the eyeball is too short (Fig. 8.29C). Distant objects are focused normally but close vision is blurred. A convex lens corrects this (Fig. 8.29E).</p>

                            <p><strong>Astigmatism</strong><br>
                            This is abnormal curvature of part of the cornea or lens. It interferes with the light path though the eye and prevents focusing of light on the retina, causing blurred vision. Correction requires cylindrical lenses. It is very common and may coexist with other refractive disorders.</p>
