                            <p>The nervous system detects and responds to changes inside and outside the body. Together with the endocrine system, it coordinates and controls vital aspects of body function and maintains homeostasis. To this end the nervous system provides an immediate response while endocrine activity (Ch. 9) is, usually, slower and more prolonged.</p>
                            <p>The nervous system consists of the brain, the spinal cord and peripheral nerves (see Fig. 1.7). The structure and organisation of the tissues that form these components enable rapid communication between all parts of the body.</p>

                            <p>The PNS comprises paired cranial and spinal nerves. Some of these are sensory (afferent), transmitting impulses to the CNS; some are motor (efferent), transmitting impulses from the CNS; and others are mixed, with both sensory and motor fibres. It is useful to consider two functional parts within the PNS:</p>

                            <p>In summary, the CNS receives sensory information about its internal and external environments from afferent nerves. The CNS integrates and processes this input and responds, when appropriate, by sending nerve impulses through motor nerves to the effector organs: muscles and glands. For example, responses to changes in the internal environment regulate essential involuntary body functions such as respiration and blood pressure; responses to changes in the external environment maintain posture and other voluntary activities.</p>
                            <p>The first sections of this chapter explore the structure and functions of the components of the nervous system, including the impact of ageing, while the final ones consider the effects on body function when one or more of the components do not function normally.</p>

                            <p>There are two types of nervous tissue: neurones and neuroglia. Neurones (nerve cells) are the working units of the nervous system that generate and transmit nerve impulses. Neurones are supported by connective tissue, collectively known as neuroglia, which is formed from different types of glial cell. There are vast numbers of both cell types: 1 trillion ($10^{12}$) glial cells and 10 times fewer ($10^{11}$) neurones.</p>

                            <h3>Neurones</h3>
                            <p>Each neurone (Fig. 7.2) consists of a cell body and its processes: one axon and, usually, many dendrites. Neurones are commonly referred to as nerve cells. Bundles of axons bound together are called nerves. Neurones cannot divide, and for survival they need a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose. Unlike many other cells, neurones can normally synthesise chemical energy (adenosine triphosphate, or ATP) only from glucose.</p>
                            <p>Neurones generate and transmit electrical impulses called action potentials. The initial strength of the action potential is maintained throughout the length of the neurone. Some neurones initiate action potentials while others act as 'relay stations' where they are passed on and sometimes redirected.</p>
                            <p>Action potentials can be initiated in response to stimuli from:</p>

The action potential travelling down the nerve axon is an electrical signal, but because nerves do not come into direct contact with each other, the signal between a nerve cell and the next cell in the chain is nearly always chemical (p. 157).</p>

                            <h4>Cell bodies</h4>
                            <p>Nerve cells vary considerably in size and shape but they are all too small to be seen by the naked eye. Cell bodies form the grey matter of the nervous system and are found at the periphery of the brain and in the centre of the spinal cord. Groups of cell bodies are called <strong>nuclei</strong> in the CNS and <strong>ganglia</strong> in the PNS. An important exception is the basal ganglia (nuclei) situated within the cerebrum (p. 167).</p>

                            <h4>Axons and dendrites</h4>
                            <p>Axons and dendrites are extensions of cell bodies and form the white matter of the nervous system. Axons are found deep in the brain and in groups, called tracts, at the periphery of the spinal cord. They are referred to as nerves or nerve fibres outside the brain and spinal cord.</p>

                            <p><strong>Axons</strong><br>
                            Each nerve cell has only one axon, which begins at a tapered area of the cell body, the <strong>axon hillock</strong>. Axons carry impulses away from the cell body and are usually much longer than the dendrites, sometimes as long as 100 cm.</p>

                            <p><strong>Structure of an axon</strong><br>
                            The membrane of the axon is called the <strong>axolemma</strong> and it encloses the cytoplasmic extension of the cell body.</p>
                            <p><em>Myelinated neurones.</em> Large axons and those of peripheral nerves are surrounded by a <strong>myelin sheath</strong> (Figs 7.3A and C). This consists of a series of Schwann cells arranged along the length of the axon. Each one is wrapped around the axon so that it is covered by a number of concentric layers of Schwann cell plasma membrane. Between the layers of plasma membrane is a small amount of fatty substance called myelin. The outermost layer of the Schwann cell plasma membrane is the <strong>neurilemma</strong>. There are tiny areas of exposed axolemma between adjacent Schwann cells, called <strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong> (see Fig. 7.2), which assist the rapid transmission of action potentials in myelinated neurones. Fig. 7.4 shows a section through a nerve fibre at a node of Ranvier, where the area without myelin can be clearly seen.</p>
                            <p><em>Unmyelinated neurones.</em> Postganglionic fibres and some small fibres in the CNS are unmyelinated. In this type, several axons are embedded in one Schwann cell (see Fig. 7.3B). The adjacent Schwann cells are in close association and there is no exposed axolemma. Conduction of action potentials is significantly slower in unmyelinated fibres.</p>

                            <p><strong>Dendrites</strong><br>
                            These are the many short processes that receive and carry incoming action potentials towards cell bodies. They have the same structure as axons but are usually shorter and branching. In motor neurones dendrites form part of synapses (see Fig. 7.7), and in sensory neurones they form the sensory receptors that respond to specific stimuli.</p>

                            <h3>The action potential (nerve impulse)</h3>
                            <p>An impulse is initiated by stimulation of sensory nerve endings or by the passage of an impulse from another nerve. Transmission of the action potential is carried out by movement of ions across the nerve cell membrane. In the resting state the nerve cell membrane is polarised due to differences in the concentrations of ions across the plasma membrane. This means that there is a different electrical charge on each side of the membrane, which is called the resting membrane potential. At rest the charge on the outside is positive and inside it is negative. The principal ions involved are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">

                                </li>

                                    <span class="list-content">potassium ($K^+$), the main intracellular cation.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the resting state there is a continual tendency for these ions to diffuse down their concentration gradients, i.e. $K^+$ outwards and $Na^+$ into cells. When stimulated, the permeability of the nerve cell membrane to these ions changes. In response to the arrival of an action potential, sodium channels in the membrane open and $Na^+$ floods into the neurone from the extracellular fluid. This causes depolarisation and triggers an action potential. Depolarisation is very rapid, enabling the conduction of a nerve impulse along the entire length of a neurone in a few milliseconds. It passes from the point of stimulation in one direction only, i.e. away from the point of stimulation towards the area of resting potential. Action potential transmission along a nerve is one-way because the membrane behind the travelling action potential is temporarily unexcitable (refractory) until repolarisation occurs.</p>
                            <p>Almost immediately following the entry of $Na^+$, the $K^+$ channels open and $K^+$ floods out of the neurone. The movement of these ions returns the membrane potential to its resting state. This is called the refractory period, during which restimulation is not possible. The action of the sodium–potassium pump, which is in continual operation, expels $Na^+$ from the cell in exchange for $K^+$ (p. 158), returning levels of $Na^+$ and $K^+$ to the original resting state and repolarising the neurone.</p>

                            <p>In myelinated neurones, the insulating properties of the myelin sheath prevent the movement of ions. Therefore electrical changes across the membrane can occur only at the gaps in the myelin sheath, i.e. at the nodes of Ranvier (see Fig. 7.2). When an impulse occurs at one node, depolarisation passes along the myelin sheath to the next node, so that the flow of current appears to 'leap' from one node to the next. This is called 'saltatory conduction' (Fig. 7.5).</p>

                            <p>The speed of conduction depends on the diameter of the neurone: the larger the diameter, the faster the conduction.</p>
                            <p>In addition, myelinated fibres conduct action potentials faster than unmyelinated fibres because saltatory conduction is faster than continuous conduction, or simple propagation (Fig. 7.6). The fastest fibres can conduct action potentials to, for example, skeletal muscles at a rate of 130 metres per second, while the slowest impulses travel at 0.5 metres per second.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>(Figure 7.6 Note: Simple propagation diagram is omitted here but conceptually described in text as continuous conduction in unmyelinated fibres).</em></p>

                            <h3>The synapse and neurotransmitters</h3>
                            <p>There is always more than one neurone involved in the transmission of a nerve impulse from its origin to its destination, whether it is sensory or motor. There is no physical contact between two neurones. The point at which the action potential passes from the presynaptic neurone to the postsynaptic neurone is the <strong>synapse</strong> (Fig. 7.7). At its free end, the axon of the presynaptic neurone breaks up into minute branches that terminate in small swellings called synaptic knobs, or terminal boutons. These are in close proximity to the dendrites and the cell body of the postsynaptic neurone. The space between them is the synaptic cleft. Synaptic knobs contain spherical membrane-bound synaptic vesicles, which store a chemical, the <strong>neurotransmitter</strong> that is released into the synaptic cleft.</p>

                            <p>Neurotransmitters are synthesised by nerve cell bodies, actively transported along the axons and stored in the synaptic vesicles. They are released by exocytosis in response to the action potential and diffuse across the synaptic cleft, where they act on specific receptor sites on the postsynaptic membrane. Their action is short-lived because immediately after they have acted on the postsynaptic membrane, they are either inactivated by enzymes or taken back into the synaptic knob. Some important drugs mimic, neutralise (antagonise) or prolong neurotransmitter activity. Neurotransmitters usually have an excitatory effect on postsynaptic receptors but they are sometimes inhibitory.</p>
                            <p>There are more than 50 neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord, including noradrenaline (norepinephrine), adrenaline (epinephrine), dopamine, histamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine. Other substances, such as enkephalins, endorphins and substance P, have specialised roles in, for example, transmission of pain signals. Fig. 7.8 summarises the main neurotransmitters of the peripheral nervous system.</p>

                            <h4>Sensory or afferent nerves</h4>
                            <p>Sensory nerves carry information from the body to the spinal cord (see Fig. 7.1). The impulses may then pass to the brain or to connector neurones of reflex arcs in the spinal cord (p. 175).</p>
                            <p><strong>Sensory receptors</strong><br>
                            Specialised endings of sensory neurones respond to different stimuli (changes) inside and outside the body.</p>
                            <p><strong>Somatic, cutaneous or common senses</strong><br>
                            These originate from the skin. They are pain, touch, heat and cold. Sensory nerve endings in the skin are fine branching filaments without myelin sheaths (see Fig. 14.4). When they are stimulated, an action potential is generated and transmitted by the sensory nerves to the brain, where the sensation is perceived.</p>
                            <p><strong>Proprioceptor senses</strong><br>
                            These originate in muscles and joints (Ch. 16). They send information to the brain about the position of the body and its parts in space, enabling maintenance of posture and balance.</p>
                            <p><strong>Special senses</strong><br>
                            These are sight, hearing, balance, smell and taste, discussed in detail in Chapter 8.</p>
                            <p><strong>Autonomic afferent nerves</strong><br>
                            These originate in internal organs, glands and tissues – e.g. the baroreceptors involved in the control of blood pressure (Ch. 5), and the chemoreceptors involved in the control of respiration (Ch. 10) – and are associated with reflex regulation of involuntary activity and visceral pain.</p>

                            <h4>Motor or efferent nerves</h4>
                            <p>Motor nerves originate in the brain, spinal cord and autonomic ganglia. They transmit impulses to the effector organs: muscles and glands (see Fig. 7.1). There are two types:</p>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>autonomic nerves</strong> (sympathetic and parasympathetic) – involved in cardiac and smooth muscle contraction and glandular secretion, all involuntary functions.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There may be one or two nerves involved in motor nerve pathways in the PNS (see Fig. 7.8). Somatic motor nerve pathways, which supply skeletal (voluntary) muscle, have only one neurone, which leaves the spinal cord and travels directly to the skeletal muscle. This nerve is called the lower motor neurone (p. 174); its synapse with the muscle is specifically named the neuromuscular junction (p. 456) and the neurotransmitter is always acetylcholine. Autonomic nerve pathways (p. 186) involve two nerves, the preganglionic neurone that leaves the spinal cord and synapses with a second nerve, the postganglionic neurone, which in turn synapses with the effector tissue, e.g. cardiac muscle, smooth muscle or glands. The main neurotransmitters in these pathways are noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and acetylcholine.</p>

                            <h4>Mixed nerves</h4>
                            <p>In the spinal cord, sensory and motor nerves are arranged in separate groups, or tracts. Outside the spinal cord, when sensory and motor nerves are enclosed within the same sheath of connective tissue, they are called mixed nerves.</p>

                            <h3>Neuroglia</h3>
                            <p>The neurones of the CNS are supported by non-excitable glial cells (Fig. 7.10). Unlike nerve cells, which cannot divide, glial cells continue to replicate throughout life. There are four types: astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells and microglia.</p>

                            <p><strong>Astrocytes</strong><br>
                            These cells are the most abundant neuroglia (Fig. 7.11). They are star-shaped with fine branching processes and they lie in a mucopolysaccharide ground substance. At the free ends of some of the processes there are small swellings called foot processes. Astrocytes are found in large numbers adjacent to blood vessels, with their foot processes forming a sleeve round them. This means that the blood is separated from the neurones by the capillary wall and a layer of astrocyte foot processes, which together constitute the blood–brain barrier (Fig. 7.12).</p>
                            <p>The <strong>blood–brain barrier</strong> is a selective barrier that protects the brain from potentially toxic substances and chemical variations in the blood, e.g. after a meal. Oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose and other lipid-soluble substances, such as alcohol, quickly cross the barrier into the brain. Some large molecules, many drugs, inorganic ions and amino acids pass more slowly, or do not pass at all, from the blood to the brain.</p>

                            These cells are smaller than astrocytes. They are found in clusters round nerve cell bodies in grey matter and are located adjacent to, and along the length of, myelinated nerve fibres. Like Schwann cells in the PNS, oligodendrocytes form and maintain myelin in the CNS.</p>

                            <p><strong>Ependymal cells</strong><br>
                            These cells form the epithelial lining of the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. Those cells that form the choroid plexuses of the ventricles secrete cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some also have cilia that assist the flow of CSF.</p>

                            The smallest and least numerous glial cells, these cells are thought to be derived from monocytes that migrate from the blood into the nervous system before birth. They are dispersed throughout the brain. They migrate and become phagocytic, removing microbes and damaged tissue, in areas of inflammation and cell destruction.</p>

                            <h3>Response of nervous tissue to injury</h3>
                            <p>Unlike neuroglia, which have the capacity to reproduce, neurones reach maturity a few weeks after birth and cannot divide. Damage to neurones can lead either to rapid necrosis with sudden acute functional failure, or to slow atrophy with gradually increasing dysfunction. These changes may result from:</p>

                            <h4>Peripheral nerve regeneration</h4>
                            <p>The axons of peripheral nerves can sometimes regenerate if the cell body remains intact (Fig. 7.13). Distal to the damage, the axon and myelin sheath disintegrate and are removed by macrophages; the muscle supplied by the damaged fibre atrophies in the absence of nerve stimulation. The neurilemma then regenerates (about 1.5 mm per day) from the point of injury towards the effector along its original track, provided the two parts of the neurilemma are in close apposition (Fig. 7.13A). New Schwann cells develop within the neurilemma, providing a pathway within which the axon can regenerate.</p>
                            <p>Restoration of function depends on the re-establishment of satisfactory neural connections with the effector organ. When the neurilemma is out of position or destroyed, the sprouting axons and Schwann cells form a tumour-like cluster (traumatic neuroma), producing severe pain, for example, following some fractures and amputation of limbs (Fig. 7.13B).</p>

                            <h4>Neuroglial damage</h4>
                            <p><strong>Astrocytes:</strong> When these cells are damaged, their processes multiply, forming a mesh or 'scar', which inhibits the regrowth of damaged CNS neurones.</p>
                            <p><strong>Oligodendrocytes:</strong> These cells increase in number around degenerating neurones and are destroyed in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (p. 199).</p>
                            <p><strong>Microglia:</strong> Where there is inflammation and cell destruction the microglia are activated and migrate to the site of damage, where they become phagocytic. This is evident in, for example, multiple sclerosis (p. 199), Alzheimer's disease (p. 196) and stroke (p. 194).</p>

                            <p>Except for the cranial nerves, the spinal cord is the nervous tissue link between the brain and the rest of the body (Fig. 7.27). Nerves conveying impulses from the brain to the various organs and tissues descend through the spinal cord. At the appropriate level they leave the cord between adjacent vertebrae and pass to the structure they supply. Similarly, sensory nerves from organs and tissues enter and pass upwards in the spinal cord to the brain.</p>
                            <p>Some activities of the spinal cord are independent of the brain and are controlled at the level of the spinal cord by spinal reflexes. To facilitate these, there are extensive neurone connections between sensory and motor neurones at the same or different levels in the cord.</p>

                            <p>A cross-section of the spinal cord shows that it is almost completely divided into two equal parts: anteriorly by a short, shallow <strong>median fissure</strong> and posteriorly by a deep narrow septum, the <strong>posterior median septum</strong>. It is composed of grey matter in the centre surrounded by white matter supported by neuroglia. Two bundles of nerve fibres merge into each side of the spinal cord. Known as nerve roots, those of the <strong>dorsal</strong> (or posterior) <strong>nerve roots</strong> carry sensory nerve impulses into the spinal cord while the fibres of the <strong>ventral</strong> (or anterior) <strong>nerve root</strong> carry motor impulses away from the spinal cord. Fig. 7.28 shows the parts of the spinal cord and the nerve roots.</p>

                            These are composed of the cell bodies of sensory nerves, which carry information from the body up to the brain. The nerve fibres of these cells contribute to the white matter of the cord and transmit the sensory impulses upwards to the brain. The posterior (dorsal) root ganglia are formed by the cell bodies of the sensory nerves.</p>

                            These are composed of the cell bodies of the lower motor neurones that are stimulated by the upper motor neurones or the interneurones linking the anterior and posterior columns to form reflex arcs.</p>

                            <p>The white matter of the spinal cord is arranged in three columns or tracts: anterior, posterior and lateral. These tracts are formed by sensory nerve fibres ascending to the brain, motor nerve fibres descending from the brain and fibres of interneurones.<br>
                            Tracts are often named according to their points of origin and destination, e.g. spinothalamic, corticospinal.</p>

                            Neurones that transmit impulses towards the brain are called sensory (afferent, ascending). There are two main sources of sensation transmitted to the brain via the spinal cord.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>The skin.</em> Sensory receptors (nerve endings) in the skin are stimulated by pain, heat, cold and touch, including pressure (Ch. 14). The nerve impulses generated are conducted by three neurones to the sensory area in the opposite hemisphere of the cerebrum where the sensation and its location are perceived (Fig. 7.29). Crossing to the other side, or decussation, occurs either at the level of entry into the cord or in the medulla.</p>

                            Neurones that transmit nerve impulses away from the brain are called motor (efferent or descending) neurones. Stimulation of motor neurones results in:</p>

                            <p><em>Voluntary muscle movement.</em> Muscle contraction that moves the joints is, in the main, under conscious (voluntary) control, which means that the stimulus to contract originates at the level of consciousness in the cerebrum. However, skeletal muscle activity is regulated by output from the midbrain, brain stem and cerebellum. This involuntary activity is associated with coordination of muscle activity, e.g. in very fine movement and in the maintenance of posture and balance.</p>
                            <p>Efferent nerve impulses are transmitted from the brain to other parts of the body via bundles of nerve fibres (tracts) in the spinal cord. The motor pathways from the brain to the muscles are made up of two neurones (see Fig. 7.21). These pathways, or tracts, are either pyramidal (corticospinal) or extrapyramidal (p. 165).</p>
                            <p><strong>Upper motor neurones.</strong> These have their cell bodies in the primary motor area of the cerebrum. The axons pass through the internal capsule, pons and medulla. In the spinal cord they form the lateral corticospinal tracts of white matter, and the fibres synapse with the cell bodies of the lower motor neurones in the anterior columns of grey matter. The axons of the upper motor neurones make up the pyramidal tracts and decussate in the medulla oblongata, forming the pyramids.<br>
                            <strong>Lower motor neurones.</strong> These have their cell bodies in the anterior horn of grey matter in the spinal cord. The axons emerge from the spinal cord by the anterior root, join with the incoming sensory fibres and form the mixed spinal nerve that passes through the intervertebral foramen.</p>
                            <p>The lower motor neurone is the final common pathway for the transmission of nerve impulses to skeletal muscles. The cell body of this neurone is influenced by a number of upper motor neurones originating from various sites in the brain and by some neurones that begin and end in the spinal cord. Some of these neurones stimulate the lower motor neurone while others inhibit it. The outcome of these influences is smooth, coordinated muscle movement, some of which is voluntary and some involuntary.</p>

                            <p><em>Involuntary muscle movement.</em> <strong>Upper motor neurones.</strong> These have their cell bodies in the brain at a level below the cerebrum, i.e. in the midbrain, brain stem, cerebellum or spinal cord. They influence muscle activity that maintains posture and balance, coordinates skeletal muscle movement and controls muscle tone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Spinal reflexes.</strong> These consist of three elements:</p>

                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>

                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">lower motor neurones.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In the simplest reflex arc there is only one of each of these neurones (Fig. 7.30). A <strong>reflex action</strong> is an involuntary and immediate motor response to a sensory stimulus that is invariably protective. For example, the pain impulses initiated by touching a very hot surface with the finger are transmitted to the spinal cord by sensory fibres in mixed nerves. These stimulate many interneurones and lower motor neurones in the spinal cord, which results in the contraction of many skeletal muscles of the hand, arm and shoulder, and the removal of the finger. Reflex action happens very quickly; in fact, the motor response may occur simultaneously with the perception of the pain in the cerebrum. Protective reflexes can occasionally be inhibited. For example, if a precious plate is very hot when lifted, every effort will be made to overcome the pain to prevent dropping it!</p>

                            <p><strong>Stretch reflexes.</strong> Only two neurones are involved. The cell body of the lower motor neurone is stimulated directly by the sensory neurone, with no interneurone in between (Fig. 7.30). The knee jerk is one example but this type of reflex can be demonstrated at any point where a stretched tendon crosses a joint. If the tendon is tapped just below the knee when it is bent, the sensory nerve endings in the tendon and in the thigh muscles are stretched. This initiates a nerve impulse that passes into the spinal cord to the cell body of the lower motor neurone in the anterior column of grey matter on the same side. As a result the thigh muscles suddenly contract and the foot kicks forwards. This is used as a test of the integrity of the reflex arc. This type of reflex also has a protective function: it prevents excessive joint movement that may damage tendons, ligaments and muscles.</p>
