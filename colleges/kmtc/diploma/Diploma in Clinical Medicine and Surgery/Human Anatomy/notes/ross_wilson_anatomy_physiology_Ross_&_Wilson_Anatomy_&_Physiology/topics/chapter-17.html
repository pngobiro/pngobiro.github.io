                            <p>All living organisms, including human beings, need to reproduce, so that at the end of their lifespan they have produced at least one, often several, other individuals to replace themselves. This ensures the continuation of their species. Offspring inherit from their parents a copy of all the information needed to develop into a functioning organism; this information is carried as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), mainly within the cell nucleus. DNA is organised into functional units called genes, which themselves are part of much bigger structures, the chromosomes.</p>
                            <p>Collectively, all the genetic material in a cell is called its <strong>genome</strong>. Genetics is the study of genes, and advancing knowledge in this area has a profound effect on many aspects of daily life, e.g. for genetic counselling in families carrying inherited diseases and the production of human insulin from genetically engineered microorganisms.</p>
                            <p>Human beings reproduce sexually. This means that a new human being is conceived using a combination of genetic material from two individuals (the parents). Although this process is complicated and prone to error, it allows a species to evolve and develop because every new human being is genetically different from all other members of the human race.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>Human Genome Project</strong> was an international collaboration completed in 2003. It has provided mankind with the blueprint for life by mapping every chromosome and identifying every gene, giving a complete list of the instructions written in DNA for the production and development of a human being. This information is enormously significant in the branch of medical science dealing with the identification, prevention, treatment or even cure of hereditable disease.</p>
                            <p>Towards the end of the chapter the effects of ageing on chromosomes, cell division and heredity are considered, and this is followed by a section on some common genetic abnormalities.</p>

                            <h3>Chromosomes</h3>
                            <p>Nearly every body cell contains, within its nucleus, an identical copy of the entire complement of the individual's genetic material. Two important exceptions are red blood cells (which have no nucleus) and the gametes or sex cells. In a resting cell the chromatin (genetic material, see Fig. 3.12) is diffuse and hard to see under the microscope, but when the cell prepares to divide, it is collected into highly visible, compact, sausage-shaped structures called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. Each chromosome is one of a pair, one inherited from the mother and one from the father, so the human cell has 46 chromosomes that can be arranged as 23 pairs. A cell with 23 pairs of chromosomes is termed <strong>diploid</strong>. Gametes (spermatozoa and ova) with only half of the normal complement, i.e. 23 chromosomes instead of 46, are described as <strong>haploid</strong>. Chromosomes belonging to the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. The complete set of chromosomes from a cell is its <strong>karyotype</strong> (Fig. 17.1).</p>
                            
                            <p>Each pair of chromosomes is numbered, the largest pair being number 1. The first 22 pairs are collectively known as <strong>autosomes</strong>, and the chromosomes of each pair contain the same amount of genetic material. The chromosomes of pair 23 are called the <strong>sex chromosomes</strong> (Fig. 17.2) because they determine the individual's gender. Unlike autosomes, these two chromosomes are not necessarily the same size; the Y chromosome is much shorter than the X and is carried only by males. A child inheriting two X chromosomes (XX), one from each parent, is female, and a child inheriting an X from his mother and a Y from his father (XY) is male.</p>

                            <p>Chromosomes are made of a tightly coiled strand of DNA, along with supporting proteins called <strong>histones</strong>. Uncoiled, there is a total length of about 2 metres of DNA in each body cell. It is an incredible feat, packaging such a large quantity of material into such a tiny space. Each end of the chromosome is capped with a length of DNA called a <strong>telomere</strong>, which seals the chromosome and is structurally essential. During replication the telomere is shortened, which would damage the chromosome, and so it is repaired with an enzyme called telomerase. Reduced telomerase activity with age is related to cell senescence.</p>

                            <h3>Genes</h3>
                            <p>Some 99% of the cell's DNA does not actually code for protein. This filler DNA contains signals to stop and start protein synthesis. DNA sequences that code for proteins are found along the length of the DNA, interspersed with filler DNA, and are called <strong>genes</strong>. Each gene allows the cell to make (almost always) one specific protein, the so-called gene product. The human genome contains about 20,500 genes.</p>
                            <p>Genes normally exist in pairs because the gene on one chromosome is matched at the equivalent site (locus) on the other chromosome of the pair.</p>

                            <h3>DNA</h3>
                            <p>DNA is a double-stranded molecule, made up of two chains of nucleotides. Nucleotides consist of three subunits: a sugar, a phosphate group and a base.</p>
                            <p>The DNA molecule is sometimes likened to a twisted ladder, with the uprights formed by alternating chains of sugar and phosphate units (Fig. 17.3). In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose. The bases are linked to the sugars, and each base binds to another base on the other sugar/phosphate chain, forming the rungs of the ladder. The two chains are twisted around one another, giving a <strong>double helix</strong> (twisted ladder) arrangement. The double helix itself is further twisted and wrapped in a highly organised way around histones, the structural proteins that are important in maintaining the heavily coiled three-dimensional shape of the DNA. The DNA–histone material is called <strong>chromatin</strong>, which is supercoiled and packaged into the chromosomes shortly before the cell divides (Fig. 17.4).</p>

                            <h4>The genetic code</h4>
                            <p>DNA carries a huge amount of information that determines all the biological activities of an organism, and which is transmitted from one generation to the next. The key to how this information is kept is found in the bases within DNA. There are four bases:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">adenine (A)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">guanine (G)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">thymine (T)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">cytosine (C).</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>They are arranged in a precise order along the DNA molecule, making a base code that can be read when protein synthesis is required. Each base along one strand of DNA pairs with a base on the other strand in a precise and predictable way. This is known as <strong>complementary base pairing</strong>. Adenine always pairs with thymine (and vice versa), and cytosine and guanine always go together. The bases on opposite strands run down the middle of the helix and bind to one another with hydrogen bonds.</p>

                            <h4>Mitochondrial DNA</h4>
                            <p>Each body cell has, on average, 5000 mitochondria (p. 44) that hold a quantity of DNA (mitochondrial DNA), which codes, for example, for enzymes important in energy production. This DNA is passed from one generation to another via the ovum (p. 503), so the offspring's complement of mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother. Certain rare inherited disorders that arise from faulty mitochondrial DNA are therefore passed through generations via the maternal line.</p>

                            <h3>Mutation</h3>
                            <p>Mutation means a hereditable alteration in the normal genetic make-up of a cell. Most mutations occur spontaneously because of the countless millions of DNA replications and cell divisions that occur normally throughout life. Others may be caused by external factors, such as X-rays, ultraviolet rays or exposure to certain chemicals. Any factor capable of mutating DNA is called a <strong>mutagen</strong>. Most mutations are immediately repaired by an army of enzymes present in the cell nucleus, and therefore cause no permanent problems.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes the mutation is lethal because it disrupts some essential cellular function, causing cell death, and the mutation is destroyed along with the cell. Often, the mutated cell is detected by immune cells and destroyed because it is abnormal. Other mutations do not kill the cell but alter its function in some way that may cause disease, e.g. in cancer. A persistent mutation in the genome that has not led to cell death can be passed from parent to child and may cause inherited disease, e.g. phenylketonuria or cystic fibrosis.</p>

                            <p>DNA holds the cell's essential biological information, written within the base code in the centre of the double helix. The products of this information are almost always proteins. Proteins are essential to all aspects of body function, forming the major structural elements of the body, as well as the enzymes essential for all biochemical processes within it. The building blocks of human proteins are about 20 different amino acids. As the cell's DNA is too big to leave the nucleus, an intermediary molecule is needed to carry the genetic instructions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. This is called messenger ribonucleic acid. Protein synthesis is summarised in Fig. 17.5.</p>

                            <h3>Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)</h3>
                            <p>Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is a single-stranded chain of nucleotides synthesised in the nucleus from the appropriate gene, whenever the cell needs to make the protein for which that gene codes. RNA is different in structure to DNA in three main ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">It is single-stranded instead of double-stranded.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">It contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">It uses the base uracil instead of thymine.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Using the DNA as a template, a piece of mRNA is made from the gene to be used. This process is called <strong>transcription</strong>. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus through the nuclear pores and carries its information to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm.</p>

                            <h3>Transcription</h3>
                            <p>The code is buried within the DNA molecule and so the first step is to open up the helix to expose the bases. Only the gene to be transcribed is opened; the remainder of the chromosome remains coiled. Opening up the helix exposes both base strands, but the enzyme that makes the mRNA uses only one of them, so the mRNA molecule is single-stranded not double-stranded. As the enzyme moves along the opened DNA strand, reading its code, it adds the complementary base to the mRNA. Therefore, if the DNA base is cytosine, guanine is added to the mRNA molecule (and vice versa); if it is thymine, adenine is added; if it is adenine, uracil is added (remember there is no thymine in RNA, but uracil instead) (Fig. 17.6A). When the enzyme reaches a 'stop' signal, it terminates synthesis of the mRNA molecule, and the mRNA is released. The DNA is zipped up again by other enzymes and the mRNA then leaves the nucleus.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <h3>Translation</h3>
                            <p>Translation is synthesis of the final protein using the information carried on mRNA. It takes place on free ribosomes (p. 45) in the cytoplasm and those attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum. First, the mRNA attaches to the ribosome. The ribosome then 'reads' the base sequence of the mRNA (Fig. 17.6B).</p>
                            <p>Proteins are built from up to 20 different amino acids and so it is not possible to use the four bases individually in a simple one-to-one code. To give enough options, the base code in RNA is read in triplets, giving a possible 64 base combinations, which allows a coded instruction for each amino acid as well as other codes, e.g. stop and start instructions. Each of these specific triplet sequences is called a <strong>codon</strong>; e.g. the base sequence ACA (adenine, cytosine, adenine) codes for the amino acid cysteine.</p>
                            <p>The first codon is a start codon, which initiates protein synthesis. The ribosome slides along the mRNA, reading the codons and adding the appropriate amino acids to the growing protein molecule as it goes. The ribosome continues assembling the new protein molecule until it arrives at a stop codon, at which point it terminates synthesis and releases the new protein. Some new proteins are used within the cell itself and others are exported, e.g. insulin synthesised by pancreatic $\beta$-islet cells is released into the bloodstream.</p>

                            <h4>Gene expression</h4>
                            <p>Although all nucleated cells (except gametes) have an identical set of genes, each cell type uses only those genes related directly to its own particular function. For example, the only cell type containing haemoglobin is the red blood cell, although all body cells carry the haemoglobin gene. This selective gene expression is controlled by various regulatory substances, and the genes not needed by the cell are kept switched off.</p>

                            <p>Most body cells are capable of division, even in adulthood. Cell division usually leads to production of two identical diploid daughter cells by the process of mitosis and is important in body growth and repair. Production of gametes is different in that the daughter cells have only half the normal chromosome number: 23 instead of 46, i.e. they are haploid. Gametes are produced by a form of cell division called meiosis. DNA replication takes place before mitosis and meiosis.</p>

                            <h3>DNA replication</h3>
                            <p>DNA is the only biological molecule capable of self-replication. Mistakes in copying may lead to production of non-functioning or poorly functional cells, or cells that do not respond to normal cell controls (this could lead to the development of a tumour). Accurate copying of DNA is therefore essential.</p>
                            <p>The initial step in DNA replication is the unfolding of the double helix and the unzipping of the two strands to expose the bases, as happens in transcription. Both strands of the parent DNA molecule are copied. The enzyme responsible for DNA replication moves along the base sequence on each strand, reading the genetic code and adding the complementary base to the newly forming chain. This means that each strand of opened bases becomes a double strand and the end result is two identical DNA molecules (Fig. 17.7). As each new double strand is formed, other enzymes cause it to twist and coil back into its normal highly folded form.</p>

                            <h3>Mitosis</h3>
                            <p>This is described on page 47.</p>

                            <h3>Meiosis</h3>
                            <p>Meiosis is the final step in gamete production. On fertilisation, when the male gamete (sperm cell) and the female gamete (ovum) unite, the resulting zygote is diploid because each gamete was haploid.</p>
                            <p>Unlike mitosis, meiosis involves two distinct cell divisions rather than one (Fig. 17.8). Additionally, meiosis produces four daughter cells, not two, all different from the parent cells and from each other. This is the basis of genetic diversity and the uniqueness of each human individual.</p>

                            <h4>First meiotic division</h4>
                            <p>This stage (Fig. 17.8) produces two genetically different daughter cells.<br>
                            DNA replication occurred beforehand, so each pair of chromosomes is now four chromatids, and they gather together into a tight bundle. The chromosomes are very tightly associated and so it is possible for them to exchange genes. This process is called <strong>crossing over</strong>, and results in the four chromatids acquiring different combinations of genes. Following crossing over, the pairs of chromosomes then separate in preparation for the first meiotic division, and transfer of maternal and paternal chromosomes to either daughter cell is random. This means that the two daughter cells have an unpredictable assortment of maternal and paternal DNA, giving rise to a huge number of possible combinations of chromosomes in them. This explains why a child inherits a combination of the mother's and father's characteristics and why children from the same parents can be very different from one another.</p>
                            <p>Each pair of chromosomes separates and one travels to each end of the cell, guided by a spindle, as in mitosis, producing two genetically unique diploid daughter cells.</p>

                            <p>For a gamete to be produced, the amount of genetic material present in the two daughter cells following the first meiotic division must be halved. This is accomplished by a second division (Fig. 17.8). The centromeres separate and the two sister chromatids travel to opposite ends of the cell, which then divides. Each of the four haploid daughter cells now has only one chromosome from each original pair. Fusion with another gamete creates a zygote (fertilised ovum), a diploid cell that can go on to grow and develop into a human being by mitosis.</p>

                            <p>Mixing up of parental genes during meiosis leads to the huge genetic variety of the human race. It is important to understand how genes interact to produce inherited characteristics.</p>

                            <h3>Autosomal inheritance</h3>
                            <p>Each of a pair of homologous chromosomes contains genes for the same traits. For example, the ability to roll one's tongue is coded for on a single gene. Because one chromosome of each pair is inherited from the father and one from the mother, an individual has two genes controlling the ability to roll the tongue. Such paired genes are called <strong>alleles</strong>. Corresponding alleles contain genes concerned with the same trait, but they need not be identical. An individual may have:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">two identical forms of the gene (<strong>homozygous</strong>)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-content">two different forms of the gene (<strong>heterozygous</strong>).</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>One copy of the tongue-rolling gene may code for the ability to roll the tongue, but the corresponding gene on the other chromosome of the pair may be a different form and code for inability to tongue roll. This simple example involves only two forms of the same gene but other characteristics are more complex. Eye colour is a diverse trait with a wide range of pigment colours and patterns possible, and is controlled by more than one gene.</p>
                            <p>A child that inherits a tongue-rolling gene from one parent and the non-rolling gene from the other will still be able to roll their tongue. This is because the tongue-rolling form of the gene is <strong>dominant</strong>, and takes priority over the non-rolling gene, which is <strong>recessive</strong>. Dominant genes are always expressed (active) in preference over recessive genes, and only one copy of a dominant gene is required for that characteristic to be expressed. A recessive gene can be expressed only if it is present on both chromosomes, i.e. individuals unable to tongue-roll have two copies of the recessive, non-rolling gene.</p>

                            <p><strong>Punnett squares</strong><br>
                            The probability of inheriting either form of a gene depends on parental make-up. Simple autosomal inheritance can be illustrated using a Punnett square. Fig. 17.9 shows all the possible combinations of the tongue-rolling gene in children whose parents are heterozygous for the trait. Using this example, there is a 3 in 4 (75%) chance that the child of these parents will be a tongue-roller (TT or Tt), and only a 1 in 4 chance that they would inherit two recessive genes (tt), making them a non-roller.</p>
                            <p>Prediction of the probability that a baby will be born with an inherited disease, e.g. cystic fibrosis (p. 288), forms the basis of genetic counselling.</p>

                            <h4>Co-dominance</h4>
                            <p>For some traits, there can be more than two alleles that code for it, and more than one allele can be dominant. An example of this is the inheritance of A and B type antigens on the surface of red blood cells, determined clinically as the ABO system of blood grouping (p. 66). There are three possible alleles here: one allele codes for production of A type antigens (A), one allele codes for production of B type antigens (B) and a third allele codes for no antigen at all (o). An individual may have any combination of two of these three alleles: AA, AB, BB, Ao, Bo or oo. Both A and B are dominant, and both express themselves wherever they are present. This is called <strong>co-dominance</strong>. O is recessive, and so only expresses itself in a homozygous recessive genotype. This means that individuals with an oo genotype have neither A nor B antigens on their red cell surface and are blood group O. An individual with genotype AB has both A and B and is blood group AB. An individual with genotype Ao or AA has only A type antigens and is blood group A; someone with genotype Bo or BB has only B type antigens and is blood group B.</p>
                            <p>Fig. 17.10 shows a Punnett square illustrating the possible blood types of children produced by a mother with genotype Ao (phenotype blood group A) and a father with genotype AB (phenotype blood group AB).</p>

                            <h3>Sex-linked inheritance</h3>
                            <p>Fig. 17.2 shows clearly that the Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome. It is not surprising, then, to find that the Y chromosome carries only 200 genes compared with the X chromosome's 2000, most of which are involved in the development of male-specific characteristics, and the vast majority of genes on the X chromosome are not matched on the Y. This means that a male has only one copy of most of the genes on his sex chromosomes. Traits coded for on the section of the X chromosome that has no corresponding material on the Y are said to be <strong>sex-linked</strong>. The gene that codes for normal colour vision is one example, and is therefore carried on X chromosomes only. It is the dominant form of the gene. There is a rare, recessive form of this gene, which is faulty and codes for red–green colour blindness. If a female inherits a faulty copy of the gene, she is statistically likely to have a normal gene on her other X chromosome, giving normal colour vision. A female carrying the colour blindness gene, even though she is not colour-blind, may pass the faulty gene on to her children and is said to be a <strong>carrier</strong>. If the gene is abnormal in a male, he will be colour-blind because, having only one X chromosome, he has only one copy of the gene. Inheritance of colour blindness is shown in Fig. 17.11.</p>

                            <h3>Ageing and DNA</h3>
                            <p>Cumulative exposure over a lifetime to potential mutagens, as well as a diminishing ability to repair DNA, means the cell's genome gradually accumulates mutations, which can lead to diminished function and increased risk of disease, e.g. cancer. Mitochondrial DNA is more prone to mutations than nuclear DNA and as it ages and develops 'wear and tear' damage, it causes progressive impairment of cell function.</p>

                            <h3>Cell senescence (ageing)</h3>
                            <p>The number of times a cell can divide is somewhere between 50 and 60 divisions. One important factor in this is thought to relate to the effects of ageing on telomerase function. Telomerase is the enzyme that repairs the telomeres (chromosome tips) following DNA replication. It declines in function with age. This restricts the number of cell replications possible, since without effective telomerase activity the chromosomes become progressively shorter with each division; they eventually become too short to be replicated and the cell can no longer divide.</p>

                            <h3>Cancer</h3>
                            <p>Cancer (malignant growth of new tissue, p. 57) is caused by mutation (p. 477) of cellular DNA, causing its growth pattern to become disorganised and uncontrolled.</p>
                            <p>Cells acquire increasing numbers of mutations as they get older, which explains why the incidence of cancer rises sharply with increasing age. The more mutations a cell suffers, the more likely it is to acquire the characteristics of a tumour cell, including failure to respond to normal growth controls and immortality. Some mutations are inherited, increasing the risk of some cancers in families, but most cancer is due to acquired mutations caused by ageing or other risk factors, such as irradiation or exposure to mutagenic chemicals.</p>

                            <h3>Inherited disease</h3>

                            <h4>Gene mutations</h4>
                            <p>Many diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (p. 288) and haemophilia (p. 79), are passed directly from parent to child via a faulty gene. Many of these genes have been located by mapping of the human genome, e.g. the gene for cystic fibrosis is carried on chromosome 7. Other diseases, e.g. asthma, some cancers and cardiovascular disease, have a genetic component (run in the family). In these cases, a single faulty gene has not been identified, and inheritance is not as predictable as when a single gene is responsible. The likelihood of an individual developing the disease depends not only on their genetic make-up but also on the influence of other factors, such as lifestyle and environment.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Phenylketonuria</strong><br>
                            In this disorder, an example of an inborn error of metabolism, the gene responsible for producing the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase is faulty and the enzyme is absent. This enzyme normally converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the liver, but in its absence phenylalanine accumulates in the liver and overflows into the blood (Fig. 17.12). In high quantities, phenylalanine is toxic to the central nervous system and, if the condition is untreated, this results in brain damage and mental retardation within a few months. There are low levels of tyrosine, which is needed to make melanin, and so depigmentation occurs; affected children are fair-skinned and blond. The incidence of this disease is now low in developed countries because screening of newborn babies detects the condition and treatment is provided.</p>

                            <p><strong>Mitochondrial abnormalities</strong><br>
                            Mitochondrial DNA contains only 37 genes but defects in these genes can cause inherited disorders with a very wide range of potentially fatal signs and symptoms, most commonly involving the central nervous system and skeletal or cardiac muscle. Spontaneous mutations in this DNA can also occur in maturity, leading to onset of disease in adults. There is evidence that mitochondrial mutations may be associated with some forms of important diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                            <h4>Chromosomal abnormalities</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes a fault during meiosis produces a gamete carrying abnormal chromosomes: too many, too few, abnormally shaped or with segments missing. Often, these aberrations are lethal and a pregnancy involving such a gamete miscarries in the early stages. Non-lethal conditions include Down's syndrome and cri-du-chat syndrome.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Down's syndrome</strong><br>
                            In this disorder, there are three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), meaning that an extra chromosome is present, caused by failure of chromosomes to separate normally during meiosis. Individuals with Down's syndrome are usually short of stature, with pronounced eyelid folds and flat, round faces. The tongue may be too large for the mouth and habitually protrudes. Learning disability is present, ranging from mild to severe. Life expectancy is shorter than normal, with a higher than average incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and a high incidence of early dementia. Down's syndrome is associated with increasing maternal age, especially over 35 years.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Cri-du-chat syndrome</strong><br>
                            Cri-du-chat (cat's cry) refers to the characteristic meowing cry of an affected child. This syndrome is caused when part of chromosome 5 is missing, and is associated with learning disabilities and anatomical abnormalities, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular problems.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Abnormalities of the sex chromosomes</strong><br>
                            If the sex chromosomes fail to separate normally during meiosis, the daughter cells will have an incorrect number: either too many or too few. A child born with such an abnormality will not follow normal sexual development without treatment, and may have additional problems such as learning disability.</p>

They have female external genitalia and ovaries, but are infertile because the ovaries fail to develop during fetal life, and secondary sexual characteristics do not develop at puberty unless oestrogen treatment is given. Other features include short stature and coarctation of the aorta (in 15%, p. 135). Intelligence is usually normal.</span>

This condition is more common than Turner's syndrome and is associated with a greater than average height and mild learning disability. The genitalia are male but the testes are underdeveloped and affected individuals are infertile. At puberty, development of feminine characteristics such as enlarged breasts (gynaecomastia) and rounded hips is common, and there is no development of male secondary sexual characteristics unless testosterone treatment is given.</span>
