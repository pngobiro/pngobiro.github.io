                            <p>From the months spent in the womb to the end of life, every individual is under constant attack from an enormous range of potentially harmful invaders. These threats include such diverse entities as bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, parasites and foreign (non-self) cells, e.g. in tissue transplant. The body has therefore developed a wide selection of protective measures, which can be divided into two categories.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Non-specific (innate) defence mechanisms</h4>
                            <p>These protect against any of an enormous range of possible dangers and are present at birth: hence the term 'innate'.</p>

                            <h4>Specific (adaptive) defence mechanisms</h4>
                            <p>These are grouped together under the term 'immunity'. Resistance is directed against only one specific invader. This type of immunity is sometimes called adaptive immunity because it adapts, refines and strengthens its response to multiple exposures to the same antigen. This ability to 'learn' is responsible for the development of immunological memory, giving long-term immunity to specific infections. An <strong>antigen</strong> is anything that stimulates an immune response.</p>

They offer a rapid response system, permanently mobilised and providing constant protection. There are five main non-specific defence mechanisms:</p>

                            <h3>Epithelial barriers</h3>
                            <p>Healthy, intact skin and mucous membranes provide an efficient physical barrier protecting the body's exposed surfaces. The skin carries a rich population of bacteria, called commensals, that do not normally cause infections. Few pathogens can establish themselves on healthy skin. Sebum and sweat secreted on to the skin surface contain antibacterial and antifungal substances.</p>
                            <p>Epithelial membranes lining body cavities and passageways exposed to the external environment (e.g. the respiratory, genitourinary and digestive tracts) are more delicate but are also well defended. Epithelia produce antibacterial secretions, often acidic, containing antibodies and enzymes, as well as sticky mucus for trapping passing microbes.</p>

                            <h3>Phagocytosis</h3>
                            <p>The process of phagocytosis ('cell eating') is the body's first line of cellular defence. Phagocytes actively migrate (chemotaxis) to sites of inflammation and infection because neutrophils themselves and invading microbes release chemicals that attract them (chemoattractants). Phagocytes attack and engulf their targets (Fig. 15.1).</p>

                            <p><strong>Neutrophils</strong> are very short-lived once activated, and destroy themselves as well as their targets with their own toxic products. <strong>Macrophages</strong> are much longer-lived phagocytes, and also have an important role as a link between the non-specific and specific defence mechanisms. After ingestion and digestion of an antigen, they act as <strong>antigen-presenting cells</strong>, displaying their antigen on their own cell surface to stimulate T-lymphocytes and activate the adaptive immune response.</p>
