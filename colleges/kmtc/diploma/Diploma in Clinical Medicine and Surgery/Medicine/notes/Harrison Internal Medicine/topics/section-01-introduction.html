During her visit, she is ruled out for cardiac ischemia, with negative biomarkers for cardiac ischemia and unremarkable electrocardiograms. An exercise single photon emission CT (SPECT) myocardial perfusion test was performed, and a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect was noted. The test was read as positive. The patient was placed on aspirin. She is quite concerned that she continues to have chest pain intermittently on a daily basis without any consistency in regards to time or antecedent activity. She is otherwise active and feeling well. She smokes socially on weekends. She has no family history of early coronary disease. What would be the best next course of action?</p>

He is afebrile with normal vital signs. His weight is down 5 kg since initiating diuretic therapy. Physical examination is notable for a somnolent but conversant man with mild jaundice, pinpoint pupils, palmar erythema, spider hemangiomas on his chest, a palpable nodular liver edge at the costal margin, and bilateral $1+$ lower extremity edema. He does not have asterixis, abdominal tenderness, or an abdominal fluid wave. Laboratory results compared to 3 months previously reveal an increased INR, from 1.4 to 2.1; elevated total bilirubin, from 1.8 to $3.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; and decreased albumin from 3.4 to $2.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$; as well as baseline elevations of his aspartate and alanine aminotransferases ($54 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$ and $78 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$, respectively).

                            <p><strong>I-23.</strong> You are a physician working in an urban emergency department when several patients are brought in after the release of an unknown gas at the performance of a symphony. You are evaluating a 52-year-old female who is not able to talk clearly because of excessive salivation and rhinorrhea, although she is able to tell you that she feels as if she lost her sight immediately upon exposure. At present, she also has nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle twitching. On physical examination the patient has a blood pressure of 156/92, a heart rate of 92, a respiratory rate of 30, and a temperature of $37.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(99.3^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. She has pinpoint pupils with profuse rhinorrhea and salivation. She also is coughing profusely, with production of copious amounts of clear secretions. A lung examination reveals wheezing on expiration in bilateral lung fields. The patient has a regular rate and rhythm with normal heart sounds. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, but the abdomen is not tender. She is having diffuse fasciculations. At the end of your examination, the patient abruptly develops tonic-clonic seizures. Which of the following agents is most likely to cause this patient's symptoms?</p>

She has had no recent travel or outdoor exposure and is up to date on all of her vaccinations. She does not use IV drugs. On examination, the ulcer looks clean with a well-granulated base and no erythema, warmth, or pustular discharge. However, the patient does have diffuse erythema that is most prominent on her palms, conjunctiva, and oral mucosa. Other than profound hypotension and tachycardia, the remainder of the examination is nonfocal. Laboratory results are notable for a creatinine of $2.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, aspartate aminotransferase of $250 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$, alanine aminotransferase of $328 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{L}$, total bilirubin of $3.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, direct bilirubin of $0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, INR of 1.5, activated partial thromboplastin time of $1.6 \times$ control, and platelets at $94,000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$. Ferritin is $1300 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$. The patient is started on broad-spectrum antibiotics after appropriate blood cultures are drawn and is resuscitated with IV fluid and vasopressors. Her blood cultures are negative at 72 h: at this point her fingertips start to desquamate. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

She notes that she always had been what she describes as a "worrier," even in grade school. The patient has always avoided speaking in public and recently is becoming anxious to the extent where she is having difficulty functioning at work and in social situations. She has difficulty falling asleep at night and finds that she is always "fidgety" and has a compulsive urge to move. The patient owns a real estate company that has been in decline since a downturn in the local economy. She recently has been avoiding showing homes for sale. Instead, she defers to her partners because she finds that she is nervous to the point of being unable to speak to her clients. She has two children, ages 16 and 12, who are very active in sports. She feels overwhelmed with worry over the possibility of injury to her children and will not attend their sports events. You suspect that the patient has a generalized anxiety disorder.
