                                    <li>Employees must be coerced, controlled, directed, or threatened with punishment to achieve organizational goals.</li>
                                    <li>Employees prefer to be directed, wish to avoid responsibility, have relatively little ambition, and want security above all.</li>
                                    <li>Motivation occurs only at the physiological and safety levels.</li>

                                    <li>External control and the threat of punishment are not the only means for bringing about effort toward objectives. People will exercise self-direction and self-control in the service of objectives to which they are committed.</li>
                                    <li>Commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievement (especially ego satisfaction).</li>
                                    <li>The average human being learns, under proper conditions, not only to accept but to seek responsibility.</li>
                                    <li>The capacity to exercise a relatively high degree of imagination, ingenuity, and creativity in the solution of organizational problems is widely, not narrowly, distributed in the population.</li>
