<p>Horizontal movement of the eye outwards (laterally) is termed abduction and inwards (medially) is termed adduction. Vertical movement upwards is termed elevation and downwards is depression. The eye is also capable of diagonal movements (version) at any intermediate angle. Rotary movements are those in which the eye twists on its anteriorposterior axis. Convergence refers to adduction of both eyes to fixate on a near object. Lateral rotation of the head causes replex rotation of the eyes in the opposite direction (internal rotation of one eye,</p>
<p>external rotation of the other). A squint (the eyes point in different directions) is described as convergent or divergent strabismus, depending on whether the eyes point towards or away from each other. Saccades are abrupt, rapid small movements of both eyes, such as those needed to shift fixation from one object to another. Nystagmus denotes rhythmic oscillations of one or (more usually) both eyes. In pendular nystagmus, the movement is slow in both directions. In jerk nystagmus, there is a slow phase in one direction and a fast phase in the opposite direction. By convention, the direction of nystagmus is the direction of the fast phase, but the defect is in fact the slow phase and is either an abnormal deviation of the eyes or a failure of the eyes to maintain position, and the fast phase is a compensatory saccade aimed at restoring the correct position of the eyes. Some types of nystagmus are outlined below.</p>

<p>As with every other component of examination, the detail in which the eye movements are examined depends on whether there are relevant symptoms and whether abnormal signs are likely to be present. Ask the patient to keep his head still (assist him by putting your left hand on his head to steady it) and then to look at your right index finger held directly in front of his eyes at about half a metre distance. In the primary position of gaze, look for any visible abnormality of the alignment of the two eyes (an affected patient may or may not complain of double vision) and any pendular or vestibular nystagmus (see below). Now move your finger to the right, left, up and down in a large 'H' pattern. The pursuit eye movements which are elicited should precisely follow your finger at the appropriate constant velocity. Eye movements which are 'broken up' into a series of short saccades indicate a brainstem or cerebellar lesion affecting eye movement control. Patients with diplopia will experience their diplopia at some point (or at all times) during this simple test. Gaze-evoked and vestibular nystagmus will be observable (see below). When looking for nystagmus, it is important not to get the patient to look too far in any direction since, at the extremes of gaze, nystagmus can be normal as the patient struggles to deviate his eyes beyond what is possible. Look for nystagmus at about <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>30</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">∘</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">30^{\circ}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6741em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">0</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.6741em;"><span style="top: -3.063em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">∘</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> away from the primary position of gaze.</p>

<p>If a patient complains of double vision, first establish that it is true diplopia and not monocular diplopia. In patients who have obvious, easily visible paresis of movement of one or both eyes, the reason for diplopia is self-evident (Fig. 14.5).

<p>Diplopia develops with even very subtle misalignment of the eyes, which cannot be seen on simple inspection. In this situation, if the ophthalmoparesis affects just one eye, it is possible to work out which eye muscles are underactive by diplopia testing. The true image is that generated by the eye with normal movements. The false image is that generated by the eye with the paretic muscle or muscles. For example, if a patient develops double vision on looking to the right, with horizontal separation of the images, the false image will be the one further out to the right. This is true whether it is the right eye which does not abduct adequately (right lateral rectus weakness) or if it is the left eye which does not adduct adequately (left medial rectus weakness). If this does not seem immediately clear, consider the extreme case: one eye moves, the other does not. An image (an examiner's finger or a white pinhead) moves to the patient's right. The image remains in the middle of the field of the eye which moves, but moves progressively to the right of the field of the eye which does not. The same rule applies in all directions of gaze. Diplopia is always maximal in the direction in which the weak muscle has its purest action (see Table 14.4).</p>
<p>The severity of the diplopia should be assessed in eight positions: looking to left and right, up and down, and obliquely up and down to the left and obliquely up and down to the right. To work out which muscle is underactive, where the diplopia is maximal, cover each eye in turn and get the patient to tell you which of the two images disappears. Inconsistent answers are common, however, and the assistance of an ophthalmologist or optometrist is frequently desirable. The features of lesions of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves are summarized in Table 14.5.</p>
<p>In assessing patients who have double vision, it is best first to establish which muscles appear to be weak, and then try to decide what the nature of the</p>

<p>problem is likely to be, taking into consideration all the physical signs. Thus, impairment of eye movements in one eye in combination with proptosis of that eye may occur because of mechanical restriction of eye movements by an intraorbital lesion. Weakness of muscles in both eyes with different patterns of involvement of the muscles in the two eyes is likely to be due to a disorder of the muscles themselves (orbital myositis, thyroid eye disease) or due to ocular or generalized myasthenia. The pupils will not be involved. Bilateral, asymmetrical combinations of cranial nerve lesions are relatively uncommon (neoplastic infiltration, cranial polyneuritis). Bilateral sixth cranial nerve lesions are common, usually but not exclusively as a feature of raised intracranial pressure. Multiple oculomotor neuropathies in one eye direct attention to the superior orbital fissure and the cavernous sinus (see Box 14.2).</p>

Commonly, nystagmus is seen in the abducting eye. The pathway for adducting both eyes for near vision is separate, and sometimes in bilateral INO preservation of adduction of the eyes for near vision can be demonstrated, proving that the problem is not bilateral medial rectus weakness.</p>

<p>The neural control of upgaze and downgaze is complex. Ultimately, output for upgaze is via components of the third nerve nucleus mainly to the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles bilaterally. The output for downgaze is from the third
and fourth nerve nuclei to the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles, respectively. In general, defects of upgaze or downgage localize rather poorly, but lesions such as pineal tumours which compress the midbrain and bilateral descending connections from the hemispheres often cause upgaze paresis.</p>

<p>Getting a patient to follow a moving finger tests pursuit eye movements. It takes very little time to test saccadic eye movements and useful signs may be detected. First, simply ask the patient to keep his head still and look to the left, to the right, up and down. Then hold your hands up in front of the patient, one in the primary position of gaze, the other to the side, with palms facing the patient, fists closed. Ask the patient to keep his head still. Open the fist of the hand in front of the patient and ask him to look at it. Then close that fist and open the other and ask the patient to switch his gaze to the hand at the side. By alternating which hand is open you can get the patient to refixate briskly to and fro. Then check the other side. These manouevers test saccadic movements; in disease, saccades may be slowed or interrupted. They are also the best way of detecting a mild internuclear ophthalmoparesis.</p>

<p>Reflex eye movements related to head movements are generated and organized by vestibular, cerebellar and brainstem systems, whereas voluntary gaze is initiated in the cerebral hemispheres. A patient's gaze paresis is therefore supranuclear if reflex eye movements are intact. Take a patient with selective paresis of downgaze. If brisk backward rotation of the head (extension of the neck) produced reflex depression of both eyes, a supranuclear lesion would be inferred. In practice, this is often not easily achieved since the relatively common disorder giving supranuclear downgaze paresis is progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition in which there is also axial rigidity affecting neck movements.</p>

<p>This occurs in lesions of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve. Normally there is tonic input to the brainstem vestibular nuclei from the periphery. Loss of this tonic input leads to deviation of the eyes towards the affected side (slow phase) with fast-phase</p>
<p>nystagmus directed to the opposite side. In mild lesions, the nystagmus is only seen when the eyes look in the direction of the fast phase. In more severe lesions, the nystagmus is seen with the eyes in the primary position of gaze or even when looking away from the direction of the fast phase. Usually the nystagmus is of high frequency and relatively low amplitude.</p>

<p>This is a gaze-evoked nystagmus in which the eyes are not able to maintain a position away from their primary position, so the slow phase is a drift back to the primary position while the fast phase is in the direction of gaze. In the primary position, the eyes are still. The nystagmus may be of large amplitude and low frequency. Drug-induced nystagmus (alcohol, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic medication) is of this sort and is seen in all directions of gaze. Structural brainstem or cerebellar lesions may cause asymmetric gaze paretic nystagmus. In cerebellar hemisphere lesions, the nystagmus may be unidirectional with the fast phase towards the side of the lesion.</p>
<p>Upbeat nystagmus (fast phase upwards) may occur with lesions at various locations in the brainstem and with cerebellar vermis lesions. Downbeat nystagmus is characteristic of cervicomedullary junction lesions such as Chiari malformations, but can also be seen with cerebellar degenerations.</p>

These nerves also mediate general sensation inside the mouth and nose and proprioception. The ophthalmic nerve passes through the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. The maxillary nerve also passes through the cavernous sinus, but leaves the inside of the skull through the foramen rotundum. The mandibular nerve passes through the foramen ovale.</p>
<p>Afferents mediating touch sensation pass to the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the pons. Pain and temperature afferents go into the spinal tract and pass caudally into the medulla and into the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, which extends down from the medulla as low as the upper cervical spinal cord. Thus, lesions in the medulla can give rise to dissociated sensory loss in trigeminal territory (loss of pinprick sensation with preserved light touch sensation).</p>

<p>Patients with impaired sensation on one side of the face may have a trigeminal nerve lesion, a trigeminal nucleus lesion or a lesion of central trigeminal sensory pathways. Not uncommonly, unilateral facial sensory symptoms remain unexplained, which does not necessarily make them 'non-organic'. Much is made of distinguishing between patients whose distribution of sensory loss is anatomical and those in whom it is not. Sensory loss which ends at the jaw line and at the hairline would be regarded as nonanatomical but too much dogma may be unwise patients are often not very careful reporters of exactly where their sensory symptoms are. Clearly defined symptoms of reduced sensation render examination almost redundant, but the area of hypoaesthesia can be delineated in the same way as sensory loss anywhere else using a pin and testing from a numb area outwards towards where sensation is normal.</p>

<p>A sensory stimulus applied to the cornea causes a reflex blink which cannot be suppressed; its absence on one side establishes unequivocally the presence of a trigeminal lesion. Patients with an anaesthetic cornea are at risk of corneal injury, so it is important to identify affected individuals by testing patients who very clearly have symptoms and other signs of a trigeminal lesion. It is also an important test in coma. The test is uncomfortable and should not be part of a 'routine' neurological examination. The presence of a normal corneal reflex does not mean that there is no lesion of the trigeminal nerve or its connections.</p>
<p>Explain to the patient what is going to happen. Ask him to look in such a direction that the eyes are wide open. Using the corner of a clean tissue, touch the centre of the patient's cornea, approaching from the side. The normal response is a brisk blink. Some use cotton wool, but there is a risk of strands getting stuck in the eye because of the blink. In coma, a drop of saline applied to the cornea is a good stimulus. Remember that if there is ipsilateral facial paralysis (e.g. Bell's palsy), the reflex will be absent on the affected side, but will be readily seen on the other side.</p>

<p>Look for wasting of the temporalis and masseter muscles. Feel for contraction of the masseter muscles when the patient clenches his jaw. Ask the patient to open his mouth; the lateral pterygoid muscles on each side draw the mandible forward, such that a severe lesion of the trigeminal nerve will lead to deviation of the jaw towards the side of the lesion
due to weakness of the pterygoid muscles on the affected side. The pterygoid muscles may be further tested by asking the patient to push his open jaw sideways against your hand.</p>

<p>This can be a useful reflex to test, but it is usually examined along with the tendon reflexes of the limbs (see below). Its usefulness is when it is pathologically brisk in a patient with a spastic tetraparesis, because it points to the site of the causative lesion being in the cerebral hemispheres (e.g. diffuse small vessel cerebrovascular disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or hydrocephalus) rather than the cervical spinal cord.</p>
<p>Ask the patient to let his jaw hang down in a relaxed manner, with the mouth slightly open. Place your index finger across his chin. Strike it lightly with a tendon hammer; reflex contraction of both masseters is the response. Sometimes an extremely brisk jaw jerk is accompanied by clonus.</p>

<p>The facial nerve is principally a motor nerve, supplying facial muscles on one side, but it also has a small general somatic sensory and major gustatory sensory components, as well as important parasympathetic functions.</p>
<p>The facial nerve nucleus is in the caudal pons, lying ventrolateral to the sixth cranial nerve nucleus (see Fig. 14.3). It receives upper motor neurone input from both cerebral hemispheres. Lower motor neurone fibres from the facial nucleus first pass round the sixth nerve nucleus, then emerge from the pons to form the facial nerve. From here, it travels laterally, adjacent to the eighth cranial nerve, to the internal auditory meatus, thence to the facial canal which has a relatively long and tortuous course through the skull, emerging at the stylomastoid foramen. The nerve then passes forward into the parotid gland and divides into branches which supply all the facial muscles and the platysma muscle on one side. In the facial canal, a branch of the facial nerve supplies the stapedius muscle.</p>
<p>The nerve cell bodies of the sensory components of the facial nerve are in the geniculate ganglion in the facial canal. Gustatory sensory afferents from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue travel in the lingual nerve and then via the chorda tympani nerve to join the facial nerve in the facial canal. Central projections reach the medulla via the nervus intermedius between the facial and eighth cranial nerve.</p>
<p>The peripheral projections of the small general somatic sensory contribution innervate the tympanic membrane, external auditory meatus and tragus of the ear. This accounts for the herpetic vesicles seen in the ear in patients with the Ramsay Hunt</p>
<p>syndrome of facial paralysis caused by herpes zoster affecting the facial nerve.</p>
<p>Secretomotor parasympathetic efferents leave the pontomedullary junction in the nervus intermedius which joins the facial nerve in the internal auditory meatus. Some of the parasympathetic nerves leave the facial nerve at the geniculate ganglion in the greater petrosal nerve, eventually mediating tear secretion from the lachrymal glands. Others leave via the chorda tympani nerve to reach salivary glands.</p>
<p>These complexities are relevant to clinical neurology because a facial nerve lesion, depending on its location, may be associated with loss of taste, hyperacusis (if stapedius is paralysed) and, in chronic lesions, 'crocodile tears' (i.e. inappropriate tear production when salivary glands should be activated), attributed to aberrant reinnervation of salivary and lachrymal glands.</p>
<p>Facial weakness occurs because of muscle disorders (invariably bilateral weakness), myasthenia (invariably bilateral but may be asymmetric early on), polyneuropathies (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome or vasculitis; unilateral or bilateral), facial nerve or nuclear lesions (most commonly unilateral), motor neuronopathies (usually bilateral) or upper motor neurone disorders (usually unilateral, but occasionally bilateral).</p>
<p>A lower motor neurone lesion affecting the whole of the facial nerve nucleus or the whole of the facial nerve will cause weakness of all muscles of one side of the face. A unilateral upper motor neurone lesion, however, will cause weakness of the lower half of the face with sparing of the upper half of the face because there is bilateral representation of the upper half of the face in the motor cortex.</p>

<p>Look for asymmetry of the face. Ask the patient to raise his eyebrows (to look astonished), to blink and then to screw both eyes up, firmly closed. On a weak side, the eyelashes will be less buried by the eyelids. Attempt to raise the patient's eyebrows while his eyes are closed and screwed up; mild weakness may be detected. When there is severe lower motor neurone facial weakness, the patient will not be able to close the affected eye. Attempted eye closure will be accompanied by elevation of the eyes (Bell's phenomenon). Ask the patient to blow his cheeks out, to show his teeth (or gums) and then to grimace. Observe the patient's spontaneous smiles. (In some upper motor neurone disorders of facial muscle control, voluntary movement of the lower face is lost but smiling is relatively preserved.) Ask the patient to purse his lips together and attempt to open them using your fingers. These tests usually suffice to pick up facial weakness and to distinguish between upper and lower motor neurone disorders.</p>

<p>The assessment of deafness is covered in detail elsewhere (Ch. 20). At the bedside, a crude assessment of hearing can be achieved by rubbing your index finger and thumb together close to the patient's ear, or by whispering numbers close to his ear, with the contralateral ear occluded. Rinne's test is good for distinguishing between conduction and sensorineural deafness, as long as you use the appropriate tuning fork (frequency 512 - not the lower frequency tuning fork (128) used for testing vibration sense).</p>
<p>Conduction deafness is sometimes of neurological significance if an infective or neoplastic middle ear lesion has spread to affect middle or posterior cranial fossa structures.</p>
<p>Unilateral sensorineural deafness is an important feature of 'cerebellopontine angle lesions', such as acoustic neuroma or meningioma, along with variable combinations of facial weakness (facial nerve), facial sensory symptoms (trigeminal nerve), nystagmus (brainstem and vestibular nerve), ataxia (brainstem and cerebellum), and ultimately long tract signs (brainstem) and raised intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>Bilateral sensory deafness may be a feature of certain multisystem neurological disorders, particularly mitochondrial disorders.</p>
<p>The disorder variously called labyrinthitis and acute vestibular neuritis (the latter is regarded as being the more accurate designation) causes vertigo and peripheral vestibular nystagmus (see p. 293). A common symptom is positioning vertigo, most commonly benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo. Positioning vertigo and nystagmus are best elicited and tested by the Dix-Hallpike test (see Ch. 20).</p>

<p>There are anatomical and functional relationships between the glossopharyngeal nerve, the vagus nerve and the cranial component of the accessory nerve. The nucleus ambiguus in the medulla (Fig. 14.8) contains the motor neurones which innervate striated muscle of the palate, pharynx, larynx and upper oesophagus, fibres running partly in the glossopharyngeal nerve, mainly in the vagus nerve and partly in the cranial portion of the accessory nerve.</p>

<p>Situated more dorsally in the medulla, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the inferior salivatory nucleus (whose fibres join the glossopharyngeal nerve) contain preganglionic parasympathetic neurones which control glands and smooth muscle. Special visceral afferents (i.e. taste fibres from the intermediate nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve) enter the solitary tract to end in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. General somatic sensory afferents in the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves join trigeminal sensory nuclei.</p>
<p>The glossopharyngeal nerve rootlets emerge from the medulla just rostral to those of the vagus nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve leaves the skull via the jugular foramen. It mediates somatic sensation of the palate and pharynx and gustatory sensation from the posterior third of the tongue, and it has autonomic secretomotor fibres which reach the parotid gland, and it supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle (which cannot be tested clinically).</p>

<p>In routine neurological examinations, this nerve is not tested. If there are particular clinical indications to test it, such as a symptom of pharyngeal sensory impairment, pharyngeal neuropathic pain or a lesion of the vagus nerve, pharyngeal sensation can be tested using an orange stick to touch lightly the mucosa of the posterior pharyngeal wall. This requires tolerance and cooperation on the part of the patient. Some normal individuals will gag even
at the approach of a tongue depressor or orange stick. In stuporous or comatose patients, testing the gag reflex may be useful. The afferent component of this reflex involves the glossopharyngeal nerves.</p>

<p>The rootlets of the vagus emerge from the medulla just below those of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Both nerves leave the base of the skull through the jugular foramen. The vagus nerve passes down the neck adjacent to the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Motor efferent fibres supply pharyngeal muscles. The superior laryngeal nerve supplies the cricopharyngeus muscle of the larynx and conveys sensation from the larynx. Lower down in the thorax, the recurrent laryngeal nerve passes back up the neck to supply the laryngeal muscles other than cricopharyngeus. The visceral afferent and efferent fibres of the vagus nerve downstream of the recurrent laryngeal nerves are not amenable to clinical neurological examination.</p>

<p>A patient with a proximal unilateral lesion of the vagus nerve may complain of dysphagia and nasal regurgitation of swallowed fluids. There will be weakness of the muscles of the soft palate on the affected side. Attempted voluntary elevation of the soft palate (ask the patient to say 'Ahh', preferably fairly high pitched) reveals the weakness of elevation of the palate on the affected side, along with deviation of the uvula to the unaffected side, because of the unopposed action of the palatal muscles on that side. In addition, ipsilateral vocal cord paresis will lead to dysphonia. Bilateral lesions of the vagus nerves will invariably be associated with dysphagia. (Bilateral palatal weakness is not commonly due to bilateral vagus lesions but rather to more diffuse disorders such as polyneuropathy or myasthenia gravis.) The effects of bilateral lesions of innervation of the larynx vary depending on whether there is weakness mainly of vocal cord abduction or adduction or both. Bilateral abductor weakness puts the patient at risk of stridor and respiratory obstruction. Bilateral adductor weakness leads to dysphonia and inability to generate a normal explosive cough (the cough which the patient can manage is described as a bovine cough).</p>

<p>The cranial accessory nerve is formed of nerve fibres from the nucleus ambiguus and they soon leave the accessory nerve to rejoin their equivalents in the vagus nerve. The spinal accessory nerve consists of motor nerve fibres from the cervical spinal cord</p>
<p>(C2-6); instead of leaving the spinal cord in spinal roots, they pass rostrally up into the medulla and emerge as the accessory nerve which, along with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, passes through the jugular foramen. The spinal accessory nerve supplies the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the upper part of the trapezius muscle.</p>

<p>The left sternocleidomastoid muscle contributes to rotation of the head to the right and vice versa. Weakness of the left sternocleidomastoid is therefore assessed by asking the patient to turn his head to the right with force, while the examiner opposes the rotation with the left hand, pushing carefully against the right side of the face. Failure of contraction of the muscle can be seen. Weakness of the upper part of trapezius is one of the causes of winging of the scapula, the other being weakness of serratus anterior due to a lesion of the long thoracic nerve (see p. 305). Scapular winging due to trapezius weakness is most commonly caused by a lesion of the accessory nerve in the posterior triangle of the neck, often iatrogenic related to surgical excision of a lymph node.</p>

<p>A unilateral hypoglossal nerve lesion in the acute stage leads to weakness of tongue muscles on the affected side. Attempted protrusion of the tongue results in deviation of the tongue toward the weak side. A chronic lesion will be associated with visible muscle atrophy of the affected side of the tongue. Bilateral wasting and weakness of the tongue with fasciculation is usually due to the progressive bulbar atrophy of motor neurone disease (Fig. 14.9).</p>

<p>Bulbar refers to the medulla oblongata, and bulbar palsy denotes any weakness of muscles supplied by the seventh to twelfth cranial nerves from the pons and medulla. Dysarthria and dysphagia are the main manifestations. Palatal weakness allows nasal escape of air during production of plosive sounds. There are many causes, ranging from muscle disorders, myasthenia gravis and polyneuropathies to lower motor neuronopathies. In myasthenia, fatigue may be evident, the dysarthria developing as the patient talks.</p>
<p>Severe upper motor neurone lesions such as strokes will produce dysarthria and it may also be a feature of certain dysphasias.</p>

<p>For the purposes of clinical neurological examination and interpretation of neurological signs, the anatomical considerations can be kept simple. The motor neurones whose axons terminate at neuromuscular junctions and which activate voluntary striated muscle contraction are situated in the anterior horns of the spinal cord grey matter and in motor cranial nerve nuclei. These are the lower motor neurones. Upper motor neurones are those situated in the cerebral cortex whose axons leave the cortex to control, directly or indirectly, the lower motor neurones. Some of these are in the somatotopically organized primary motor cortex (Fig. 14.10) in the precentral gyrus at the back of the frontal lobe, but the distribution of upper motor neurones in the cortex is much wider than just the primary motor cortex, and includes the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex in the frontal lobes. The cerebral control of posture and movement involves widely distributed cortical motor systems. Crucial also are circuits involving the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Output from the cortex is either direct to motor neurones via corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts or indirect via projections to the brainstem which has major influences by various pathways.</p>
<p>The corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts pass via the internal capsule and cerebral peduncle to the ventral pons. The corticobulbar tract projects to

<p>Figure 14.10 Somatotopic representation in the primary motor cortex.
motor nuclei of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X and XII bilaterally. The corticospinal tract continues in the medullary pyramid. The majority of corticospinal tract fibres decussate in the lower ventral medulla, passing into the lateral corticospinal tract of the spinal cord to innervate contralateral spinal motor neurones. These fibres control movements of the limbs. A minority of corticospinal tract fibres do not decussate but proceed straight on into the spinal cord in the anterior corticospinal tract, to project to motor neurones bilaterally. They control axial muscles involved in posture.</p>
<p>The fundamental effect of a lower motor lesion is weakness (ultimately paralysis) of affected muscles with marked wasting. The effects of upper motor neurone lesions are more variable, depending on which descending pathways are affected. They are loss of dexterity, weakness and spasticity. An upper motor neurone lesion may cause mild weakness but, nevertheless, be incapacitating because of spasticity and impaired dexterity. On the other hand, a lesion restricted to cells in the primary motor cortex itself causes weakness without spasticity. With upper motor neurone lesions, muscle wasting is much less marked, and occurs late.</p>

<p>The examination technique for formal assessment of the motor system depends very much on the circumstances. For instance, a follow-up outpatient assessment to gauge the response to treatment of a patient with myasthenia gravis, polymyositis or even chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy may be effectively achieved in the consultation room without recourse to the examination couch. Here, it is assumed that the patient is presenting for a diagnosis; this requires complete exposure of limbs, shoulders, trunk and buttocks, and careful assessment of muscle power of a large number of muscles or muscle groups.</p>

<p>Start by looking at the muscles and the limbs and trunk. Pathological hypertrophy of muscle is rare. Pseudohypertrophy is also uncommon. It is seen mainly in the calf muscles of individuals with certain muscular dystrophies. It is termed 'pseudohypertrophy' because it is associated with weakness, and pathologically there is degeneration of muscle with replacement of muscle tissue by fat.</p>
<p>Wasting of muscle is a common sign of disease, but does not always have a neurological basis. With disuse, muscles atrophy, sometimes quite fast. Generally disuse atrophy is fairly mild. Power is preserved if it can be tested (e.g. quadriceps wasting in someone with severe knee arthritis). Cachexia</p>
<p>involves diffuse muscle wasting, but usually power is surprisingly good. Thyrotoxicosis leads to diffuse muscle wasting and ultimately there is weakness (thyrotoxic myopathy). Many myopathic disorders give rise to wasting, and the pattern of wasting (proximal, distal, symmetrical, asymmetrical and selective (e.g. finger flexor muscles in the forearm in inclusion body myositis)) helps diagnostically. Wasting is an important sign of peripheral nerve disease which affects motor nerve fibres. It is denervated muscle which wastes markedly, indicating motor nerve terminal or axon loss. Focal motor nerve demyelination with conduction block but without denervation causes weakness, but there may be little or no wasting. In mononeuropathies, the wasting only affects muscles supplied by the affected nerve. Sometimes an ulnar neuropathy or median nerve lesion at the wrist or a common peroneal nerve lesion can be correctly diagnosed with reasonable confidence just by observing the pattern of wasting. In mononeuropathies, plexopathies and radiculopathies, wasted muscles will be weak. Motor and mixed motor and sensory polyneuropathies also cause wasting, most commonly distally and symmetrically. Disorders of motor nerve cell bodies lead to loss of associated axons and wasting. Thus, a range of pathologies of the spinal cord cause wasting, including processes which just affect motor nerve cell bodies, such as motor neurone disease and hereditary motor neuronopathies (spinal muscular atrophies) and poliomyelitis, and structural spinal cord disorders such as syringomyelia. Many elderly patients appear to have wasting of the small muscles of the hand, but if the strength is normal, there is probably actually no muscle wasting.</p>
<p>Fasciculations are spontaneous contractions of the muscle fibres of individual motor units within a muscle at rest, seen as twitches within a muscle. While widespread fasciculations are rather characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they are not always seen in that condition, and they may be seen in peripheral neuropathies and radiculopathies and in normal individuals who are not fully at rest. They may also be an isolated, benign abnormality.</p>
<p>Pes cavus (Fig. 14.11) with clawing of the toes may be idiopathic or an indication of longstanding imbalance of muscle power in the feet (mainly weakness of intrinsic foot muscles), caused commonly by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, but also by other hereditary or congenital disorders of peripheral nerve or spinal cord. Contractures of joints can be a consequence of muscle disease, peripheral neuropathy or CNS disease. Scoliosis is common in neurofibromatosis, but may be a complication of other neurological disorders such as syringomyelia and Friedreich's ataxia.

<p>Some people can relax their muscles extremely well, whereas others tense up during an examination, sometimes making for difficulty in assessing tone. Generally, in adult neurological practice, apparent hypotonia is not very diagnostically useful. The two common and important forms of pathological increase in muscle tone are spasticity, reflecting an upper motor neurone disorder (imprecisely designated 'pyramidal' because the corticospinal tracts constitute the medullary pyramids) and the 'extrapyramidal' rigidity of parkinsonism.</p>

<p>Spastic hypertonia in the upper limbs affects flexor muscles more than extensor muscles. This may give rise to a characteristic posture of the limb which is flexed at the elbow, wrist and fingers. There will be more resistance to passive extension of these joints than to passive flexion. The resistance increases in proportion to the speed of stretch of affected muscles, until it suddenly reduces (so-called claspknife rigidity). Accordingly, detecting spasticity is best achieved by fairly fast and vigorous movements of the patient's limb to stretch relevant muscles. Hold the patient's elbow and hand and extend the elbow briskly, from a fully flexed to a fully extended position. Similar considerations apply at the wrist and fingers. A spastic arm will also have increased tone in pronator muscles. Brisk passive supination of</p>
<p>the forearm will elicit clasp-knife rigidity felt as a 'pronator catch'.</p>
<p>In the leg, spasticity typically affects adductors and extensors more than flexors. With spinal cord lesions, the spasticity is often bilateral (a spastic paraparesis). Mild bilateral adductor spasticity can be detected with the the patient lying supine on a couch or bed. Pick up one leg and abduct it. In doing so, adduction of the contralateral leg will be observed. Mild spasticity in quadriceps can be detected by asking the patient to relax. Then briskly flex his hip by lifting the leg behind the knee. In a normal limb, this will lead to flexion of the knee by gravity of the lower leg. The ankle will remain on the couch, being dragged proximally. If there is spasticity, however, the lower leg will be lifted off the bed briefly before falling back down. Spasticity at the ankle causes plantarflexion. Brisk passive dorsiflexion of the ankle, best done with the knee partially flexed, elicits the spasticity in the form of clonus - a succession of involuntary brief contractions of the calf muscles. Clonus may range from a few beats to sustained clonus in which there are repetitive calf muscle contractions until pressure on the sole of the foot is removed.</p>

<p>This takes two forms: either an increase in muscle tone affecting any movement of any muscle groups (so-called lead-pipe rigidity); or rigidity which is modified by tremor (so-called cogwheel rigidity, in which a high frequency intermittency in the severity of the resistance to movement is felt). Mild parkinsonian rigidity is sometimes absent when the patient is relaxed, but may be induced by getting the patient to use the arm contralateral to the arm being assessed (activated rigidity). Passive flexion and extension of the wrist is a good manoeuvre to pick up parkinsonian rigidity. Test first with the contralateral arm at rest. Then, if appropriate, test again, this time for activated rigidity, with the patient moving his opposite arm up and down with the fist clenched.</p>

<p>This is a skill which requires considerable practice, in order to learn how to encourage patients to cooperate fully and demonstrate the full amount of power they have at their disposal, and to be able to make correct judgements about the presence of weakness. With few exceptions, isometric contraction (in which a muscle exerts a force but does not change in length) is tested by the examiner opposing the action of the patient's muscle(s). Clearly the
average healthy young doctor will be stronger than a child or a frail elderly but otherwise normal person, so judgement has to be applied. Conversely some patients will be stronger than the examiner. It is important to be thinking about the patterns of muscle weakness which are likely to be found in different kinds of disease processes; and to look for and register the evolving pattern of weakness as you go along.</p>
<p>A common problem is non-organic weakness. This may reflect malingering or a conversion disorder, but sometimes just indicates that the patient is keen to impress on you that there is something the matter. In non-organic weakness, intermittency of effort is apparent, with variability of power produced from second to second, often with a prominent tendency abruptly to give way or withhold effort. In contrast, the muscle of a patient with organic weakness exerting as much force as he can will give in a smooth, continuous way, not a jerky, fluctuating way. Nonorganic paralysis is often quite easy to diagnose because of inconsistencies in the patient's capabilities. For instance, a patient may walk into the consulting room normally, mount the examination couch unaided but be unable to lift a leg into the air because of apparent paralysis of hip flexion. The non-organic nature of unilateral hip extension weakness may be established by Hoover's sign. A patient appears to have paralysis of hip extension. Keep a hand under the affected leg and ask the patient to flex the opposite hip against the resistance of your other arm. In doing so, the patient will unwittingly activate the previously paralysed hip extensors.</p>
<p>Clinical methods of recording the severity of muscle weakness have considerable shortcomings, but in neurological practice it is desirable to chart muscle strength in order to document progression or recovery and to gauge the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The Medical Research Council scale is widely used (Box 14.3), but a problem with this scale is that the vast majority of muscle weakness one will encounter is grade 4 . It also performs</p>

<ul>
<li>Grade 0: no contraction</li>
<li>Grade 1: flicker or trace of contraction</li>
<li>Grade 2: active movement with gravity eliminated</li>
<li>Grade 3: active movement against gravity</li>
<li>Grade 4: active movement against gravity and resistance</li>
<li>Grade 5: normal power</li>

<p>Commonly Grade 4 is divided into 4-, 4 and 4+, denoting severe, moderate and mild weakness, and some use 5- to signify minimal weakness.</p>
<p>badly for fingers and toes where gravity has scarcely any influence, so that grades 1,2 and 3 are more or less identical. Many clinicians find a scale of normal power, mild, moderate and severe weakness and paralysis is practical for everyday use. Accurate quantitative myometry ought to be a way forward, but has hardly entered routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>There is not the space here to describe in detail the testing of all the important individual muscles and muscle groups. Tables 14.6 and 14.7 represent a summary of commonly tested muscles and their actions, but a number of specific points are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two tests in which muscle strength is routinely tested isotonically (i.e. the muscle shortens while lifting a constant load) as opposed to isometrically. Abdominal trunk muscles are tested by asking the patient to sit up from lying flat with his arms folded on his chest. Standing up from a sitting position or rising from a crouched position are good tests of hip and knee extension and spine extension muscles, and are useful in testing patients with myopathies. Normally these actions can be accomplished without use of the arms. Weak patients often have to resort to using their arms to push themselves up, either using surrounding furniture or, failing that, pushing themselves up with their arms on their own legs (Gowers' sign; Fig. 14.12).</li>
<li>Testing neck flexion and extension is important in myopathies, in myasthenia gravis and in motor neurone disease.</li>
<li>Deltoids, spinati, the pectoralis major muscles, hip abductors and hip adductors can be tested bilaterally simultaneously, but all other muscles must be tested in each limb separately.</li>
<li>People sometimes test ulnar nerve-supplied small hand muscles by squeezing together the abducted index and small fingers (first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi muscles). It is better to test these two muscles individually.</li>
<li>Mild weakness of calf muscles (gastrocnemii and soleus) is difficult to detect on a couch. A good technique is to get the patient to walk around on 'tiptoes'. The ankle sags in a leg affected by mild plantarflexion weakness.</li>
<li>Rather than thinking solely about the myotomes supplying the relevant muscles, it is better simultaneously to be thinking, 'Is this the pattern of weakness one sees in upper motor neurone disorders (monoparesis, hemiparesis, paraparesis, tetraparesis); is this the weakness of a polyneuropathy (usually distal symmetrical weakness except in demyelinating polyneuropathies which give substantial proximal weakness as well); is the weakness best

explained by a nerve root lesion or lesions; is the weakness best explained by a lesion of an individual nerve or by a number of nerves or by a plexus lesion; is the pattern of weakness due to a muscle disorder (often proximal symmetrical weakness)?'</p>

<p>The anatomy of the cerebellum is complex; it receives afferents of virtually every kind and its efferents connect to virtually every part of the brain and spinal cord. Important afferents include those from the motor cortex, visual cortex, vestibular nuclei and spinal cord. Vestibular afferents connect to the flocculonodular lobe. Lesions here cause disequilibrium and gait ataxia. Spinocerebellar tracts go mainly to the vermis, in the midline of the cerebellum. Lesions here cause truncal and gait ataxia. Each cerebellar hemisphere receives a major input from the contralateral cerebral cortex via pontine nuclei and the middle cerebellar peduncles. The major output from the cerebellum is via the superior cerebellar peduncles. Fibres from the cerebellar</p>

<p>hemispheres cross to the contralateral red nucleus and thalamus, thence to spinal cord and basal ganglia and cerebral hemispheres. Thus, whereas cerebral cortex lesions affect contralateral limbs, cerebellar hemisphere lesions cause incoordination of ipsilateral limbs.</p>
<p>Incoordination, ataxia and tremor are the main effects of cerebellar lesions. Given the widespread afferent and efferent connections of the cerebellum, it is clear that lesions outside the cerebellum itself may have clinical manifestations which closely resemble those of cerebellar disease, and this needs to be borne in mind when examining patients. Thus, gait ataxia may be seen with cerebral, brainstem or spinal cord disorders, and tremor and ataxia can be manifestations of brainstem lesions.</p>

<p>A mild cerebellar lesion gives rise to no limb signs at rest, but movements of affected limbs may be accompanied by action tremor. Actions are clumsy and inaccurate. Coordination of the arm is tested by the finger-nose test. Hold up an index finger in front of the patient. Ask him to touch it with the tip of his index finger, then with the same finger to touch
his nose, and then ask him to carry on, touching alternately your finger and his nose. Some make the test a bit more difficult by moving the finger from place to place, but this adds little. More important is to make sure that the patient has to stretch a little to reach the finger, so that coordination is seen over the full range of movement of the arm. The observed action tremor is of fairly low tremor frequency, sometimes of quite large amplitude, and it becomes more marked in amplitude as the patient's finger approaches the target (his nose or your finger). This gives rise to the term 'intention tremor'.</p>
<p>In more severe cerebellar lesions, there will be postural as well as action tremor. In the extreme, the postural and action tremor are incapacitating. In such circumstances, the finger-nose test is inappropriate, being dangerous to the patient, whose finger might poke an eye or any other part of his face.</p>

<p>Ask the patient to tap his fingers rapidly on the back of his other hand.

Each tap should be on the same spot, not adjacent parts of the back of the hand.</p>
<p>Irregularity and clumsiness indicate an ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere disturbance. Dysdiadochokinesis is not very specific; impairment is also seen in pyramidal and extrapyramidal disorders as well.</p>

<p>This tests lower limb coordination. The patient lies on a couch or bed. Ask him first to lift one leg into the air; then to put the heel of that leg onto the shin of the other leg just below the knee and run the heel down the front of the shin onto the dorsum of the foot. Cerebellar dysfunction is revealed as tremor when the patient attempts to place his heel at the top of the shin, and as an inability accurately to run the heel down the shin.</p>
<p>In testing cerebellar function, allowance has to be made for any weakness, particularly spastic weakness which by itself causes a certain amount of incoordination. Furthermore, it is essential to test proprioception, because proprioceptive loss can give rise to signs which look just like cerebellar incoordination (sensory ataxia).</p>

<p>The tendon reflexes are monosynaptic stretch reflexes. Sudden stretching of a muscle by striking its tendon sends an impulse from muscle spindle afferents which synapse directly with motor neurones, leading to reflex contraction of that muscle. The tendon reflexes provide information about both the motor system and the sensory system. Abnormally brisk tendon reflexes contribute to the clinical picture of an upper motor neurone disorder. Absence of reflexes occurs in disorders of sensory afferents from muscle spindles, in a wide range of sensory polyneuropathies, radiculopathies and mononeuropathies. Motor neuropathies and eventually myopathies may entail areflexia, but areflexia more commonly reflects a sensory rather than a motor system disorder. The other important cause of widespread areflexia, which can cause considerable confusion, is a spinal cord lesion which is extensive up and down the cord. In this situation, interruption of afferents to motor neurones in the anterior horns, or damage to the motor neurones themselves, prevent the reflexes from occurring. Examples include syringomyelia, extensive myelitis, spinal cord infarction and extensive intramedullary spinal cord tumours.</p>
<p>Pathologically brisk reflexes below a particular myotome level raise the possibility of a spinal cord lesion between the lowest normal reflex level and the highest abnormal reflex level. Remember that a
focal spinal cord lesion will interrupt the pathway of any reflex at that level. Thus, the combination of loss of a reflex at a particular level and abnormally brisk reflexes subserved by levels below points strongly to a focal spinal cord lesion. One of the limitations of these analyses is the restricted number of reflexes that can be examined. The biceps reflex is at C5 or C6 level and there is no reflex that corresponds to C 4 or higher except for the jaw jerk. If all the reflexes are pathologically brisk but the jaw jerk is not, there may be a high cervical spinal cord lesion. Normal upper-limb power and reflexes and a spastic paraparesis with pathologically brisk lowerlimb reflexes may indicate a thoracic spinal cord lesion, but there are no tendon reflexes between C8 (finger reflexes) and adductor reflexes (L2 or L3) to localize the lesion more precisely.</p>

<p>Eliciting tendon reflexes is not completely straightforward and requires practice. The aim is to ensure that the tendon of the relevant muscle being tested is briskly and effectively struck. Accordingly, sufficient force must be delivered. For the biceps reflex, place your own finger over the tendon and strike your finger. Similarly the brachioradialis reflex can be elicited by applying the tendon hammer to your own fingers positioned just above the wrist on the lateral aspect of the radius bone. The other standard reflexes (triceps, knee (quadriceps) and ankle (gastrocnemii and soleus)) involve directly striking the tendon with the tendon hammer. The standard tendon reflexes examined are summarized in Table 14.8.</p>
<p>The range of briskness of normal reflexes is very variable both between and within individuals, so it is important not to jump to conclusions about the presence of upper motor neurone lesions or polyneuropathies just on the basis of reflexes alone. Normal individuals who have absent reflexes tested in the standard way will usually have reflexes if they are brought out by reinforcement. To reinforce lower limb reflexes, ask the patient to put his hands together with the fingers interlocked. Then get ready to elicit the reflex, ask the patient to squeeze with his hands and then directly test the reflex. Upper limb reflexes can also be reinforced. Ask the patient to squeeze firmly something held in the hand contralateral to the limb in which the reflexes are to be tested (e.g. the barrel of a standard ophthalmoscope).</p>

<p>The normal response to uncomfortable or painful cutaneous stimulation of the sole of the foot includes flexion of the toes. A remarkably reliable feature of an upper motor neurone lesion (anywhere in the spinal cord above L5 or in the brain), affecting the leg being tested, is the extensor plantar response. The minimum extensor response</p>

is extension of the great toe only. In addition there may be fanning of the other toes, and a very strong response in a paralysed patient comprises dorsiflexion of the ankle, flexion of the knee and flexion of the hip. If you are dealing with a patient who clearly has spasticity of the leg, a pyramidal distribution of weakness, pathologically brisk reflexes and ankle clonus, it hardly matters what the plantar response is. Occasionally, however, a patient has weakness without spasticity or hyperreflexia and the evidence that it is a CNS disorder hinges on the plantar reflex. Conversely, agitated individuals may have increased tone and very brisk reflexes but the plantar reflex responses reassure one that there is no neurological problem.</p>
<p>A patient with lower motor neurone paralysis of toe extension cannot have a conventional extensor response regardless of the severity of any upper motor neurone disorder he may also have. A small number of malingerers learn to produce extensor responses.</p>

<p>The ideal instrument to use is an orange stick (Fig. 14.13). Hold the patient's foot. Apply the orange stick to the sole of the foot on the lateral border just in front of the heel. Draw it forward towards the base of the fifth toe. This may suffice. Some continue round across the ball of the foot. It is best to press fairly firmly, warning the patient that this is not a pleasant test. Try to do the test effectively once or twice, not a large number of times. If you remain in doubt as to whether a patient's response is extensor or not, then later, when testing pinprick sensation, test the dorsum of the toe in question. Involuntary extension of the toe towards the pin is an extensor response.</p>

<p>Tremor by itself is a common reason for neurological referral. Tremor that has not hitherto been noticed by the patient or his doctors may contribute to neurological diagnosis. Getting a tremor diagnosis wrong is rarely serious, but giving patients incorrect diagnoses or prognoses is unsatisfactory and may lead to futile and inappropriate treatments, or deprive a patient of worthwhile treatment.</p>
<p>The common tremor disorders include enhanced physiological tremor, essential tremor, parkinsonian tremor, dystonic tremor, cerebellar ('intention') tremor, drug-induced tremor and psychogenic tremor (Table 14.9). Combinations of tremor and myoclonus are seen in encephalopathies, mainly in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>The classical tremor of Parkinson's disease (PD) is called a rest tremor (a slight contradiction in terms), and it is not always easy to diagnose. The patient's limb shakes when it is relaxed and doing nothing. Getting a patient into a position which allows his arms completely to relax in a chair may be difficult; beware you are not simply observing the postural tremor of a patient with essential tremor. In fact, you can quite often establish the presence of rest tremor as well from the history as from examination: 'When relaxed on a comfortable sofa watching television, does your arm start to shake?', 'Do any of your limbs shake when you are lying in bed?' Rest tremor may be observed in a relaxed patient sitting in a chair or lying on a couch. Furthermore, if a patient is walking and the fingers of one hand are shaking (and the arm is not swinging), it is likely to be the rest tremor of PD. PD tremor is seen most commonly in the fingers, wrist and forearm. It may also affect a foot. Classically, when a PD patient with upper limb rest tremor holds his hands out in front of him, his tremor stops for 10-20 seconds, whereafter a postural tremor may become evident. PD tremor is almost invariably asymmetric, starting in one limb and remaining more marked on that side throughout.</p>
<p>Essential tremor is not present at rest. It is noted with maintained postures and during movement. It mainly affects upper limbs. It is usually not markedly asymmetric. The action tremor may be examined during the finger-nose test and may also be assessed by tasks such as drawing a spiral, or a wavy line between two straight lines, or while writing, and these can be documented in case records.

<p>The cell bodies of primary sensory neurones are in dorsal root ganglia and equivalent ganglia on cranial nerves (particularly the trigeminal ganglion). Their peripheral axons convey sensory information from sensory end organs in skin, muscle spindles and tendons. Their central axons project into the spinal cord or brainstem. Large diameter myelinated axons transmit proprioception, vibration and touch. Small diameter myelinated and unmyelinated axons transmit pain and temperature. The centrally projecting axons for proprioception and vibration sense enter the spinal cord and turn immediately to head rostrally in the posterior (dorsal) columns ipsilaterally, to synapse in the gracile and cuneate nuclei at the cervicomedullary junction. Axons from these nuclei cross in the medulla and proceed to the thalamus. In contrast, axons for pain and temperature, having entered the spinal cord, synapse in the dorsal horns. The axons of second-order sensory neurones cross over to the contralateral anteriorly (ventrally) situated spinothalamic tracts and run rostrally all the way to the thalamus. Touch sensation travels by both routes. Sensory pathways from the trigeminal sensory nuclei cross in the brainstem to project to the contralateral thalamus. From the thalamus, third-order neurones project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the primary sensory cortex in the parietal lobe, which is somatotopically organized (Fig. 14.14), akin to the primary motor cortex.

<p>By the time sensation is examined, it may be apparent from the history and the clinical examination thus far what the diagnosis is and, consequently, what needs to be looked for during sensory testing. This is important because, in general, sensory testing needs to be goal directed; otherwise it tends to be fruitless or misleading. If a patient gives a very clear description of impaired sensation in the distribution of, for example, the ulnar nerve, diagnostically it makes little difference whether he can or cannot feel sharp pinpricks in the area of his symptoms. The symptoms still suggest an ulnar neuropathy either way. With very few exceptions (the corneal reflex would be one), all sensory tests are subjective - in other words, the examiner relies on what the patient reports. Patients with no sensory symptoms may have signs of impaired cutaneous sensation; in that situation, the examiner has to exercise judgement as to whether they are of significance.</p>
<p>Disorganized sensory testing tends to confuse both patient and examiner. With cutaneous sensory testing, the goal is to see whether any hypoaesthesia conforms to a meaningful pattern (see Table 14.13 and Figs 14.15 and 14.16). Defining an area of hypoaesthesia is almost invariably better achieved by starting testing within the area of hypoaesthesia and moving the stimulus out into areas where sensation is normally perceived.</p>
<p>One of the less satisfactory modalities of sensation to test is light touch. It is often done by dabbing the skin lightly with a piece of cotton wool, but there may be differences between touching the skin and stroking it. Tickle is a different modality; moving hairs on hairy skin is different again. In the context of spinal cord pathology, an abnormality of light touch sensation will not differentiate a posterior column lesion from one affecting the spinothalamic tracts. When testing light touch sensation, it can be helpful to ask the patient to close his eyes and then to report when he perceives the touches; some patients with anaesthesia will report that they feel touches when they see them being applied. Touch/ pressure can be somewhat more rigorously assessed using a 10 -gram monofilament to apply a standard quantity of pressure, and this can be useful as a screening test in situations where a patient is at risk of development of sensory peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetes).</p>
<p>Pinprick testing is more informative diagnostically and useful in mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies,</p>

<p>radiculopathies and spinal cord lesions as well as brainstem and cerebral hemisphere lesions. It is, however, totally subjective. The patient reports whether the pinprick has a sharp, slightly painful quality or whether it is merely felt as a blunt touch. Testing can be done with the patient looking. In some clinical situations, it is worth testing pinprick sensation even when a patient has no symptoms. A patient with a spastic monoparesis of one leg could have a brain or spinal cord lesion, but impaired pinprick sensation in the contralateral leg would strongly suggest a spinal cord lesion (Brown-Séquard lesion, see below). A patient with a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis or tetraparesis might have a degenerative disorder, but the finding of a clear-cut sensory level on the trunk or neck would strongly suggest a structural spinal cord lesion.</p>
<p>Perception of heat and cold can be tested but in routine clinical practice adds little. A patient with impaired thermal sensation caused by a cerebral or spinal cord disorder will have impaired pinprick sensation in the same distribution. Impaired thermal sensation in patients with small fibre polyneuropathies is best assessed in a neurophysiology laboratory.</p>

<p>Patients do not complain of impaired vibration sense, but its finding on examination is a useful sign of either a polyneuropathy or a spinal cord lesion. Vibration sensation is conveyed in large diameter sensory neurones, the central projections of which run in the posterior columns of the spinal cord.</p>

<p>Set a low-frequency tuning fork vibrating noiselessly by striking it against the heel of your hand. Then apply the base of the tuning fork to bony parts of the limbs and ask the patient to report whether he feels the vibrations. Start distally and work proximally if necessary. In the upper limb, start on a distal phalanx. If the patient has absence of vibration sense there, then test the wrist and, if necessary, the elbow. In the lower limb, test the distal phalanx of the big toe, and then the medial malleolus and top of the tibia, if necessary. If you suspect you are getting false positive answers from the patient, ask him to close his eyes and then randomly apply the tuning fork either vibrating or not vibrating to his limb; the patient reports whether it is or is not vibrating.</p>

<p>Impaired proprioception occurs in large fibre sensory (or sensory and motor) polyneuropathies, spinal cord lesions affecting the posterior columns and in
lesions at higher levels including lesions of the sensory cortex. Proprioceptive loss is the basis of sensory ataxia. Patients with polyneuropathies which cause severe proprioceptive loss have gait and limb ataxia which looks very like cerebellar ataxia. There are several clinical tests or signs which address proprioception: joint position sense (more strictly joint movement sense), pseudoathetosis and Romberg's test.</p>

<p>Joint position testing does require the patient to look away or have his eyes closed. With the thumb and index finger of one hand, hold each side of the middle phalanx of the patient's middle finger. With your other hand, grasp the sides of the distal phalanx. Explain to the patient that he is to say which way his finger moves, and that it will only go up or down and that the movements up or down will be random. Move the distal phalanx either up or down through a small angle - the patient should be able to perceive as small a movement as you will be able to make. Make sure each movement is random, not just up, down, up, down, etc. If the patient fails to understand the test or to concentrate, do it first with him looking at the joint being tested. If joint position sense is impaired at the distal interphalangeal joint, move more proximally to the metacarpophalangeal joint and, if necessary, to the wrist or elbow, employing bigger angles of movement. The same applies in the foot and leg: start with the interphalangeal joint of the big toe and, if necessary, the ankle or knee. The normal threshold for perception of joint movement in the toe is larger than in the finger.</p>

<p>Patients with impaired joint position sense in their fingers may exhibit so-called pseudoathetosis: outstretched fingers drift up or down or to the side when the patient has his eyes closed. This is because, proprioception having failed, vision is the only means by which the patient knows where his fingers are and can keep them in one place (Fig. 14.17).</p>

<p>Ask the patient to stand with his feet side by side. Having established that his balance is satisfactory with his eyes open, ask him to close his eyes, having reassured him that nothing untoward will happen. If he loses balance with his eyes closed, the test is positive. You need to be prepared to catch the patient if he shows signs of toppling. Sometimes this kind of proprioceptive loss is evident in the clinical history - the patient comments on loss of balance in the dark, or when he closes his eyes to wash his face.</p>

<p>Cerebral hemisphere lesions may disrupt sensory afferents or the primary sensory cortex in such a way as to give rise to very straightforward sensory loss affecting the usually tested modalities. In the same way that occipital lesions may give rise either to visual loss or to disorders of visual interpretation, parietal lesions can cause sensory impairment without anaesthesia. One such disorder is sensory inattention which is akin to visual inattention. A patient may feel sensory stimuli in limbs on the affected side, so does not have a hemianaesthesia, but sensory stimuli presented simultaneously on both sides are registered by the patient only on the normal side.</p>
<p>In tactile agnosia, a patient has no difficulty naming an item shown to him, but with his eyes closed and the item put into his hand, he is unable to work out by its size, consistency and texture what it is. Similarly a patient may be unable to distinguish different very familiar coins by feel alone. Dysgraphaesthesia is another form of cortical sensory impairment. Use an orange stick or a pen with the cap on. Write numbers on the patient's palm, clarifying with him which way up they are going to be. With eyes open, the patient will cope with <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>3</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>6</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2,3,6,1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8389em; vertical-align: -0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">6</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span></span>, etc., but will not recognize the numbers with his eyes closed.</p>

<p>In the outpatient setting, a patient's gait will inevitably be observed, although it may well be desirable to inspect it in some detail, perhaps by taking him out into a corridor. In hospitalized patients, it is easy to neglect to test gait if the patient is encountered in his bed. Mobility is so fundamental that gait must be considered and assessed in every appropriate patient and does not take long to do.</p>
<p>First, simply observe the patient standing. Look for abnormalities of posture. Established PD gives a kyphotic posture (Fig. 14.18). Neck extension weakness causes forward flexion of the neck; in extreme</p>

<p>cases, a state of drop head is apparent. Axial dystonia may be observed. Muscular dystrophy may be associated with hyperlordosis. Check the patient's balance and do Romberg's test (see above). Then ask the patient to walk a short distance, turn round and walk back again. Mild gait ataxia can be brought out by getting the patient to walk heel to toe. If relevant, test for retropulsion (the pull test; see p. 312).</p>

have a gait disorder which looks deceptively like a myopathic gait. Finally, as in other domains, a functional gait disorder does not necessarily mean that there is no organic disease.</p>

<p>Formulating the nature of the neurological problem and its localisation on the basis of the signs requires a combination of basic anatomical knowledge and pattern recognition. It is important to be able to recognize the limitations of information the physical</p>
<p>signs convey in terms of localization. A patient with gait ataxia and extensor plantar reflexes, and no other signs, could have a lesion in the thoracic or cervical spinal cord or in the cerebellum with early brainstem compression, or it could be a diffuse cerebral process such as small vessel cerebrovascular disease or hydrocephalus. It may also be that two different lesions account for the two manifestations. Conversely, dysfunction affecting several different systems does not necessarily imply a multifocal disorder: diplopia, nystagmus, dysarthria, ataxia, upper motor neurone signs in the limbs, widespread sensory loss and impairment of bladder control might be caused by multiple sclerosis, but a single brainstem lesion could equally account for all of the symptoms and signs.</p>
<p>In the following section, patterns of motor signs and patterns of sensory signs are outlined separately - and, of course, the examiner encounters them sequentially, but for many syndromes it is the characteristic combination of motor and sensory features that allows accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>Diagnosing lesions of individual motor or motor and sensory peripheral nerves requires knowledge of which muscles are supplied by which nerve; the same considerations apply to nerve root lesions. Plexus lesions can be difficult, particularly if patchy and multifocal, but can sometimes be diagnosed confidently on clinical grounds simply from the anatomy. For example, a patient with a combination of what appears to be a radial nerve lesion and an axillary nerve lesion will have a lesion affecting the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.</p>
<p>Distal symmetrical weakness in the limbs would be typical for a generalized motor polyneuropathy. The same pattern can be seen in distal myopathies and some spinal muscular atrophies (hereditary motor neuronopathies), neither being common.</p>
<p>Demyelinating polyneuropathies (Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) being the most important) give rise to proximal as well as distal weakness, short nerves being as susceptible to conduction block as long ones. Hence, the presentation of GBS may be with exclusively 'proximal' and life-threatening weakness of muscles of swallowing and breathing.</p>
<p>Mainly proximal, symmetrical limb weakness should prompt consideration of myopathy, particularly polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and muscle disease secondary to metabolic or drug-induced disorders such as steroid myopathy, thyrotoxic myopathy and osteomalacic myopathy. Test getting out of a chair or rising from a crouch. The different muscular dystrophies tend to have particular patterns of muscle involvement which may help diagnostically.</p>
<p>Patients who have weakness and no sensory symptoms or signs and no upper motor neurone signs usually have muscle disorders or neuromuscular junction disorders, (such as myasthenia gravis (MG), Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome or botulism). Typically, MG affects the eyelids, eye muscles, face, jaw, muscles of swallowing and breathing and axial and proximal limb muscles, but atypical cases occur.</p>

<p>The lesion may be in the spinal cord or brain. Weakness affects the flexor muscles more than extensor muscles; hence the abnormal findings are of weakness in hip flexion (iliopsoas), knee flexion (hamstrings) and ankle dorsiflexion (tibialis anterior). Spasticity usually predominates in the hip adductors and the extensor muscles of the leg and foot (gluteus maximus, quadriceps and calf muscles). These circumstances account for the characteristics of the hemiparetic and paraparetic gait (see Table 14.11).</p>

<p>Here the typical pattern is almost the opposite of that in the leg: weakness mainly affects deltoid and the extensors of the arm and hand - elbow extension (triceps), wrist extensors and finger extensors. Spasticity is mainly in the flexors (biceps and brachialis, wrist flexors and finger flexors) and in forearm pronators. Thus, the typical posture of the arm in an ambulant patient with a hemiparesis is adduction at the shoulder, flexion at the elbow, pronation of the forearm and flexion of the wrist and fingers.</p>
<p>The distribution of weakness in upper motor neurone lesions of the limbs is often referred to as 'pyramidal', a useful but not completely accurate term. Table 14.12 summarizes where in the CNS lesions need to be to produce the various categories of upper motor neurone lesions.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of lesions of individual sensory peripheral nerves or the sensory component of mixed nerves requires knowledge of anatomy, in this case the area of cutaneous sensation mediated by the nerve in question (see Table 14.13 and Figs 14.15 and 14.16). In lesions affecting mixed nerves, sensory symptoms with or without signs commonly precede motor symptoms and signs. Thus, a clear description by a patient of sensory loss in ulnar nerve distribution provides compelling evidence for an ulnar neuropathy even if there are no signs. The right combination of motor and sensory signs allows the diagnosis of a mononeuropathy to be made. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography may contribute to the assessment of the nature of the</p>

<p>Familiarity with the areas of cutaneous sensation mediated by nerve roots (dermatomes - see Figs 14.15 and 14.16) is important for two reasons. First, it enables lesions of individual nerve roots to be diagnosed. Second, the level of a spinal cord lesion can be ascertained to some extent (see below).</p>
<p>Distal cutaneous sensory loss (touch; pinprick) in all four limbs, often in a 'glove and stocking' distribution, usually indicates a sensory polyneuropathy. Vibration sense and joint position sense may also be affected, and loss of reflexes, particularly the ankle reflexes, provides strong clinical support for a diagnosis of sensory polyneuropathy. Cervical spinal cord lesions sometimes produce quite widespread sensory symptoms in both hands which might make one think of peripheral nerve pathology, but the motor signs in the legs and possibly autonomic manifestations (sexual dysfunction, impaired bladder and bowel control) ought to clarify the situation. However, rarely, cervical spinal cord lesions can also give rise to distal lower limb sensory symptoms which can be misleading.</p>

<p>The characteristic sensory disturbance associated with compression of the cauda equina or spinal cord is one of loss of all modalities of sensation below the level of the compression. If the compression is of the cauda equina (e.g. a big central posterior intervertebral disc prolapse), all nerve roots below and possibly at the level of the lesion will be affected, including the buttocks and perineum. A severe spinal cord lesion (often compression, but any process which functionally transects the cord at one site) will result in a sensory level on the trunk (abdomen and back, or chest, including the arms if the lesion is between C5 and T1 spinal cord level) or on the neck. Knowledge of the anatomy of the dermatomes allows the spinal cord level (not the same as the spinal column level) to be determined. In spinal cord lesions of mild to moderate severity, the sensory level (which is less dense than in severe lesions) is some distance below the spinal cord level of the lesion. As the lesion evolves, the patient develops progressively worse sensory symptoms, first perceived at a level well below that of the lesion but which then extend up towards the level of the lesion. This process may not have been completed at the time the patient is evaluated and can sometimes lead to the wrong part of the spinal cord being imaged.</p>

<p>This syndrome refers to the signs resulting from a focal lesion affecting the right or left half of the spinal cord, such as an intramedullary inflammatory or an extramedullary compressive lesion. Disruption of the descending corticospinal tract on the affected side results in an ipsilateral upper motor neurone disorder below the level of the lesion (commonly in one leg but a high cervical lesion would affect the arm as well). Involvement of the posterior columns on the affected side results in ipsilateral loss of vibration sense and joint position sense in the leg or arm and leg below the lesion. The spinothalamic tracts on the side of the lesion are affected, but sensory input into the spinothalamic tracts comes from pain and temperature afferents on the opposite side which cross over on entering the spinal cord, so loss of pinprick and temperature sensation occurs below the level of the lesion on the opposite side (Fig. 14.19). Some patients with mild lesions comment that while it is one leg which drags and feels weak and stiff, it is the other leg which has impaired sensation.</p>

<p>A syrinx is a pathological tube-shaped cavity in the spinal cord, usually cervical and extending down into the thoracic area. It expands the spinal cord, but ascending and descending long tracts are unimpaired except in extreme cases. Anterior horn cells are damaged, leading to the motor manifestations of wasting and weakness of muscles in the arms and hands. Tendon reflex pathways are affected leading to upper limb reflex loss. There may be abnormalities of autonomic control of blood vessels and sweating in affected limbs. Most remarkable, however, are the patterns of sensory impairment. The classical findings are described by two adjectives: the sensory loss is dissociated; and a sensory level is found which is suspended. Dissociated sensory loss denotes loss of pain and temperature sensation with preservation of vibration and proprioception. The central cord lesion interrupts the sensory afferents which cross the middle of the spinal cord from dorsal roots on one side to spinothalamic tracts on the other side. Sensory afferents proceeding directly from dorsal roots into posterior columns are unaffected. Spinothalamic afferents which have already crossed below the lower limit of the lesion are also unaffected. This dictates that the loss of pinprick sensation will have an upper level corresponding approximately to the top of the syrinx, but there will also be a lower level, usually on the trunk, so the sensory loss is suspended by comparison with the situation in lesions affecting the spinothalamic tracts themselves (such as complete transverse cord

<p>A major component of the arterial supply to much of the cord, particularly the thoracic spinal cord, comes from the anterior spinal artery, which receives its main blood supply via the artery of Adamkiewitz from the thoracic aorta. Spinal cord infarction is uncommon; when it occurs, it is usually the thoracic cord which is affected. Occlusion of the artery of Adamkiewitz may be atherosclerotic, arteritic or consequent upon dissection of the aorta. The result is infarction of the anterior (ventral) half of the spinal cord, over a variable length. The corticospinal tracts are involved bilaterally, resulting in abrupt-onset paraplegia. The major autonomic</p>
<p>manifestations are loss of bladder and bowel control. The spinothalamic tracts are affected on both sides of the cord. Thus, there is dense loss of pinprick sensation with a sensory level on the trunk. The striking feature, in a numb paraplegic individual, is preservation of sensation mediated by the posterior columns - intact vibration and joint position sense in the toes and feet.</p>

<p>In the midbrain, pons and medulla, so many nuclei and nerve tracts are found in such restricted anatomical confines that inevitably the clinical manifestations resulting from small lesions in different parts vary substantially. Considering sensation in isolation, a lesion of the lateral medulla on one side may affect the spinothalamic tract on that side conveying pain sensation from the contralateral side of the body and, at the same time, affect the spinal tract and nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, which mediates pain on the ipsilateral side of the face.</p>

<p>A lesion affecting the sensory afferent pathways rostral to the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the pons (i.e. in the midbrain, diencephalon, thalamus or internal capsule) will result in a hemianaesthesia: loss of sensation on the whole of one side of the body including the head and face. A large lesion, such as a middle cerebral artery territory ischaemic stroke affecting the whole of the primary sensory cortex, will have the same effect. Smaller lesions in sensory cortex will affect sensation (all modalities) in only part of one side of the body.</p>

<p>There is a risk in neurological examination that cognition may be neglected. It is a useful simplification to divide domains of cognition into those which are distributed and those which are localized. The anatomical substrates of distributed cognitive functions are bilateral and widespread in the brain. An implication is that a single focal neurological lesion will have little perceptible impact on that function. In contrast, a focal lesion in a particular place will have a major effect on a localized cognitive function.</p>
<p>The two major syndromes of cognitive impairment, which may be accompanied by no neurological signs, are dementia and delirium. They are covered in Chapter 6. In this section, emphasis is placed on cognitive deficits which, to some extent, have localizing value and which may be seen in
patients with focal cerebral lesions as well as those with more generalized neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Memory is a distributed cognitive function. Dense amnesia requires bilateral hemisphere lesions, but those lesions may be very focal - bilateral thalamic infarction, or damage to the mamillothalamic tracts in Wernicke's encephalopathy, can cause devastating amnesia - and the anatomy of memory in each hemisphere is localized and well defined. Furthermore, unilateral lesions, such as a posterior cerebral artery occlusion causing temporal lobe infarction, do have discernible effects on memory. Normal episodic memory (memory of events which have been personally experienced) depends on integrity of the hippocampi and entorhinal cortex in the temporal lobes, the fornices, the thalami and the mamillary bodies. Anterior temporal lobes subserve semantic memory (memory for facts, learning and general knowledge). Verbal memory is dependent on the left temporal lobe, visual memory on the right temporal lobe. Some important causes of amnesia are listed in Table 14.14. Amnesia emerges mainly from the history taken from an informant rather than from the patient. Episodic memory may be assessed by testing recall of a name and address that the patient has registered; and by testing the patient's recall of events from his past, both recent and distant.</p>

<p>Dysphasia or aphasia is an acquired disorder of language function. The auditory processing of language involves the superior temporal gyri bilaterally. The meaning of words requires the dominant temporal lobe. The planning of speech production occurs in the dominant frontal lobe (including Broca's area in the inferior frontal lobe). The motor control of speech production depends on the sensorimotor cortex bilaterally. In routine practice, four major parameters of language can be used to assess dysphasia: fluency, comprehension, repetition and naming skills. Naming skills are affected in all forms of dysphasia. Dominant frontal lobe lesions are likely to give rise to a non-fluent dysphasia characterized by effortful speech and a poverty of language but with comprehension intact, while lesions in Wernicke's area (posterior superior dominant temporal lobe) result in impairment of comprehension but with fluent speech that conveys rather little meaning. Global aphasia occurs as a result of large dominant hemisphere lesions of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobe. Dysphasia is often associated with dyslexia and dysgraphia.

<p>This term refers to an inability to do things in spite of having intact motor and sensory systems. Dressing apraxia, an inability to put on items of clothing, particularly jackets and gowns, is seen in patients with non-dominant parietal lesions. Visuospatial disabilities and neglect contribute to this form of apraxia. Constructional apraxia likewise reflects impaired visuospatial function. The main form of motor apraxia (ideomotor apraxia) manifests as
difficulty using instruments and tools (toothbrush, scissors, etc.) in spite of knowing what the device in question is. Other manifestations of ideomotor apraxia include inability to carry out actions such as waving goodbye or saluting, and inability to mime actions (e.g. using a comb to comb one's hair, hammering a nail) and to copy finger and hand positions demonstrated by the examiner. This form of apraxia usually occurs in dominant parietal lesions. An apraxic individual may be unable to make a cup of tea, but agnosia (see below) might give rise to the same inability. Furthermore, a test for apraxia which requires a sequence of actions probes comprehension, memory and executive skills as well as praxis. Patients with dominant inferior frontal lobe lesions may have apraxia affecting the use of lips, tongue and mouth, often in association with a non-fluent dysphasia. Gait apraxia is covered elsewhere.</p>

<p>Agnosia is a failure of recognition. A simple classification is by the sensory modality affected: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory. There is overlap between tactile agnosia and cortical sensory loss. Visual agnosia (potentially the most devastating) reflect visuoperceptual impairment due to occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal lesions which are often bilateral and may be associated with a visual field defect but basic visual function in the preserved field is intact. A patient with visual agnosia may not recognize a watch until it is put into his hand but would answer correctly the question 'What do you wear on your wrist and use to tell the time?' Prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize familiar faces (though parts of the face are correctly identified, and the patient may be able to match correctly two different photographs of the face he cannot recognize). Bilateral occipitotemporal lesions underlie prosopagnosia.</p>

<p>A lesion in either hemisphere may lead to a form of neglect affecting the opposite side, but neglect is much more commonly seen when the lesion is in the right cerebral hemisphere, affecting the left side. Usually the lesion is large such as a stroke. Different forms of neglect may have different localizations. Parietal lobe involvement is often prominent. A patient with neglect of personal space may pay no attention to the affected side of the body, in the extreme even denying that the affected side belongs to him. Denial of a hemiplegia is anosagnosia; unconcern about a hemiplegia is anosodiaphoria. Neglect of extrapersonal space leads to failure to eat the food off one side of a plate, failure to complete one side of a drawing, failure to read the left side of a text, even failure to write the first part of a word. Sensory and visual inattention are forms of neglect.</p>

<p>Having taken a history and undertaken a neurological and relevant general medical examination, it is important to decide where the likely lesion(s) is and, ideally, its likely nature (e.g. vascular inflammatory, degenerative, neoplastic). This can often seem bewildering for students and doctors in training. In addition to those points made above regarding the identification of muscle disorders, neuromuscular junction disorders, mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies, radiculopathies and spinal cord disorders, the following are some helpful principles regarding brainstem, cerebellar and cerebral hemisphere lesions.</p>
<p>If a patient has a hemiparesis and a hemianaesthesia on the same side, the lesion has to be above the decussation of the corticospinal tracts in the medulla. The lesion is most likely to be in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere but could also be in the brainstem.</p>
<p>The range of possible manifestations of brainstem lesions is extensive, but a good general rule is that a cranial nerve lesion (III, V, VI, VII, VIII, X or XII) on one side and long tract signs on the other side of the body indicates a brainstem lesion. The long tract signs may be motor, sensory or both. A brainstem lesion has to be considered if there are bilateral long tract signs and the lesion is above neck level. Nystagmus and long tract signs indicate a brainstem lesion. Vertical gaze paresis of acute onset and internuclear ophthalmoparesis are indicators of midbrain and pontine lesions, respectively. Extensive brainstem lesions affecting the reticular formation will cause coma. A basilar artery thrombosis may spare the dorsal brainstem such that consciousness is preserved but the devastating consequence is the locked-in syndrome.</p>
<p>Cerebellar lesions should be suspected with combinations of gait ataxia, limb ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Ataxia by itself is rather non-localizing, being a feature of polyneuropathy and spinal cord, cerebellar, brainstem and cerebral hemisphere disease. Remember that anyone who is vertiginous will be ataxic until the vertigo settles, so ataxia in combination with vertigo may be due to a peripheral vestibular rather than a neurological disorder. Cerebellar mass lesions readily compress the brainstem which complicates the signs and, moreover, brainstem compression readily causes hydrocephalus.</p>
<p>Common manifestations in large unilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions include contralateral hemianopia, horizontal gaze paresis, hemiparesis and hemianaesthesia together with cognitive impairment (dysphasia in dominant hemisphere lesions; neglect and visuospatial problems in non-dominant). A frontal lobe lesion affecting prefrontal structures may give rise to behavioural and cognitive deficits only. Anterior cerebral artery territory ischaemic strokes cause spastic paresis in the contralateral leg. Middle cerebral artery territory ischaemic strokes cause all of the features of large unilateral hemisphere lesions. The hemiparesis is maximal in the face and arm. Posterior cerebral artery territory ischaemic strokes cause hemianopia because of occipital lobe infarction and cognitive deficits due to involvement of the temporal lobe.</p>
<p>The clinical manifestations of hydrocephalus depend on how acutely it develops. Acute hydrocephalus causes headache, papilloedema, drowsiness and coma. In the setting of established hydrocephalus, acute exacerbations cause hydrocephalic attacks, which may manifest with abrupt headache, paralysis,</p>
<p>drop attacks and coma. In some cases, however, hydrocephalus occurs with hardly any raised pressure at all. In such cases, the manifestations are cognitive impairment, ataxia, urinary incontinence, upgaze paresis and extensor plantar reflexes. Hydrocephalus is a common cause of bilateral long tract (corticospinal tract) signs of cerebral origin. The other is diffuse or multifocal bilateral white matter disease, which may be ischaemic or inflammatory. Large supratentorial mass lesions ultimately cause bilateral long tract signs, pupillary changes and impending coma due to brain herniation.</p>

<p>A discussion about which patients with headache should be imaged is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a number of points are worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migraine, tension-type headaches, medication overuse headaches and post-traumatic headaches can be diagnosed with a high degree of accuracy without scans.</li>
<li>Normal scans undoubtedly reassure worried patients with headaches, but incidental abnormalities found on scans risk perpetuating worry.</li>
<li>Normal scans do not cure headaches (though a proportion of patients who know their scan is normal do not attend their follow-up appointment).</li>
<li>Patients with serious intracranial disorders rarely just have headache.</li>
<li>Occasionally migraine really is 'symptomatic', i.e. caused by a structural intracranial disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) remains a good investigation for headache in the emergency setting, to image large tumours, particularly supratentorial tumours, abscesses, brain swelling, hydrocephalus and haemorrhage, particularly subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, the radiation dose is the equivalent of 200 chest X-rays so, if available, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferable, especially in an elective setting.</p>

<p>The investigation of choice for late-onset epilepsy is an MRI head scan; the information required is whether there is an identifiable structural cause for
the epilepsy. Electroencephalography (EEG) in this situation is less useful. In the paediatric/adolescent age group, imaging is usually normal but the EEG may well be informative (see below).</p>

<p>Imaging is central to the investigation of stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.

<p>Electrodes applied to the patient's scalp pick up small changes of electrical potential which, after amplification, are recorded on paper or displayed on</p>
<p>a video monitor and recorded electronically. The main use of EEG is in diagnosing the nature of the epilepsy in young patients (particularly in distinguishing generalized from focal epilepsies), but it has significant limitations since, in the majority of cases, what is recorded is an interictal EEG which may or may not show diagnostically useful abnormalities. EEG is a poor test in individuals who have undiagnosed attacks of symptoms which might be epilepsy. Video telemetry is invaluable in clarifying whether attacks are epileptic or non-epileptic, the main limitation being that the attack frequency has to be high enough to make it likely that attacks will be recorded.</p>
<p>EEG may be a useful investigation in encephalopathic states where the clinical picture may be one of delirium. Here, EEG can identify non-convulsive status epilepticus, or point to a diagnosis of encephalitis as opposed to a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.

<p>Sensory nerve conduction studies (NCS) are achieved by stimulating electrically a purely sensory nerve percutaneously and recording, usually by surface electrodes, the resulting sensory action potentials (SAPs) in the relevant nerve either more proximally or distally. The SAP amplitude and conduction velocity are measured. Motor NCS require stimulation of a motor or mixed nerve, recording the resulting motor action potentials from a muscle supplied by the nerve, again usually with surface electrodes. Stimulation of the nerve at two different sites allows calculation of the conduction velocity between the two sites. Electromyography (EMG) entails recording electrical activity generated by muscle fibres and motor units (groups of muscle fibres supplied by a single motor neurone) at rest and during contraction, using a needle electrode inserted into the muscle. Different abnormalities of EMG arise in denervation, disorders of neuromuscular transmission and disorders of muscle itself. NCS contribute to the diagnosis of many but not all entrapment. It has to be anatomically possible to stimulate and record from the nerve proximal to the entrapment site. In patients with clear physical signs, NCSs are not needed to make the correct clinical diagnosis, but may help in the assessment of severity and prognosis. Every patient who is going to have surgical decompression of an entrapped peripheral nerve should have a NCS. NCS are invaluable in confirming the suspected diagnosis of nerve entrapment when there are no definite signs, a common circumstance in carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>NCS and EMG may contribute to the assessment of plexopathies and radiculopathies though, in the
latter, the combination of careful clinical evaluation and imaging should suffice. NCS and EMG help to confirm a diagnosis of polyneuropathy, and provide information about the nature of polyneuropathies (axonal, demyelinating, multifocal, small fibre). NCS and EMG are helpful in suspected disorders of neuromuscular junctions. EMG helps in the diagnosis of myopathy and is an important test for patients with undiagnosed weakness.</p>

<p>CSF is usually obtained by lumbar puncture (LP), which is uncomfortable, invasive and attended by a number of potential complications, the most common one being post-lumbar puncture headache. There is a risk of death from brain herniation when LP is undertaken in a patient with raised intracranial pressure due to a mass lesion or obstructive hydrocephalus. Papilloedema, any grade of impaired level of consciousness or any focal neurological signs mandate brain imaging before consideration of LP and it is contraindicated in patients with mass lesions and obstructive hydrocephalus. However, it is an essential investigation in patients with papilloedema due to suspected raised intracranial pressure who have a normal good quality MRI, to pursue the possibility of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and to exclude low-grade chronic meningitis, as well as to treat the raised pressure. Pressure measurement as well as CSF analysis will be required.</p>

<p>The single circumstance in which LP is an emergency investigation is CNS infection, particularly meningitis. There is controversy as to whether CSF examination in meningitis is really necessary, or at least whether the risk is worth taking. In adult neurology, the consensus remains that CSF should be obtained if possible but that, in cases of suspected pyogenic bacterial meningitis, there must be no delay in starting antibiotic treatment pending cranial imaging. Thus, if there is no contraindication to LP, it should be performed expeditiously immediately after clinical assessment and obtaining blood cultures to provide a microbiological diagnosis. If cranial imaging is necessary, treatment should start directly after clinical assessment and blood cultures. CSF obtained after the relevant imaging has indicated that LP is expected to be safe may still be diagnostic even some hours after treatment has started.</p>
<p>CSF examination is important, sometimes critical, in diagnosis of all forms of infective meningitis: bacterial, tuberculous, yeast, fungal and viral. The key parameters are the white cell count, the types of white cells (polymorphonuclear neutrophil white cells, lymphocytes), the CSF glucose concentration (low in bacterial meningitis) which must be</p>
<p>compared with a simultaneous blood glucose concentration, microscopy for microorganisms (Gram stain, tuberculosis stain, India ink preparation for cryptococci), DNA analysis for viral and bacterial DNA (using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques) and appropriate microbiological culture. The CSF protein concentration is of some importance and the CSF lactate concentration may be helpful.</p>
<p>CSF analysis is also urgent in encephalitis, which will be treated as herpes simplex encephalitis until CSF PCR tests for herpes simplex virus have proved negative. CSF examination in myelitis will follow imaging.</p>
<p>In all other situations, CSF examination is not so urgent, even if it is still essential.</p>

<p>In suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage with cranial imaging that does not show evidence of blood in the subarachnoid space, CSF must be examined. It is important to wait until 12 hours after the suspected bleed, so that red blood cells will have lysed and haemoglobin will have undergone metabolism to oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin, which can be detected by spectroscopy, or seen with the naked eye as xanthochromia. Failure to allow time for xanthochromia to develop makes it impossible to distinguish a traumatic CSF tap from bloodstained CSF due to subarachnoid haemorrhage.</p>

<p>CSF lymphocytosis is usually a feature of conditions such as CNS vasculitis, neurosarcoidosis, Behçet's disease and sometimes systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
<p>With regard to multiple sclerosis (MS), if the clinical features and MRI appearances are typical
(particularly in a young patient), CSF examination may not be necessary. It remains important if scans do not fulfil diagnostic criteria or if there is ambiguity as to whether scan lesions are inflammatory or ischaemic, or reflect some other pathology. CSF protein electrophoresis to detect oligoclonal IgG immunoglobulins is the most sensitive test to provide evidence of chronic inflammatory CNS demyelination. Occasionally in suspected MS results of CSF examination are incompatible with a diagnosis of MS, because of either a very high cell count or a very high protein concentration, mandating a revision of the diagnosis.</p>

<p>A high CSF protein concentration without a high cell count is the characteristic of GBS, but this takes time to develop so will not be found if the CSF is examined early in the course of the condition. Every patient with GBS should have CSF looked at in order to make sure that the patient does not have a rapidly progressive polyradiculopathy due to diffuse neoplastic leptomeningeal infiltration. Accordingly, when the LP is done, care should be taken to order cytology as well as a cell count, blood and CSF glucose concentration, protein concentration and, if appropriate, culture.</p>

<p>In the human body, the skin is the largest organ. Forming a major interface between man and his environment, it covers an area of approximately 2 m and weighs about 4 kg . The structure of human skin is complex (Figs 15.1 and 15.2), consisting of a number of layers and tissue components with many important functions (Box 15.1). Reactions may occur in any of the components of human skin and their clinical manifestations reflect, among other factors, the skin level in which they occur and sometimes act as a 'window' of systemic changes elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>The accurate diagnosis of most skin lesions requires an adequate history, careful examination of the patient and, occasionally, laboratory investigation, but dermatology is predominantly a visual speciality.</p>

<p>Detailed information should be sought concerning the present skin condition. This should include the site of onset, mode of spread and duration of the disorder. Any personal history or family history of skin disease, including skin cancer and atopy (an allergic skin reaction becoming apparent more or less immediately on contact), is important. Previous medical conditions should be noted and a full drug history obtained, including use of over-the-counter and other preparations. The social and occupational history and, in some circumstances, details of recent travel, environmental exposure, especially sunshine and artificial ultraviolet light, and sexual activity are often important.</p>

<p>Before inspecting any rash or lesion, note the colour of the skin. Normal skin colour varies, depending on lifestyle and light exposure as well as constitutional and ethnic factors.</p>
<p>Pallor can have many causes. It may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>temporary, due to shock, haemorrhage or intense emotion</li>
<li>persistent, due to anaemia or peripheral vasoconstriction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vasoconstriction is seen in patients with severe atopy - an inherited susceptibility to asthma, eczema and hay fever. Pallor is a feature of anaemia, but not all pale persons are anaemic; conjunctival and mucosal colour is a better indication of anaemia than skin colour. A pale skin resulting from diminished pigment occurs with hypopituitarism and hypogonadism.</p>
<p>Normal skin contains varying amounts of brown melanin pigment. Brown pigmentation due to deposited haemosiderin is always pathological. Albinism is an inherited generalized absence of pigment in the skin; a localized form is known as piebaldism. Patches of white and darkly pigmented skin (vitiligo) (Fig. 15.3) are due to a local and complete absence of melanocytes. Several autoimmune endocrine disorders are associated with vitiligo.</p>
<p>Abnormal redness of the skin (erythema) is seen after overheating, extreme exertion, sunburn and in febrile, exanthematous and inflammatory skin disease. Flushing is a striking redness, usually of the face and neck, which may be transient or persistent. Local redness may be due to telangiectasia, especially on the face. Cyanosis is a blue or purple-blue tint due to the presence of excessive reduced haemoglobin, either locally, as in impaired peripheral circulation, or generally, when oxygenation of the blood is defective. The skin colour in methaemoglobinaemia is more leaden than in ordinary cyanosis;</p>

<p>Increased pigmentation may be racial, due to sunburn or connected with various diseases. In Addison's disease, there is a brown or dark-brown pigmentation affecting exposed parts and parts not normally pigmented, such as the axillae and the palmar creases; the lips and mouth may exhibit dark bluish-black areas. Note, however, that mucosal pigmentation is a normal finding in a substantial proportion of black patients.</p>
<p>More or less generalized pigmentation may also be seen in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haemochromatosis, in which the skin has a peculiar greyish-bronze colour with a metallic sheen, due to excessive melanin and iron pigment.</li>
<li>Chronic arsenic poisoning, in which the skin is finely dappled affecting covered more than exposed parts.</li>
<li>Argyria, in which the deposition of silver in the skin produces a diffuse slate-grey hue.</li>
<li>The cachexia of advanced malignant disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>In pregnancy, there may be pigmentation of the nipples and areolae, of the linea alba and sometimes a mask-like pigmentation of the face (chloasma). Chloasma may also be induced by oral contraceptives containing oestrogen. A similar condition, melasma, may be seen in Asian and Afro-Carribean males.</p>
<p>Localized pigmentation may be seen in pellagra and in scars of various kinds, particularly those due to X-irradiation therapy. Venous hypertension in the legs is often associated with chronic purpura, leading to haemosiderin pigmentation. The mixture of punctate and fresh purpura and haemosiderin

<p>Assessment of morphology requires visual and tactile examination. Do not be afraid to feel the lesions. You will rarely be exposed to any infection risk, with the exception of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. If these infections are suspected, it is wise to wear disposable plastic gloves when examining open or bleeding cutaneous lesions. Begin with palpation of the skin. Pass the hand gently over it, pinching it up between the forefinger and thumb, and note the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it smooth or rough, thin or thick?</li>
<li>Is it dry or moist?</li>
<li>Is there any visible sweating, either general or local?
The elasticity of the skin should be investigated. If a fold of healthy skin is pinched up, it immediately flattens itself out again when released. Sometimes, however, it only does so very slowly, remaining creased for a considerable time. This is found frequently in healthy old people but may be an important sign of dehydration, for example after severe vomiting and diarrhoea, or in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.</li>

<p>When oedema is present, firm pressure on the skin with a finger produces a shallow pit that persists for some time. In some cases, especially when the oedema is of very longstanding, pitting is not found. The best place to look for slight degrees of oedema in cardiac disease is behind the malleoli at the ankles in patients who are ambulant, and over the sacrum in those who are confined to bed. The finger pressure should be maintained for 20-30 seconds, or slight degrees of oedema will be overlooked. Pitting is minimal or absent in oedema due to lymphatic obstruction, where the skin is usually thickened and tough.</p>

Swelling of the eyelids is an important sign. Without redness and scaling, bilateral periorbital oedema may indicate acute nephritis, nephrosis or trichinosis. If there is irritation, contact dermatitis is the probable diagnosis. Dermatomyositis often produces swelling and heliotrope-coloured erythema of the eyelids without scaling of the skin. In Hansen's disease (leprosy), the skin lesions may be depigmented or reddened, with a slightly raised edge; they are also anaesthetic to pinprick testing (Fig. 15.7) and mainly located in skin that is normally cooler than core body temperature.</li>

<p>Hair colour and texture are racial characteristics that are genetically determined. The yellow-brown Mongol race has black straight hair, negroid people have black curly hair and white Caucasians have fair, brown, red or black hair. Secondary sexual hair begins to appear at puberty and has characteristic male and female patterns. Androgenic male pattern baldness is genetically determined but requires adequate levels of circulating androgens for its expression. It occurs in women only in old age.</p>

<p>Unlike other epithelial mitotic activity that is continuous throughout life, the growth of hair is cyclic (Fig. 15.8), the hair follicle going through alternating phases of growth (anagen) and rest (telogen). Anagen in the scalp lasts 3-5 years; telogen is much shorter, at about 3 months. Catogen is the conversion stage from active to resting and usually lasts a few days. The duration of the anagen phase determines the length to which hair in different body areas can grow. On the scalp, there are on average about 100000 hairs. The normal scalp may shed as many as 100 hairs every day as a normal consequence of growth cycling. These proportions can be estimated by looking at plucked hairs (trichogram): the 'root' of a telogen hair is non-pigmented and visible as a white, club-like swelling.

<p>Any inflammatory or destructive disease of the scalp skin may destroy hair follicles in its wake. Thus, burns, heavy X-ray irradiation or herpes zoster infection in the first division of the trigeminal nerve may cause scarring and alopecia. Alopecia in the presence of normal scalp skin may be patchy and localized, as in traction alopecia in nervous children, ringworm infections (tinea capitis) or autoimmune alopecia areata. Secondary syphilis is a rare cause of a patchy alopecia with a 'moth-eaten' appearance.</p>
<p>Scalp hair loss at the temples and crown, with the growth of male-type body hair, is characteristic of women with virilizing disorders. Metabolic causes of diffuse hair loss in women include hypothyroidism and severe iron deficiency anaemia. Antimitotic drugs may affect the growing hair follicles, producing a diffuse loss of anagen hairs, which are pigmented throughout their length. Dramatic metabolic upsets, such as childbirth, starvation and severe toxic illnesses, may precipitate follicles into the resting</p>

<p>Thimble pitting of the nails is characteristic of psoriasis (Fig. 15.13), but eczema and alopecia areata may also produce pitting. A severe illness may temporarily arrest nail growth; when growth starts again, transverse ridges develop. These are called Beau's lines and can be used to date the time of onset of an illness.

<p>Disturbance of the nail bed may produce thick nails (pachyonychia) or separation of the nail from the bed (onycholysis). This occurs in psoriasis, but may be idiopathic. Long-term tetracyclines may induce separation when the fingers are exposed to strong sunlight (photo-onycholysis). The nail may be destroyed in severe lichen planus (Fig. 15.14) or epidermolysis bullosa (a genetic abnormality in which the skin blisters in response to minor trauma). Nails are missing in the inherited nail-patella syndrome. Splinter haemorrhages under the nails may result from trauma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other 'collagen vascular' diseases, bacterial endocarditis and trichinosis.</p>

<p>In iron-deficiency states, the fingernails and toenails become soft, thin, brittle and spoon-shaped. They lose their normal transverse convex curvature, becoming flattened or concave (koilonychia). The 'half and half nail', with a white proximal and red or brown distal half, is seen in some patients with chronic renal failure. Whitening of the nail plates may be related to hypoalbuminaemia, as in cirrhosis of the liver (leukonychia). Some drugs, notably antimalarials, antibiotics and phenothiazines, may discolour the nail. Nail-fold telangiectasia or erythema is a useful physical sign in dermatomyositis (Fig. 15.15), systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In dermatomyositis, the cuticle becomes ragged. In systemic sclerosis, loss of finger pulps may lead to curvature of the nail plates. An impaired peripheral circulation, as in Raynaud's phenomenon, can lead to thinning and longitudinal ridging of the

<p>This is probably caused by hypervascularity and the opening of anastomotic channels in the nail bed. Rarely, clubbing may be congenital.

Café au lait type macules, sometimes multiple, are a common sign of neurofibromatosis (NF). Another valuable sign in von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis is bilateral freckling of the axillary skin. The characteristic soft neurofibromata may be solitary or a few, or hundreds may be scattered over the body.

<p>Several of the so-called collagen vascular diseases show characteristic cutaneous eruptions. Systemic lupus erythematosus, seen in women between puberty and the menopause, may show a symmetrical 'butterfly' erythema of the nose and cheeks. In discoid lupus, the cutaneous lesion is localized (Fig. 15.18). In polyarteritis nodosa, reticular livedo of the limbs with purpura, vasculitic papules and ulceration occurs. In scleroderma (systemic sclerosis), acrosclerosis of the fingertips with scarring, ulceration and calcinosis follows a Raynaud's phenomenon of increasing severity. Dermatomyositis often presents with a heliotrope-coloured discoloration and oedema of the eyelids, and with fixed erythema over the dorsa of the knuckles and fingers (see Fig. 15.15) and over the bony points of the shoulders, elbows and legs. There is usually weakness of the proximal limb muscles.

<p>Acanthosis nigricans is a brownish velvety thickening of the axillae, groins and sides of the neck. Sometimes there is thickening of the palms and soles, and warty excrescences may develop on the skin, eyelids and oral mucosa. In the middle-aged, acanthosis nigricans is strongly associated with internal malignancy, but benign minor forms are seen in obese young women, especially in Arab people, and in children with endocrinopathies characterized by insulin resistance. Patchy depigmented macules which are hypoanaesthetic and associated with enlargement of the peripheral nerves are a feature of certain types of leprosy (Hansen's disease).</p>
<p>Generalized, severe persistent pruritus in the absence of obvious skin disease may be due to systemic disease (Box 15.7). However, in older people with dry skin, it is common and of no systemic significance. Diabetes mellitus has a number of skin manifestations: of these, pruritus vulvae, pruritus ani, balanoposthitis and angular stomatitis are due to Candida overgrowth. Boils, follicular pustules or ecthyma are staphylococcal. Impetigo and erysipelas, streptococcal infections, are uncommon (Fig. 15.19). Eruptive xanthomata are a rare feature of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (Fig. 15.20) produces reddish-brown plaques, usually on the shins, with central atrophy of the skin. It has to be distinguished from peritibial myxoedema (which is hypertrophic, not atrophic), the dermatoliposclerosis of chronic venous disease in the legs and the epidermal hypertrophy of chronic lymphatic obstruction.</p>
<p>Neuropathic ('perforating') ulcers are found on pressure points of the heel, ball of foot or toes and are characteristically painless. Arteriopathic ulceration resulting from large vessel disease is seen on the foot, and due to small vessel disease on the calves. Spider naevi consist of a central arteriole feeding a cluster of surrounding vessels. Many young people have up to seven naevi on the face, shoulders or arms. In older age groups, pregnancy, the administration of oestrogens (as in oral contraceptives) and liver disease may cause multiple lesions. Pregnancy and liver disease may also produce a blotchy

Erythema nodosum is a condition in which tender, painful, red nodules appear, typically on the shins. They fade slowly over several weeks, leaving bruising, but never ulcerate. Sarcoidosis and drug sensitivity are the commonest causes, but other systemic disorders should be considered (Box 15.8).
Xanthomata are yellow or orange papules or nodules in the skin caused by dermal aggregations of lipid-loaded cells. Different patterns of hyperlipoproteinaemia may induce varying patterns of xanthomatosis. Thus, the type la (hypercholesterolaemia) pattern typically causes tuberous xanthomata on the extensor aspects of the knees and elbows and on the buttocks, sometimes associated with tendon xanthomata. Widespread eruptive xanthomata are more characteristic of hypertriglyceridaemia. White deposits of lipid (arcus senilis) in the cornea may have a similar explanation but may be a normal feature in those over 60. Flat lipid deposits around the eyes (xanthelasma) may be due to hyperlipidaemia, but are also seen in the middle-aged and elderly without any general metabolic upset.
Carotenaemia produces an orange-yellow colour to the skin, especially of the palms and soles. It occurs in those who eat great quantities of carrots and other vegetables, in hypothyroidism, in diabetic patients and also in those taking <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8889em; vertical-align: -0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span>-carotene for the treatment of porphyria.</li>

<p>Aggregations of extravasated red blood cells in the skin cause purpura (Fig. 15.21). Purpura may be punctate, from capillary haemorrhage or may form larger macules, depending on the extent of haemorrhage and the size of vessels involved. Palpable pupura should raise suspicion of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The Hess test for capillary fragility involves deliberately inducing punctate purpura on the forearm by inflating a cuff above the elbow at 100 mmHg for 3 minutes. Sensitivity to drugs such as aspirin may cause widespread 'capillaritis'.
The term ecchymosis implies a bruise, usually with cutaneous and subcutaneous haemorrhage

causing a palpable lump. A frank fluctuant collection of blood is a haematoma. Unlike erythema and telangiectasia, purpura cannot be blanched by pressure. It must not be confused with senile haemangioma (cherry angioma or Campbell de Morgan spot), which is common in later life on the trunk and has no pathological significance. Haemorrhage into the thick epidermis of the palm or sole due to trauma (e.g. 'jogger's heel') may induce brown or almost black macules that take weeks to disappear, inviting confusion with melanoma.</p>

<p>The skin is involved in various sexually transmitted diseases. The primary chancre of syphilis may occur on the genitalia of either sex, at or near the anus, on the lip or, rarely, elsewhere. The rash of secondary syphilis is brownish-red, maculopapular and is one of the few rashes involving the palms and soles. It does not itch. Other manifestations of the secondary stage are condylomata lata around the anogenital area, snailtrack ulceration and 'mucous patches' in the mouth. There may be low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
Septicaemia is a rare complication of gonorrhoea that occurs particularly in pregnant women presenting with pustular skin lesions. Recurrent type II herpes simplex is common on the penis; it occurs less often on the buttocks, where relapses may be heralded by a radiating neuralgia. Genital viral warts are common in both sexes. They are particularly important in females because there is evidence that</p>

<p>Several of the most common viral infections and illnesses of childhood are characterized by fever and a distinctive rash (exanthem), including measles, varicella and rubella. In measles, upper respiratory symptoms are quickly followed by a characteristic maculopapular and erythematous rash. In rubella (German measles), the rash is more transient, with small papules, and associated with occipital lymphadenopathy and only slight malaise. The exanthem of varicella (chickenpox) is papulovesicular and centripetal, and there may be lesions in the mouth. In herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections (Fig. 15.23), there is a non-follicular papulovesicular rash in which the vesicles are planted in an inflamed base. The rash is painful. In herpes zoster, the rash follows a segmental distribution, in the skin of a dermatome. The vesicular lesion becomes encrusted (Fig. 15.24) and, later, secondary infection may occur.</p>
<p>Other less common viral infections associated with a rash include erythema infectiosum, due to a parvovirus, in which the exanthem on the face gives a 'slapped-cheek' appearance, and roseola infantum, a disease of toddlers which mimics rubella.</p>

<p>Drugs that may sensitize the skin to sunlight (phototoxic reaction) include tetracyclines, sulphonamides and nalidixic acid. Acne-like rashes may follow high-dose prednisolone therapy, and are common with phenytoin therapy. Certain cytotoxic drugs and sodium valproate cause hair loss. Both erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme may be induced by sulphonamides, including co-trimoxazole. Laboratory tests are of little value in the diagnosis of drug eruptions. Careful history taking and knowledge of the common patterns of drug reactions usually allow accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>Exposure to the sun may, after many years, result in the development of many common skin tumours, for example squamous or basal cell carcinoma, or melanoma. These tumours are especially common in fair-skinned people. Basal cell carcinoma arises especially on the face, near the nose or on the forehead (Fig. 15.25). The lesion may be ulcerated with a firm, rounded edge, or papular. Melanomas may develop on the torso in men, and legs in females. They may be pigmented or amelanotic, and may in a third or so develop rapidly in a pre-existing benign mole (Fig. 15.26). Staging by assessing draining regional sentinel lymph nodes is becoming increasingly routine in cutaneous oncology. Seborrhoeic keratoses are familial resulting in a raised warty pigmented lesion found in the sun-exposed elderly, especially on the dorsa of hands as 'liver spots' (Fig. 15.27).

From their position on the hairs, one can judge roughly the duration of the condition, as they are fixed at first near the root of the hair and are carried up as the hair grows, so the higher the nits are, the longer the pediculi have been present. P. corporis should be looked for in the seams of the clothes, especially where the clothes come into contact with the skin, for example over the shoulders. The bites of the parasite produce haemorrhagic spots, each with a dark centre and a paler areola. Marks of scratching should be looked for on parts accessible to the patient's nails. P. pubis is venereally acquired and causes intense pubic itching. The nits are laid on the pubic hair and the lice themselves are easily visible. P. corporis is seen only in the grossly deprived, in those living rough and in conditions of war and social upheaval. In contrast, P. capitis is common in school children, however clean they and their families may be, and is endemic in many schools.</p>

<p>Fungus may grow in the skin, nails or hair and can cause disease (ringworm or tinea), for example athlete's foot (tinea pedis).</p>
<p>The skin between the toes (tinea pedis), the soles of the feet and the groin (tinea cruris) are the commonest sites of fungal infection. The lesions may be scaly or vesicular, tending to spread in a ring form with central healing (Fig. 15.28); macerated, dead, white, offensive-smelling epithelium is found in the intertriginous areas, such as the toe clefts.</p>
<p>Nail discoloration, deformity, hypertrophy and abnormal brittleness may result from fungus infection (tinea ungium).

<p>Biopsy of the skin is used not only for the excision of benign and malignant tumours but also to identify the nature of reactive and/or inflammatory lesions. Punch biopsy (Figs 15.31 and 15.32) is popular because of its convenience and results in minimal scarring. The biopsy can be studied by conventional histology, often supplemented by immunofluorescence, and sometimes immunohistochemistry or molecular biology, to identify specific proteins or genetic abnormalities. Skin biopsy of fresh tissue can be sent for the microbiology of unusual infections and is increasingly used in diagnosis and in assessing the progress of skin diseases.</p>

<p>Excessive thirst (polydipsia) and increased urine output (polyuria) are the most important presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus; these are discussed in detail in Chapter 17. Polydipsia and polyuria may also be due to impairment of renal concentrating capacity as a result of a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (cranial diabetes insipidus) or a failure of antidiuretic hormone action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). The latter may be inherited or may occur secondary to impairment of antidiuretic hormone action by hypercalcaemia or hypokalaemia. Sometimes, apparent polydipsia and polyuria may be due to increased fluid intake, which at its most extreme
may be vastly excessive (psychogenic polydipsia). The distinction between psychogenic polydipsia and diabetes insipidus is important. Generally, nocturnal polyuria is not a feature of psychogenic polydipsia, but this is not an absolute distinction and further investigation of urine concentrating capacity is usually required.</p>

<p>Loss of weight is a feature of decreased food intake or increased metabolic rate. Sometimes both factors may operate to reduce body weight, as in the cachexia of malignant disease. Thyroid overactivity (hyperthyroidism) is nearly always associated with a combination of weight loss and increased appetite, although occasionally the latter may be stimulated more than the former so that there is a paradoxical increase in weight. Weight loss is rarely the sole presenting symptom of hyperthyroidism and other clinical features often predominate, particularly in younger patients (Box 16.1). In the elderly, however, hyperthyroidism may be occult or may simulate the gradual weight loss of malignant disease. Cardiac arrhythmias are a frequent feature in the elderly. Anorexia nervosa, a psychogenic disorder characterized by a long history of low body weight in the absence of other features of ill health, must be considered, especially in young women. Any form of weight loss may be associated with amenorrhoea.</p>
<p>Other endocrine conditions in which weight loss is a major feature are listed in Box 16.2. Weight loss associated with diabetes mellitus is discussed in Chapter 17.</p>

<p>An increase in body weight (Box 16.3) is a predictable result of a reduction in metabolic rate. Weight gain is therefore a common feature of primary hypothyroidism.

patients, 'simple obesity' is due to a longstanding imbalance between energy intake and expenditure; it frequently begins in childhood and is often present in more than one family member.

<p>An abnormal sensation of cold, out of proportion to that experienced by other individuals, may indicate underlying hypothyroidism (Boxes 16.5 and 16.6). This symptom differs from the localized vasomotor symptoms in the hands found in Raynaud's phenomenon and is rather non-specific, especially in the elderly.</p>

<p>The increased metabolic rate of thyrotoxicosis may be associated with heat intolerance in which, at its most extreme, the patient is comfortable at an ambient temperature that others find unpleasantly cold. This is an important symptom, highly specific for thyroid overactivity, which may partly explain some of the seasonal variation in presentation of the condition.</p>

<p>Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) may be a constitutional abnormality, characterized by onset in childhood or adolescence and, sometimes, by a family history. A recent increase in sweat secretion, on the other hand, may be an early indication of thyroid overactivity. Paroxysmal sweating is a common feature of anxiety. Increased catecholamine secretion from a phaeochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla is a rare cause of hyperhidrosis. Intermittent sweating after meals (gustatory hyperhidrosis) may occur in patients with autonomic dysfunction. Growth hormone excess (acromegaly) also increases sweating, perhaps because of hypertrophy of the sweat glands, and this feature can be used to assess the activity of the disease in the clinic. Increased sweating should be distinguished from flushing that occurs physiologically at the time of the natural menopause. Flushing may be a presenting feature of serotonin-secreting carcinoid tumours of the gut and usually indicates extensive disease with hepatic metastases.</p>

<p>A fine rapid resting tremor is one of the cardinal clinical features of thyrotoxicosis. This must be distinguished from the coarser and more irregular tremor of anxiety, which is usually associated with a cool peripheral skin temperature, in contrast to the warm skin of the thyrotoxic patient. Tremor due to neurological disease is greater in amplitude, slower in rate, and may be present at rest, as in Parkinson's disease, or on movement, as in cerebellar tremor. It therefore rarely simulates thyrotoxic tremor. Essential tremor is not so rapid as thyrotoxic tremor, is variable and is worse in certain postures. It often involves the head and neck.</p>

<p>Palpitations are a heightened, unpleasant awareness of the heart beat. They may be a feature of thyrotoxicosis, but are more likely to be due to anxiety. Awareness of the heartbeat while lying down is normal. Other causes of rapid heart rate include paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias. The sensation of intermittent forceful cardiac contraction, sometimes described by the patient as a missed beat, is often due to a compensatory pause following an ectopic beat, and is usually a normal phenomenon.</p>

<p>Dizziness, or a sensation of faintness on standing, should prompt measurement of lying and standing blood pressure. Postural hypotension, a fall of diastolic blood pressure on standing, occurs with reduced blood volume. In the absence of obvious bleeding or gastrointestinal fluid loss, adrenal insufficiency should be considered. Postural hypotension is frequently due to autonomic neuropathy, especially in longstanding diabetes mellitus. It is also a common complication of any drug therapy for essential hypertension. The drug history is particularly important in the elderly patient with dizziness.</p>

<p>Several endocrine conditions may cause visual symptoms. Decreased visual acuity may be due to spaceoccupying lesions compressing the optic nerve. For example, severe dysthyroid eye disease and orbital or retro-orbital tumours may present in this way. Bitemporal hemianopia (bilateral loss of part or all of the temporal fields of vision), often asymmetrical or incongruous, is a major feature of suprasellar extension of pituitary adenomas compressing the optic chiasm, but may occur in other tumours in this location. Double vision (diplopia) on lateral or upward gaze often results from medial or lateral rectus muscle tethering in dysthyroid eye disease. Apparent magnification of vision (macropsia) can occur in hypoglycaemia.</p>

<p>Tachycardia, sweating and tremor occurring intermittently, especially when fasting, are suggestive of hypoglycaemia. These symptoms resemble those associated with the increased sympathetic drive found in states of fear or with excess secretion of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), as in phaeochromocytoma. In severe persistent hypoglycaemia, these symptoms may progress to decreased consciousness. This is a serious emergency implying neuroglycopenia sufficient to impair brain function. Spontaneous or fasting hypoglycaemia can be due to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autonomous insulin production due to an insulinoma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without thyroxine and growth hormone deficiency (e.g. primary adrenal failure or hypopituitarism).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inappropriate insulin or excessive sulphonylurea drug administration in a diabetic patient.</p>

<p>Intermittent cramp and 'pins and needles' (paraesthesiae), especially if bilateral, can be due to a decreased level of circulating ionized calcium. This may occur in hypoparathyroidism or be associated with a fall in the ionized component of serum calcium, owing to an increased extracellular pH (alkalosis). The latter may occur with any alkalosis, but is particularly well recognized in hyperventilatory states (respiratory alkalosis) and hypokalaemia (metabolic alkalosis). Refractory cramping symptoms after correction of hypocalcaemia can be due to an associated hypomagnesaemia. However, the differential diagnosis of paraesthesiae in the hands includes median nerve compression at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), a syndrome that is usually accompanied by typical sensory and motor disturbance suggestive of a lesion in the median nerve (see Ch. 14).</p>

<p>Superficial discomfort in the neck may lead to the incidental finding of thyroid enlargement. Modest degrees of thyroid enlargement are very common, whereas pain arising from the thyroid is comparatively unusual. The most common cause of local discomfort and tenderness in the neck is inflammatory lymphadenopathy. Severe tenderness of the thyroid itself, especially when accompanied by fever and signs of thyrotoxicosis, suggests a diagnosis of viral subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's thyroiditis). Occasionally, autoimmune thyroiditis may give rise to pain and tenderness, which mimics a viral thyroiditis but is less severe. The sudden onset of localized pain and swelling in the thyroid is indicative of bleeding into a pre-existing thyroid nodule and is a recognized complication of multinodular goitre. The symptoms are self-limiting. Painless enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre) presents either with pressure effects, resulting in dysphagia progressing to tracheal compression and stridor, or cosmetic disturbance. The underlying cause of thyroid enlargement is often difficult to establish. The family history and subsequent investigation may point to autoimmune thyroiditis or dyshormonogenesis. A history of rapid enlargement of the gland, especially in an elderly patient, suggests an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Coexisting severe diarrhoea points towards a diagnosis of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. In the differential diagnosis, goitrogenic drugs, for example lithium, should be considered, as should residence in an iodine-deficient area. Previous exposure to neck irradiation or to radioactive iodine in childhood may also be important.</p>

<p>Reduced erectile potency may be a consequence of primary abnormalities, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreased blood supply to the penis (e.g. atherosclerosis).</li>
<li>Neural dysfunction (e.g. autonomic neuropathy complicating diabetes).</li>
<li>Testosterone deficiency (e.g. hypopituitarism and primary testicular failure).</li>

<p>It is often difficult to distinguish with certainty between impotence due to organic factors and that which is psychological, although total erectile failure and the absence of nocturnal and morning erections suggest a physical cause. Impotence in a diabetic patient should not be assumed to be inevitably due to autonomic neuropathy, and other causes should be considered. Most importantly, it should be recognized that male impotence is often complicated by a psychological disturbance, which may serve to exacerbate the problem.</p>

<p>The term amenorrhoea describes absence of menstrual periods (menses). Perhaps the most common cause of failure of onset of menses (primary amenorrhoea) is physiological delay of puberty, a diagnosis that can only be made with certainty in retrospect. Important pathological causes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction (e.g. due to tumours)</li>
<li>ovarian failure (e.g. failure of normal ovarian development or cytotoxic chemotherapy)</li>
<li>thyroid dysfunction</li>

</ul>
<p>Important diagnostic pointers in the history include symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease, or any visual disability that might indicate compression of the optic chiasm by a hypothalamic or pituitary tumour. Secondary amenorrhoea (cessation of
previously established menses) has similar causes. In addition, marked weight loss may lead to amenorrhoea, as in anorexia nervosa or inflammatory bowel disease. Amenorrhoea, or oligomenorrhoea (infrequent scanty periods), may occur in women subject to excessively rigorous physical training programmes.

<p>Occasionally, physiological lactation may persist after breastfeeding has ceased. Inappropriate lactation is usually bilateral. There are a number of causes, which include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prolactin-secreting tumours of the pituitary gland.</li>
<li>Idiopathic galactorrhoea, in which there is an apparent increased sensitivity to normal levels of serum prolactin.</li>

<li>Hyperprolactinaemia due to dopamine antagonist drugs.</li>
<li>Hyperprolactinaemia due to lactotroph disinhibiting lesions of the hypothalamopituitary region.
Inappropriate secretion of breast milk should therefore always prompt enquiry for symptoms referable to the thyroid and pituitary glands, and a thorough drug history should be taken. Even with very high prolactin levels, galactorrhoea is rare in men.</li>

<li>androgen-secreting ovarian or adrenal tumours.
The history is vital in the clinical assessment. If the symptoms commenced shortly after the menarche, then a tumour source of androgen is unlikely. A regular menstrual cycle is good evidence against severe androgen excess but does not exclude polycystic ovary syndrome. Increased libido suggests substantially increased androgen secretion, which may be either ovarian or neoplastic in origin.</li>

<p>Pallor often occurs in primary testicular failure and in panhypopituitarism. Excessive pigmentation occurs in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)dependent Cushing's syndrome, and increased sebum production causing greasy skin and acne on the face and shoulders may occur in all causes of glucocorticoid excess. In carcinoid tumours of the gut or lung, increased humoral secretion results in a violaceous cyanosis-like skin discoloration. A variegate, patchy rash is a feature of porphyria, an inherited abnormality of haem metabolism. In primary hypoadrenalism, there is increased pigmentation of the conjunctival membrane beneath the eyelids and of the inside of the mouth, the axillae and the palmar skin creases. In hypothyroidism, the skin appears dry, pale, sallow or even slightly yellow, scalp hair is coarse and lateral eyebrow hair is thinned. In hyperthyroidism, the skin is dry and hot, but often not flushed. In hypocalcaemia, the nails are friable. In uraemia, the skin is pale, or yellow and slightly pigmented, and in terminal uraemia, a 'uraemic frost' may appear on the skin.</p>

<p>This should begin with observing the general appearance of the patient. Start by assessing the state of nutrition and by measuring weight and height. Calculate the body mass index (BMI). The distribution of fat should be noted. Deposition of fat in the intraabdominal, thyrocervical and interscapular regions with relative sparing of the limbs (truncal obesity) is characteristic of Cushing's syndrome and is accompanied by a typical moon-faced plethoric appearance (Fig. 16.1) owing to a combination of increased subcutaneous fat and thinning of the skin.</p>
<p>Patients with growth hormone hypersecretion, resulting from somatotroph pituitary adenomas, also demonstrate a classic facial appearance with increased fullness and coarsening of soft tissues, including the lips and tongue which, in patients with longstanding disease, may be accompanied by overgrowth of the zygoma, orbital ridges and mandible (prognathism) (Fig. 16.2). Acromegaly in young people occurring before epiphyseal fusion causes abnormally tall stature (gigantism). Increased adiposity in a child who is growing poorly suggests the possibility of growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism or, rarely, Cushing's syndrome. Simple

obesity is associated with normal or increased linear growth velocity.
The skeletal proportions should be noted: a longlimbed appearance may indicate delayed epiphyseal fusion due to hypogonadism (eunuchoidism) or the connective tissue abnormality Marfan's syndrome. A eunuchoid body habitus is confirmed by

<p>The cytogenetic disorder, Turner syndrome (karyotype 45XO), which is characterized by gonadal dysgenesis and the variable presence of other visceral abnormalities, has a typical phenotypic appearance, including short stature, failure of secondary sexual development, decreased or absent secondary sexual hair, an increase in the normal angulation between the humerus and the lower arm, a low posterior hairline and an exaggerated fold of skin between the neck and shoulder. It is most important that accurate wall-mounted stadiometers be used in the assessment of normal growth and its possible disorders.</p>
<p>The hands should be carefully examined for evidence of finger clubbing which, among other things, may be a rare manifestation of thyrotoxic Graves' disease (thyroid acropachy). Palmar erythema may also be found in thyrotoxicosis of any cause, as well as in patients with chronic liver disease or rheumatoid arthritis, and in pregnancy.</p>

Localized thickening of the dermis due to mucopolysaccharide and inflammatory cell deposition, particularly on the anterior aspects of the legs when it is known as pretibial myxoedema, is one of the classic but relatively rare extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease.</p>
<p>In females, dermatological examination should also include attention to any abnormality of hair distribution, either excess hair growth in an androgen-dependent distribution (hirsutism) or hair loss in a male pattern, both of which may indicate increased circulating androgen and should prompt examination for evidence of virilization (see below).

<p>The anatomical landmarks relevant to inspection and palpation of the thyroid are shown in Figure 16.8. Immediately inferior to the thyroid cartilage (with its superior notch) is the cricoid cartilage, with the thyroid isthmus lying just below in the midline. The right and left lobes of the thyroid curve posterolaterally round the trachea and oesophagus and are partially covered by the sternomastoid muscles. The</p>

attachment of the thyroid to the pretracheal fascia dictates that it moves superiorly on swallowing; absence of this movement raises the possibility of an infiltrative thyroid carcinoma. Remember that the right lobe is slightly larger than the left; hence, diffuse thyroid enlargement, as in Graves' disease, is often apparently asymmetrical. There are several
methods for examining the thyroid, but a suggested routine is as follows.</p>
<p>With the patient's neck slightly extended, inspect the area below the cricoid cartilage. Ask him to take a sip of water, extend the neck again and swallow. Watch for the superior movement of the gland, carefully noting its contour and any asymmetry.</p>

<p>Figure 16.8, cont'd (D) diffuse enlargement; (E) multinodular gotre; (F) single nodule.</p>
<p>Thyroid palpation is best carried out from behind, with the patient's neck slightly extended, but not so much that the neck musculature is tightened. This may feel awkward initially, but with time and practice it will become more comfortable. Have a glass of water available throughout the examination, so the patient may take repeated sips and swallow as necessary. Position both hands to encircle the neck (Fig. 16.8A), with the fingers slightly flexed, such that the tips of the index fingers lie just below the cricoid in order to palpate the isthmus. Now rotate
the fingers down and slightly laterally in order to feel the lateral lobes, including the inferior border (Fig. 16.8B). The anterior surface of each lobe should be no larger than the terminal phalanx of the patient's thumb.</p>
<p>The following points should be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the thyroid diffusely enlarged, as in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-mediated or autoimmune enlargement (Fig. 16.8D)? If so, is it soft (e.g. dyshormogenesis, diffuse goitre of puberty) or firm/hard (e.g. autoimmune</li>

thyroiditis). In general, the firmer the texture of an enlarged thyroid, the more likely is the pathology to be autoimmune.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there two or more identifiable nodules (Fig. 16.8E, Fig. 16.9) and, if so, is the patient thyrotoxic and does the gland extend downward behind the sternum? (If the gland is partially or completely retrosternal, the inferior border may not be palpable, or palpable only on swallowing.) Most multinodular goitres are benign, but a history of neck irradiation, enlarged cervical lymph nodes or progressive enlargement of one of the nodules raises the suspicion of malignancy.</li>
<li>Is the palpable abnormality a single focal nodule (Fig. 16.8F), suggesting a cyst, adenoma or carcinoma? Rapid growth, hard texture, lack of movement on swallowing (see above), enlarged regional lymphadenopathy, male gender and a history of neck irradiation all increase the probability of malignancy.</li>
<li>Is the goitre firm and asymmetrical?</li>
<li>Are there features of local pressure effects or local infiltration (e.g. dysphonia from recurrent laryngeal involvement)?</li>
<li>Is there weight loss and debility? These suggest anaplastic carcinoma or lymphoma.</li>
<li>Is there a bruit, indicating increased blood supply? This is frequently found in untreated Graves' disease, but should not be confused with a transmitted bruit from the carotid.</li>

<p>A detailed description of growth and pubertal development is beyond the scope of this chapter. In brief, however, in the average adolescent female, pubertal development usually commences between the ages of 10 and 11 and takes 3 to 4 years to complete. A growth spurt starts about 1 year before breast development, peak height velocity is reached on average 1 year later, and menarche follows in an average of 1 year. In males, pubertal development usually commences between the ages of 11 and 12, takes approximately 3 years to complete and has a characteristic sequence of adrenarche (onset of adrenal androgen secretion with appearance of secondary sexual hair), testicular development, beginning of pubic hair, beginning of growth spurt and peak height velocity.
The breasts should be examined for mass lesions and, if suggested by the history, for galactorrhoea. In the adolescent female, physiological breast enlargement provides a precise index of pubertal status and signals the onset of the pubertal growth spurt (Tanner stage 3 breast development). Onset of menses (menarche) is a relatively late pubertal event at which point pubertal breast development is virtually complete. In males, any tendency to gynaecomastia should be noted (Fig. 16.10). This may range from minor degrees of subareolar glandular enlargement to substantial breast prominence; breast enlargement associated with generalized adiposity should not be confused with true gynaecomastia.</p>

<p>Figure 16.11 Prader orchidometer. (A) Testicular volume (in ml) may be estimated by comparison with calibrated ellipsoids. (B) Gently grip the testis in one hand and compare its volume (including the scrotal skin, but excluding the epididymis) with that of the ellipsoids. The patient shown has a reduced testicular volume of 8 ml , due to Klinefelter's syndrome; the normal secondary sexual hair is due to the provision of exogenous testosterone.</p>
<p>Genital examination in the male should document testicular volume. This is particularly important in the assessment of pubertal development, for which volume should be measured by comparison with calibrated ovoids (Prader orchidometer; Fig. 16.11). Prepubertal testicular volume is less than 4 ml ; increased volume implies pubertal gonadotrophin stimulation. Onset of the pubertal growth spurt in boys is associated with a testicular volume of 10 ml and normal adult testicular volume is in the range of 15 to 25 ml . In the assessment of normal puberty, it is important to establish that growth velocity and gonadal changes (testicular volume or breast stage) are concordant, since a discordance of puberty proceeding ahead of growth implies an abnormal source of sex steroid (e.g. androgen-secreting tumours or congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Testicular atrophy in the adult male indicates hypogonadism, due either to primary testicular failure, hypothalamopituitary dysfunction or chronic liver disease. Tumours

of Leydig cells are usually palpable and should be sought in any patient with gynaecomastia.</p>
<p>Examination of the external genitalia in the female is important when androgen hypersecretion is suspected. Enlargement of the clitoris is a feature of excess androgen secretion.</p>
<p>Ambiguity of the external genitalia is indicative of fetal androgen excess in the karyotypic female and of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone deficiency or resistance in the male; these conditions are rare and require specialized investigation.</p>

<p>The hypercalcaemic patient should be carefully examined for corneal calcification, evident as a narrow band on the medial or lateral border of the cornea (Fig. 16.12); this usually indicates longstanding hypercalcaemia and a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.</p>
<p>In patients with thyroid disease, the presence of exophthalmos (proptosis) should be noted. This may be unilateral or bilateral, and may be associated with apparent ophthalmoplegia due to tethering of the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial and inferior rectus muscles, such that diplopia occurs on upward or lateral gaze (dysthyroid eye disease; Fig. 16.13). These ocular signs are especially important in the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves' disease). It must be remembered that unilateral proptosis may also occur with an orbital tumour. Lid retraction, evident as a wide-eyed staring expression, and lid lag, in which depression of the upper lid lags behind the eye in a downward gaze, are due to increased activity of the sympathetic innervation of levator palpebri superioris and are not specific to Graves' disease. Any degree of corneal exposure due to failure of complete lid apposition should be documented.</p>

<p>Visual acuity should be measured both with and without a pinhole to correct for any refractive error. Reduced acuity may be a feature of optic nerve compression in severe dysthyroid eye disease or of asymmetrical pressure on the optic chiasm due to hypothalamopituitary space-occupying lesions. In the latter, assessment of the visual fields may reveal a bitemporal hemianopia; this is frequently incomplete and incongruous, reflecting the asymmetrical growth of the tumour. A detailed description of the visual pathways and examination of the visual fields is given in Chapter 19. In the context of suspected pituitary/peripituitary disease, use of a red object (e.g. a hat pin) is preferable to finger movements as this provides a more sensitive marker of early visual pathway compression. Examination of the optic discs with the ophthalmoscope may show papilloedema, indicating recent onset of optic nerve compression, or pallor, indicating neural atrophy resulting from longstanding pressure. In the context of a pituitary mass lesion, pallor of the optic discs suggests that full visual recovery is improbable.</p>

<p>In thyrotoxicosis, examination of the nervous system reveals a rapid fine tremor. Proximal weakness with or without wasting of the shoulder and hip girdle musculature (proximal myopathy) is a typical
feature of thyrotoxicosis, glucocorticoid excess and vitamin D deficiency. Osteomalacic myopathy is often associated with myalgia.</p>
<p>Hypocalcaemia is associated with increased neural excitability, which may be demonstrated by gentle percussion over the proximal part of the facial nerve (as it exits from the parotid gland). The test is positive if this manoeuvre evokes involuntary facial muscular twitching (Chvostek's sign).</p>
<p>Tendon reflexes will be abnormally brisk in thyrotoxic patients and may show a slow relaxation phase in hypothyroidism. Both hypothyroidism and acromegaly may give rise to nerve entrapment syndromes, particularly of the median nerve at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome).</p>

<p>The investigation of endocrine and metabolic disorders usually involves: (a) the measurement of electrolytes, minerals, metabolites or hormones in plasma; and (b) isotopic, ultrasonographic, radiological or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of specific endocrine glands. In investigating endocrine disease, one is usually interested in whether a specific gland is over- or underactive. These questions may be answered by basal hormone measurements, for example serum free thyroxine and thyroidstimulating hormone in thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, but in many instances the lack of a clear distinction between basal hyposecretion, normal secretion and hypersecretion necessitates the use of stimulation and suppression tests.</p>

<p>Plain X-ray imaging is of limited value in the investigation of endocrine disorders. However, lateral and anteroposterior views of the pituitary fossa can be useful in demonstrating abnormal calcification in the fossa, or gross expansion and erosion of the fossa due to large intrasellar or suprasellar tumours. Plain abdominal radiology may show renal calcification (nephrocalcinosis; Fig. 16.14) in patients with longstanding hypercalcaemia or renal tubular acidosis.</p>

<p>The study of metabolism (Box 17.1) began as long ago as the fifteenth century BC , with the first description of diabetes in the Ebers Papyrus. Metabolic diseases comprise a variety of disorders encompassing a number of medical specialties. They contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity, predominantly from cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and metabolic disorders have become more prevalent in both developed and developing countries, leading to a significant burden of chronic disease and complications related to those diseases. This increased prevalence is related to excessive calorific intake coupled with reduced physical activity. Whereas in the past metabolic diseases such as diabetes were deemed diseases of the rich, in developed countries they are now frequently diseases of lower social class, as access to healthier foods may be expensive and difficult.</p>
<p>The major metabolic disorders considered in this chapter are:</p>
<ul>
<li>diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome</li>
<li>lipid disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Diabetes is a Greek word meaning 'a passer through; a siphon', and mellitus derives from the Greek word for 'sweet'. The Greeks named it thus due to the excessive amounts of urine produced by sufferers which attracted insects because of its glucose content. The ancient Chinese tested for diabetes by observing whether ants were attracted to a person's urine.</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder encountered in clinical practice. It is strongly linked to obesity. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by abnormal carbohydrate and lipid homoeostasis,
leading to elevation in plasma glucose, or hyperglycaemia, and abnormality of serum lipids, or dyslipidaemia. Glucose homoeostasis is modulated mainly by the release of insulin from the islet cells ( <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8889em; vertical-align: -0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.05278em;">β</span></span></span></span></span> cells) of the pancreas. Diabetes develops as a result of a variable combination of absolute insulin deficiency as a result of pancreatic islet cell dysfunction and tissue insulin resistance due to reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a classification of diabetes mellitus based on its pathogenesis (Table 17.1). The two predominant classes of diabetes are type 1 and type 2, and clinical differences between the two are listed in Table 17.2. Type 1 is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmune-mediated pancreatic islet cell destruction. In contrast, type 2 diabetes is associated with a variable degree of tissue insulin resistance, leading - at least in the early stages - to high plasma insulin levels, then subsequently to relative insulin deficiency as pancreatic islet cell function fails to overcome this resistance. The diagnostic criteria for disorders of glucose metabolism based on the <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>75</mn><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">75-\mathrm{g}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.7278em; vertical-align: -0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord">75</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.625em; vertical-align: -0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right: 0.01389em;">g</span></span></span></span></span> oral glucose tolerance test are shown in Table 17.3. Note that glycosuria itself (glucose in the urine) is not a reliable diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>It has long been recognized that many people have a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Thus, the term metabolic syndrome has been coined, with various pseudonyms of syndrome X or insulin resistance syndrome. Clinical and biochemical characteristics of the metabolic syndrome are shown in Box 17.2. People with the syndrome are at high risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The condition is common among certain ethnic groups (African-Americans, MexicanAmericans, Asian Indians, Australian Aboriginals), and features can be present for up to 10 years before hyperglycaemia is detected. Vigorous treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast patient from midnight</li>
<li>Check plasma glucose at time zero</li>
<li>Give 75 g of glucose solution orally</li>
<li>Check plasma glucose 2 hours later</li>
</ul>
<p>In the absence of symptoms, diabetes should only be diagnosed on the basis of two abnormal glucose results. One abnormal glucose result is sufficient if the patient has symptoms.</p>
<p>These levels apply to a plasma (venous) glucose, not a capillary glucose (finger prick). These levels do not apply to the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.</p>

<p>decompensation, leading to marked hyperglycaemia, occurs infrequently.</p>
<p>In contrast, type 1 diabetes is often abrupt in onset, and characterized by severe hyperglycaemia with acute life-threatening decompensation (diabetic ketoacidosis).</p>
<p>The cardinal symptoms of diabetes mellitus are weight loss, polyuria and polydipsia, and their presence should always result in an immediate test for blood glucose and urine for ketones.</p>

<p>Acute hyperglycaemia causes increased urine excretion (polyuria) and, as a result, excessive thirst and water ingestion (polydipsia). These presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus are also termed osmotic symptoms. Raised plasma glucose leads to increased renal tubular delivery of glucose, which then exceeds the resorptive capacity of the renal tubule, leading to glycosuria. Therefore, despite hyperglycaemia, people with an increased renal threshold for glucose may have no osmotic symptoms. Conversely, people with a low renal threshold for glucose may have glycosuria despite being normoglycaemic. It is for this reason that glycosuria is an unreliable feature in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Nocturia is also common in patients presenting with osmotic symptoms of diabetes, and enquiry regarding the frequency of passing urine at night can be helpful in evaluating symptoms.</p>
<p>Other conditions can cause polyuria and polydipsia (Table 17.4). Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by loss of renal concentrating capacity, owing to either loss of secretion of antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary gland (cranial DI) or to poor renal tubular responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic DI). This leads to loss of free water which, if uncorrected by increased water ingestion, can lead to severe dehydration and plasma hypertonicity. Electrolyte disturbance, such as hypercalcaemia or</p>
<p>hypokalaemia, can impair antidiuretic hormone action and hence lead to polyuria and polydipsia. In addition, polyuria and nocturia are common symptoms of chronic renal failure.</p>

<p>Loss of more than 5% of total body weight should be considered clinically important in a subject not deliberately attempting to lose weight. Weight loss is a common presenting symptom in people with type 1 diabetes, and occasionally in type 2 diabetes with marked hyperglycaemia. Loss of weight in diabetes is predominantly due to renal glucose loss as a result of lack of insulin to enable cellular uptake of glucose. The weight loss usually occurs despite a normal appetite and dietary intake. This is in contrast to the weight loss of malignant disease, which is usually associated with reduced appetite and oral intake, or thyrotoxicosis which is associated with increased appetite and oral intake.</p>
<p>Lethargy and fatigue are also common presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2, where the symptoms may have been present for some time.</p>

<p>Dermatological manifestations of diabetes are common at diagnosis, especially in patients with poor glycaemic control. Skin infections, such as staphylococcal infection leading to boils, carbuncles or abscesses, which are often recurrent, may occur. Severe infection itself can lead to hyperglycaemia, and a new diagnosis of diabetes should be reconsidered once the acute infection has cleared.</p>
<p>Oral and genital candidiasis can also be presenting features of diabetes mellitus. The presence of the characteristic white plaques on the tongue and oropharynx in a previously healthy person not on antibiotic therapy should alert the physician to the possibility of diabetes mellitus, although other conditions leading to immune paresis, such as HIV infection or haematological malignancy, can also lead to candidiasis. Genital candidiasis in women leads to a thick white discharge and vaginal soreness. Similarly, in men it can lead to a severe balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis). Always check the blood glucose in people with recurrent candidiasis.</p>

<p>Hyperglycaemia can lead to blurred vision, owing to osmotic changes within the aqueous humour of the lens of the eye. This can also occur when chronic hyperglycaemia is treated, causing further osmotic shifts in the lens. The symptom usually settles once normoglycaemia is achieved.</p>

<p>A family history of premature cardiovascular disease is also important.

<p>The cornerstone of management of diabetes is lifestyle; accordingly, periodic re-assessment is important. Regularity of meals, the quality and quantity of foods eaten and the frequency of snacks should be known. Enquire about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularity of meals - three meals a day is ideal.</li>
<li>Content of fatty/greasy foods - particularly discourage saturated (animal) fats, as this type of fat is linked to heart disease.</li>
<li>Content of fruit and vegetables - at least five portions a day are recommended.</li>
<li>Content of sugar and sugary foods - avoid carbonated drinks, cakes, sweets and biscuits.</li>
<li>Content of salt - a high salt intake can lead to hypertension.</li>
<li>Alcohol intake - a maximum of two units of alcohol per day for a woman and three units per day for a man.
The smoking history is of paramount importance, as smoking with diabetes is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease. Occupational history may be important, because if insulin therapy is required, this may have an impact on legal requirements for driving. Assess physical activity, to ascertain whether increased activity may improve glycaemia and weight. At least 30 minutes of moderate exercise, for example brisk walking, per day is recommended.</li>

<p>In a patient previously diagnosed with diabetes, assess his self-monitoring of glucose. This will enable a reasonable judgement of glycaemic control. Self-monitoring can be done by home capillary blood testing, or by urine testing for glycosuria (Fig. 17.1).

<p>The features of ischaemic heart disease are described elsewhere (see Ch. 11). People with diabetes have fewer, less severe symptomatic chest pains, possibly due to autonomic neuropathy leading to reduced deep pain sensation - so-called silent ischaemia. Thus, the only symptom of ischaemic heart disease in a diabetic subject may be breathlessness.</p>
<p>Peripheral vascular disease presents with claudication (Ch. 11). In addition, in patients with diabetes, a combination of peripheral neuropathy and</p>

<p>Diabetic retinopathy is frequently asymptomatic until it causes significant visual loss, which may be acute in onset (e.g. owing to a sudden retinal haemorrhage) or insidious (e.g. owing to cataract or maculopathy). Diabetic nephropathy is similarly asymptomatic until renal dysfunction becomes so severe that uraemia ensues (see Ch. 18). Uraemic symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness and tachypnoea, pleuritic chest pain due to pericarditis and pruritus. Heavy proteinuria may lead to the development of a nephrotic syndrome.</p>
<p>In contrast, diabetic neuropathy can manifest in a number of ways. Chronic peripheral sensory neuropathy is the commonest form, affecting around <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8056em; vertical-align: -0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">5%</span></span></span></span></span> of patients with diabetes. This can present with symptoms varying from numbness, a feeling of 'walking on cotton wool' and paraesthesiae (pins and needles) to burning, sharp and shooting pains. The latter is a feature of selective involvement of small pain fibres. Typically the symptoms start distally and spread up in a stocking distribution, and are characteristically worse at night, frequently leading to insomnia.</p>
<p>Proximal motor neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy, or femoral neuropathy) is uncommon, but is seen predominantly in middle-aged men with type 2 diabetes. The condition is characterized by severe, deep pain and paraesthesiae in the upper anterior thigh, followed by weakness and wasting of the quadriceps muscle. The condition is often unilateral, generally short-lived (around 3 months) and usually
resolves spontaneously. Associated weight loss and cachexia are common.</p>
<p>Mononeuropathies, particularly affecting the median nerve of the hand (carpal tunnel syndrome; see Ch. 14) are common in patients with diabetes. This frequently presents with paraesthesiae and numbness in the median nerve distribution of the hand (lateral two-and-half digits) and is again worse at night. Similar symptoms may occur in the foot (tarsal tunnel syndrome). Cranial mononeuropathies are rare, but palsies of cranial nerves III, VI and VII are seen in patients with diabetes, leading to blurred or double vision due to ophthalmoplegia, or a lower motor neurone facial palsy (Ch. 14). The pupillomotor fibres are usually spared in diabetic third nerve palsy.</p>
<p>Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy, the symptoms of which can be very troublesome. They include impotence, gustatory sweating (severe facial sweating on tasting food), urinary retention or incontinence, dizziness or syncope due to postural hypotension, constipation or diarrhoea (so called diabetic diarrhoea) and recurrent nausea and vomiting due to diabetic gastroparesis.</p>

<p>Treatment of diabetes is aimed at reducing symptoms and reducing the risk of diabetic complications. In attempting to reduce hyperglycaemia using oral hypoglycaemic tablets or insulin therapy, the patient with diabetes is at risk of hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p>Physiological responses to hypoglycaemia start at a plasma glucose of around <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3.8</mn><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">3.8</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">mmol</span></span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord mathrm">l</span></span></span></span></span>, with the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon or adrenaline (epinephrine). Symptoms of hypoglycaemia normally occur at around this level owing to sympathetic overactivation. Such symptoms include sweating, palpitations, hunger, agitation or blurred vision, and most patients recognize them as hypoglycaemia and are able to treat themselves rapidly. A further drop in blood glucose leads to neuroglycopenic symptoms, where cerebral glucose is low, leading to impaired intellectual activity or diminished psychomotor skills. Further drops in glucose levels can lead to severe agitation, confusion, coma and epileptiform seizures. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia can be distressing, and have a significant adverse impact on quality of life. Loss of awareness of hypoglycaemia is sometimes a problem in diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy, and in insulin-treated diabetes this can lead to unexpected hypoglycaemia. Patients at risk should be warned against driving motor vehicles, and taught the early symptoms of hypoglycaemia in order to raise their awareness of this potentially serious complication of therapy.</p>

<p>Patients with diabetes can present with acute metabolic decompensation, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic syndrome (HHS) or, in treated patients, hypoglycaemia. Thus, it is mandatory for all patients presenting with coma or reduced conscious level to have their blood glucose checked immediately.</p>
<p>Characteristically, the cardinal symptoms of severe polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss will have been present for some time prior to coma; such symptoms should never be ignored in a diabetic person. Patients with acute hyperglycaemic crises are frequently severely dehydrated, with hypotension (including postural hypotension), tachycardia, dry mucous membranes and reduced skin turgor. Other signs of DKA include rapid deep sighing respiration (Kussmaul breathing - a respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis) and ketones on the breath (a sweet odour reminiscent of nail polish remover). Diabetic ketoacidosis can occasionally present with symptoms of an acute abdomen.</p>
<p>In the non-acute setting, measurement of weight and height to ascertain the body mass index (BMI) is of great importance in the assessment of the diabetic patient (Box 17.3). It is desirable for all patients with diabetes to undergo a full medical assessment once a year - the so-called diabetic annual review (Box 17.4).</p>

<p>Dermatological manifestations of diabetes are common. Fungal nail infections, particularly of the feet, are common, as are dermatophyte infections of the skin of the feet (tinea pedis). Staphylococcal skin infections leading to pustules, abscesses or carbuncles can also be seen. Other skins lesions seen in diabetes include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (Fig. 17.3).

predominantly seen in young women aged 15-40 years. This presents as a painless red macule, usually over the anterior shin, which then heals with scarring to form a yellowish/brown lesion. The condition can be unsightly, and little effective treatment is available. Vitiligo is seen in a small number of patients with type 1 diabetes, reflecting its autoimmune nature.</p>
<p>Diabetic dermopathy is characterized by brown macules on the lower legs that heal to form atrophic, shiny white scars. A further skin lesion seen in patients with diabetes is granuloma annulare, pale, shiny rings and nodules usually seen on the hands (Fig. 17.4). Bullosis diabeticorum is a rare manifestation, characterized by tense blistering, mainly on the feet. Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by a dark velvety appearance in the axillae or neck of people with insulin resistance (Fig. 17.5) and frequently accompanies type 2 diabetes, but may occur in people with insulin resistance in the absence of diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetic patients treated with insulin should have their injection sites examined for signs of lipohypertrophy (a physiological response to insulin injected

<p>Diabetic cheiroarthropathy, or 'stiff hand syndrome' or 'limited joint mobility', is seen in some patients with longstanding diabetes. It is characterized by skin thickening and sclerosis of the tendon sheaths, leading to reduced joint mobility and the characteristic prayer sign (Fig. 17.8). Examination of the hands for signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (Ch. 14) is important if the patient has suggestive symptoms. Thus, the presence of Tinel's sign (Fig. 17.9) and Phalen's sign (Fig. 17.10) should be sought. Thenar eminence wasting may also be seen.</p>

<p>Examination of the eyes is mandatory in patients with diabetes. External examination may indicate signs of dyslipidaemia (corneal arcus and xanthelasmata; Fig. 17.11). A reduced pupillary response to light may indicate autonomic neuropathy. Visual acuity should be assessed yearly with a Snellen chart,</p>

and unexplained loss of acuity should be investigated. Funduscopy should be undertaken with pharmacological dilatation of the pupils in order to obtain an adequate view. Loss of the red reflex on funduscopy may indicate cataract formation, and the lens should be assessed for opacities (Fig. 17.12). The vitreous and retina should be examined carefully, starting from the optic disc and radiating into each quadrant of the eye. The macula is examined last, as this can be quite uncomfortable for the patient. The use of green light may aid the detection of microaneurysms. Ideally, all patients with diabetes should have annual fundal photography. A classification of diabetic retinopathy is shown in Box 17.5 (and see Figs 17.13-17.17).</p>

Signs of deformity, callus (a sign of excessive pressure at this site), fungal infection especially between the toes, nail care and ulceration should be carefully assessed. Peripheral pulses and nail-fold refill should be assessed for signs of peripheral vascular disease.

Loss of ankle jerks is also a sign of early diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy.
A complication of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the neuropathic joint - Charcot neuroarthropathy (see Fig. 17.2). This usually affects the ankle and presents with a painless, swollen, hot red joint, sometimes with a history of minor local trauma. The natural history is of progressive deformity until the process settles, usually over a few months. Untreated, the joint develops severe deformity, which then puts the foot at high risk of ulceration, infection and amputation. Treatment is with immobilization in a plaster-cast boot, and intravenous bisphosphonates.
Diabetic patients with signs of peripheral vascular disease or peripheral neuropathy, even if asymptomatic, should be classified as at high risk for ulceration and be given careful education on foot care by a podiatrist.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of diabetes is based on a fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), using the WHO criteria (see Table 17.3). Although clinically it is relatively simple to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, occasionally the diagnosis is not clear, especially in younger-onset type 2 diabetes without a family history. In these circumstances, the use of immunological tests such as anti-islet cell (ICA) or antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody may be helpful. Positivity of either is a good indicator of autoimmune islet cell destruction (and hence probable type 1 diabetes), insulin deficiency and a subsequent requirement for insulin therapy.
In acute hyperglycaemic decompensation of diabetes, urgent investigations are required, including a laboratory glucose estimation, assessment of renal function (urea and electrolytes), urinalysis testing for ketones and glucose, and arterial blood gas assessment to determine pH and bicarbonate level. A search for precipitating causes should be undertaken, including a chest radiograph, ECG, white cell count and, in younger women, a pregnancy test.
In order to reduce the risk of chronic complications, it is important to ensure a full biochemical assessment is undertaken yearly as part of an annual diabetic review. Renal and liver function should be checked, along with assessment of urine albumin excretion.

<p>Lipid disorders are common and contribute significantly to the burden of cardiovascular disease. They can be conveniently divided into primary and secondary (Table 17.7). Primary lipid disorders are usually inherited, whereas secondary are acquired as a result of other medical disorders.</p>

<p>Lipid disorders rarely cause significant symptoms, unless the patient presents with an acute feature such as acute pancreatitis or myocardial infarction. Thus, any previous history of vascular disease or acute abdominal pain should be sought. Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of severe hypertriglyceridaemia, and presents with acute severe generalized abdominal pain. Although alcohol and cholelithiasis are the commonest causes of acute pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridaemia is a well recognized and easily overlooked cause of the condition, and any patient presenting with acute pancreatitis should have his serum lipids checked.</p>

<p>In the assessment of patients with lipid disorder, it is important to enquire about symptoms of ischaemic heart disease (chest pain history, admissions for ischaemic heart disease and any cardiological/ cardiothoracic interventions), peripheral vascular disease (intermittent claudication) and cerebrovascular disease (transient ischaemic attacks, amaurosis fugax and strokes). Other cardiovascular risk factors should also be assessed. The smoking history is very important and a family history of premature vascular disease (under the age of 55 years) should be carefully sought. In familial hypercholesterolaemia, half of men and a fifth of women die before the age of 60 from coronary heart disease. Possible symptoms of secondary causes should also be assessed. Thus, symptoms of hypothyroidism (Ch. 16), diabetes (above), renal failure or nephrotic syndrome (Ch. 18) and liver disease (Ch. 12) should be sought. Alcohol intake and dietary history should also be assessed.</p>

the Achilles tendon and the extensor tendons of the hands, particularly over the knuckles (Fig. 17.19). Other sites include the tibial tuberosities, at the site of insertion of the patellar tendon (subperiosteal xanthomata) or at the triceps tendon at the elbow.</p>
<p>As the cholesterol deposition is deep within the tendon, and the swelling is fibrous, tendon xanthomata are felt as hard nodules along the length of the tendon. They occasionally become inflamed, and a tenosynovitis develops. On the extensor surface of the hands, they may overlie the knuckle and be very hard and quite easy to miss.

<p>Xanthelasmata are deposits of lipid in the skin of the eyelids, more commonly the upper rather than the lower (see Fig. 17.11). Although a dramatic sign, they are not present in the majority of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. More common is a corneal arcus, seen as a rim of lipid deposit around the iris (Fig. 17.11). This can be seen at any age, although it is more common in older people; only in the minority is this sign associated with hypercholesterolaemia.</p>
<p>The characteristic sign of hypertriglyceridaemia is eruptive xanthomata (Fig. 17.20). These are yellow</p>

Striate palmar xanthomas are yellowish discoloration of the skin creases, usually seen best in the hands, and are due to hypertriglyceridaemia. In severe forms of hypertriglyceridaemia, hepatosplenomegaly may be seen. Funduscopy in severe hypertriglyceridaemia may show lipaemia retinalis, characterized by optic pallor and the retinal vessels appearing white (Fig. 17.21).</p>
<p>A careful cardiovascular examination should be performed in all patients with significant hyperlipidaemia, including a search for carotid or femoral

<p>All patients with lipid disorders should undergo a fasting lipid profile, comprising total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, the serum may become turbid and take on the appearance of milk. Investigations to exclude secondary causes should include thyroid, liver and renal function and fasting glucose. Resting or exercise ECG may be checked to look for signs of ischaemic heart disease. Genotyping to determine the type of familial lipid abnormality may be required, especially for familial hypercholesterolaemia, although this is usually only available in specialist centres. Genotyping should be considered, depending on the parents' wishes, to aid in antenatal diagnosis of familial monogenic hypercholesterolaemia.</p>
<p>Acute pancreatitis can be diagnosed using serum amylase, which is frequently very elevated in the condition. In severe hypertriglyceridaemia, however, falsely low serum amylase can lead to diagnostic confusion, as triglycerides interfere with the amylase assay. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia can lead to a pseudohyponatraemia, and care should be exercised when interpreting serum sodium levels in the condition.</p>

<p>These systems are more dependent than most on laboratory, histopathology and imaging techniques to complete the diagnostic process, but the basic principles and requirements of clinical assessment often lead towards an area of diagnosis which directs subsequent laboratory and other technically orientated investigations. Diseases of the kidney and urinary tract manifest a somewhat restricted array of symptoms and signs, but almost all patients can be categorized into a well-defined renal or urological syndrome, and keeping these in mind informs the clinical diagnostic process. There are many areas of overlap between clinical and pathological processes within a single syndrome, and in general it is not helpful to create artificial distinctions between the two. Once the syndrome has been established, further details of assessment and management objectives become clearer. It is important to emphasize that a number of these syndromes were first described many years ago. They have stood the test of time principally because of their pragmatic value and relative ease of recognition on the basis of clinical assessment and quite simple tests.</p>

<p>Pain arising from the urinary tract is a common symptom that is often due to obstruction, infection or tumour. Renal pain is usually felt in the flank or the loin. When renal pain arises from ureteric obstruction (e.g. a stone), discomfort may additionally radiate to the iliac fossa, the testicle or the labia, the pattern depending to a certain extent on the level of the obstruction. Patients with polycystic kidney disease may suffer chronic flank pain. Exacerbations occur with cyst infection and haemorrhage.</p>
<p>Acute bladder outflow obstruction presents with severe suprapubic pain. However, pain in the suprapubic region and perineum most commonly arises from lower urinary tract infection, due to cystitis or urethritis. Such pain is frequently accompanied by dysuria, frequency or strangury (painful micturition). These symptoms comprise the syndrome of cystitis. It is nearly always associated with urinary abnormalities on urine stick testing (protein, blood and leukocytes). In men, this pain may be associated with severe perineal or rectal discomfort, in which case prostatitis is suggested.
In young children with urinary tract infection and cystitis, the symptoms may be much less obvious, but cystitis should be suspected in any child who cries on micturating. Pain from the kidneys, if it results from acute infection or abscess, may occasionally reflect tracking of pus upwards to the diaphragm, causing diaphragmatic pain, or in the retroperitoneal space to the psoas muscle, leading to pain when the muscle is stretched on passive hip extension. Glomerulonephritis is usually painless. Kidney tumours may cause a dull persistent flank pain.</p>

<p>It is important to decide early in the diagnostic process whether the haematuria originates from the kidneys or elsewhere in the urinary tract (Box 18.1). This decision affects the order in which investigations should be conducted. For example, continuous painless microscopic haematuria with associated proteinuria in a young man or woman is most likely to be the result of glomerulonephritis or other renal pathology. However, haematuria in an older person with risk factors for urothelial malignancy (smoking) is more likely to be caused by a bladder or ureteric tumour and merits a cystoscopy early in the investigative process. It is important to remember that the commonest cause of dipstick haematuria in women is contamination from menstrual blood.</p>

<p>Oliguria is the passage of less than 500 ml of urine per day. Anuria is the complete absence of urine flow. A reduction in urinary flow rate to the point of oliguria may be physiological, as in a patient whose fluid intake is low. Physiological reduction of urinary flow rate implies that the glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) remains normal, and that the kidney is avidly retaining sodium and water. If inadequate fluid intake leads to a significant reduction in the extracellular fluid compartment, the resulting decrease in renal blood flow leads to oliguria and reduction of the GFR. Oliguria arising in this fashion is termed prerenal and is clearly pathological. Renal oliguria implies the presence of intrinsic renal disease, whereas postrenal oliguria results from mechanical obstruction at any level, from the collecting system in the kidney to the urethra. Anuria and oliguria may be signs of renal failure.</p>

<p>Polyuria implies no more than a high urinary flow rate. There will always be an associated increase in the frequency of micturition (frequency), and often nocturia as well. Polyuria results from excessive water intake (psychogenic polydipsia or beer drinking, for example), from an osmotic diuresis (glucose, as in diabetes mellitus, urea as in chronic renal failure and sodium chloride as in diuretic use) and finally from abnormal renal tubular water handling, as seen in cranial diabetes insipidus (inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone) or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (renal resistance to antidiuretic hormone).</p>

<p>Increased frequency of micturition results from polyuria, a reduction in functional bladder capacity or bladder/urethral irritation. The commonest cause of polyuria is excessive fluid intake, whereas reduced functional bladder capacity is seen most frequently in patients with prostatic hypertrophy and bladder outlet obstruction. Lower urinary tract infection (cystitis) causes bladder irritation and an increase in urinary frequency. Some patients with neurological diseases, in particular multiple sclerosis, also have frequency of micturition. The detrusor muscle of the bladder contracts at an inappropriately low bladder volume, resulting in a low functional bladder capacity.</p>

<p>This term implies the need to empty the bladder during the hours of sleep. In health, there is a substantial diurnal variation in urinary flow rate: a nighttime reduction in urine flow, together with adequate functional bladder capacity, serves to obviate the need for night-time micturition. Thus polyuria of any cause, or any cause of reduction of functional bladder capacity, may lead to nocturia. In addition, failure of the urine concentrating ability of the kidneys, as occurs in renal impairment and sickle cell disease, will also lead to nocturia. Obviously,</p>
<p>diuretics taken in the evening and at night will lead to this symptom.</p>

The urine is often described as 'burning' or 'scalding', and there is usually associated frequency of micturition and decreased functional bladder capacity. Infection and neoplasia in the bladder or urethra are the most important causes. An extreme form of dysuria, strangury, implies an unpleasant and painful desire to void when the bladder is empty or nearly so.</p>

<p>Urgency is the loss of the normal ability to postpone micturition beyond the time when the desire to pass urine is initially perceived. Incontinence is the involuntary passage of urine. In extreme cases, urgency may lead to urge incontinence, in which the desire to void cannot be voluntarily inhibited. Stress incontinence, on the other hand, is leakage of urine associated with straining or coughing, often due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The term enuresis is usually used to describe noctural enuresis, or bed wetting.</p>

<p>This triad of symptoms is most frequently seen in elderly men with prostatic hypertrophy. Here the bladder outlet is partially obstructed by the enlarging prostate gland, with the result that the maximum achievable urinary flow rate during micturition is reduced. There is often difficulty in initiating micturition (hesitancy) and in completing micturition in a 'clean stop' fashion (terminal dribbling). The symptoms are nearly always associated with frequency of micturition and nocturia, the result of a low functional bladder capacity. In more advanced cases, there may be progressive bladder enlargement, with eventual overflow incontinence and continuous or intermittent dribbling of urine.</p>

<p>These physical signs fall into three principal groups:
1 Local signs related to the specific pathology, for example an enlarged palpable tender kidney in renal carcinoma, or a palpably enlarged bladder in a patient with acute or chronic retention.
2 Symptoms of disturbance of renal salt and water handling, with resulting clinical evidence of extracellular fluid volume expansion or contraction.
3 Signs of failure of the kidney's normal excretory and metabolic functions.
In many renal patients, particularly those with advanced chronic renal failure and uraemia, signs from all three of the above categories may be present.</p>

<p>Patients with chronic renal failure look unwell. The skin is pallid, the complexion sallow and a slightly yellowish hue is often evident. The mucous membranes are pale, reflecting the associated normochromic, normocytic anaemia. There may be bruises, purpura and scratch marks due to uraemic pruritus, and also an underlying disorder of platelet function and capillary fragility. The nails often appear pale and opaque (leukonychia) in the nephrotic syndrome, and sometimes in chronic renal failure. Intercurrent episodes of severe illness in the past may have led to the appearance of Beau's lines, which appear as transverse ridges across the nails. Splinter haemorrhages in the nail beds point to underlying vasculitis, which may be the cause of the renal failure or be indicative of endocarditis; there may be an associated purpuric rash (Fig. 18.1). When blood urea is very high, a uraemic frost may be seen on any part of the body and appears as a white powder; it is formed from crystalline urea deposited on the skin via the sweat. The onset of chronic renal failure in childhood is associated with impaired growth, causing short stature. Severe bony deformity may be evident in some cases, particularly in children, who may develop rickets (Fig. 18.2). Advanced uraemia is also associated with metabolic flap, a coarse tremor which is best seen at the wrists when in the dorsiflexed position. It is similar to the metabolic flap (asterixis) seen in patients with advanced liver disease or respiratory failure. The presence of metabolic acidosis leads to increased ventilation with an increased tidal volume, known as Kussmaul respiration.</p>

<p>Of crucial importance here is the correct assessment of the patient's fluid volume status. It is important to define whether the patient is euvolaemic, hypovolaemic or hypervolaemic. This is a bedside assessment that, with practice, can usually be made correctly.
Hypervolaemia is associated with some or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypertension.</li>
<li>Elevation of the jugular venous pressure.</li>
<li>Peripheral oedema at the ankles or sacrum.</li>
<li>Basal crackles on lung auscultation.</li>
<li>Ascites.</li>
<li>Pleural effusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In patients with nephrotic syndrome (see below), oedema and salt and water retention are caused by reduced plasma oncotic pressure. Oedema with expansion of the extracellular fluid is often accompanied by hypertension and, particularly if the cardiac reserve is poor, may progress to pulmonary oedema and other manifestations of heart failure. The presence of oedema itself, however, can coexist with intravascular volume depletion, especially in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
The diagnosis of hypovolaemia requires the absence of any signs of hypervolaemia. The hypovolaemic patient may have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low blood pressure, often exaggerated in the upright position - postural hypotension.</li>
<li>Sinus tachycardia (exaggerated in the upright position).</li>
<li>Low pulse pressure (exaggerated in the upright position).</li>
<li>Flat neck veins even when almost supine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Poor skin turgor, 'sunken eyes' and dry mucous membranes are often cited as signs of volume depletion, but these are generally unreliable features.</p>

<p>The detection of the kidneys in the abdominal examination is described in Chapter 12. In slim people with relaxed abdominal muscles, it is sometimes possible to feel a normal right kidney (the right kidney is situated slightly lower than the left at the level of T12-L3). More often a palpable kidney can only be felt because it is enlarged, as in hydronephrosis, multiple cysts (polycystic kidney disease) or tumour (generally unilateral). A distended bladder is identified in the lower abdomen by a combination of palpation and percussion. Rectal examination is an important part of the clinical assessment of the renal patient: bimanual palpation of the bladder is a more</p>
<p>reliable way of assessing bladder enlargement than is simple per abdominal examination. In men, rectal examination also allows evaluation of the prostate gland, both for benign enlargement and for the detection of malignant change suggested by hard irregularity of the gland and absence of the central groove.</p>

<p>Uraemic pericarditis and pleurisy may be suggested by pericardial and pleural friction rubs, respectively. Their presence points to either advanced uraemia or a multisystem inflammatory disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may have both renal and extrarenal manifestations. Added heart sounds (S3 and S4) suggest, respectively, volume expansion and incipient heart failure, and ventricular hypertrophy, often as a consequence of hypertension. The presence of vascular bruits and/ or impairment of the major arterial pulses is an important finding, raising the possibility of renal vascular disease, which may underlie hypertension and/ or renal failure if bilateral.</p>

<p>Corneal calcification (limbic calcification) occurs in patients with longstanding hyperparathyroidism with elevation of blood calcium and phosphorus concentrations (see Ch. 16). The presence of limbic calcification should not be confused with a corneal arcus (arcus senilis), which is a broader band at the edge of the cornea and merges with the sclera. Corneal arcus is usually most marked in the superior and inferior positions, whereas limbic calcification is seen medially and laterally or circumferentially. Retinal changes are extremely important in uraemic patients, many of whom have hypertension and/or diabetes. Renal dysfunction in the absence of diabetic retinopathy cannot be attributed to diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, however, diabetic nephropathy is present in many patients without any diabetic eye changes. Patients with renal disease as part of systemic vasculitis may have manifestations of the latter in the retinae, with haemorrhages and exudates. Patients with chronic renal failure are at greatly increased risk of a range of vascular complications affecting both the macrovasculature and the microvasculature. In the retinae, thrombosis of the central retinal artery or its branches, or of the central retinal vein and its branches, is an important manifestation of this. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings may help confirm a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.</p>

<p>This is the abrupt onset of declining renal function occurring over a period of hours or days, usually (but not always) accompanied by a marked reduction or cessation of the urinary flow rate. Central to the diagnosis, however, is a rapid decline in the GFR, leading to nitrogen retention and usually to sodium and water retention as well. An exception is the patient in whom the decline of GFR is not accompanied by reduction of urine flow, so-called nonoliguric acute renal failure. The outlook depends on the cause. Many are reversible spontaneously (repair of ischaemic injury as in tubular necrosis) or as a result of therapy (removal of stone or other cause of obstruction).</p>

<p>Chronic renal failure implies that the GFR has been reduced for a considerable period and that the reduction is largely or completely irreversible. It can result from almost any form of renal parenchymal disease, chronic renal ischaemia or unrelieved urinary obstruction. If renal impairment is severe, there may be clinical manifestations of uraemia. These are usually evident when the GFR has fallen to onethird of normal or less. The implication of the term chronic renal failure is that the timescale of onset and progression is rarely shorter than a few months, and often much longer. A further and crucial implication is an irreversible reduction in the number of functioning nephrons with no prospect of significant</p>

<p>As in acute renal failure, the acute nephritic syndrome implies a fairly brisk onset (days, weeks or months) of reduction in GFR and retention of nitrogenous waste, and usually salt and water also. Oliguria is, therefore, common. The underlying pathology is an acute glomerulonephritis which, as well as causing the functional abnormalities described above, also results in florid abnormalities of the urine. Haematuria (macroscopic or microscopic), proteinuria and tubular casts are often present. Many of the causes of acute nephritis are associated with functional abnormalities of the immune system which may be detected by laboratory tests and which may also manifest with disease in other organs, for example the skin, joints or eyes, as in SLE, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (see Fig. 18.1) and systemic vasculitis.</p>

Depending on the circumstances of the bleeding, the urine may be a rusty-brown colour, lightly tinged with red blood or more heavily bloodstained. The source of the bleeding may be anywhere in the urinary tract, from the glomeruli at the top to the urethra at the bottom.

<p>The normal urinary tract is sterile except at its extreme distal end. Infection in the urinary tract leads to a range of symptoms and signs that reflect the location and severity of the infection. By far the most frequent site is the bladder, and the local symptoms reflect bladder irritation, with frequency of micturition, low functional bladder capacity and dysuria. The presence of urinary tract infection is defined importantly by the presence of a significant number of infecting organisms in the urine. A working definition of a proven urine infection would be the detection of more than <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>5</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10^{5}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">0</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.8141em;"><span style="top: -3.063em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">5</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> colony-forming units <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">/ \mathrm{ml}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">ml</span></span></span></span></span></span> urine in a carefully collected mid-stream specimen of urine (MSU).

<p>This syndrome may conveniently be divided into lower and upper tract obstruction. Lower urinary tract obstruction is defined by residual urine in the bladder after micturition, or in more extreme forms by urinary retention with inability to empty the bladder at all. The most common causes relate to prostatic hypertrophy (benign hyperplasia or carcinoma), and a characteristic array of symptoms and signs arises (frequency, nocturia, poor stream, hesitancy, terminal dribbling). All of these are a
consequence of a low functional bladder capacity, an inability to empty the bladder completely and impairment of the urinary flow rate.</p>
<p>The presence of upper urinary tract obstruction is established in most cases by the demonstration of a dilated renal collecting system (renal pelvis and/or calyces), often seen to be proximal to a specific obstructing lesion. These features may be demonstrated by a number of imaging techniques, including ultrasound and intravenous urography (IVU) as well as cross-sectional imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scanning. Upper and lower urinary tract obstruction may coexist, most frequently when the lower urinary tract obstruction is severe and/or of long standing, and leading to progressive dilatation of the upper urinary tract with consequent renal damage. It is important to remember that unilateral renal obstruction should not result in a rise in the serum creatinine. Therefore, if the creatinine is elevated, there is also dysfunction of the contralateral kidney.</p>

<p>The operational definition is largely observational, depending on the demonstration of one or more stones in any part of the urinary tract. Resulting symptoms and signs depend much on the location of the stone(s) and on size. For example, small stones in the kidneys are frequently asymptomatic, or they may lead to subtle urinary abnormalities, presenting initially with asymptomatic urinary abnormality. Larger stones in the kidneys frequently lead to renal pain, whereas stones in the ureter are particularly likely to cause acute obstruction and very severe ureteric and renal pain. Bladder stones are usually associated with symptoms suggestive of cystitis with frequency, haematuria and pain all common, and often associated with urinary tract infection.</p>

<p>By far the most common cause of sustained blood pressure elevation is essential hypertension. However, in a minority of patients with raised blood pressure, renal disease will be found to be the cause, and the likelihood of this is greatly increased in patients with coexisting renal disease of any kind. Hypertension may be one of the presenting features of virtually any disease of the renal parenchyma, including all forms of glomerulonephritis, many forms of tubulointerstitial disease, renal vascular disease, renal stone disease and obstruction. Renal tumours and renal infections may occasionally present with hypertension, which in some cases can be the only presenting feature. Thus, in any patient with newly identified hypertension, the possibility of underlying renal disease should be considered. Conversely, the</p>
<p>exclusion of renal disease as a cause of hypertension is generally straightforward, comprising the absence of symptoms and signs of renal disease, the absence of urinary abnormalities on simple stick testing and the presence of a normal GFR as judged by serum creatinine concentration or other surrogate measurement for GFR.</p>

<p>The majority of patients with parenchymal renal disease or obstructive renal damage manifest disordered tubular function, although in only a few of these are the tubular defects responsible for specific clinical manifestations. Tubular syndromes arising in this context are generally unobtrusive and are certainly common. Much less common is the patient in whom the tubular defect dominates the clinical picture. These defects may be inherited or acquired, and are seen mainly in children. They usually require careful laboratory testing to characterize them fully. Proximal tubular abnormalities include renal phosphate wasting, aminoaciduria (of these, cystinuria with cystine stone formation is the most important) and renal tubular acidosis leading to chronic metabolic acidosis. Distal tubular defects are also associated with metabolic acidosis and with disturbances of potassium metabolism, sodium-losing nephropathy and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, with resulting failure, respectively, of salt and water conservation.</p>

<p>The urine should be tested as part of every general medical examination and not just in patients with known renal or urinary tract disease. Not only may the testing lead to the discovery of hitherto unsuspected diseases, such as diabetes or renal disease, but also documentation of normal urine often provides a very useful historical reference point in the event of the later development of renal disease or urinary abnormalities. The urine specimen should be passed into a clean container without additives. Testing should normally be conducted as soon as possible, and if delayed more than 2 hours, the urine should be refrigerated (not frozen) and returned to room temperature before testing. For microbiological assessment, it is essential to minimize the chances of contamination. This is best done by placing a sterile container in the path of the urine stream once voiding has commenced (i.e. a mid-stream specimen).</p>

<p>Urochrome and uroerythrin are pigments that contribute to the natural yellow tinge of urine. Darkening occurs on staining as a result of oxidation of urobilinogen to coloured urobilin. The colour of urine is also heavily influenced by the urinary flow rate, with high flow leading to dilute urine and hence a pale colour. Bile pigments in excess will colour the urine brown, with a characteristic yellow froth on shaking. Small to moderate quantities of blood impart a smoky appearance, with larger amounts leading to progressive brown or, in the case of brisk bleeding, bright red discoloration. Free haemoglobin from intravascular haemolysis (e.g. in severe malaria - blackwater fever) produces a darker red colour, verging on black in severe cases. Myoglobin may appear in the urine after acute muscle necrosis (rhabdomyolysis), causing a brown-red discoloration. Certain drugs discolour the urine (e.g. rifampicin (red), anthraquinone purgatives such as senna (orange), nitrofurantoin (brown) and methyldopa (grey)). Urine is normally transparent when freshly passed and still warm, but may be cloudy if there are large numbers of red blood cells or leukocytes, or if phosphates have precipitated in significant amounts.</p>

<p>Figure 18.4 Relationship between renal concentration and diluting capacity, and serum creatinine concentration. The serum creatinine is plotted on a logarithmic scale. This therefore represents linear changes in GFR, such as might occur in progressive renal failure. End-stage renal failure is shown on the left, and normal renal function on the right. Curve (a) represents maximum concentrating capacity, e.g. in water deprivation, when the normal kidney can maintain the serum creatinine in the normal range by increasing urine osmolality. In renal failure, the urine cannot be concentrated and the serum creatinine rises. Curve (b) represents the maximum diluting capacity, e.g. after the ingestion of large volumes of water. The normal kidney excretes urine of low osmolality. In end-stage renal failure, urine osmolality cannot be reduced and the water load is not adequately handled. There is also isosthenuria, i.e. the urine tends towards an iso-osmolar state (specific gravity 1.010 ).</p>

<p>Glucose oxidase-impregnated dipsticks provide a quick and semiquantitative test for glucose in urine. By far the commonest causes of abnormal glycosuria are elevation of the plasma glucose to a point where the tubular reabsorptive capacity for glucose is exceeded (usually seen in people with diabetes) and during pregnancy, in which glycosuria occurs with normal plasma glucose concentrations. Very rarely, tubular transport defects may be associated with glycosuria at normal plasma glucose concentrations, and more frequently, but less predictably, patients with acquired chronic renal diseases may exhibit glycosuria at normal plasma glucose concentrations. Collectively these disorders are termed renal glycosuria.</p>

Dipsticks reactive to urine albumin provide a simple semiquantitative test. They are sensitive to 200300 mg protein/l and have almost completely superseded the more cumbersome sulphosalicylic acid test. The urinary protein excretion rate generally rises in the upright posture and with activity and, in some normal individuals, this may lead to apparently abnormal proteinuria on spot urine specimens in ambulant patients, and even in 24 -hour urine collections (orthostatic proteinuria). Measurement of protein in an early-morning urine, however, reveals no protein, and this serves to distinguish abnormal proteinuria from orthostatic proteinuria. A further refinement is the specific measurement of urine albumin, which is increasingly used and should be <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>20</mn><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">&lt;20 \mathrm{mg} /</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.5782em; vertical-align: -0.0391em;"></span><span class="mrel">&lt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">20</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right: 0.01389em;">mg</span></span><span class="mord">/</span></span></span></span></span> day.

Although this range is frequently too low to be detectable by stick testing, it is an important finding, particularly in diabetics in whom it predicts the later onset of overt diabetic nephropathy.

infection), red blood cells and various types of tubular casts. The presence of tubular casts is indicative of parenchymal renal disease. They may be red cell casts or white cell casts, in which Tamm-Horsfall protein matrix has solidified and is studded with red or white blood cells. Granular casts probably represent degenerate cellular casts and have a grainy appearance. Hyaline casts contain no elements or debris and may be seen in small numbers in normal urine. It is usual to express the number of cells or casts seen per high-power field. The presence of red cell casts should alert one to the possibility of an aggressive glomerulonephritis. Red cell morphology may be a useful indicator as to the source of bleeding. Red cells with a normal outline usually, but not always, arise from the renal collecting system or from a point downstream of that, whereas red cells arising from the glomeruli are often distorted, probably as a result of movement through the glomeruli or osmotic insults during passage down the renal tubule.</p>

<p>neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the tubules (Table 18.4). Inulin is the best agent, but involves a continuous infusion of inulin and measurements of inulin concentration in plasma and urine. This is a laborious investigation that is generally confined to research, and is not routinely available. A number of surrogates for the inulin clearance method exist, however, and details of these are given in Table 18.4. The most frequently used surrogates, and also the crudest ones, are the plasma urea and plasma creatinine concentrations. Both compounds are produced endogenously (at an inconstant rate in the case of urea) and excreted by glomerular filtration. Neither is particularly accurate when used to establish the absolute level of glomerular filtration in an individual patient, although the plasma creatinine concentration is certainly very useful when used to follow changes in an individual patient's renal function, especially when the GFR is significantly reduced (Fig. 18.9). Creatinine clearance is more precise, but requires a 24 -hour urine collection with measurements of plasma creatinine concentration and urine creatinine excretion rate. The clearance is then calculated using the simple formula <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi><mi>V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U V / P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span></span> where <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.10903em;">U</span></span></span></span></span> equals the urinary concentration of creatinine, <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span></span> the urinary flow rate (usually expressed in <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">ml</span></span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">min</span></span></span></span></span></span> ) and <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span></span> equals the plasma creatinine concentration.

compounds that are freely filtered at the glomerulus and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the renal tubules are suitable for GFR measurement.</p>
<p>The use of mathematical formulae to estimate GFR has been gaining in popularity, as most of these calculations require simple information such as the age, sex, weight and serum creatinine to derive an estimated GFR (Table 18.5).

<p>This involves measurement of the important constituents of stone whose outputs may be abnormally increased, and also measurement of at least one of the natural inhibitors of stone formation. Ideally this should be combined with analysis of the stone itself. The tests that should be undertaken in all stone patients are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plasma calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, urea, urate, creatinine and electrolytes.</li>
<li>24-hour urine collection for simultaneous measurement of:</li>
<li>calcium</li>
<li>uric acid</li>
<li>oxalate</li>
<li>citrate</li>
<li>creatinine</li>
<li>sodium.</li>
<li>Nitroprusside test for cystine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of increased excretion rates of calcium, uric acid, oxalate or cystine indicates a strong predisposition to recurrent stone formation. Conversely, citrate is a natural inhibitor of stone formation, and a low urine citrate is associated with increased stone risk. All patients who make radiopaque stones should be screened for cystinuria using</p>
<p>the nitroprusside test. If hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia are noted, then the parathyroid and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme should also be measured.</p>

<p>This investigation, in which one or two small cores of renal cortex are removed using a needle-biopsy technique, is performed in patients in whom diffuse renal parenchymal disease is suspected. However, not everyone with renal parenchymal disease requires a biopsy. The test is invasive and carries a small but definite risk of serious complications. It is therefore important to define the indications and contraindications carefully. The risk of the procedure can be minimized by the following preconditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cooperative patient.</li>
<li>Prior knowledge of the position and size of both kidneys (usually provided by ultrasound).</li>
<li>A solitary functioning kidney should only be biopsied if the diagnostic yield is deemed to be crucial.</li>
<li>Absence of a bleeding disorder.</li>
<li>Availability of blood for transfusion in the event of haemorrhage.</li>
<li>An appropriate indication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kidney biopsy is often the only way to distinguish the various forms of glomerulonephritis, both from one another and from tubulointerstitial diseases of the kidney.</p>

<p>Ultrasound provides good images of the renal parenchyma and collecting system, and in nearly all patients gives a reliable estimate of renal size as well as identifying discrete lesions within the parenchyma, hydronephrosis and stone. Doppler studies often permit assessment of blood flow in the main renal arteries and in the larger intrarenal branches. The resistive index, measured by Doppler ultrasound, indicates the degree of chronic intrarenal ischaemic injury. Although the upper ureter can be seen quite well in most patients, the lower ureter is not adequately visualized. Ultrasound examination of the bladder is also extremely useful, allowing calculation of the bladder capacity when full and
also after micturition (emptying should be virtually complete), as well as visualization of the bladder wall and lesions projecting into the bladder itself (e.g. tumours). It can be combined with a measurement of urinary flow rate.</p>

<p>Intravenous urography (IVU) involves the intravenous injection of organic iodine compounds that are excreted and concentrated radiographically. It is an extremely good technique for examining the renal collecting system, the ureters and the bladder, but gives less information than ultrasound about the renal parenchyma (Fig. 18.10). Imaging by IVU depends on renal function. This is useful in that it gives a crude measure of the symmetry or otherwise of excretory capacity, but it also means that the image quality is poor in patients with renal insufficiency in whom the GFR is low (Fig. 18.11).</p>

<p>Computed tomography scanning of the kidneys sometimes complements the information gained from ultrasound and certainly yields important information about the surrounding structures in the retroperitoneum (Fig. 18.13). It is particularly useful in patients with ureteric obstruction from, for example, retroperitoneal malignancy or retroperitoneal fibrosis. Spiral CT is becoming the investigation of choice for renal calculi as well. In some cases, more information is obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

hypertension and/or renal insufficiency in whom renal artery stenosis is suspected. In the context of renal insufficiency, contrast-induced deterioration of function is often seen, but can usually be minimized by adequate prehydration and the use of non-ionic contrast agents. MRI can be used to generate images
of the major renal vasculature. Although the images are generally not as good as those from conventional arteriography, the technique has the advantage of avoiding contrast nephropathy and of being noninvasive. CT imaging may also be used in this way but still requires some contrast.</p>

<p>Disturbance of vision, the most important ocular symptom, may be sudden or gradual, unilateral or bilateral, and lead to loss of central vision or partial field loss. Simultaneous, bilateral visual symptoms are usually due to disease in optic pathways at or posterior to the optic chiasm. Sudden visual disturbance should be assessed urgently. Visual hallucinations may be formed or unformed. Some visual symptoms have particular significance (Table 19.1). For example, haloes around lights occur in acute angle-closure glaucoma due to corneal oedema. 'Floaters' and flashes (photopsia) are indicative of vitreous or retinal disorders, respectively. The latter may also cause objects to appear smaller (micropsia), larger (macropsia) or distorted (metamorphopsia). Disorders of ocular movement may cause double vision (diplopia) or visual blurring. Are the visual symptoms binocular or monocular? Are they related to eye movements?</p>
<p>Other common presentations include a red eye, abnormal lid position, protrusion of the globe, pupillary or eyelid abnormality. Ocular pain is often associated with a red eye (Table 19.2). Ocular pain due to a foreign body may be described as 'a gritty sensation' in the eye, often worsened by blinking. It may be associated with sensitivity to light (photophobia) but this, particularly in conjunction with ocular aching, usually indicates serious corneal or intraocular disease. Severe ocular pain with vomiting may indicate acute glaucoma. Migraine often presents with bilateral visual symptoms and headache. Raised
intracranial pressure and giant cell arteritis should also be considered when headache is associated with visual symptoms. Pain may be referred to the eye because of neighbouring disease, for example sinusitus. Excessive tear production (lacrimation) associated with discomfort may indicate ocular surface disease. There may be abnormal secretions from the eye, such as mucus or pus. With insufficient tears, the eye typically feels dry, whereas a painless overflow of tears (epiphora) typically indicates blockage of the lacrimal drainage system.</p>
<p>Note any previous ophthalmic history, such as a squint in childhood, and any pre-existing poor vision, or previous ocular injury or surgery. Note what type of glasses or contact lenses are worn: extended-wear soft contact lenses are associated with an increased risk of corneal infection. The family history may reveal glaucoma, decreased visual acuity, colour blindness, squint, or neurological disease associated with visual loss. In addition to the ocular history, the medical, drug and social histories are important.</p>

<p>Eye examination is part of the cranial nerve examination. It includes ocular movements (cranial nerves III, IV and VI), corneal sensation (ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve) and eye closure (VII). Assess the optic (II) nerve by testing visual acuity, colour vision, the visual fields and the pupillary light reaction. Inspect the optic nerve head (the optic disc and cup) with the ophthalmoscope. Detailed examination of the anterior segment of the eye requires use of the slit lamp which, with additional equipment, can also be used to test the intraocular pressure (IOP) and examine the retina.</p>

<p>Tests of colour vision are important because colour perception, especially for red, is affected in optic nerve disease before changes in visual acuity can be detected. Show the patient a red target one eye at a time (any bright red target can be used) and ask if there is a difference between the eyes. In the affected eye, red appears 'washed out' (desaturated). Acquired defects of colour vision may also occur in macular disease. The Ishihara test (Fig. 19.5) was devised to test for congenital colour anomalies (colour blindness), but is often used to assess acquired visual disorders. Most inherited colour blindness occurs in males (sex-linked recessive inheritance). It ranges from total colour blindness (monochromatopsia) to subtle confusion between colours, typically between red and green.

<p>Visual field testing is described in Chapter 14. Field defects may affect one or both eyes. Symmetric bilateral (homonymous) field defects are characteristic of lesions posterior to the optic chiasm, and asymmetric field defects are usually due to lesions anterior to the chiasm (i.e. in the optic nerves or retinae). Characteristic field defects (scotoma) occur in glaucoma, when damage to nerve fibres occurs at the optic disc, typically at the inferior or superior aspect of the optic cup. Fundoscopy shows an increase in vertical length of the optic cup (see later in the chapter for details about how examine the fundi) and field loss is arcshaped (arcuate scotoma). If both the inferior and superior fields are involved, a ring-shaped scotoma develops. Untreated glaucoma results in loss of the peripheral field so that only a small central island of vision remains (tunnel vision). Computerized perimetry is useful in identifying early visual field loss. The Humphrey field test analyser, for example, provides statistical information indicating the reliability
of the test in comparison with a group of agematched controls (Fig. 19.6).</p>

<p>Examination of the pupils in neurology is discussed in Chapter 14. In ophthalmic practice, there are three key aspects to pupil examination: size, shape and reactions.</p>

Abnormal pupils dilate and constrict abnormally, and the degree of anisocoria varies with the ambient illumination. However, it is often difficult to decide which pupil is abnormal. In the absence of local eye disease, a small pupil may be due to paralysis of the dilator pupillae muscle (sympathetic innervated), part of Horner's syndrome (Fig. 19.7), in which anisocoria is more pronounced in low ambient light. An enlarged pupil suggests a parasympathetic lesion, which may be preganglionic in oculomotor lesions or postganglionic as in the tonic pupil of Adie's syndrome. Adie's tonic pupil tends to be dilated in bright light and is very slow to react. A feature of both parasympathetic and sympathetic lesions is denervation hypersensitivity caused by upregulation of receptors at the neuromuscular junction (adrenergic in sympathetic and cholinergic in parasympathetic). This is the basis of pharmacological pupil testing. In both pre- and postganglionic parasympathetic blockade, the pupil is supersensitive to weak cholinergic drops (e.g. pilocarpine <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.1 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8056em; vertical-align: -0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">0.1%</span></span></span></span></span> ).

This dilates normal pupils but has no effect in pre- or postganglionic lesions. Hydroxyamfetamine 1% causes noradrenaline (norepinephrine) release from normal or intact postganglionic neurones and allows pre- and postganglionic lesions to be distinguished (the synapse is located in the superior cervical ganglion). In complex pupil abnormalities, for example bilateral Horner's syndrome, infrared pupil imaging can be valuable. Causes of anisocoria are highlighted in Box 19.1. In congenital Horner's syndrome, the affected iris is depigmented and appears blue.</p>

<p>The swinging light test is used to detect a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) resulting from retinal or optic nerve disease. The test loses sensitivity in symmetrical bilateral optic nerve disease, but this is rare, and in most bilateral cases the defect will be detected on the more abnormal side.

Then he heard a sniff, itft something wet against his leg - he had almost stepped upon the animal. He bent down and stroked its wet coat. The dog stood quite still, then moved forward towards the house, sniffed at the steps, at last walked calmly through the open door as though the house belonged to him. Jeremy followed, object the dogs behind them; then there they were in the little dark passage with the head intact beating like a drum, his teeth clattering, and a terrible temptation to omure hevering around him. Let him reach the nursery and establish the animal there and all might be well, but let them be discovered, cold and shivering, in the passage, and out the dog would be flung. He knew so exactly what would happen.

<p>The camp stood where, until quite lately, has been pasture and ploughland; the farm house still stood in a fold of the hill and had served us for battalion offices; ivy still supported part of what had once been the walls of a fruit garden; half an acre of mutilated old trees behind the washhouses survived of an orchard. The place had been marked for destruction before the army came to it. Had there been another year of peace, there would have been no farmhouse, no wall, no apple trees. Already half a mile of concrete road lay between bare clay banks, and on either side a chequer of open ditches showed where the municipal contractors had designed a system of drainage. Another year of peace would have made the place part of the neighbouring suburb. Now the huts where we had wintered waited their turn for destruction.

<p>And another image came to me, of an arctic hut and a trapper alone with his furs and oil lamp and log fire; the remains of supper on the table, a few books, skis in the corner; everything dry and neat and warm inside and outside the last blizzard of winter raging and the snow piling up against the door. Quite silently a great weight forming against the timber; the bolt straining in its socket; minute by minute in the darkness outside the white heap sealing the door, until quite soon when the wind dropped and the sun came out on the ice slopes and the thaw set in a block would move, slide and tumble high above, gather way, gather weight, till the whole hillside seemed to be falling, and the little lighted place would crash open and splinter and disappear, rolling with the avalanche into the ravine.

vision is retained, the acuity will be normal, although severe peripheral field damage may cause RAPD. In neurosyphilis, the pupils are small and irregular and show the Argyll Robertson phenomenon (normal pupil constriction to a near target but reduced reaction to light) owing to a midbrain defect. In Parinaud's syndrome, the pupils are typically large and poorly reactive to light, with abnormal vertical gaze, convergence retraction nystagmus and lid retraction on attempted upgaze (Collier's sign). The causes of light-near dissociation are given in Box 19.2.</p>

At-risk individuals must be warned to return if symptoms of acute angle closure occur.

<p>This marks the point where the retinal axons exit the back of the eye to form the optic nerve. It corresponds to the physiological blind spot. The normal disc is round or slightly oval. If there is astigmatism, the disc may appear more oval than normal. There are four key questions to consider when viewing the optic disc:
1 Is the colour normal? The normal disc is yellow-pink and its temporal side is paler. An abnormally pale disc is a sign of optic atrophy (Fig. 19.10). In addition, in optic atrophy there is a reduction in the number of capillaries</p>

<li>Use your LEFT eye for the patient's LEFT eye, holding the ophthalmoscope with your LEFT hand and using your RIGHT hand with thumb over the LEFT brow to steady the patient's head (the opposite approach is used for the right eye) (Fig. 19.8).</li>
<li>First, at arm's length, look for and examine the red reflex (like that in flash photographs). The red reflex is dimmed in elderly people with cataracts, and these may obscure the retina. In a child, congenital cataract and retinoblastoma may abolish the red reflex.</li>
<li>Looking at the red reflex through the ophthalmoscope, gradually close on the eye to examine the anterior ocular structures. Use the +20 D lens to view the cornea and the +15 D lens for the iris. Some ophthalmoscopes have a lever to switch to these lenses.</li>
<li>Then, with a zero lens setting, locate the optic disc. If it is difficult to find, locate any blood vessel and follow it towards the optic disc. Fine-tune the focus with 1-2 D lens steps; if the focus worsens, reverse the other way. If your eye is emmetropic and your accommodation is relaxed, the strength of the lens necessary to bring the fundus into focus gives an indication of the refractive error of the patient's eye (plus or red lenses indicate hypermetropia and minus or black lenses myopia).</li>
<li>Compare the two eyes. There is a broad range of normal appearances, so if an unusual appearance is symmetrical, it could be a variant of normal.

In primary optic atrophy due to optic nerve lesions, the disc is flat and white, with clear-cut edges. Secondary optic atrophy follows swelling of the optic disc due to papilloedema: the disc is greyish-white, with indistinct edges.
2 Are the margins distinct? The disc margin should be sharply defined. In optic disc swelling, this clear edge is obscured (Fig. 19.11) and venous pulsations are abolished. However, venous pulsations may be difficult to see in some normal subjects. Some important causes of disc swelling are listed in Box 19.7.

lower margins, and particularly in the upper nasal quadrant. The physiological cup becomes obliterated and the retinal veins are slightly distended. As the condition progresses, the disc becomes more definitely swollen (Fig. 19.12). In order to measure the degree of swelling, start with a high plus lens in the ophthalmoscope and reduce the power until the centre of the

disc is just in focus. The retina, a short distance from the disc, is then brought into focus by further reduction of the lens power. This further reduction indicates the degree of swelling of the disc ( 3 D is equivalent to 1 mm of swelling). If papilloedema develops rapidly, there will be marked engorgement of the retinal veins with haemorrhages and exudates on and around the disc, but with papilloedema of slow onset there may be little or no vascular change, even though the disc may become very swollen. The retinal vessels will, however, bend sharply as they dip down from the swollen disc to the surrounding retina. The oedema may extend to the adjacent retina, producing greyish-white striations near the disc (Paton's lines), and a macular fan of hard exudates temporal to the fovea may develop in some cases.
3 Is the central cup enlarged? The cup is a physiological central depression formed at the optic disc as nerve fibres leave the retina to form the optic nerve. It marks the point where the retinal vessels enter and leave the eye. It is paler than the surrounding rim of the disc. The optic cup:disc ratio is estimated by comparing their ratios vertically. In chronic open-angle glaucoma, the ratio is increased ( <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">&gt;0.3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.5782em; vertical-align: -0.0391em;"></span><span class="mrel">&gt;</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">0.3</span></span></span></span></span> ) - optic disc cupping. When the cup is deep, in advanced glaucoma, retinal vessels disappear as they climb from the floor to the rim, and reappear as they bend sharply over the edge of the rim (bayonetting); in less advanced cases, the cup appears as a vertical oval extending to the edge of the disc (Fig. 19.13). In myopic individuals, the disc and cup appear large, and mimic glaucoma. Myopes often have a partial ring of pigmentation or white sclera surrounding the disc, which is easily mistaken for the edge of the cup. In severe myopia, degenerative</p>

chorioretinal changes may occur in the fundus, which can involve the macula and impair central vision.
4 Are there any other abnormal features? In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, new blood vessels (neovascularization) develop at the optic disc. Myelinated nerve fibres have a dramatic white appearance, but they are a unilateral, harmless and non-progressive congenital anomaly (Fig. 19.14). They have a characteristic feathered edge that may obscure the retinal vessels.</p>

<p>There are four pairs of arterioles and venules, which form the main retinal vascular arcades that emerge from the optic disc: superotemporal (above the macula); inferotemporal (below the macula); superonasal; and inferonasal.

arteriolar occlusion, a bright yellow (cholesterol) embolus may occasionally be seen (Fig. 19.15). In diabetes or venous occlusion, the venules are larger, darker and often dilated or tortuous. Look carefully at arteriolar/venous crossings: compression and localized dilatation of venules (arteriovenous (AV) nipping) with arteriolar narrowing (attenuation) is a sign of hypertension (Box 19.8, Fig. 19.16). Spontaneous arteriolar pulsation is an abnormal finding that may occur if the IOP is very high or the central retinal artery pressure very low. Spontaneous venous pulsation is frequently seen in normal eyes, but is reduced in papilloedema.</p>

<p>As each main vascular arcade is followed and examined, the adjacent and peripheral retina can be systematically assessed. The macula is the central retinal area bounded by temporal vascular arcades. It measures approximately five disc diameters across. The fovea at its centre is one disc diameter in size. The fovea, with its high density of cone photoreceptors, is responsible for fine discriminatory vision. To find the fovea, locate the optic disc and move the ophthalmoscope beam temporally (move yourself nasally). Alternatively, ask the patient to look directly into the light. However, if the pupil is undilated, it tends to constrict at this point, and the patient may recoil because of dazzle (you can dim the light beam to make it more comfortable). In young patients, the retina is very reflective and there is often a small yellow dot in the middle of the fovea (macula lutea or fovea centralis). Box 19.9 and Figures 19.17 and 19.18 identify common retinal abnormalities by their colour and appearance.</p>

<p>The slit lamp (Fig. 19.19) provides a stereoscopic, magnified view of the eye and is the key examination tool for ophthalmologists. Many accident and emergency departments have a slit lamp, and it can be invaluable for assessing suspected foreign bodies and corneal abrasions. Some direct ophthalmoscopes are equipped with a slit-lamp beam, which can be useful. Alternatively, the anterior orbital structures and globe can be examined with a bright torch and basic magnification, and the same principles of systematic examination apply. The slit lamp comprises a table-mounted binocular microscope column with an adjustable illumination source that produces a narrow, slit beam of light.</p>
<p>The patient is seated with forehead and chin supported. The slit beam illumination and microscope have a common axis of rotation and coincident focal lengths, allowing the angle of illumination to be varied along with its width, length and intensity. Projected onto the globe, the slit beam illuminates an optical cross-section of the eye's transparent structures, and this can be viewed with</p>

To examine the superior tarsal conjunctiva - for example if a foreign body is suspected - ask the patient to look downwards (Fig. 19.20).

The tear meniscus on the lower eyelid should be symmetrical and less than 1 mm thick, and the tear break-up time should be more than 10 seconds. Fluorescein also aids the identification of aqueous leakage in a penetrating corneal injury (Seidel's test). Arcus senilis is a common crescentic opacity near the periphery of the cornea. It usually starts at the lower part of the cornea, extending to form a complete circle. It is common in old people, but may occur in the young (arcus juvenilis) in association with type IV hyperlipoproteinaemia. Corneal sensation should be tested.</li>

<ul>
<li>Iris. Note any difference in the colour of the two eyes (heterochromia), abnormality in the shape or size of the pupils or signs of iritis. In iritis, the pupil may be constricted (miosis) or
irregular owing to the formation of adhesions (posterior synechiae) between the edge of the pupil and the anterior surface of the lens. Blunt trauma can cause a dilated (mydriasis) unreactive pupil with radial ruptures in the iris. An irregular or teardrop-shaped pupil with a history of a high-velocity foreign body is highly suspicious of a penetrating eye injury where the iris has plugged the leaking wound. Other abnormalities of the pupils are described in Chapter 14.</li>
<li>Lens. Cataracts are usually due to ageing (central nuclear sclerosis), but also occur in diabetes mellitus, after injury and in certain hereditary diseases, for example myotonic dystrophy. Posterior subcapsular cataract is a common side-effect of corticosteroid therapy. Blunt eye injury may cause partial dislocation of the lens (subluxation) or complete dislocation into the vitreous cavity.</li>
<li>Anterior vitreous. This is best examined when the pupil is dilated. Opacities may be observed, most easily using a green light. Cells in the vitreous may be associated with ocular inflammation (vitritis), trauma (vitreous haemorrhage) or retinal holes/detachment (retinal pigment).</li>

<p>Intraocular pressures between 10 and 21 mmHg are considered normal. An increased IOP is a characteristic feature of glaucoma. A diminished IOP occurs in diabetic coma and in severe dehydration from any cause. The IOP may be assessed by palpating the eyeball, although only gross variations from normal can be appreciated. More accurate is applanation tonometry, in which the force required to flatten (applanate) an area of a sphere (the cornea) is proportional to the pressure within the sphere (Fig. 19.22). Topical anaesthestic and fluorescein are applied to the cornea and a bright cobalt blue filter is used to illuminate the sterile tonometer head. Contact between tonometer head and cornea creates a thin green circular outline of fluorescein, and a prism in the head splits this into two semicircles. The tonometer force is adjusted manually until the semicircles just overlap, and is read in millimeters of mercury (mmHg; Fig. 19.23).</p>

highest point of the aperture is typically at the junction of its middle and inner thirds. In Down's syndrome, the palpebral fissure is also oblique. However, it is also short and wide, with its highest point at the centre of the lid.</p>
<p>Normally no sclera is visible above the limbus (the corneoscleral junction). The commonest cause of scleral show is eyelid retraction (Fig. 19.24) due to dysthyroid eye disease, accompanied by other signs such as lid lag, in which movement of the upper lid seems to lag behind that of the eyeball when the patient looks downwards. In parkinsonism, there may be reduced blink frequency. Look for reduced eyelid closure (lagophthalmos) and levator muscle function. Ptosis (drooping of the upper lid) may be congenital or acquired (check old photographs). In age-related ptosis, owing to levator disinsertion, levator function is retained and there is a high upper eyelid skin crease. In ptosis due to myogenic or neurogenic lesions, there is reduced levator function (see Ch. 14). In entropion, there is inversion of the lid margin with associated malpositioning of the lashes,

<p>Examine the lacrimal gland by pulling up the outer part of the upper lid while the patient looks downwards and inwards. Acute inflammation (dacroadenitis) causes a tender swollen gland, with oedema of the upper lid and localized conjunctival injection. Chronic dacroadenitis, a painless enlargement of the lacrimal gland which is frequently bilateral, occurs in sarcoidosis and lymphoproliferative disorders. Tumours of the lacrimal gland produce a hard swelling of the gland associated with displacement of the globe. Involvement of the lacrimal gland by any disease process may cause a dry eye.</p>

<p>The most common cause of forward displacement of the eyeball - proptosis when unilateral, or exophthalmos when bilateral - is thyroid eye disease (TED) (see Fig. 16.13). This can cause corneal exposure and ulceration. Optic nerve damage may occur despite minimal proptosis. Axial proptosis, in the primary direction of the eye in forward gaze, is typical of TED and of tumours in the extraocular

muscle cone behind the eye (intraconal mass lesions) (Fig. 19.28). Non-axial proptosis occurs in association with space-occupying orbital lesions outside the muscle cone, for example lacrimal gland tumours; these displace the globe forward and inferomedially. Apparent ('pseudo') proptosis causes diagnostic confusion: for example in ipsilateral eyelid retraction or myopia (where the eye is longer than normal) or when there is contralateral ptosis or enophthalmos.</p>

<p>The advice given in Chapter 5 on the examination of children in general is also important when examining children's eyes. Children may object strongly to lights and instruments, particularly when they are wielded by white-coated strangers. Allow the child to get used to the surroundings while taking a history from the parent, but do not ignore the child. Constantly observe the child, noting visual behaviour, the position and movements of the eyes and the general appearance of each eye.</p>
<p>Visual maturation continues until the age of 8. Without a focused retinal image, the visual pathways fail to develop properly, a condition known as amblyopia. After this age, sight loss from amblyopia becomes irreversible. It is therefore important to assess visual acuity in preverbal and young children. Babies should rapidly fix a large object - for example the examiner's face - and follow it. After 6 months, 'continuous' and 'steady' fixation that is 'maintained' ('CSM') during a blink should be demonstrable. If an infant strongly objects to your covering an eye for even a short time, consider whether the non-covered eye may not be seeing well. A more sophisticated assessment can be made using 'preferential looking'. Cards are presented to the child with a grating drawn at one end and none at the other. The child will prefer to look at the image rather than nothing. Successively smaller spatial gratings are shown until the child does not see them. The grating seen can be converted to an approximate Snellen acuity (the vision of a 1-year-old equates to approximately <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>12</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6 / 12</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">6/12</span></span></span></span></span> ), although testing each eye independently in this age group is difficult. From the age of 2 years, a more accurate estimate of acuity can be made using the Kay picture-matching test (Fig. 19.30), and from 3 years the Sheridan-Gardiner letter-matching test. In these tests, the child, or the child's parent, holds a card with a number of pictures or numbers on it. The examiner holds up an image and asks the child to match this target to one on the card - the targets vary in size.</p>
<p>Next, the position and movements of the eyes should be assessed. The least disturbing method is to observe the corneal light reflex: a light held at about 1 m should produce a reflection in the centre of each pupil. If the reflection in one eye is at a different location from that in the other, there may be a squint (although a wide intercanthal distance may give this appearance). If a squint is suspected, a cover and alternate cover test should be performed. Assess the ocular movements and the pupillary responses

to light and accommodation. Examine the media and fundi with the ophthalmoscope through the dilated pupil. Because of limited cooperation, refraction testing may be limited to the retinoscopy assessment. In general, only children with refractive errors so severe that there is a risk of amblyopia require treatment.</p>

<p>Retinal photography in conjunction with the intravenous injection of sodium fluorescein gives a detailed assessment of the retinal and choroidal vasculature (Figs 19.34 and 19.35). A blue filtered light excites fluorescence ( 530 nm ) as the dye circulates. Fundus fluorescein angiography is useful in investigating diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal ischaemia. Minor sideeffects, including transient nausea and yellow discoloration of the skin and urine, are common. Severe anaphylaxis is, fortunately, very rare.

<p>Visual evoked potentials (VEP), recorded from the occipital cortex using scalp electrodes while the patient views an alternating black-and-white chequerboard stimulus, have a role in the diagnosis of disease of the visual pathway. The principal waveform recorded from the scalp is a positive deflection
occurring about 100 ms after the stimulus (the P100 wave). This is attenuated in amplitude and increased in latency in disease of the optic nerve, for example optic neuritis or optic nerve compression. Electroretinograms (ERG) measure the electrical potential across the eye, recorded with a corneal electrode, with a reference electrode placed on the forehead. Flash, flicker or pattern stimuli are used to generate electrical responses from retinal activation. This is useful in assessing hereditary or acquired retinal degeneration.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the assessment of potential diseases of the ear, nose and throat. The formal title of the specialty is otorhinolaryngology, which has many interactions with oral and maxillofacial surgery, although more details of the latter are too specialized for an undergraduate textbook.
There is a close functional and anatomical relationship between the ear, the nose and the throat. Disease in one area may have manifestations in another area. Symptoms in one area may likewise refer to another area so an accurate assessment requires a thorough history and examination of the entire area to elucidate a cause. Ear, nose and throat (ENT) is a highly clinical subject as much is visible, especially with modern examination techniques. Therefore, the myriad of modern imaging and other investigations are often unnecessary.</p>

<p>The ear (Fig. 20.1) consists of the external, middle and inner ears. The external ear consists of the pinna and external auditory canal (meatus). The cartilaginous pinna is covered with perichondrium and skin, forming the helix and antihelix. The meatus has an outer cartilaginous and an inner bony component. The skin overlying the external auditory meatus contains hair cells and modified sebaceous glands which produce wax (cerumen). Desquamated skin debris, mixed with cerumen, migrates outward from the drum and deep canal, and makes the external ear a self-cleaning system.
The opaque or semitranslucent eardrum (tympanic membrane) separates the middle and external ears (Fig. 20.2). The pars tensa, the lower part of the drum, is formed from an outer layer of skin, a middle layer of fibrous tissue and an inner layer of middle ear mucosa. It is attached to the annulus, a fibrous
ring that stabilizes the drum to the surrounding bone. The pars flaccida, the upper part of the drum, may retract if there is prolonged negative middle ear pressure secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunction. The malleus, incus and stapes are three small connecting bones (ossicles) (Fig. 20.3) that transmit sound across the middle ear from the drum to the cochlea. The handle of the malleus lies within the fibrous layer of the pars tensa. Within the middle ear, the head of the malleus articulates with the incus in the attic, the upper portion of the middle ear space. The long process of the incus articulates with the stapes. This articulation (the incudostapedial joint) is liable to disruption from trauma or chronic infection. The stapes footplate sits in the oval window, and transmits and amplifies sound to the fluid-filled inner ear.
The inner ear has two portions. The cochlea (Fig. 20.4), the spiral organ of hearing, is a transducer that converts sound energy into digital nerve impulses that are transmitted by the eighth cranial nerve (cochlear) to the brainstem and thence to the auditory cortex. The organ of Corti (Fig. 20.5) within the cochlea contains hair cells that detect frequencyspecific sound energy: low-frequency sounds are detected in the apical region, and high-frequency sounds are detected in the basal region. The inner ear is also concerned with balance. The semicircular canals and the vestibule contain receptors that detect angular and linear motion in the three cardinal <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x, y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.625em; vertical-align: -0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">z</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right: 0.04398em;">z</span></span></span></span></span> planes. The inner ears are only one component of the balance system; visual input and proprioception from joints and muscles are also important.
The facial (seventh cranial) nerve (Fig. 20.6) is important in otological practice. It runs from the brainstem through the cerebellopontine angle to the internal auditory meatus (IAM) with the cochlear and vestibular (eighth) nerves. The facial nerve passes through the temporal bone and leaves the skull through the stylomastoid foramen near the mastoid process. It may be damaged when there is suppurative middle ear disease or trauma. The</p>

teeth, disease of these structures may give rise to referred pain in the ear. Therefore, if otoscopic examination is normal, examination of these other sites should be considered. In half of affected patients, the ear pain is referred.</p>
<p>The main causes of otalgia are listed in Box 20.1. Of the otological causes, acute infection of the cartilage of the pinna (perichondritis) can be very painful. Malignant otitis externa is not neoplastic. It is due to infection (usually Pseudomonas) and can spread to the skull base, especially in diabetic or immunocompromised individuals.</p>

a hearing aid. Hearing loss may be conductive, sensorineural or mixed, with both conductive and sensorineural components (Box 20.2). Conductive deafness is due to disease in the external ear canal, tympanic membrane or middle ear. Characteristically, the patient retains normal speech discrimination. Sensory deafness implies pathology in the cochlea, and neural deafness implies pathology in the cochlear nerve or the central connections of hearing, but in practice this distinction is difficult to make and rarely useful, and the term sensorineural deafness is used instead. Sensorineural deafness causes impairment of speech discrimination with recruitment; the latter is an abnormal perception of the increase of intensity of sound with increasing signal volume that results from damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. This leads</li>
</ul>
<p>to a decreased functional dynamic range, so that a small increase in sound intensity is uncomfortable. The patient may also notice an apparent difference in the pitch or frequency of a tone between the two ears (diplacusis). Most hearing loss is gradually progressive and related to ageing. Deafness is often secondary to occupational or social noise exposure, and is often inherited. Many drugs are ototoxic, and there are associations between hereditary hearing loss and neurological and renal disorders. Occasionally, sensorineural hearing loss occurs suddenly. A cause is only rarely identifiable.</p>

<p>Tinnitus is a ringing, rushing or hissing sound in the absence of an appropriate auditory stimulus. It can be caused by almost any pathology in the auditory pathways. It is strongly associated with hearing loss, although it occasionally occurs with normal hearing.

<p>Vertigo is an illusion of movement such that the patient either feels the world moving or has a sensation of moving in the world. Patients frequently have difficulty describing the symptom. Higher centre dysfunction, as in anxiety states or drug effects, may also cause dizziness. There are therefore many causes for symptomatic 'dizziness' (Box 20.3). A feeling of the room spinning associated with nausea or vomiting suggests an acute labyrinthine cause, especially if there are changes in hearing or tinnitus. Fortunately, most acute vestibular events are self-limiting, because even if one vestibular system is abnormal, the central connections can 'reset' the system over a period of a few days. The elderly are less able to compensate. In all age groups, vertigo may cause residual vague imbalance, particularly in association with movement or after alcohol ingestion. It is important to test for positional changes, as the commonest cause of vestibular vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), secondary to loose debris floating in the posterior semicircular canal.</p>

A hot, tender postaural swelling, pushing the pinna forward, suggests mastoid infection (Fig. 20.7). Incomplete development of the ear (microtia) occurs with narrowing (atresia) of the external meatus, but the auricle can also be displaced from its normal position (melotia) or pathologically enlarged (macrotia). These abnormalities may be associated with cysts or infection in a preauricular sinus.</li>

speculum that will comfortably fit the ear canal. Hold the otoscope like a pen between thumb and index finger, with the ulnar border of your hand resting gently against the side of the patient's head. In this way, any movement of the patient's head during the examination causes synchronous movement of the speculum, limiting any risk of accidental injury to the ear canal.

<p>The hand-held otoscope is satisfactory for most examinations, but the outpatient microscope offers the best view. Be familiar with the variability in appearance of the normal drum. The most common abnormality is tympanosclerosis (Fig. 20.10), which consists of white chalky patches in the drum caused by hyaline degeneration of the fibrous layer due to previous infection. Prolonged negative middle ear pressure may cause the drum to become thinned and atelectatic (Fig. 20.11), either diffusely or with a retraction pocket. Eustachian tube dysfunction and/or acute otitis media may cause a middle ear effusion (Fig. 20.12). Fluid behind the drum is often obvious, but when the drum is opaque, increased vascularity or retraction are useful clues. Perforations of the pars tensa are either central or marginal (Fig. 20.13). Marginal perforations extend to the annulus and may be associated with cholesteatoma (Fig. 20.14), whereas with central perforations there is a rim of retained membrane between the defect and the annulus. Both are described by their position in relation to the handle of the malleus (anterior, posterior or inferior) and by their size (Fig. 20.15).</p>
<p>The fistula test is indicated if the patient is dizzy with middle ear pathology. Press on the tragus to occlude the meatus and then apply more pressure. If the labyrinth is open, this pressure change will be applied to the inner ear. The patient will be dizzy and nystagmus may be induced.</p>

Strike the tuning fork and hold it near the external ear canal with the prongs vibrating towards the meatus (air conduction) and then against the mastoid process (bone conduction). Ask the patient which sound was louder. In subjects with normal hearing and those with sensorineural loss, air conduction is better than bone conduction (Rinne positive.) In conductive deafness, bone conduction is louder (Rinne negative), although patients with a small conductive loss (up to 30 dB ) may remain Rinne positive; it is only when the difference between air and bone conduction exceeds 40 dB that the Rinne test is consistently negative. Moreover, patients</p>

with a profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss will report a Rinne-negative response if the contralateral ear has normal or reasonable hearing. This is because although the vibrating tuning fork held adjacent to the test ear will only be heard in that ear, the same tuning fork placed on the mastoid process will also be heard in the non-test ear. For these reasons, masking (by rubbing) the non-test ear should always validate a negative response. If there
is doubt, a Barany box should be used to mask the contralateral ear.</p>
<p>In the Weber test, the base of the vibrating tuning fork is placed firmly on the vertex or forehead in the midline. With eyes shut, ask the patient whether the sound is heard in the midline or whether it is lateralized. With normal response or with hearing symmetrically reduced, the sound is heard in the midline. However, with one ear normal, the noise will be</p>
<p>louder on the side opposite to an ear with pure sensorineural loss, and on the same side as an ear with purely conductive hearing loss. The Weber test is simple and quick, but there is a high test-retest variability. Because all clinical tests of hearing have limited reliability, accurate formal audiometry in the ENT clinic is essential.</p>

<p>The unsteady patient requires a full neuro-otological examination. It is also necessary to examine the cardiovascular system (see Ch. 11). The aim is to localize the site of any potential lesion and possibly confirm a diagnosis, although sometimes all that is possible is to differentiate between central (brainstem) and peripheral (labyrinthine) lesions.</p>

<li>Nystagmus (see Ch. 19). The characteristic saw-toothed nystagmus of vestibular disease has a slow (labyrinthine) and a fast (central) component and is enhanced by movement of the eyes in the direction of the fast phase. Eye movements can also be assessed using Frenzel's glasses (Fig. 20.17). These are illuminated and have 20 -dioptre lenses that abolish visual fixation for the patient, thereby possibly unmasking nystagmus.</li>

The patient is laid back rapidly with his head extended over the end of the bed (Fig. 20.18). The classic response in BPPV involves a variable latent period when nothing happens. There is then a torsional nystagmus beating to the lower ear, with a variable feeling of vertigo. This lasts perhaps 5-30 seconds. With repetition, the response becomes less or absent. The condition is caused by debris in the posterior semicircular canal. It is frequently self-limiting, but if it persists it may be cured by the Epley particle repositioning manoeuvre. Other positive results are possible. Persistent immediate positional nystagmus without vertigo implies central pathology.

<p>A pure tone audiogram does not test discrimination. A speech audiogram measures the patient's ability to recognize words from phonetically balanced lists delivered at different sound levels to the test ear from a tape recording. The percentage of words correctly repeated by the subject is noted at each level. With normal hearing, all words are heard ( <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>100</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">100 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8056em; vertical-align: -0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">100%</span></span></span></span></span> optimal speech discrimination - ODS) at a sound intensity of 40 dB .

<p>An earpiece is inserted into the external meatus through which pass three channels. The first delivers a continuous tone into the ear canal during the test
(probe tone); the second has a microphone to record the sound intensity level within the ear canal; the third channel connects to a manometer so that the pressure within the canal can be altered (Fig. 20.22).</p>
<p>The external meatus is a rigid tube with a compliant end (the drum). Normally the middle ear and ear canal pressures are equal, and most of the sound introduced into the meatus is transmitted into the ear; only a minimum of sound energy is reflected back and measured by the microphone. Changing the pressure difference between the external and the middle ear causes the tympanic membrane to become less compliant. This increases the sound energy reflected back to the probe. These changes are plotted graphically on a tympanogram (Fig. 20.23). The test also measures the volume of the canal: a large volume indicates a tympanic perforation. Impedance (the reciprocal of compliance) is increased when the tympanic membrane is thickened or the middle ear has fluid, and is decreased when the drum is hypermobile or atrophic. Tympanometry is an objective test. It has particular value in children in the assessment of glue ear.</p>

<p>When a click or tone-burst is played into the ear, a very small noise is emitted in return, probably arising from the outer hair cells. These emissions are particularly prominent in neonates but become increasingly difficult to elicit with age. Testing does not require cooperation. When there is hearing loss there is no response. The technique is valuable in the screening of neonates and forms the backbone of the Universal Neonatal Hearing Screen programme.</p>

Cold water induces nystagmus away from the irrigated ear, and the opposite for warm water (COWS: cold opposite, warm same). The induced nystagmus is recorded and analysed using electronystagmography (Fig. 20.24). Nystagmus can be enhanced by the abolition
of optic fixation (see Frenzel's glasses above). The videonystagmoscope also allows monitoring of this response (Fig. 20.25) and allows recordings to be made. Peripheral lesions tend to cause a diminished response on one side (a canal paresis). A directional preponderance may be due to central disorders, especially in the brainstem.</p>

<p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the investigation of choice, but is not a substitute for clinical assessment of chronic ear disease. It is not specifically diagnostic of cholesteatoma (Fig. 20.26), but is useful in cranial trauma (Fig. 20.27) and in the evaluation of temporal bone neoplasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more useful in identifying soft tissue abnormalities in the cerebellopontine angle, especially vestibular schwannoma (Fig. 20.28). These present with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. MRI also helps assess tumour spread outside the temporal bone. MR angiography helps assessment of pulsatile tinnitus and vascular lesions.

posteriorly (Fig. 20.30). The lateral wall of the nose is formed by the three nasal turbinate bones; inferior, middle and superior (Fig. 20.31). Under each turbinate is a corresponding meatus. The nose constantly produces mucus - a pint a day - which is constantly propelled backwards by the cilia to the posterior choanae, whence it is swallowed, usually unnoticed.
The paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bones of the facial skeleton (Figs 20.31 and 20.32). They comprise the paired maxillary, frontal and ethmoid sinuses and the unpaired but bisected sphenoid sinus, and form the structure of the adult face. The ethmoidal cells or labyrinth comprises a number of small bony cells. The sinuses open into the nose

via small drainage channels (ostia). Their mucus is swept by cilia through the ostia to be mixed with mucus secreted by the nose. The middle meatus is the common pathway for drainage from the maxillary, the anterior ethmoid and the frontal sinuses. The anterior ethmoids are important because disease in these areas will compromise maxillary and frontal sinus drainage. Blockage of the ostia due to inflammation in the nose, with retention of mucus and secondary infection, is the presumed mechanism for sinus infection (rhinosinusitis). The upper teeth are closely related to the floor of the maxillary sinus: infection here may lead to sinus problems.

<p>Unilateral or bilateral blockage of the nose is common. Maximum resistance to airflow occurs at the front of the nose near the inferior turbinate. In the nasal cycle (2-6 hours long), one side is congested and one side decongested at any one time. The commonest cause of nasal blockage is allergic rhinitis. A constant blockage suggests a structural abnormality (deviated nasal septum, nasal polyposis, adenoidal hypertrophy (children)).</p>

<p>Nasal discharge may be mucoid, purulent or watery. It may contain blood. A purulent discharge suggests infection, either in the nose or in the sinus. In a child, unilateral discharge may be due to a foreign body retained in the nose. Mucoid discharge is more suggestive of allergic rhinitis. Watery discharge is indicative of vasomotor rhinitis. CSF leak is a rare but important cause; the discharge is clear, watery and salty tasting. Epistaxis (a nose bleed) varies in severity from a minor intermittent problem to a lifethreatening major haemorrhage that may require cautery. It tends to occur in children and the elderly. The arterial supply of the nose is from branches of the sphenopalatine artery (external carotid), and from the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries (internal carotid). These vessels anastomose in the anterior nasal septum, the site of most epistaxes. Epistaxis is associated with hypertension, trauma
(including nose-picking), rhinitis and bleeding disorders.</p>

<p>Loss of smell (anosmia) or impaired sense of smell is most often due to nasal obstruction, for example with nasal polyposis or allergic rhinitis. It also follows damage to nerve fibres passing through the cribriform plate after craniofacial trauma. Rarely, viral infection may cause permanent anosmia. Cacosmia is an unpleasant smell, usually unnoticed by the patient, caused by chronic anaerobic sepsis in the nose.</p>

<p>Pain in the face is very common, but pain limited to the nose is rare. Pain centred over a sinus may indicate infection or, rarely, a malignancy. There are many causes of facial pain. Some, such as cluster headache (causing transient nasal blockage and rhinorrhoea) and trigeminal neuralgia, are functional disorders, with well-defined features (see Ch. 14). Structural disorders, such as infection or tumour involving facial structures, may also present with facial pain. Investigation should usually include imaging by CT or MRI.</p>

<p>Inspect the nose and face from the front, side and back in a good light. Note the colour of the skin and any asymmetry of facial contours. Observe for scars and pigmentary changes. With age, the tip of the nose tends to droop. Deformities of the nasal bone and cartilage, such as saddle deformity, often follow a nasal fracture or other destructive disorders of the bony or cartilaginous septum. Palpate the nose and facial skeleton, especially the orbital margins, noting tenderness and any swelling, expansion or depression of bone. Facial swelling is unusual in maxillary sinusitis, but occurs with dental root infections and in carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. Inspect and palpate the palate and alveoli from inside the mouth using a gloved finger.</p>
<p>Examine the nasal vestibule and intranasal contents by gently pushing the tip of the nose upwards</p>

with a finger, preferably using reflected illumination from a head mirror. The nasal vestibule is lined with skin and contains vibrissae (thicker hairs): these become prominent in older men. Inspect the anterior nasal cavity with Thudicum's nasal speculum or an otoscope (Fig. 20.33). The nasal septum is rarely completely straight but should not be so bent that it is not possible to see the anterior end of the inferior turbinate. The majority of nasal resistance to airflow occurs in the front of the nose. Look for any area of granulation on the nasal septum and for any perforation (Fig. 20.34). Perforations may be secondary to cocaine snorting, digital trauma (nose-picking), surgical trauma, granulomatous conditions or inhalation of industrial dusts, notably nickel and chrome.</p>
<p>Nasal polyps are usually easily identifiable by their pale colour (Fig. 20.35) and their softness and lack of sensitivity to probing. In a child, an apparent polyp may be seen arising from the roof of the nose: this should not be probed as it may be the intranasal presentation of a meningocele. In children and adults, airflow through a patent nostril causes misting on a cold metal tongue depressor or mirror held at the nose. In a neonate, nasal patency is best estimated by observing any movement of a wisp of cotton wool held in front of each nostril, after blocking each in turn with the thumb. Nasal endoscopy

<p>If allergic symptoms are severe, there is merit in confirming extrinsic allergy by skin-prick testing (see Ch. 15). An important component of treating allergy is allergen avoidance and certainty of responsible allergens may encourage compliance. The common inhalant allergens (Box 20.5), together with any agents that have been suspected from the history, should be tested and compared to positive and negative controls (histamine and saline). Unfortunately, however, a negative response does not definitely</p>

<p>Plain X-rays are unreliable in the management of sinus disease but may be helpful in the absence of more specialized tests. A lateral X-ray may be useful in estimating the degree of adenoidal hypertrophy in young children (Fig. 20.38). Endoscopic nasal examination and CT scanning are the investigations of choice for sinus disease (Fig. 20.39). CT is useful in the management of chronic infection, trauma and neoplasia. However, there is a radiation dosage to the eyes and the investigation should be used only when the diagnosis is uncertain or to provide accurate anatomical information before surgery. MRI is less useful in sinus disease because of difficulties in interpretation. MRI is highly sensitive to changes in the

<p>The throat includes the oral cavity, the pharynx (oropharynx, nasopharynx and hypopharynx), the larynx and the major salivary glands. The oral cavity extends from the lips to the anterior faucial pillars. The oral cavity proper is bounded by the teeth laterally, the tongue and floor of the mouth inferiorly and the hard and soft palate superiorly. The pharynx extends from the base of the skull to the cricopharyngeal sphincter (Fig. 20.40). The oropharynx is bounded above by the soft palate and below by the upper surface of the epiglottis. Its anterior margin is defined laterally by the anterior faucial pillar, containing the palatoglossus muscle, and by the posterior third of the tongue. The posterior pharyngeal wall is its posterior boundary. The palatine tonsils are situated laterally between the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces. The base of the tongue contains the lingual tonsils. This lymphoid tissue, together with the adenoids and the tubal tonsil (lymphoid tissue around the Eustachian tube opening), makes up Waldeyer's ring, an important line of immunological defence. The hypopharynx consists of the posterior pharyngeal wall, the piriform fossae and the postcricoid area. The piriform fossae, which comprise the lateral walls of the pharynx adjacent to the larynx, are the routes by
which food is passed into the upper oesophagus. The larynx is a rigid structure consisting of cartilages, the most prominent of which are the paired thyroid cartilages, which articulate with the cricoid cartilage below. The epiglottis is attached to the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage and aids the separation of air and food passages during swallowing. The larynx consists of three compartments (Fig. 20.41): glottis, supraglottis and subglottis. The glottis is formed by the vocal folds. The glottis has poor lymphatic drainage, which may help to delay the spread of malignancy from this area. The epiglottis extends from the false cords below to the hyoid bone above. It has a rich lymphatic drainage, and therefore malignancy in this area is more frequently associated with metastatic disease. The subglottis is the narrowest part of the upper respiratory tract and extends from the glottis to the lower border of the cricoid.
The prime function of the larynx is to separate breathing and swallowing, thereby protecting the airway. Voice production is a secondary function that has arisen with evolution. Phonation occurs with movement of the vocal folds into the midline (Fig. 20.42). Changes in volume of the voice are caused by alterations in the subglottic pressure, whereas alterations in pitch are due to modification of the length and tension of the vocal folds. The quality of this basic laryngeal sound is modulated by resonance in the pharynx, air sinuses, mouth and nose.
The pharynx is innervated from the pharyngeal plexus (cranial nerves IX, X and XI). Interruption of this nerve supply by lesions at the jugular foramen leads to swallowing problems and severe morbidity. All the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus (cranial nerve X). In the chest, this nerve loops around the arch of the aorta on the left and the subclavian artery on the right, before running up to enter the larynx. The long course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve means it is more frequently affected by disease. The cricothyroid is supplied by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (cranial nerve X).
There are three paired major salivary glands (Fig. 20.43). The parotid gland lies anterior to the ear. Its duct opens opposite the second upper molar tooth. The submandibular gland lies far posterior in the floor of the mouth and may be palpated in the neck, under the mandible.

The smaller sublingual gland lies anteriorly in the floor of the mouth and its duct joins the submandibular duct.
The lymph nodes of the head and neck (Fig. 20.44) provide a barrier to the spread of disease, whether inflammatory or neoplastic. Enlargement implies that there is either primary disease within the nodes or that they have become involved</p>

<p>An ulcer is the commonest oral lesion. Traumatic ulcers heal quickly, although, if due to ill-fitting dentures or broken teeth, will rapidly recur, if not fail to heal. Aphthous ulcers are small, painful superficial ulcers of the tongue, buccal mucosa and palate, of uncertain cause which are painful but generally heal quickly. There is a high incidence of recurrence. Oral carcinoma may present as an ulcer and is frequently painless. Sometimes there will be other symptoms such as bleeding, loose teeth or halitosis but suspicious non-resolving lesions need to be biopsied. Thrush (fungal infection with Candida albicans) is a frequent cause of white patches or pain.

<p>A sore throat is one of the commonest of all symptoms. Viral pharyngitis is the most common cause. Tonsillar inflammation is also common. Acute follicular tonsillitis begins with local redness, developing into a punctate or confluent yellow exudate on the tonsils, often due to group A Streptococcus infection. In glandular fever (Epstein-Barr virus infection), the tonsils are covered with a white membrane</p>

Find out the frequency and severity of attacks of tonsillitis, as estimated by the amount of time lost from school or work, and any antibiotic treatment: such considerations help to decide whether tonsillectomy is merited. Generally, in children, at least four attacks a year for 2 years is the minimum indication for tonsillectomy.
An abscess adjacent to the tonsil (quinsy) is very painful, causing dysphagia and trismus (spasm in the lower jaw). Surgical drainage is usually required. Squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil is also often painful. It presents as an exophytic mass or ulcer. In the early stages, diagnosis is difficult. Ulceration in the oropharynx also occurs in glandular fever, rubella and streptococcal tonsillitis.</li>

<p>Stridor is noisy breathing associated with upper airway obstruction at the laryngeal level (Box 20.7). Stertor is noisy breathing at the oropharyngeal level and is nearly always caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Epiglottitis is particularly important in infants and small children up to the age of 7 years. It is associated with infection by Haemophilus influenzae type B, and may present with rapidly progressive airway obstruction and dyspnoea, fever, pharyngeal pain and drooling. Vaccination has reduced its incidence. Immediate antibiotic therapy may need to be supplemented by intubation or even tracheostomy. In adults, laryngeal carcinoma may cause stridor owing to direct blockage of the airway, to fixation of the vocal fold or with recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement. Croup, acute laryngotracheobronchitis in young children, causes less severe airway obstruction. The thick tenacious secretions are relieved by air humidification.</p>

<p>Dysphonia or hoarseness covers a range of symptoms, from subtle changes noticed by professional voice users to aphonia, when there is no voice. It may be caused by structural problems affecting the vocal fold, or by neurological disease (Box 20.8). Hoarseness followed by increasing airway obstruction is the typical presentation of a laryngeal neoplasm (Fig. 20.45). Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve anywhere along its course usually leads to hoarseness, although compensation from the unaffected side will limit symptoms. A lesion of the vagus above the exit of the superior laryngeal nerve produces a more breathy voice, as there is also loss of cricothyroid function. Acute vocal abuse and acute inflammation causes dysphonia, which is usually self-limiting. Long-term vocal abuse may lead to a number of changes of the vocal folds: singer's nodules, polyps (Fig. 20.46) or Reinke's oedema. These will often respond to speech therapy, although surgery may be necessary. It is also worth considering whether gastro-oesophageal (laryngopharyngeal) reflux may be implicated. Malignancy should be considered in any patient with dysphonia of more than 4 weeks' duration.</p>

<p>The causes of salivary gland swelling are outlined in Box 20.10.
The neck has a rich lymphatic system of nodes and channels that drain the head and neck (see Fig. 20.44). The deep cervical lymph nodes run in the carotid sheath. The most prominent of these is the jugulodigastric node, which can be palpated just posterior to the angle of the mandible and anterior to the anterior edge of sternomastoid. This is the most commonly enlarged node in upper respiratory tract infections, especially following tonsillitis. The commonest mass in the neck is a lymph node following infection, especially in children. Tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection should always be considered with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of a neck lump is partly suggested by the age of the patient (Box 20.11). Features that suggest malignancy are progressive enlargement, hardness, lack of tenderness, fixation to deep structures and size (a node more than 1 cm in diameter is more likely to be malignant). Ultrasound is a</p>

<p>With practice it is possible to inspect all of the oral cavity, the pharynx and the larynx. Use a headlight or a head mirror to ensure adequate illumination and keep both hands free for the manipulation of instruments. First check the lips, teeth and gums, the floor of the mouth and the openings of the submandibular and parotid ducts. Observe the corners of the mouth for cracks or fissures (angular stomatitis or cheilitis). In children, this is usually due to bacterial infection, but poor dentition in the elderly leads to cracks and candidiasis (thrush). This may also be seen in severe iron-deficiency anaemia and in vitamin <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">B</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{B}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8333em; vertical-align: -0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">B</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.3011em;"><span style="top: -2.55em; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (riboflavin) deficiency.

palpation, with one gloved finger in the mouth and synchronous palpation of the gland, may help to define pathology. Palpation is also valuable for examining the cheeks, tongue and even the tonsils on occasion. Tongue mobility (cranial nerve XII) should be assessed by protrusion and side-to-side movement. Look for wasting or fasciculation. Depress the tongue to inspect the tonsillar pillars, the palatine tonsils, soft palate and uvula. The tonsils and soft palate should be nearly symmetrical. Check the gag reflex (cranial nerve IX). The more distant portions of the pharynx can be inspected only with a laryngeal mirror or fibreoptic laryngoscope. For indirect laryngoscopy (Fig. 20.47), remove any dentures; gently hold the protruded tongue and ask the patient to take slow deep breaths. With the mouth opened wide, a warmed or demisted laryngeal mirror is introduced gently but firmly to the soft palate. Displace the soft palate upwards and backwards with the mirror and instruct the patient to say 'ee' or 'ah'. The larynx elevates towards the examining mirror. The vallecula, epiglottis, supraglottis and glottis are examined in turn. The whole length of each vocal fold should be clearly visible and the mobility of each side noted. Vision can be helped in the gagging patient by using a <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8056em; vertical-align: -0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">2%</span></span></span></span></span> lidocaine anaesthetic spray. If an inadequate view is obtained (this depends upon the skill of the examiner), the flexible fibreoptic nasal endoscope (Fig. 20.48) allows a good view in almost every case. If available, the flexible endoscopic examination is mostly used due to the superior view, and recording the examination for clinical review. Videolaryngostroboscopy (Fig. 20.49) is a specialized endoscopic examination, useful for detailed visualization of the vocal folds. In this technique, stroboscopic light is used through the endoscope to visualize the mucosal wave of the vocal fold and heighten diagnostic capabilities.</p>

<p>This is part of the routine assessment of any patient with suspected or proven disease in the throat. The neck is exposed and inspected from the front and side before the examiner stands behind the patient (Fig. 20.50) and follows a well-rehearsed routine so

that no area is missed. Start by palpating the nodes in the posterior auricular region, and then progressively feel for the nodes on the anterior border of the trapezius muscle down to the supraclavicular fossa. The latter area is palpated from behind forwards. The examining fingers then pass up the jugular vein, where the most important groups of nodes in the head and neck are situated, towards the ear. The jugular, parotid and preauricular areas are then examined, followed by submandibular and submental nodes. Finally, the nodes associated with the anterior jugular chain are examined. This brings the fingers to the thyroid gland (details of thyroid examination are in Ch. 16). Midline lumps should also be assessed with the patient protruding the tongue. Movement suggests attachment to the base of the tongue and implies the presence of a thyroglossal cyst (Fig. 20.51). The larynx should be mobile from side to side, and if the thyroid cartilage is held between thumb and first finger and gently moved against the cervical spine, it should grate. This</p>
<p>laryngeal crepitus is a normal phenomenon. It may be reduced or abolished by hypopharyngeal pathology or a mass in the prevertebral space displacing the larynx away from the cervical spine. Finally, auscultate the carotid arteries and the thyroid gland.</p>

<p>Fine-needle aspiration cytology is useful in virtually all neck lumps. If correctly performed, this will diagnose the vast majority of metastatic squamous carcinomas. It is less accurate in distinguishing lymphoma from reactive changes. If doubt remains then core or excision biopsy should be performed. Accessible lesions in the oral cavity and oropharynx may be biopsied in the clinic with either topical anaesthesia or a local anaesthetic injection (usually with lidocaine).</p>

<p>A soft-tissue lateral neck X-ray is not a sensitive investigation, even for detecting foreign bodies. A barium swallow is a dynamic investigation and can locate obstruction in the oesophagus or demonstrate incoordinate swallowing. It can be combined with video recording (videofluoroscopy). It is less helpful in evaluating the hypopharynx, where endoscopy under a general anaesthetic is the preferred investigation. Endoscopy is also helpful in taking biopsies in suspected malignancy. Ultrasound is useful for the evaluation of neck masses and the thyroid gland.

<p>There are two main principles in the management of sexually transmitted infections. First, an infected patient implies that at least one other person is also infected. Thus, treating a patient in isolation will not control the spread of these diseases. Second, a patient may harbour more than one sexually transmitted infection (Box 21.1). Many infections are asymptomatic, acquired months or even years previously. Patients are often uncomfortable or embarrassed to give their sexual history or a history of genitourinary symptoms as stigma and shame are often attached to sexually transmitted infections. Remember that babies, monogamous partners and victims of rape and sexual abuse can also be infected.</p>
<p>The interview and examination must be carried out in private, in strict confidence and avoiding any disapproving, judgemental or moralistic attitude. As with other clinical problems, diagnosis is achieved by history (Box 21.2), examination and relevant laboratory tests. Following diagnosis, effective treatment and partner notification/contact tracing should be instituted promptly. In children under 16 years of age, ensure they are able to comprehend (follow the Fraser's guidelines in the UK) and it is essential to exclude any child protection issues and sexual abuse.</p>

<p>This is nearly always a complaint of men. Ensure that the discharge is from the urethra and not from under the foreskin. Ascertain the colour and duration of the discharge. A purulent discharge suggests gonorrhoea, whereas chlamydial or 'non-specific' urethritis and Trichomonas vaginalis are more likely to give rise to a scanty mucoid or mucopurulent
discharge. Sometimes the patient only notices the discharge in the morning, or by staining of his underwear. Prostatic secretions, which are physiological, may present as urethral discharge in men who have abstained from sexual intercourse or masturbation.</p>

<p>Ask if the discharge is itchy or offensive. An itchy vaginal discharge is suggestive of thrush or, occasionally, trichomoniasis. Smelly discharges are usually due to trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis or retained foreign bodies such as tampons. Physiological discharge can occur after sexual stimulation or during pregnancy, but is not itchy or offensive. Vaginal discharge may also arise from gonococcal, chlamydial or herpetic infections of the cervix.</p>

<p>This is pain on sexual intercourse. In women, superficial dyspareunia is pain in the vulvovaginal area and can be due to vulvitis or lichen sclerosus. This must be differentiated from vulvodynia, which is chronic localized burning and soreness in the vulva and may be associated with vestibulitis, vestibular papillomatosis or subclinical warts, or may be idiopathic. However, vulvodynia can be aggravated by intercourse or tampon insertion.

<p>This is usually described as a 'sore'. Ask if it is painful or recurrent. Painful ulcers are usually due to genital herpes, chancroid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Behçet's disease or trauma, whereas a painless ulcer may be due to syphilis or lymphogranuloma venereum. However, syphilitic ulcers can be painful. The evolution of the ulcer is important. Genital herpes may start with local irritation followed by erythema, a group of papules, then blisters which ulcerate and crust before healing, but the majority present atypically such as an anogenital fissure. If the infection was acquired in a tropical country, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum and donovanosis should also be considered. Lymphogranuloma venereum is endemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) but is more likely to present with a proctitis rather than an ulcer. Ask whether the patient has applied any medicament that might interfere with microbiological tests. An acute anogenital ulcer is syphilitic or herpetic unless proved otherwise; herpetic ulceration persisting more than 1 month is an AIDS-defining illness.</p>

<p>Acute epididymo-orchitis may complicate a sexually transmitted infection. Painful scrotal swelling is also a feature of acute surgical emergencies such as torsion of the testis and strangulated inguinal hernia. Other causes include trauma and recent vasectomy. Acute epididymo-orchitis in sexually active men below the age of 35 is likely to result from gonococcal or chlamydial infection and in those over the age of 40 from bacterial urinary tract infection, such as that due to Escherichia coli. Testicular cancer may sometimes present as a painful swelling.</p>

<p>This is usually due to pediculosis pubis, scabies or other inflammatory genital conditions, such as allergic dermatitis, but may be psychological or be due to lichen simplex. Ask if sexual or household contacts also complain of itching. In pediculosis pubis, patients may notice 'crabs' and nits on the hair shaft. Itching at night is suggestive of scabies and is likely to be generalized except for the face.</p>

<p>An itchy rash on the vulva, glans penis or prepuce is seen in thrush, scabies and inflammatory dermatological conditions such as lichen sclerosus, lichen simplex or contact dermatitis. Non-itchy rash may be seen in secondary syphilis, circinate balanitis, which is a manifestation of Reiter's disease, and in other genital dermatosis. Fixed drug eruptions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichen planus and penile</p>

<p>Anal soreness, pain or itching, rectal discharge, pain on defaecation, a feeling of incomplete defaecation (tenesmus) and constipation may occur in infective proctitis resulting from herpes simplex, gonococcal or chlamydia D-K serovar infection or lymphogranuloma venereum. The latter may mimic chronic inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Anal itch (pruritus ani) may be secondary to rectal discharge or due to thrush, anal warts, dermatitis and poor anal hygiene. If the itch is worse at night, threadworm infestation should be considered. Pruritus ani is frequently psychological in origin. Sexually transmitted enteric infections such as giardiasis, shigellosis and salmonellosis in MSM may present with diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is also a common problem in HIV infection.</p>

<p>The skin, mouth, eyes and joints are commonly associated with sexually transmitted infections. Rashes may be seen in acute HIV infection, secondary syphilis, gonococcal septicaemia, Reiter's disease and occasionally in acute viral hepatitis. Keratoconjuctivitis may be seen in chlamydial, gonococcal and herpetic infection and is usually unilateral, whereas in Reiter's disease it is usually bilateral. Anterior uveitis may be seen in Reiter's disease, syphilis, HIV and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 infection. Joints may be involved in gonococcal arthritis, Reiter's disease and congenital (Clutton's joints) and late syphilis (Charcot's joints). Lower abdominal pain may indicate pelvic inflammatory disease, and right hypochondrial pain may indicate perihepatitis or FitzHugh-Curtis syndrome, which are all related to chlamydial or gonococcal infections.</p>

<p>A past history of genitourinary problems, sexually transmitted infections, gynaecological diseases, for example pelvic inflammatory disease and cervical dysplasia, and obstetric problems, such as stillbirths, miscarriages or babies with ophthalmia, is important. A change in the menstrual cycle may be due to pelvic inflammatory disease. A delayed menstrual period with unilateral lower abdominal pain may be due to ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydial cervicitis may cause postcoital bleeding, but other causes, including carcinoma of the cervix, must be excluded. Ask whether the patient is using contraception, including intrauterine contraceptive devices, which may predispose to pelvic inflammatory disease, or has taken any drugs recently, especially antibiotics. Enquire
about recreational drug use, particularly injecting drug use. Antibiotics, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy and immunosuppression may predispose to thrush.</p>

<p>Enquiry into the less embarrassing aspects of the medical history fosters the patient's confidence, so start with this before moving on to more intimate matters, such as (in the case of women) contraception and the menstrual history. Details of the sexual history should be obtained by simple questions. Ascertain the date of exposure: 'When did you last have intercourse/sex?' and particulars of sexual contacts over recent months. Heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual contact should be ascertained: 'Do you have intercourse/sex with men, women or both?' If married: 'When did you last have intercourse/sex with your wife/husband?' followed by 'When did you last have intercourse/sex with someone else?' and whether with regular partners, casual contacts or commercial sex workers (Did you pay for sex?). Are sexual partners traceable, for example place of intercourse: 'which town?' and 'whether abroad?' If there are several contacts, it is useful to identify them by first names.</p>
<p>The incubation period of infection may be assessed from the date of exposure to the onset of symptoms, and hence the probable cause. Tropical sexually transmitted infections should also be considered in patients presenting with genital problems acquired in the tropics. A history of intercourse with homosexual or bisexual men, injecting drug users or persons in or from an area of high HIV endemicity suggest AIDS as the cause of multisystemic symptoms and signs.</p>
<p>The type of sexual practice will dictate the sites from which to take tests (see below). It is also helpful to understand some of the common or unfamiliar terms that may be used in relation to sexual practices. 'Straight sex' indicates heterosexual (penovaginal) intercourse. Ask whether the person also practises insertive or receptive oropenile intercourse: 'Do you receive or give 'oral sex'?' Certain practices in homosexual or bisexual men ('gay sex') may predispose to particular infections; for example, if there is oroanal contact, the possibility of intestinal pathogens should be considered. Hepatitis B and HIV infections are more common in those practising receptive penoanal intercourse. Ask whether the patient practises insertive ('active', 'give anal sex') or receptive ('passive', 'receive anal sex') penoanal intercourse: 'When did you last have anal sex?', 'Do you give or receive anal sex?' or simply 'Are you 'active', 'passive' or both?' Some patients practise oroanal intercourse ('rimming'), insertive or receptive brachioanal intercourse ('fisting') and, rarely,</p>
<p>urinating onto each other ('watersports') or using faeces during intercourse ('scat'). 'Bare backing' is unprotected anal intercourse; 'cottaging' is sexual intercourse in public places.</p>
<p>Heterosexual couples may also practise penoanal intercourse. This should be enquired for if rectal infection is found in women, although this commonly occurs in association with infection at other genital sites without having anal sex. Sex 'toys' or 'dildoes' (artificial penises) are objects inserted into the rectum or vagina. 'Fisting' and 'toys' may cause injury presenting as an acute abdomen. 'Bondage', in which the person is tied up during sex, may be associated with masochism (sexual gratification through the infliction of pain on another). This should be considered if superficial injuries are present without an obvious cause.</p>
<p>Enquire about the use of condoms whether or not the patient is using other methods of contraception. Condom use should be advised if the person is at risk of acquiring or transmitting sexually transmitted infections, or if the efficacy of an oral contraceptive is affected by the concomitant use of other drugs. Many infections that may initially be acquired through non-sexual means, for example hepatitis B and HIV infection among injecting drug users and haemophiliacs, may be secondarily transmitted through sexual intercourse. Advice on non-penetrative 'safer sex' practices, such as body rubbing, dry kissing and masturbating each other, can be given to infected individuals who do not wish to have penetrative intercourse.</p>
<p>Sexual dysfunction, including erectile problems, premature and retarded ejaculation, often presents to a sexually transmitted disease clinic. Impotence is likely to be psychogenic if it is sudden in onset, related to life events, situational or intermittent, or if nocturnal or early morning erections are unaffected, and organic causes often have a psychogenic component. Curvature of the penis on erection may result from Peyronie's penile fibrosis.</p>

disease, there may be induration or a fibrotic lump inside the penile shaft. In the uncircumcised, establish that the prepuce can be readily retracted by gently withdrawing it over the glans penis.

Always carefully draw the prepuce forwards after examination; otherwise paraphimosis - painful oedema of the foreskin due to constriction by a retracted prepuce - may ensue.</p>
<p>Phimosis is narrowing of the preputial orifice, thereby preventing retraction of the foreskin; it may be due to lichen sclerosus. This predisposes to recurrent episodes of infection of the glans (balanitis), the prepuce (posthitis) or both (balanoposthitis). Circinate balanitis in Reiter's disease appears as erythematous eroded lesions which coalesce with a slightly raised and polycyclic edge. Multiple small yellow or white submucous deposits (Fordyce's spots) may be seen on the inner prepuce. These are ectopic sebaceous glands and do not require treatment. Smegma, which is greyish-white cheesy material arising from Tyson's glands, may accumulate under the prepuce if unwashed.</p>
<p>Hypospadias is a congenital abnormality in which the external urethral orifice is not at the tip of the glans penis but opens at its ventral surface in the midline, anywhere from the glans to the shaft, or even in the perineum. Epispadias, a similar opening situated on the dorsal surface of the penis, is rare.</p>
<p>Tiny regular papules arranged in rows around the coronal sulcus are coronal papillae and may be mistaken for warts. The coronal sulcus is the commonest site for a chancre. Inspect the meatus for inflammation, urethral discharge, narrowing (stricture) and warts. Retract the lips of the meatus to look for meatal chancre and intrameatal warts. Tyson's gland is on the fraenum of the penis and is not normally palpable, whereas the median raphe</p>
<p>leads from the fraenum to the inferior aspect of the penile shaft; both can be infected by gonococcal or chlamydial infection, leading to tysonitis and median raphe abscess, respectively.</p>
<p>Look at the scrotal skin for any redness, swelling or ulcer. Lift the scrotum to inspect its posterior surface. Tiny dark-red papules of angiokeratoma, or round, firm, whitish nodules of sebaceous cysts can sometimes be seen. Scabies causes erythematous nodular lesions on the scrotum and glans penis. If intrascrotal swelling is present, observe whether it appears to extend into the groin and note whether both testes are in the scrotum. Ulceration can result from Behçet's disease, fungation of an underlying tumour of the testis, or from a gumma.</p>

<p>Place both hands below the scrotum, the right hand being inferior, and palpate both testes. Arrange the hands and fingers as shown in Figure 21.2: this 'fixes' the testis so that it cannot slip away from the examining fingers. The posterior aspect of the testis is supported by the middle, ring and little fingers of each hand, leaving the index finger and thumb free to palpate. Gently palpate the anterior surface of the body of the testis; feel the lateral border with the index finger and the medial border with the pulp of each thumb. Note the size and consistency of the testis and any nodules or other irregularities. Now very gently approximate the fingers and thumb of the left hand (the effect of this is to move the testis inferiorly, which is easily and painlessly done because of its great mobility inside the tunica vaginalis). In this way, the upper pole of the testis can be readily felt between the approximated index finger and thumb of the left hand. Next move the testis upwards by reversing the movements of the hands and gently approximating the index finger and thumb of the right hand, so enabling the lower pole to be palpated. The normal testes are equal in size, varying between 3.5 and 4 cm in length.

<p>The head of the epididymis is found at the upper pole of the testis on its posterior aspect. It is a soft nodular structure about 1 cm in length. The tail lies on the posterolateral aspect of the inferior pole of the testis. The tail is also soft, but unlike the head it has a coiled tubular form. Occasionally the epididymis is situated anterior to the testis.</p>

<p>Finally palpate the spermatic cord with the right hand. Then exert gentle downward traction on the testis, place the fingers behind the neck of the scrotum and, with the thumb placed anteriorly, press forward with fingers of the right hand. The spermatic cord will be felt between the fingers and thumb; it is about 1 cm in width. The only structure that can be positively identified within it is the vas deferens, which feels like a thick piece of string.</p>
<p>Repeat the examination on the other side. Remember that the patient should also be examined standing up to look for varicocele - dilated tortuous veins like a bag of worms in the scrotum. Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis or cysts of the epididymis are common causes of a painless scrotal swelling. Hydrocele can be demonstrated by transillumination, using a bright light source held in contact with the enlarged testicle, preferably in a darkened room. A painless, unilateral, hard, enlarged testis must be considered malignant. Other painless enlargements include testicular gumma and tuberculous involvement. Acute epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the testis, strangulated inguinal hernia and some cases of testicular neoplasm cause a painful swelling. In torsion, the epididymis cannot be differentiated from the swollen testis, which lies at a higher level than the normal testis. In old age, the testes may become atrophic. In younger men, testicular atrophy often indicates chronic liver disease, usually alcoholic in aetiology, or it may be associated with previous torsion or varicocele. In swellings of uncertain origin, ultrasound is useful.</p>

<p>The anorectal region is particularly important in homosexual and bisexual men. Ask the patient to lie in the standard left lateral position with the knees drawn up, or in the knee-elbow position. Examine the anal and perianal skin for inflammation, ulceration, fissures and tags. Primary syphilis and herpes simplex virus infection can present as an anal fissure. Anal tags should not be confused with anal warts (condylomata acuminata), which are sessile or pedunculated papillomata. Anal warts in turn should not be confused with the flat warty lesions of</p>
<p>condylomata lata, which are the highly infectious lesions of secondary syphilis.</p>
<p>Gently insert a lubricated proctoscope and examine the rectal mucosa for pus, inflammation, ulceration, warts and threadworms. Take rectal tests. In patients who practise frequent receptive penoanal intercourse, the anus may be lax.</p>

<p>It is best to examine women in the lithotomy position. Examine the perineum, vulva and labia majora and minora for discharge, redness, swelling, excoriation, ulcers, warts and other lesions. In rape and sexual abuse cases, look for evidence of trauma. In such cases, forensic and genital examination by specially trained personnel may be required. Redness and swelling of the vulva with excoriations may be seen in thrush and trichomoniasis. Separate the labia and palpate the Bartholin's glands: normally they are not felt. Bartholin's abscess may result from gonococcal or chlamydial infection, and purulent discharge may be observed from Bartholin's duct, which is between the upper two-thirds and lower one-third of the labia. Wipe away any contaminating vaginal discharge from the urethral meatus and insert a bivalve Cusco speculum moistened with water or lubricating jelly. Lubricating jelly should not be used if a cervical cytological smear is to be performed. Note any inflammation of the vaginal wall (vaginitis) and the colour, consistency and odour of any discharge. A curd-like or cheesy white discharge suggests thrush, a frothy greenish-yellow discharge trichomoniasis and an off-white homogeneous discharge bacterial vaginosis. The last two conditions also have a fishy odour. Take tests (see below) from the posterior fornix of the vagina.</p>
<p>Wipe the cervix with a swab and examine it for discharge from the external cervical os, for ectopy or ectropion (ectopic columnar epithelium) and for cervicitis, warts and ulcers. Nabothian follicles may present as yellowish cysts, which may have prominent vessels on their surface, and are normal. Mucopurulent cervicitis may be caused by gonococcal or chlamydial infections (Fig. 21.3). Warts on the cervix appear as either flat or papilliferous lesions. Take tests, including a smear for cervical cytology, if indicated, to detect dysplasia and cancer of the cervix. This is particularly important because of the association of cervical cancer with oncogenic human papilloma virus infections. Then remove the speculum. Next examine the urethral orifice for discharge, inflammation and warts, and take endourethral tests (see below). Examine the anal region for lesions, as in homosexual men. If indicated, insert a lubricated proctoscope and examine the rectal mucosa for discharge or inflammation, and take tests.

<p>Look for pediculosis pubis ('crabs') and nits. Molluscum contagiosum lesions appear as pearly or pinkish umbilicated papules. Look at the groins for tinea cruris, thrush and erythrasma. Tinea cruris and erythrasma give rise to a rash with a well-defined border whereas, in thrush, the border is less well defined, often with erythematous satellite papules outside it. Erythrasma lesions show a coral-red fluorescence with Wood's light, an ultraviolet light used in the diagnosis of skin conditions.</p>
<p>Swelling in the groin is usually due to hernia, lymphadenopathy or undescended testis in men. Genital ulceration with tender suppurative inguinal lymph nodes (buboes) will suggest chancroid and lymphogranuloma venereum. In lymphogranuloma venereum, the ulcer may be transient and the buboes may have a grooved appearance resulting from lymphadenopathy above and below the inguinal ligament - 'sign of the groove'. In primary syphilis, lymphadenopathy is painless, with mobile and rubbery nodes, although they can be painful if there is pyogenic secondary infection. Anal, penile and vulval carcinoma may metastasize to the inguinal</p>
<p>lymph nodes. Inguinal lymphadenopathy may be part of a generalized disorder, as in lymphoma, secondary syphilis or viral infections, for example infectious mononucleosis and that due to HIV infection. Donovanosis may give rise to pseudobuboes, which are inguinal subcutaneous granulomata.</p>

<p>The worldwide spread of HIV infection has resulted in a dramatic lowering of life expectancy in some countries, especially in Africa. HIV infection is categorized into A, B and C (Box 21.3), based broadly on the clinical evolution of the immunodeficiency state that leads to the development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), on average some 8-15 years after infection if untreated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acute primary illness - with fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, muscle pain and sore throat, often with an erythematous, maculopapular rash and headache. Night sweats, weight loss, diarrhoea, meningism, neuropathy and oral thrush may occur. There is HIV viraemia and
severe immunosuppression, indicated by a high plasma HIV-RNA and a low CD4 T-lymphocyte count.</li>
<li>Asymptomatic phase - following the acute infection (primary HIV or acute seroconversion infection), the patient may be asymptomatic, or there may be persistent lymphadenopathy; the HIV-RNA decreases and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count increases and stabilizes (Fig. 21.4) to a baseline level.</li>
<li>Symptomatic phase (category B).</li>
<li>AIDS-defining illnesses (category C) - especially opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and neoplasms such as Kaposi's sarcoma (Fig. 21.5) and lymphoma.
Assessment of the patient with HIV infection should assess the extent of the disease and its complications. Multisystem involvement is common, and in each system there may be multiple causes. Examination of the mouth and the skin may provide clues that a patient is immunosuppressed. Common chest infections include tuberculosis, Pneumocystis and other bacterial pneumonias.

<p>A generalized rash occurs in drug allergy and in acute viral infections such as HIV seroconversion illness, acute viral hepatitis, cytomegalovirus infection and infectious mononucleosis as well as acute toxoplasmosis. The generalized rash of secondary syphilis can be itchy or non-itchy, and commonly involves the palms and soles. Gummata of the skin may be present in late syphilis. In disseminated gonococcal infection, pustules with an erythematous base are seen mainly on the limbs, particularly near joints. Excoriated papules and burrows are features of scabies; generalized or crusted scabies may present as widespread crusted lesions. A psoriasis-like rash and keratoderma of the feet may be present in Reiter's disease. Behçet's disease causes recurrent painful orogenital ulcers. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can also present with painful orogenital ulceration and target lesions on the skin. In HIV infection, acute herpes zoster or scars of previous shingles, seborrhoeic dermatitis, severe fungal and bacterial infections, facial molluscum contagiosum and warts, bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi's sarcoma may be present. The last may present with purplish nodules or plaques (Fig. 21.5).</p>

<p>The mouth is a common site for syphilitic lesions: extragenital chancres in primary syphilis, mucous patches and snail-track ulcers in secondary syphilis, and leukoplakia, chronic superficial glossitis and gummatous perforation of the palate in late syphilis. In congenital syphilis, linear scars radiating from the mouth, known as rhagades, and Hutchinson's incisors - dome-shaped incisor teeth with a central notch - or Moon's/mulberry molars may be present. Genital herpes can spread to the mouth and vice versa if the patient practises orogenital intercourse. In HIV infection, oral hairy leukoplakia, consisting of persistent white hairy patches on the side of the tongue, and oral thrush, consisting of curdy white patches which can be removed, leaving behind a raw surface (Fig. 21.7) or erythematous areas, may be

<p>Pediculosis pubis may be seen on the eyelashes. Conjunctivitis can be due to direct infection by Chlamydia, gonococcus, herpes simplex virus or molluscum, or can arise indirectly, as in Reiter's disease. Anterior uveitis (iritis) can be seen in Reiter's disease, secondary and late syphilis, Behçet's disease and HIV and HTLV-1 infection. Secondary and late syphilis can present with cranial nerve palsies including cranial nerves III, IV and VI and choroidoretinitis. Congenital syphilis can present with interstitial keratitis, iritis and choroidoretinitis. Argyll Robertson pupils are small irregular pupils seen in neurosyphilis, particularly tabes dorsalis. They are non-reactive to light, but the accommodation reflex is present. In HIV infection, there may be retinal exudates and haemorrhages due to retinal infarcts, and cytomegalovirus infection may cause a segmental or diffuse retinitis with exudates and haemorrhage while herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus can cause acute retinal necrosis.</p>

<p>Gonococcal and chlamydial infection can cause lower abdominal pain and tenderness if endometritis or salpingitis supervenes, and right hypochondrial pain and tenderness if perihepatitis (FitzHughCurtis syndrome) is present. Sexually transmitted hepatitis includes secondary syphilis and viral hepatitis. Hepatosplenomegaly may be present in secondary syphilis, acute viral hepatitis, HIV infection and associated opportunistic infections, or lymphoma. In HIV infection, retrosternal pain on swallowing indicates oesophageal infection by candida, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infection. Acute pancreatitis may complicate treatment with drugs such as didanosine. Renal colic may result from protease inhibitors (e.g. indinavir, atazanavir, darunavirinduced stones).</p>

<p>The Gram-staining procedure is outlined in Box 21.4. If the patient has passed urine just before the test, the urethral smear may show no polymorphonuclear leukocytes because the urine will have washed out the accumulated urethral material. In such cases, the patient should be asked to reattend for an overnight or late afternoon urethral smear after holding urine for 8 or more hours. Gramnegative intracellular diplococci, which appear as opposing bean-shaped cocci within polymorphonuclear leukocytes under the microscope (Fig. 21.8), suggest gonococcal urethritis.

A wet preparation, made by mixing urethral material using a loop with a drop of normal saline on a slide, can be examined by brightor dark-field illumination for Trichomonas, which appear as ovoid protozoa with beating flagellae and in jerky motion. Continuing symptomatic urethritis a week or more after successful treatment for gonorrhoea indicates that the patient has postgonococcal urethritis, a non-gonococcal urethritis unmasked following treatment for gonorrhoea.</p>

<p>This test still has a role when there are no facilities for urethral smear. Ask the patient to pass urine into two clear plastic cups, approximately 50 ml in the first glass and 100 ml in the second. The presence of several specks or threads that sink to the bottom in the first glass, with a clear second glass, indicates anterior urethritis; if there are threads in both glasses, posterior urethritis is indicated. Phosphaturia causes hazy urine in both glasses that clears with the addition of acetic acid. If the urine still remains hazy and there is pus in the urethral smear, this suggests either sexually transmitted urethritis with ascending infection in the bladder, or bacterial urinary tract infection with descending non-sexual infection to the urethra. The latter can be tested by a mid-stream urine culture. The urine must always be checked for sugar, protein, blood, cells and casts.</p>

<p>To investigate the cause of a genital ulcer, first cleanse the base of the ulcer with normal saline, and then gently squeeze it until a drop of serum exudes. Catch the exudates on the edge of a cover slip. Place this on a glass slide and press down firmly between filter paper. Examine the slide under dark-field microscopy for the characteristic morphology and movements of Treponema pallidum (Fig. 21.9) bending itself at an angle, rotating forward on its long axis or alternating between contraction and expansion of its coils. Dark-field examination should be repeated for several days if syphilis is suspected.</p>
<p>Sometimes dark-field microscopy of suspected syphilitic ulcers may be negative, particularly if the patient has used a topical antiseptic or antibiotic cream. If regional lymph nodes are enlarged, a lymph node aspiration can be performed. After infiltration of the skin with <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8056em; vertical-align: -0.0556em;"></span><span class="mord">1%</span></span></span></span></span> lidocaine, 0.2 ml of normal saline is injected into the node, the needle tip moved around in the node and then the saline aspirated. A drop is placed between a glass slide and cover slip, pressed between filter paper and examined under the dark-field microscope. In oral chancres, commensal treponemes from the gum margins may be confused with Treponema pallidum: because of this, immunofluorescent staining for pathogenic treponemes of serum from the ulcer, air-dried on a slide, is advisable. However, dark-field examination can be performed from oral ulcers away from the gum margin.</p>

<p>There are two groups of serological tests for syphilis:
1 Non-specific/cardiolipin:</p>
<ul>
<li>anticardiolipin antibody, such as Venereal Disease Research Laboratories (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR).
2 Specific antitreponemal antibody tests:</li>
<li>treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA)</li>
<li>T. pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA)</li>
<li>T. pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA)</li>
<li>T. pallidum line immunoassay (LIA)</li>
<li>fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-abs).
The titre of the non-specific tests indicates disease activity and is useful for following up patients, particularly those who have been treated for primary, secondary or early latent syphilis, when the test should become negative or sustain a greater than two-fold dilution or four-fold decrease in antibody titre within 6-12 months. After successful treatment of all stages of syphilis, the specific tests usually remain positive whereas the VDRL or RPR
test may slowly revert to negative, but commonly remains positive in lower titre in late syphilis. A greater than two-fold dilution or four-fold increase in antibody titre following treatment indicates recrudescence or reinfection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The presence of a positive VDRL or RPR test on two occasions with negative specific tests and the absence of any evidence of treponemal disease indicate a biological false positive reaction. Acute false positive reactions may be due to acute febrile infections such as pneumonia, malaria, HIV infection and infective endocarditis, pregnancy and vaccination; they last less than 6 months. Chronic false positive reactions may indicate autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but can also occur in antiphospholipid syndrome, intravenous drug abusers, lepromatous leprosy and old age.</p>
<p>All patients should be screened for syphilis with serological tests using the treponemal EIA, TPPA or TPHA or combination of the VDRL/RPR and TPHA/TPPA. A positive EIA is confirmed with TPPA or TPHA (and vice versa) and a VDRL/RPR performed to assess activity. LIA or FTA-abs is used as the final 'arbiter' when there are discordant results between EIA and TPPA/TPHA. FTA-abs is being superseded by LIA. If syphilis is endemic, these tests should be repeated after 3 months if initial tests are negative. If primary syphilis is suspected, the EIA-IgM or FTA-abs IgM test is also performed, as this can be the first serological test to be positive, although any one or combination of treponemal tests may be positive. In babies with suspected congenital syphilis, the EIA-IgM or FTA-abs tests using an IgM conjugate should be requested because of passive transfer of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta. When treponemes cannot be demonstrated, positive serological results must be confirmed by a second set of tests, but treatment should be started immediately in early infectious syphilis, or in pregnant women while awaiting confirmation.</p>
<p>Endemic treponematoses, such as yaws, bejel and pinta, may result in positive serological tests for syphilis. It is not possible to differentiate the treponematoses by serological tests. Patients may recall having such infection, or there may be a history of being brought up in the countryside in endemic areas, with evidence of signs of such infection, such as 'tissue-paper' scarring of the shins in yaws, which may suggest non-venereal treponematoses. However, there may be coinfection with syphilis, and it would be prudent to treat all positive treponemal serology as for syphilis.</p>

<p>Screening for antibody to HIV, the causal agent for AIDS, is advisable for patients at risk of infection because of the possibility of early intervention with</p>
<p>anti-HIV agents, preventative treatment against opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, and the prevention of transmission from mother to child. The latter is achieved by treating both mother (antepartum, during labour and at delivery) and baby at birth with antiretroviral, caesarean section and avoidance of breastfeeding. The test may also be indicated to confirm or exclude HIV infection as a cause of immunosuppression or problematic medical illness. Consent from the patient for the test to be carried out, with information regarding the test, is desirable. The test should be repeated at 3 months to cover the 'window' period for incubating infection although 4th generation test (include both the HIV antibody and P24 antigen) can be positive by 6 weeks. HIV-RNA viral load testing can also be performed for patients suspected of acute HIV infection, as the HIV antibody test may initially be negative. Immunological assessment must include analysis of lymphocyte subtypes, especially CD4 and CD8 counts: a selective reduction in the numbers of circulating CD4 cells is characteristic of the disturbed immune state. The HIV-RNA test and the CD4 T-lymphocyte count are prognostic indicators of HIV infection and can be used to monitor progression as well as treatment efficacy. Other investigations will depend on the suspected systems involved. Patients with headache or neurological signs should first have a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging brain scan to exclude intracerebral lesions before a lumbar puncture is performed. HIV genotypic or phenotypic resistance tests are helpful in deciding on the choice of antiretroviral regimen in treatment-naïve patients, or in those who are failing treatment.</p>

<p>Ophthalmia neonatorum is defined as purulent conjunctivitis in the first 4 weeks of life. It should be differentiated from 'sticky eyes', which frequently result from blocked lacrimal ducts.</p>
<p>Ophthalmia neonatorum is commonly due to gonorrhoea, Chlamydia or non-sexually transmitted bacteria. A Gram-stained conjunctival smear can be a useful guide. The presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with Gram-negative intracellular diplococci is presumptive evidence of gonorrhoea, but rarely may indicate Moraxella catarrhalis infection; culture must be carried out for full identification. The presence of pus cells with bacteria indicates bacterial ophthalmia, whereas the presence of pus alone suggests chlamydial ophthalmia. Chlamydial NAAT such as PCR, SDA or TMA tests, cultures for gonorrhoea and other bacteria should be performed. Mixed infections may occur.</p>
<p>Chest symptoms such as a staccato cough and rapid breathing with poor feeding in the absence of fever may indicate chlamydial pneumonia. Auscultation of the chest may be normal but the chest X-ray may show consolidation.</p>
<p>If the ophthalmia is due to gonococcal or chlamydial infection, it is important to check the parents and their sexual partners.</p>

<p>The Barthel Index should be used as a record of what a patient does, not as a record of what he was able to do previously. The main aim is to establish the degree of independence from any help, physical or verbal, however minor and for whatever reason. The need for supervision means the patient is not independent. Performance over the preceding 24-48 hours is important, but longer periods are relevant. A patient's performance should be established using the best available evidence. Ask the patient or carer, but also observe what the patient can do. Direct testing is not needed. Unconscious patients score 0 throughout. Middle categories imply that the patient supplies over 50% effort. Use of aids to be independent is allowed. <a href="#user-content-fnref-0" data-footnote-backref="true" class="data-footnote-backref" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
