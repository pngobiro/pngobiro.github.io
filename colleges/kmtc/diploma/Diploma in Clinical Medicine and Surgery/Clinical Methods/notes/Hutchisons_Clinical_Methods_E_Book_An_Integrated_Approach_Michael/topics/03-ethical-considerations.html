                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The cornerstone of a good relationship between doctor and patient is trust. In primary care, this relationship (often in the context of caring for the whole family) may be built up over several years, but in hospital practice or in an emergency, the patient and the doctor may be meeting for the first time. Patients expect a high standard of behaviour and care when they seek medical help. This includes the following expectations:</p>

                            <li class="list-item">

                        <p>Always assume that a patient is able fully to understand the nature of the medical problem and its implications, regardless of your impression of their educational level. Some patients like to discuss what they would like to know early in a consultation, and many will say clearly what information they would like to be given to the family. Occasionally, family members may feel that the patient would not be able to comprehend medical information; or ask that they are 'protected' from the full details of a serious illness. Patients may insist that they do not wish the family to know about their medical problems or, sometimes, that they themselves do not wish to know the diagnosis. In all such instances, the needs and rights of each individual patient should be considered paramount, over and above those of the family, in the event of conflict.</p>

                    <section id="autonomy-and-consent" class="content-section">
                        <h2>Autonomy</h2>
                        <p>The fundamental principle underlying medical ethics is autonomy: the patient has the right to decide his or her own medical destiny. This gives rise to the concept of seeking the patient's consent for medical interventions, for research and for teaching.</p>
                        <p>Only in the case of a minor or a mentally disturbed person may consent be sought from the patient's lawful parents or guardians. Assent, but not consent, may be sought from relatives, for example in the case of an unconscious patient in an intensive care unit. The doctor therefore has a duty not only to advise, but also to explain. This principle crosses all religious and cultural boundaries.</p>

                        <h3 id="consent">Consent</h3>
                        <p>The patient's consent should be sought for any treatment, however minor, even when that consent might appear implicit as, for example, by attendance at an emergency unit with injury. Sometimes assessment of a minor symptom discloses a separate, more serious issue. In such circumstances, consent to investigate the new problem is required.</p>
                        <p>In order to give consent, a patient must have sufficient, accurate information about the illness in order to make an informed judgement about whether its investigation and treatment are justified. There are four requirements of the doctor discussing an intervention with a patient:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content">The procedure itself must be described, including the technique and its implications, and the intended benefit of doing it.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="list-marker">2</span>
                                <span class="list-content">Information about the risks and complications must be given, which usually means all the risks, as well as some information about the consequences of the complication (e.g. perforation at colonoscopy is a rare occurrence but, if it happens, a laparotomy and colostomy may be needed).</span>

                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker">3</span>
                                <span class="list-content">Associated risks (e.g. from anaesthesia or from other drugs that may be necessary) should be described.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker">4</span>
                                <span class="list-content">Alternative medical or surgical investigations or treatments should be discussed, so that the reasons for the specific advice given are clear. In addition, the implications of the 'do nothing' option should be discussed.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="obtaining-consent">Obtaining consent</h3>
                        <p>The amount of information divulged will vary according to the context of the discussion and according to the needs of the patient as they emerge in the consultation. The objective is not to place the patient in the situation of having to decide between conflicting medical data, but to explain why a particular investigation or treatment is being recommended. The patient must not feel under duress.</p>

                        <h4 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the scene</h4>
                        <p>Discussions regarding consent for investigation and treatment should be conducted in a suitable environment that is quiet, free of interruptions and away from unnecessary observers, such as other patients or unfamiliar nurses or students. Make time for the discussion and turn off pagers or mobile phones which, if they interrupt a discussion, can give the impression that you are rushed and fitting the patient into a busier, more important schedule. Use simple language that the patient can understand. Be patient. If necessary, and with the patient's permission, involve relatives. If there is likely to be a language problem, make sure that an interpreter (not a relative) is available. At the end of the discussion, check that the patient has actually understood. A written summary of the information supplied should be given to the patient for later consideration.</p>

                        <h4 id="implications-of-consent-or-refusal">Implications of consent or refusal</h4>
                        <p>Some patients, after detailed discussion, decline the recommended investigation or treatment. This should not result in the doctor being any less committed to their welfare. Discussions regarding alternative strategies should commence within the framework of what has been agreed and what is acceptable to the patient. If explicit consent is given, the patient and doctor should both sign an appropriate consent form. This procedure should be followed for all serious interventions. In hospital, this will be a standardized form, and a similar form should be used in family or private practice to verify that the discussion took place. The act of both parties signing the form does not constitute proof that consent has been lawfully given but merely documents that a discussion took place. It is good practice to make a separate, contemporaneous note describing what was discussed.</p>

                        <p>There are three aspects of consent that are required in law:</p>

                        <h3 id="competence-and-capacity-for-consent">Competence and capacity for consent</h3>
                        <p>The definition of mental capacity is given in Box 3.1. If the patient does not have capacity to make a decision, the doctor must involve the relatives, although the doctor is still taking the final decision. If the patient does not have capacity and has no relatives, in the UK the doctor must involve an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to help with decision-making, particularly if consenting for surgery or for decisions about change of living circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Special difficulties with consent arise when the patient is unconscious. If treatment is necessary in order to save life, it can and must be given without waiting for consent. If relatives are available, they should be consulted, but their wishes are not necessarily paramount in the decision to initiate life-saving therapy. The relatives may thus assent to treatment, but cannot legally consent to it (in the UK). This limitation also means that relatives cannot legally refuse treatment that is medically in the best interests of the patient, although a conflict of this kind should be reason to consider, carefully and in detail with the relatives, the reasons for disagreement.</p>
                        <p>Consent for the treatment of children requires special consideration. In general, a minor (i.e. a person under the age of 16 years) can be treated without parental consent, provided that care has been taken to ensure the child understands the nature of the treatment proposed and its possible risks, adverse effects and consequences. However, this should be a most exceptional decision. In practice, the parents' agreement should almost always be sought. An obvious exception would be in an emergency, such as after a life-threatening head injury, or when non-accidental injury is suspected. Difficult decisions sometimes arise, for example when the prescription of contraceptive drugs to a young girl is requested in circumstances she does not wish her parents to know, or parents refusing to allow a bleeding child to have a blood transfusion for religious reasons.</p>

                        <h3 id="appropriately-informed">Appropriately informed</h3>
                        <p>The point at which a patient can be considered to be appropriately informed is a matter of judgement. Some patients make it clear that they do not wish for long and involved discussions whereas others are comfortable only when very full explanations have been given. It is often necessary to strike a balance. It is easy to frighten a patient by reciting unwelcome, but rare, possible complications of a procedure to such an extent that he refuses treatment. This should not be the objective of discussing treatment. If a procedure is so risky that the doctor feels it is not justified, and is therefore futile, the patient should be advised accordingly rather than being asked to decide for himself.</p>

                    <section id="confidentiality" class="content-section">
                        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                        <p>The fact that all aspects of the medical consultation are confidential forms the foundation for the consultation, as it allows the patient freedom of expression in the knowledge that disclosures made within the confines of the consulting room will not be made available to others.</p>
                        <p>The principle of confidentiality applies also to the medical records. These are held by the doctor or the group practice or, in the case of hospital records, by the hospital itself. Medical records are not available to anyone other than the medical and nursing staff treating the patient, and are immune from police powers of search. They are made available, however, with the permission of the patient and, once disclosed, can be used in evidence in court in both civil and criminal cases. Patients have the right to inspect their own medical records after seeking access in writing. In the UK, the principle of confidentiality is rigorously supported by the General Medical Council and its breach is regarded as a serious matter.</p>
                        <p>The main situations in which confidentiality can be relaxed include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>When the patient or his legal adviser allows it.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>When it is in the patient's interests.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>If there is an overriding duty to society as a whole.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>In cases of statutory disclosure.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Sometimes after death.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="with-permission">With permission</h3>
                        <p>A common example of relaxation of confidentiality with the patient's permission occurs when a consultation is witnessed (e.g. by medical students or a nurse). The patient should be given the opportunity to ask that others leave.</p>

                        <h3 id="in-the-patient-s-interests">In the patient's interests</h3>
                        <p>When it is necessary that another family member be informed about the nature of a patient's illness, for example in order to obtain information essential for effective treatment, it may be judged in the patient's best interests to break confidentiality. Another example might arise if a patient was judged mentally incompetent and it became necessary to involve a legal adviser to handle their financial and legal affairs during a severe illness. This generally requires permission from a court.</p>

                        <h3 id="an-overriding-duty-to-society">An overriding duty to society</h3>
                        <p>Occasionally confidentiality may be relaxed in the context of a known or possibly pending violent crime. In the case of an illness such as epilepsy or coronary heart disease that might impair the ability to control a vehicle, the responsibility to inform the authorities rests with the patient. Voluntary disclosure is encouraged, maintaining the principle of confidentiality between doctor and patient, but if the patient clearly does not make the disclosure, the clinician does have discretion to break this principle in circumstances that entail serious public risk (e.g. a patient having regular seizures who clearly has not informed the driving licensing authority).</p>

                        <h3 id="statutory-disclosure">Statutory disclosure</h3>
                        <p>Confidentiality is breached in the case of certain infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, that are statutorily notifiable to the public health authorities. There is also a statutory duty for a doctor to help in the identification of a driver involved in a road traffic accident who, for example, might have attended a surgery or accident and emergency department after the accident. The doctor in the witness box is in a state of privilege, and is protected against any action for breach of confidentiality when instructed by a court to disclose potentially confidential information. Similarly, a court can ask that medical documents be released to it if they are regarded as necessary for the completion of a fair trial of an accused person.</p>

                        <h3 id="inspection-of-medical-records">Inspection of medical records</h3>
                        <p>Patients have a lawful right to inspect their own medical records, and can see any reports concerning their own medical condition that have been prepared before they are released to another party. Such reports can only be prepared with the permission of the patient or at the request of a statutory body, as in the context of an order under the Mental Health Act, or in the jurisdiction of a recognized court. Generally, persons other than the patient have no right to inspect the medical records of an individual in the absence of written permission or when the records are subject to a subpoena from a recognized court.</p>

                        <h3 id="after-death">After death</h3>
                        <p>Generally, the principle of confidentiality should extend to patients who have died. In the cases of a number of deceased public figures of recent years (e.g. Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy), this principle was not adhered to on the grounds (not universally accepted) that there were matters of public interest involved.</p>

                        <h2>Specific Issues</h2>

                        <h3 id="organ-donation">Organ donation</h3>
                        <p>When a tissue that can be replaced by the donor's own tissues, such as blood or bone marrow, is given to another patient, no special ethical problem arises. When a living donor gives an irreplaceable organ, such as a kidney, difficulties arise. The donor must be of sound mind, not under duress and must not be placed in a position to gain financially by the gift. The sale of organs for transplantation is forbidden in all developed countries, and is rapidly becoming illegal in all countries. Similar considerations apply to the acquisition of donor organs from a minor, a practice about which it is particularly difficult to issue sound guidelines.</p>

                        <h3 id="resuscitation">Resuscitation</h3>
                        <p>Resuscitation is generally available in hospitals in the event that cardiopulmonary arrest occurs unexpectedly. However, this is not always successful, and many patients, recognizing the terminal nature of their illness, may request that resuscitation not be attempted. This is an entirely valid request, which should be respected once it is certain that the options are clearly understood by the patient.</p>

                        <h4 id="not-for-resuscitation">Not for resuscitation</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes a patient is so seriously ill that resuscitation is deemed inappropriate by medical and nursing staff. Clearly, this implies a value judgement by those concerned that, in some way, the patient's life is not worth saving. The situation most frequently arises when a patient has terminal cancer; resuscitation followed by a few hours or days of further pain and discomfort might be regarded as an unnecessary prolongation of the illness.</p>
                        <p>The decision to withhold resuscitation is a matter for which it is proper always to seek the patient's full, informed consent. The patient's views are paramount, and should be respected whatever the views of the clinicians and nurses or even the relatives. Relatives have no legal rights in a decision about the possible resuscitation of another individual. Although they may be consulted, and their views noted, they should not be allowed to influence a decision once it has been made by the individual, unless it is decided that the patient is not competent by reason of dementia, or some other impairment of judgement, to reach a decision. Overt depression, for example, might be a reason for not accepting a patient's expressed wish not to be resuscitated.</p>
                        <p>Although it might be thought not helpful to a patient to discuss this issue openly, in fact the reverse is usually the case. Most patients near to death are aware of their situation and welcome the opportunity for full discussion of the issues. The agreement of the patient and medical staff should be signed in the case record and most hospitals now use a formal protocol to document this procedure. Patients should always be resuscitated when cardiopulmonary collapse is unexpected and their wishes are unknown.</p>

                        <h3 id="consent-for-autopsy">Consent for autopsy</h3>
                        <p>Explicit consent is required for autopsy, as tissue samples will be taken and examined and some may be retained for future use. If this is intended, or is likely to occur, permission to retain the samples must be obtained as part of the consent for autopsy. This process of consent implies that the family will be given some idea of what studies might be undertaken on the retained samples in the future. It may be considered appropriate to consider whether any circumstances might develop in which the family might reasonably expect to be informed of the results of any such studies. For example, if information of a predictive or genetic nature were to be obtained in relation to the risk of vascular disease, or of specific cancers, then the family might wish to know of this.</p>

                    <section id="other-ethical-problems" class="content-section">
                        <h2>Other ethical problems</h2>
                        <p>There are several other problems that arise in medical practice, many of which are likely to become more important in the coming years.</p>

                        <h3 id="medical-negligence">Medical negligence</h3>
                        <p>Inadvertent adverse events are common in clinical practice, but few of these result in any legal action. Accusations of negligence often imply that a doctor-patient relationship has broken down. For the doctor, such an action is distressing and sometimes professionally damaging, even when shown to be unjustified.</p>
                        <p>In considering whether there has been negligence, it is necessary to establish breach of professional duty (whether the standard of care afforded the patient fell below what was expected). The standard expected is that of the ordinary skilled practitioner in the field in question, practising in the circumstances pertaining. It is not that of the greatest expert in the land. Thus, in assessing possible negligence, a court will need to establish:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>what the ordinary practice is</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>that the doctor did not follow this practice</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>that the doctor undertook a course of clinical management that no ordinarily skilled doctor in that specialty would have undertaken if acting with ordinary care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A mistake in diagnosis is not necessarily negligent, and the test of the standard of care applicable to the ordinary practitioner in the specialty will be applied by the court in considering this. Doctors are expected to keep up to date in their expertise by continuing medical education, and this is an aspect that is relevant to this judgement. Doctors in training are expected, by and large, to exercise an appropriate standard of care, and no patient should expect a lower standard of care simply because they are cared for by a junior doctor with less experience. This would clearly be wrong. It is imperative, therefore, that in treating a patient, advice and help should be sought from senior colleagues whenever relevant. If negligence has occurred, the legal process will go on to attempt to establish what harm resulted from the negligence, and that the harm would not have occurred if the negligent act had not been committed.</p>

                        <h3 id="hiv">HIV</h3>
                        <p>Testing for HIV requires the consent of the patient or individual. It is usual to counsel the individual about the consequences of a positive result before testing, as there are implications for lifestyle, future health and even employment hinging on the result of the test.</p>

                        <h3 id="genetics">Genetics</h3>
                        <p>The rapidly evolving availability of relatively accurate genetic testing for susceptibility to inherited diseases, based on the modern understanding of DNA and the genetic code, has raised a number of ethical problems for which most societies are not well prepared. For example:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Who should have genetic tests done?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>What should be done with the results?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Who, if anyone, should have access to the information, other than the patient?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>How should expensive treatments that may be possible for genetically determined disorders be made available?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Is it socially and economically appropriate to prevent such disorders?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The application of genetic information to medical practice is a current major area of change. It can be expected to have profound implications for the management of most aspects of disease, and for the ways in which all societies view the acquisition and availability of medical information.</p>

                        <h3 id="genetic-counselling">Genetic counselling</h3>
                        <p>Genetic counselling is relatively long-established. The clinical geneticist will usually be asked to assess the risks of genetically determined disease in the context of statistical data or a known familial occurrence of a disease, for example Down's syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis. There is knowledge about the genetic causation of each of these conditions, and certain tests with various probabilities of accuracy are available to assess the risk for individuals in a family, and for the risk that a planned pregnancy might result in an affected offspring. Major difficulties arise in deciding whether to inform someone who has been shown by genetic testing to be certain to develop a disease in later life, for example Huntington's disease. Such decisions should ideally be made before testing is undertaken at all. Even when offering counselling about the risks for planned pregnancies, similar difficulties arise. The social costs in terms of unresolved problems to individuals and their families of offering treatment or prevention for genetic disorders are largely undetermined at present. Practice in this context will change as knowledge and experience accumulate.</p>

                        <h2>Principles of medical ethics</h2>
                        <p>Several modern attempts have been made to encapsulate the principles of ethical medical behaviour in a series of simple statements. The Declaration of Geneva (Box 3.7) represents a modern attempt to restate the Hippocratic Oath in contemporary language. The International Code of Medical Ethics (Box 3.3) was derived from these principles, and restates them in more direct terms. The Declaration of Helsinki (1975) sets out recommendations for the guidance of doctors wishing to undertake biomedical research involving human subjects. The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki are generally recognized as relevant to the design of research protocols. The UK General Medical Council's duties of doctors are listed at the end of Chapter 1.</p>
