                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>All medical history taking, examination, investigation and management are intensely personal matters for patients, although their consent to such involvement is implied by their presence in the clinic or ward. In obstetric and gynaecological practice, intimate details must be elicited; this requires tact, discretion, consideration and the maintenance of proper confidentiality. Women may have particular expectations of their doctors, and complying with these may not be easy. A gentle manner and a genuine interest in the patient help the development of a good professional relationship. Allow adequate time, but it is essential to keep a sense of direction and purpose so that the important is quickly separated from the trivial. It is important to be aware that there may be an expectation on the patient's part that she would be seeing a senior person throughout, so always be very clear about your status as a medical student or doctor in training. As with breast disease, gynaecological and obstetric cases are usually multidimensional in nature; the reported symptoms are experienced and reported against a backdrop of core aspects of the patient's identity and femininity. Developing the necessary skills to gather and interpret the relevant information requires considerable care, insight and reflection.</p>

                    <section id="gynaecological-history" class="content-section">
                        <h2>Gynaecological history</h2>
                        <p>The usual preparations for history taking should be followed: courteous introduction; a statement as to your status as a student or trainee; and a careful check that you have the correct patient, that she understands the language and seemingly has competence. It may be that the patient is younger than the age of competence (16, or 18 if she is in care), and awareness of this and its effect on management may be an issue. If a relative, such as a parent, insists on being present during the history, potentially sensitive questions may be reserved for a time when the other person has been asked to leave the room, such as during the examination. Sometimes, it is appropriate to revisit sensitive issues at a future appointment which the patient may feel more confident to attend alone.</p>
                        
                        <p>In all consultations, you should describe the process that is about to take place and get an agreement or verbal consent. This will include history taking, an examination, an explanation of the findings and a discussion of a plan of action which will, of course, include an opportunity for the patient to ask any questions.</p>

                        <h3 id="menstrual-history">Menstrual history</h3>
                        <p>For premenopausal women, a menstrual history is mandatory. This can be done quite quickly with practice, but is usually dependent on direct questioning. Menstruation (the cyclical loss of sanguineous fluid from the uterus) is recorded as the days of menstrual loss and the duration of the interval from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, for example 5/28.</p>

                        <p>If the patient is post- or perimenopausal, the history taking should reflect this. Some examples of direct, focused questions that could be asked are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are you still having periods? or</li>
                            <li>When did you have your last period?</li>
                            <li>Has there been any bleeding since your last period? (This relates to a definition of postmenopausal bleeding - generally defined as bleeding 6 months after the last period, unless the patient is taking hormone replacement therapy, in which case it is important to establish which type. Exclusion of organic pathology is mandatory in this situation.)</li>

If you know that the patient is in a sexual relationship, it is reasonable routinely to ask her whether she experiences or has experienced pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). Sometimes the patient will present with painful sex on penetration; again, direct, but sensitive, questions are useful in this context:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How severe is the pain - does sex have to stop?</li>
                            <li>Does it happen every time you have sex, or only on some occasions? (If intermittent, ask how often this happens.)</li>
                            <li>Can you say if the pain is superficial (near the outside) or deep on the inside? (Typical causes of deep dyspareunia include endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.)</li>
                            <li>Do you have any other pains in the pelvic region other than the one brought on by sexual activity?</li>
                            <li>Is there any bleeding during or after penetrative sex?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It is inevitable that a gynaecological history will include a truncated obstetric history. This can be a sensitive issue, as medical and lay terminology regarding lost pregnancies can cause potential confusion and inadvertent distress. Spontaneous abortion is the medical term for a 'miscarriage', whereas what many women refer to as an 'abortion' is a termination of pregnancy in medical language.</p>

                        <h2>Gynaecological examination</h2>
                        <p>Full awareness of the privacy of the examination is mandatory. Contemporary attitudes to examination insist on a chaperone being present during any intimate examination (breast or pelvic examination) whether the person examining is male or female. General, abdominal and peripheral examination can be carried out without a chaperone, although it is preferable to have one present.</p>

                        <p>The system of examination described in Chapter 12 is recommended, but should focus on inspection and palpation; percussion and auscultation are less important in gynaecological practice. The presence or absence of scars should be noted. Suprapubic examination is particularly important as gynaecological masses arise out of the pelvis and the examining hand cannot get below it. When an abdominopelvic mass is present, its characteristics and size, either in centimetres measured from the symphysis pubis upwards, or estimated as weeks' gestation of an equivalent-size pregnancy, are recorded.</p>

                        <p>PE commences with inspection of the perineum in the dorsal or left lateral position. Generally, but not always, a speculum examination precedes the digital examination. Make note of any inflammation, swelling, soreness, ulceration or neoplasia of the vulva, perineum or anus. Small warts (condylomata acuminata) appearing as papillary growths may occur scattered over the vulva; these are due to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Inspect the clitoris and urethra and ask the patient to strain and then cough to demonstrate any uterovaginal prolapse or stress incontinence.</p>

The hand provides gentle directional pressure to bring the pelvic viscera towards the examiner's fingers in the vagina and serves to assess the size, mobility and regularity of masses.</p>

                        <h2>Investigations in obstetrics and gynaecology</h2>
                        <p>A variety of investigations is available in gynaecological and obstetric practice.</p>

                        <h3 id="imaging">Imaging</h3>
                        <p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning has proved less useful in gynaecology than was originally anticipated and is now used mainly for staging and follow-up of malignancies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where available, is a better option. It does not use ionizing radiation and is particularly good at staging gynaecological malignancies.</p>

                        <p>The preferred contemporary technique to image the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes is hysterosonography (hysterosalpingo contrast sonography, HyCoSy), rather than X-ray hysterosalpingography, in which the flow of saline or galactose microparticles through the tubes and uterus is visualized with a vaginal ultrasound probe, thereby avoiding exposure to radiation (Fig. 4.14).</p>

                        <p>Assessment of the fetal heart rate and its variation with fetal and uterine activity can be recorded antenatally or in labour with ultrasound using the Doppler principle (Figs 4.22 and 4.23). A pressure transducer is attached to the abdominal wall so that variations in uterine activity can be matched with the ultrasound recordings.</p>
