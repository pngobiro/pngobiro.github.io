                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Diseases of the respiratory system account for up to a third of deaths in most countries and for a major proportion of visits to the doctor and time away from work or school. As with every aspect of diagnosis in medicine, the key to success is a clear and carefully recorded history; symptoms may be trivial or extremely distressing, but either may indicate serious and life-threatening disease.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="the-history" class="content-section">
                        <h2>The history</h2>
                        <p>Most patients with respiratory disease will present with breathlessness, cough, excess sputum, haemoptysis, wheeze or chest pain.</p>

                        <h3 id="breathlessness">Breathlessness</h3>
                        <p>Everyone becomes breathless on strenuous exertion. Breathlessness inappropriate to the level of physical exertion, or even occurring at rest, is called dyspnoea. It is not due simply to a lowered blood oxygen tension (hypoxia) or to a raised blood carbon dioxide tension (hypercapnia), although these may play a significant part.</p>
                        <p>An important assessment is whether the dyspnoea is related only to exertion and how far the patient can walk at a normal pace on the level (exercise tolerance). Other clarifications include whether there is variability in the symptoms and whether there are any times of day or night that are usually worse than others. Variable airways obstruction due to asthma is very often worse at night and in the early morning.</p>

                        <h3 id="cough">Cough</h3>
                        <p>A cough may be dry or it may be productive of sputum.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content"><strong>Duration:</strong> A cough lasting a few days following a cold has less significance than one lasting several weeks in a middle-aged smoker, which may be the first sign of a malignancy.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content"><strong>Timing:</strong> A dry cough at night may be an early symptom of asthma, as may a cough that comes in spasms lasting several minutes.</span>

                            <li class="list-item">

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 id="sputum">Sputum</h3>
                        <p>Children and some adults swallow sputum, but it is always worth asking for a description of its colour and consistency. Yellow or green sputum is usually purulent. People with asthma may produce small amounts of very thick or jelly-like sputum, sometimes in the shape of a cast of the airways. Eosinophils may accumulate in the sputum in asthma, causing a purulent appearance even when no infection is present.</p>

                        <h3 id="haemoptysis">Haemoptysis</h3>
                        <p>Haemoptysis means the coughing up of blood in the sputum. It should never be dismissed without very careful evaluation. Fear often leads patients not to mention it: a specific question is always necessary. Blood may be coughed up alone, or sputum may be bloodstained. It is sometimes difficult to describe whether or not the blood has originated from the chest or whether it comes from the gums or nose (epistaxis), or even from the stomach (haematemesis).</p>

                        <h3 id="wheezing">Wheezing</h3>
                        <p>Always ask whether the patient hears any noises coming from the chest. Even if a wheeze is not present when you examine the patient, it is useful to know that he has noticed it on occasions. Sometimes, wheezing will have been noticed by others (especially by a partner at night, when asthma is worse) but not by the patient. Sometimes stridor (a high-pitched inspiratory noise) may be mistaken for wheezing; this serious finding usually indicates narrowing of the larynx, trachea or main bronchi.</p>

                        <h3 id="pain-in-the-chest">Pain in the chest</h3>
                        <p>Chest pain caused by lung disease usually arises from the pleura. <strong>Pleuritic pain</strong> is sharp and stabbing, and is made worse by deep breathing or coughing. It occurs when the pleura is inflamed, most commonly by infection in the underlying lung. More constant pain, unrelated to breathing, may be caused by local invasion of the chest wall by a lung or pleural tumour.</p>

                        <p>The hands should be inspected for clubbing, pallor or cyanosis. A fine tremor may indicate the use of inhaled $\beta_{2}$ agonists, such as salbutamol. A flap (asterixis) may indicate carbon dioxide retention or hypercapnia; such patients are often drowsy, with warm hands and a bounding pulse.</p>

                        <h3 id="rate-and-rhythm">Respiratory rate and rhythm</h3>
                        <p>The normal rate of respiration in a relaxed adult is about 14-16 breaths per minute. Tachypnoea is an increased respiratory rate. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a disturbance of respiratory rhythm in which there is cyclical deepening and quickening of respiration, followed by diminishing respiratory effort and rate, sometimes associated with a short period of complete apnoea.</p>

                        <p>Look for any obvious scars from previous surgery. Inspect the shape of the chest. Kyphosis or scoliosis of the vertebral column will lead to asymmetry and may restrict lung movement. Severe airways obstruction (COPD) may lead to a 'barrel shaped' chest with increased anteroposterior diameter.</p>

                        <p>Percussion should be systematic, comparing the two sides of the chest. Reduction of resonance (dullness) occurs when the underlying lung is more solid (consolidation, collapse) or when fluid is present (pleural effusion - often 'stony dullness'). Increase in resonance (hyperresonance) may occur with pneumothorax.</p>

                        <p>Listen to the chest with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Ask the patient to take deep breaths in and out through the mouth. Compare corresponding positions on each side.</p>
