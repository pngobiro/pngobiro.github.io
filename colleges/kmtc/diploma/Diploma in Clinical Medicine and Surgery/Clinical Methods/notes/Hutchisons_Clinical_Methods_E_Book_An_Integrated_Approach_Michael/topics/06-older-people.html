                        </blockquote>
                        <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, there were 65,000 people in the UK aged 85 or older. By 2050, it is projected there will be more than three million. Old age is still associated with frailty, disability and loss of independence. The positive aspects of ageing, such as sagacity, maturity and experience, are too often neglected. One hopes that these commonly held negative beliefs about growing old will gradually disappear, as the period between the average age of onset of disability in the old and the average age of death narrows and the elderly enjoy healthier lives.</p>
                        <p>Age is traditionally defined in terms of chronological age. Older people are considered in three distinct chronological groups: the young old (65-74), the old (75-84) and the very old (85+). However, older people are a very heterogeneous group and each old person should be respected as an individual and not merely classed according to their chronological age. Frailty, disability and dependency are not synonymous with getting old. The accumulation of disability resulting from chronic disease and environmental insults must be separated from the process of merely getting older, i.e. senescence. People age at different rates, and it is the interplay of environmental, genetic and acquired pathological processes that determines an individual's biological age. Functional age takes into account the combination of a person's biological and chronological ages and, although difficult to define, this concept circumvents the negative implications of grouping individuals together because of arbitrary socioeconomic or statutory definitions, such as 'pensioner'. With an increasingly healthy and longer-lived population, these concepts will require redefinition according to functional ability.</p>

                        <h2>Presentation of disease in older people</h2>
                        <p>Two major factors influence the recognition of disease processes in older people:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Acceptance of ill health, with delay in seeking help.</li>
                            <li>Atypical presentation of disease processes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The acceptance of ill health and disease as 'ageing', with its resultant disabilities, means that many older people expect to be frail, rarely complain and often seek help late. Coming to terms with some disability or change is necessary at all ages, and acceptance is part of survival. However, the tacit acceptance of inevitable deterioration - for example in vision, hearing, teeth and feet - may lead to treatable conditions being ignored and result in loss of independence. Table 6.1 illustrates what may be regarded as normal ageing and what is pathological.</p>

                        <p>Taking a good history is always essential but requires particular sensitivity in the elderly. Respect for autonomy should always be afforded, just as for the young. 'Don't talk about patients, talk with them', especially when dealing with carers. Negotiate how much information the patient would like to share with carers when giving investigation results or trying to obtain corroborative information. Avoid being judgemental and paternalistic. The grey-haired are not necessarily disabled or confused! Even severely physically disabled people, no matter what their age, may have the brightest minds.</p>

                        <h2>The 'geriatric giants'</h2>
                        <p>Professor Bernard Isaacs drew attention to the four 'geriatric giants' - immobility, instability (falls), incontinence and intellectual impairment. Impaired senses, iatrogenesis and pressure ulcers are now commonly included.</p>

                        <h3 id="immobility">Immobility</h3>
                        <p>Impaired mobility is one of the most common clinical presentations in the elderly. It is almost invariably multifactorial. Sometimes a diagnostic gait pattern is found (Box 6.9).</p>

                        <p>It is said that 'young people trip, but old people fall'. With age, muscle strength is lost and postural reflexes become impaired. Falls are therefore common in old age. Several causes may coexist (Box 6.7).</p>

                        <p>A bedridden patient or a person lying on the floor generates pressures in the skin in excess of 100 mmHg, especially over the sacrum, heels and greater trochanters. Such pressures lead to occlusion of cutaneous blood vessels. About 80% of pressure ulcers are superficial (Fig. 6.5). Deep ulcers (Fig. 6.6) are formed when localized high pressure applied to the skin cuts off a wedgeshaped area of tissue.</p>
