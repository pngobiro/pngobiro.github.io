                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Pain is a phenomenon with which we are all familiar. It is a part of everyday life and is a feature of various diseases. It most commonly accompanies an injury, where it serves its most important purpose; namely, to protect us, alert us and to make us remove ourselves from danger. The severity of pain, and its impact on an individual, ranges from a trivial occurrence such as a needle-prick injury to a sensation of such intensity that it induces thoughts of suicide.</p>

                                <p>The International Association for the Study of Pain proposed the following definition (1979): <strong>'Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of damage'</strong>.</p>
                                <p>It follows from this that pain is always a subjective sensation and is always unpleasant. This definition has two important implications: pain is not necessarily or always associated with ongoing tissue damage; it is a subjective experience and has an emotional as well as a sensory component.</p>

                        <p>Pain is notoriously difficult to describe. It is difficult to assess and even harder to quantify. Nonetheless, pain assessment is crucial in order to evaluate its impact on the sufferer and plan a treatment strategy.</p>

                        <h2>Classification of pain</h2>
                        <p>There are many ways in which pain can be classified in order to formulate an optimal treatment strategy. Despite this, classifying a particular pain state can be challenging because often the pain syndrome does not fall into a single category. The main reason for this is that the aetiology and pathogenesis of many pain syndromes is multifactorial.</p>

                        <h2>Mechanisms of pain</h2>
                        <p>At its simplest, pain is generated by a noxious stimulus that excites the central nervous system. This mechanism was first proposed by Descartes in the sixteenth century and conceptually still holds true, but it is crucial to appreciate that the final subjective experience of pain is shaped by various factors (Fig. 9.1).</p>

                        <p>A stimulus (which can be thermal, pressure, cold or chemical) excites nociceptors and is then transmitted to the spinal cord by two different classes of nerve fibre. Faster, myelinated $A \delta$ fibres and smaller, slower, unmyelinated $C$ fibres transmit the sensation to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where these primary afferent fibres synapse in lamina I, lamina II (substantia gelatinosa), lamina IV and some in lamina V. All of these afferent sensory fibres are excitatory. Second-order fibres are then carried in the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts to the thalamus, where they synapse. From the thalamus, third-order neurones project to the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and the insular cortex, where they terminate. It is at this cortical level that a stimulus is perceived as pain.</p>
                        <p>However, it is known that the noxious sensory input may be modulated at several levels (including spinal cord and higher brain centres) by the nervous system, thereby altering the final pain experience. At the spinal level, the gate theory, proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965, states that non-noxious stimulation of the large $A \beta$ fibres inhibits the response to painful stimuli of neurones with wide dynamic range (WDR neurones, located primarily in lamina V), reducing the input of small fibres mediating the sensation of pain. A good example of this effect is 'rubbing it better'. In addition, descending input from higher centres also modulates neural activity in the spinal cord, reducing or enhancing pain sensation. Such descending input is one of the mechanisms by which emotional and cognitive factors modulate pain perception. Much remains to be understood about the central pathophysiology of pain.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, pain management has increasingly adopted a biopsychosocial model. This has highlighted the need to take into account the interactions between biological, psychological and social factors leading to an individual's pain experience (see Fig. 9.1).</p>

                    <section id="patient-assessment" class="content-section">
                        <h2>The patient in pain</h2>
                        <p>As with any other branch of medicine, careful and meticulous assessment of a patient in pain is important. Two questions should be considered when dealing with a patient in pain:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is the pain a symptom of ongoing tissue damage, or of another condition that needs to be dealt with by another medical professional?</li>
                            <li>What is the optimal treatment strategy: to either abolish the pain altogether or reduce it to a more bearable level?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Unfortunately, no single standardized approach will allow assessment of pain in every situation, given that it is a subjective experience. As in other areas of medical practice, the history is the most useful tool in assessment and diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3 id="history">History</h3>
                        <p>Taking a history from a patient in pain is more complex than recording symptoms and making a diagnosis. Even in acute pain states, where pain represents a protective function and is a symptom of an injury, taking the patient as a whole and bearing in mind emotional, cognitive and behavioural aspects are crucial in arriving at a treatment strategy.</p>

                        <h4 id="pain-evaluation">The pain</h4>
                        <p>The first step is to evaluate the pain and try to understand its mechanisms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The site of pain:</strong> this may give a clue to the underlying pathology.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> pain may follow a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution, or have no relation to anatomical patterns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Character of pain:</strong> nociceptive (somatic or visceral) versus neuropathic (Table 9.1).</li>
                            <li><strong>Duration of pain:</strong> this may have a bearing on the level of disability and the associated psychosocial cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rapidity of onset and any precipitating factors:</strong> a rapid or relatively recent-onset pain syndrome is more likely to follow a conventional medical model, whereby it is appropriate to search for an underlying cause. Chronic pain requires a more biopsychosocial approach.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severity of pain and its change over time:</strong> this requires some method of measurement (see below).</li>
                            <li><strong>Alleviating and exacerbating/aggravating factors:</strong> these may lead to a better understanding of mechanisms that sustain the pain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exclusion of more sinister pathology:</strong> 'red flags'. Two most important conditions are not to be missed. One is pain related to cancer and the other is pain related to inflammation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluation of psychosocial elements:</strong> 'yellow flags' (Box 9.1). These are not life-threatening symptoms, but their presence means that the psychosocial history has special relevance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Previous and current treatments and their effect.</strong></li>

                        <h2>Measuring pain</h2>
                        <p>Pain is a subjective experience and therefore difficult to quantify. However, being able to quantify pain will aid management by assessing severity and allowing the measurement of treatment or intervention effect, and is crucial for the purposes of research studies looking at new treatment modalities. Measurement tools may be single or multidimensional, with the latter being more useful in chronic pain conditions.</p>

                        <h3 id="single-dimensional-scales">Single-dimensional scales</h3>
                        <p>These are very commonly used for the assessment of acute pain syndromes. They are simple, sensitive, reproducible and quickly applied, and give a numerical value to the pain severity. They can be either analogue or discrete. The latter may be numerical or verbal. The most common of these scales is the visual analogue scale (VAS). The patient is given a horizontal line 10 cm long with 'no pain' on the left-hand side and 'worst possible pain' on the right, and is asked to mark the line according to the severity of the pain.</p>
                        <p>The numerical scale is similar to the VAS. The patient is asked to assign a number from 0 to 10 to his pain, 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst imaginable pain. In the verbal rating scale, the patient rates his pain into one of the following categories: none, mild, moderate or severe.</p>

                        <h3 id="multidimensional-scales">Multidimensional (complex) scales</h3>
                        <p>The development of multidimensional scales acknowledges the multidimensional impact of pain on an individual's life. The most frequently employed scale in use is the McGill Questionnaire. There are two forms of this: the original McGill Questionnaire assesses various aspects of pain, including sensory qualities of pain, affective qualities (tension, fear, etc.) and evaluative words that describe the subjective intensity of the total pain experienced. There are various measurements derived from the data, but a short form of the McGill Questionnaire is most used (Fig. 9.2). It is easy to apply and reproducible.</p>

                        <p>Acute pain management should be directed to the treatment of the underlying cause. For example, fractures should be reduced and immobilized and infections treated with antibiotics. Pain is then treated symptomatically with analgesic drugs.</p>

                        <p>In chronic pain, the emphasis shifts to management of the pain which includes addressing its psychosocial sequelae. This often involves a multimodal treatment approach.</p>

                        <h4 id="pharmacology">Pharmacology</h4>
                        <p>Pharmacological options include simple analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids and non-conventional analgesics. These are prescribed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder (Fig. 9.3). This is generally effective in acute pain and in most cases of cancer pain. However, in chronic pain, drugs are less effective and there is often a neuropathic component. For neuropathic pain, the most commonly used drugs are antidepressants and anticonvulsants.</p>

                        <p>The non-pharmacological management of chronic pain is multidisciplinary and is usually available through specialized pain clinics. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter but pain management may include interventional techniques such as spinal injections, the use of acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and may also involve physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological techniques. The aim is to provide physical and psychological rehabilitation leading, where possible, to patient self-management.</p>
