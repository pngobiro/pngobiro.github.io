                        <p>Any patient presenting with an acute or emergency condition needs instant attention and quick thinking from his clinicians, who in turn need to be immediately aware of the principles of resuscitation, diagnostics and the prioritization of clinical interventions. Not infrequently the diagnosis will be unclear, despite best efforts, and the presenting syndrome or scenario (such as 'shock' or 'breathlessness') will need to be dealt with in a systematic and logical manner. The clinicians will need to overcome his own anxiety and perform quickly, efficiently and professionally.</p>

                        <h2>The importance of clinical assessment</h2>
                        <p>High-quality history taking and clinical examination, when used properly rather than just routinely, will usually identify a diagnosis in a timely fashion, and enable the initiation of appropriate investigation and management plans. In modern medicine, much has been made of the awareness of 'vital observations' or 'vital signs', which are often performed by nursing staff and are usually available prior to a doctor's clinical assessment. It should be remembered that observations support clinical diagnosis and management and do not replace them.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between good history taking, sound examination skills and the ordering of appropriate investigations is as important in an emergency situation as in any other clinical setting. A poorly taken and rushed history, followed by numerous, irrelevant investigations, is poor-quality medicine. Such an approach often leads to a wrong or missed diagnosis and some abnormal results of uncertain significance. Investigations are not always risk free, and patients should not be exposed unnecessarily to interventions such as ionizing radiation or pleural taps without serious thought. The aim of this chapter is to aid your reasoning skills in the emergency situation in order to formulate working diagnoses, which will in turn facilitate the ordering of appropriate investigations and the formulation of targeted management plans.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, the severity of illness dictates that life-saving resuscitative treatment should begin <strong>before</strong> any diagnosis is reached, especially in acutely ill patients with problems such as shock or breathlessness. However, it should be possible to make an underlying diagnosis (or differential diagnoses) in the majority of cases and an acutely ill patient may not clinically improve until the treatment based on the correct diagnosis is provided. Acute resuscitation and the formulation of diagnoses will often be performed successfully in tandem.</p>

                        <p>Patients frequently present to emergency departments with signs and symptoms of infection. Severe infections have the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, and therefore it is vital that they are identified and diagnosed speedily by the clinician. The term 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome' (SIRS) is widely recognized. If features of SIRS are present in the face of infection, the term 'sepsis' is often used. 'Severe sepsis' is used if there is evidence of sepsis with additional physiological upset (e.g., hypotension, acute oliguria).</p>

                        <p>Septic shock may come with a history suggesting the source of infection. Anaphylactic shock is usually apparent, but there may not be a history of allergy. True neurogenic shock is relatively rare. Cardiogenic shock may be associated with a preceding history of chest pain, palpitations or breathlessness. Hypovolaemic shock will usually be obvious, associated with a history or visual evidence of blood loss or fluid loss.</p>
