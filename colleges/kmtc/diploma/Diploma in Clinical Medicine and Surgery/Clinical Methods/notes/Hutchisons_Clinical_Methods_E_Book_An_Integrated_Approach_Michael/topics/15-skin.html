                        <p>In the human body, the skin is the largest organ. Forming a major interface between man and his environment, it covers an area of approximately 2 m² and weighs about 4 kg. The structure of human skin is complex (Figs 15.1 and 15.2), consisting of a number of layers and tissue components with many important functions (Box 15.1). Reactions may occur in any of the components of human skin and their clinical manifestations reflect, among other factors, the skin level in which they occur and sometimes act as a 'window' of systemic changes elsewhere in the body.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Detailed information should be sought concerning the present skin condition. This should include the site of onset, mode of spread and duration of the disorder. Any personal history or family history of skin disease, including skin cancer and atopy (an allergic skin reaction becoming apparent more or less immediately on contact), is important. Previous medical conditions should be noted and a full drug history obtained, including use of over-the-counter and other preparations. The social and occupational history and, in some circumstances, details of recent travel, environmental exposure, especially sunshine and artificial ultraviolet light, and sexual activity are often important.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="examination" class="content-section">
                        <h2>Examination</h2>
                        <p>The whole skin, including hair, nails and assessable mucosae, should be fully inspected (preferably in natural light), but the patient's modesty should be protected. Sometimes a magnifying lens or dermatoscope is useful.</p>

                        <h3 id="colour-and-pigmentation">Colour and pigmentation</h3>
                        <p>Before inspecting any rash or lesion, note the colour of the skin. Normal skin colour varies, depending on lifestyle and light exposure as well as constitutional and ethnic factors.</p>
                        <p>Pallor can have many causes. It may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>temporary, due to shock, haemorrhage or intense emotion</li>
                            <li>persistent, due to anaemia or peripheral vasoconstriction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Vasoconstriction is seen in patients with severe atopy. Pallor is a feature of anaemia, but not all pale persons are anaemic; conjunctival and mucosal colour is a better indication of anaemia than skin colour. A pale skin resulting from diminished pigment occurs with hypopituitarism and hypogonadism.</p>
                        <p>Normal skin contains varying amounts of brown melanin pigment. Brown pigmentation due to deposited haemosiderin is always pathological. Albinism is an inherited generalized absence of pigment in the skin; a localized form is known as piebaldism. Patches of white and darkly pigmented skin (vitiligo) (Fig. 15.3) are due to a local and complete absence of melanocytes. Several autoimmune endocrine disorders are associated with vitiligo.</p>

                        <p>Abnormal redness of the skin (erythema) is seen after overheating, extreme exertion, sunburn and in febrile, exanthematous and inflammatory skin disease. Flushing is a striking redness, usually of the face and neck, which may be transient or persistent. Local redness may be due to telangiectasia, especially on the face. Cyanosis is a blue or purple-blue tint due to the presence of excessive reduced haemoglobin, either locally, as in impaired peripheral circulation, or generally, when oxygenation of the blood is defective. The skin colour in methaemoglobinaemia is more leaden than in ordinary cyanosis; it is caused by drugs, such as dapsone, and certain poisons.</p>
                        <p>Jaundice varies from the subicteric lemon-yellow tints seen in pernicious anaemia and acholuric jaundice to various shades of yellow, orange or dark olive-green in obstructive jaundice. Jaundice, which stains the conjunctivae, must be distinguished from the rare orange-yellow of carotenaemia, which does not. Slight degrees of jaundice cannot be seen in artificial light.</p>
                        <p>Increased pigmentation may be racial, due to sunburn or connected with various diseases. In Addison's disease, there is a brown or dark-brown pigmentation affecting exposed parts and parts not normally pigmented, such as the axillae and the palmar creases; the lips and mouth may exhibit dark bluish-black areas. Note, however, that mucosal pigmentation is a normal finding in a substantial proportion of black patients.</p>
                        <p>More or less generalized pigmentation may also be seen in the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haemochromatosis, in which the skin has a peculiar greyish-bronze colour with a metallic sheen, due to excessive melanin and iron pigment.</li>
                            <li>Chronic arsenic poisoning, in which the skin is finely dappled affecting covered more than exposed parts.</li>
                            <li>Argyria, in which the deposition of silver in the skin produces a diffuse slate-grey hue.</li>
                            <li>The cachexia of advanced malignant disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In pregnancy, there may be pigmentation of the nipples and areolae, of the linea alba and sometimes a mask-like pigmentation of the face (chloasma). Chloasma may also be induced by oral contraceptives containing oestrogen. A similar condition, melasma, may be seen in Asian and Afro-Carribean males.</p>
                        <p>Localized pigmentation may be seen in pellagra and in scars of various kinds, particularly those due to X-irradiation therapy. Venous hypertension in the legs is often associated with chronic purpura, leading to haemosiderin pigmentation. The mixture of punctate and fresh purpura and haemosiderin may produce a golden hue on the lower calves and shins. Pigmentation may also occur with chronic infestation by body lice. Erythema ab igne, a reticular pattern of pigmentation, can be seen in patients who use local heat to relieve chronic pain, or on the shins of people who habitually sit too near a fire. Livedo reticularis, a web-like pattern of reddish-blue discoloration mostly involving the legs, occurs in autoimmune vasculitis, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome, when it is associated with cerebral infarction. The violet-coloured lesions of lichen planus are slightly raised, flat-topped papules (Fig. 15.4). Psoriasis usually presents as a symmetrical plaque on extensor surfaces (Fig. 15.5). Keloid consists of raised and inflammed, overgrown tender scar tissue (Fig. 15.6).</p>

                        <h3 id="inspection-and-palpation">Inspection and palpation</h3>
                        <p>Assessment of morphology requires visual and tactile examination. Do not be afraid to feel the lesions. You will rarely be exposed to any infection risk, with the exception of herpes simplex, herpes zoster, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. If these infections are suspected, it is wise to wear disposable plastic gloves when examining open or bleeding cutaneous lesions. Begin with palpation of the skin. Pass the hand gently over it, pinching it up between the forefinger and thumb, and note the following points:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Is it smooth or rough, thin or thick?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Is it dry or moist?</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span>Is there any visible sweating, either general or local?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The elasticity of the skin should be investigated. If a fold of healthy skin is pinched up, it immediately flattens itself out again when released. Sometimes, however, it only does so very slowly, remaining creased for a considerable time. This is found frequently in healthy old people but may be an important sign of dehydration, for example after severe vomiting and diarrhoea, or in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.</p>

                        <h3 id="subcutaneous-oedema">Subcutaneous oedema</h3>
                        <p>When oedema is present, firm pressure on the skin with a finger produces a shallow pit that persists for some time. In some cases, especially when the oedema is of very longstanding, pitting is not found. The best place to look for slight degrees of oedema in cardiac disease is behind the malleoli at the ankles in patients who are ambulant, and over the sacrum in those who are confined to bed. The finger pressure should be maintained for 20-30 seconds, or slight degrees of oedema will be overlooked. Pitting is minimal or absent in oedema due to lymphatic obstruction, where the skin is usually thickened and tough.</p>

                        <h3 id="subcutaneous-emphysema">Subcutaneous emphysema</h3>
                        <p>Air trapped under the skin gives rise to a characteristic crackling sensation on palpation. It starts in, and is usually confined to, the neighbourhood of the air passages. On rare occasions, it may result from the infection of a wound by gas-producing organisms.</p>

                        <h3 id="configuration-of-skin-lesions">Configuration of skin lesions</h3>
                        <p>Once the morphology of individual lesions and their distribution has been established, it is useful to describe their configuration on the skin (Box 15.4).</p>

                        <p>Localized distributions may point immediately to an external contact as the cause, for example contact dermatitis from nickel earrings, lipstick dermatitis, etc. Swelling of the eyelids is an important sign. Without redness and scaling, bilateral periorbital oedema may indicate acute nephritis, nephrosis or trichinosis. If there is irritation, contact dermatitis is the probable diagnosis. Dermatomyositis often produces swelling and heliotrope-coloured erythema of the eyelids without scaling of the skin. In Hansen's disease (leprosy), the skin lesions may be depigmented or reddened, with a slightly raised edge; they are also anaesthetic to pinprick testing (Fig. 15.7) and mainly located in skin that is normally cooler than core body temperature.</p>

                        <h2>The hair</h2>
                        <p>Hair colour and texture are racial characteristics that are genetically determined. The yellow-brown Mongol race has black straight hair, negroid people have black curly hair and white Caucasians have fair, brown, red or black hair. Secondary sexual hair begins to appear at puberty and has characteristic male and female patterns. Androgenic male pattern baldness is genetically determined but requires adequate levels of circulating androgens for its expression. It occurs in women only in old age.</p>

                        <h3 id="growth-of-hair">Growth of hair</h3>
                        <p>Unlike other epithelial mitotic activity that is continuous throughout life, the growth of hair is cyclic (Fig. 15.8), the hair follicle going through alternating phases of growth (anagen) and rest (telogen). Anagen in the scalp lasts 3-5 years; telogen is much shorter, at about 3 months. Catogen is the conversion stage from active to resting and usually lasts a few days. The duration of the anagen phase determines the length to which hair in different body areas can grow. On the scalp, there are on average about 100 000 hairs. The normal scalp may shed as many as 100 hairs every day as a normal consequence of growth cycling. These proportions can be estimated by looking at plucked hairs (trichogram): the 'root' of a telogen hair is non-pigmented and visible as a white, club-like swelling. Normally 85% of scalp hairs are in anagen and 15% in telogen.</p>

                        <p>Any inflammatory or destructive disease of the scalp skin may destroy hair follicles in its wake. Thus, burns, heavy X-ray irradiation or herpes zoster infection in the first division of the trigeminal nerve may cause scarring and alopecia. Alopecia in the presence of normal scalp skin may be patchy and localized, as in traction alopecia in nervous children, ringworm infections (tinea capitis) or autoimmune alopecia areata. Secondary syphilis is a rare cause of a patchy alopecia with a 'moth-eaten' appearance.</p>
                        <p>Scalp hair loss at the temples and crown, with the growth of male-type body hair, is characteristic of women with virilizing disorders. Metabolic causes of diffuse hair loss in women include hypothyroidism and severe iron deficiency anaemia. Antimitotic drugs may affect the growing hair follicles, producing a diffuse loss of anagen hairs, which are pigmented throughout their length. Dramatic metabolic upsets, such as childbirth, starvation and severe toxic illnesses, may precipitate follicles into the resting phase, producing an effluvium of telogen hairs 3 months later, when anagen begins again. This is called telogen alopecia. In the autoimmune disorder alopecia totalis (Fig. 15.9), there is complete loss of hair. Self-inflicted traction alopecia (Fig. 15.10) may indicate psychological problems.</p>

                        <p>Thimble pitting of the nails is characteristic of psoriasis (Fig. 15.13), but eczema and alopecia areata may also produce pitting. A severe illness may temporarily arrest nail growth; when growth starts again, transverse ridges develop. These are called Beau's lines and can be used to date the time of onset of an illness. Inflammation of the cuticle or nail fold (chronic paronychia) may produce similar changes. The changes described above arise from disturbance of the nail matrix.</p>

                        <p>Disturbance of the nail bed may produce thick nails (pachyonychia) or separation of the nail from the bed (onycholysis). This occurs in psoriasis, but may be idiopathic. Long-term tetracyclines may induce separation when the fingers are exposed to strong sunlight (photo-onycholysis). The nail may be destroyed in severe lichen planus (Fig. 15.14) or epidermolysis bullosa (a genetic abnormality in which the skin blisters in response to minor trauma). Nails are missing in the inherited nail-patella syndrome. Splinter haemorrhages under the nails may result from trauma, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or other 'collagen vascular' diseases, bacterial endocarditis and trichinosis.</p>

                        <p>In iron-deficiency states, the fingernails and toenails become soft, thin, brittle and spoon-shaped. They lose their normal transverse convex curvature, becoming flattened or concave (koilonychia). The 'half and half nail', with a white proximal and red or brown distal half, is seen in some patients with chronic renal failure. Whitening of the nail plates may be related to hypoalbuminaemia, as in cirrhosis of the liver (leukonychia). Some drugs, notably antimalarials, antibiotics and phenothiazines, may discolour the nail. Nail-fold telangiectasia or erythema is a useful physical sign in dermatomyositis (Fig. 15.15), systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In dermatomyositis, the cuticle becomes ragged. In systemic sclerosis, loss of finger pulps may lead to curvature of the nail plates. An impaired peripheral circulation, as in Raynaud's phenomenon, can lead to thinning and longitudinal ridging of the nail plate, sometimes with partial onycholysis. In bronchiectasis, the nails may take on a curved, yellow appearance (Fig. 15.16).</p>

                        <p>This is probably caused by hypervascularity and the opening of anastomotic channels in the nail bed. Rarely, clubbing may be congenital. The distal end of the digit becomes expanded, with the nail curved excessively in both longitudinal and transverse planes. Viewed from the side, the angle at the nail plate is lost and may exceed 180°. In normal nails, when both thumbnails are placed in apposition, there is a lozenge-shaped gap whereas, in clubbing, there is a reduction in this gap (Schamroth's window test; Fig. 15.17). In hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, there is clubbing of the fingers and thickening of the periosteum of the radius, ulna, tibia and fibula, which can be tender. (The causes of clubbing are listed in Box 15.6.)</p>

                        <p>White macules shaped like small ash leaves which are present at birth may be the first sign of tuberous sclerosis. Sometimes they are difficult to see by natural light but show up under ultraviolet light (Wood's light). They should be looked for in infants with seizures. Pigmentation of the lips is a feature of the genetically determined Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, in which multiple polyps of the stomach or colon appear that may later undergo malignant transformation. Café au lait type macules, sometimes multiple, are a common sign of neurofibromatosis (NF). Another valuable sign in von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis is bilateral freckling of the axillary skin. The characteristic soft neurofibromata may be solitary or a few, or hundreds may be scattered over the body. Ichthyosis (scaly fish skin) is usually present from childhood and is genetic, but if ichthyosis is acquired in adult life, a search should be made for malignancy or other underlying disease.</p>

                        <h3 id="non-organ-specific-autoimmune-disorders">Non-organ-specific autoimmune disorders</h3>
                        <p>Several of the so-called collagen vascular diseases show characteristic cutaneous eruptions. Systemic lupus erythematosus, seen in women between puberty and the menopause, may show a symmetrical 'butterfly' erythema of the nose and cheeks. In discoid lupus, the cutaneous lesion is localized (Fig. 15.18). In polyarteritis nodosa, reticular livedo of the limbs with purpura, vasculitic papules and ulceration occurs. In scleroderma (systemic sclerosis), acrosclerosis of the fingertips with scarring, ulceration and calcinosis follows a Raynaud's phenomenon of increasing severity. Dermatomyositis often presents with a heliotrope-coloured discoloration and oedema of the eyelids, and with fixed erythema over the dorsa of the knuckles and fingers (see Fig. 15.15) and over the bony points of the shoulders, elbows and legs. There is usually weakness of the proximal limb muscles. Dermatomyositis in the middle aged is associated in about 10% of cases with internal malignancy.</p>

                        <p>Acanthosis nigricans is a brownish velvety thickening of the axillae, groins and sides of the neck. Sometimes there is thickening of the palms and soles, and warty excrescences may develop on the skin, eyelids and oral mucosa. In the middle-aged, acanthosis nigricans is strongly associated with internal malignancy, but benign minor forms are seen in obese young women, especially in Arab people, and in children with endocrinopathies characterized by insulin resistance. Patchy depigmented macules which are hypoanaesthetic and associated with enlargement of the peripheral nerves are a feature of certain types of leprosy (Hansen's disease).</p>
                        <p>Generalized, severe persistent pruritus in the absence of obvious skin disease may be due to systemic disease (Box 15.7). However, in older people with dry skin, it is common and of no systemic significance. Diabetes mellitus has a number of skin manifestations: of these, pruritus vulvae, pruritus ani, balanoposthitis and angular stomatitis are due to Candida overgrowth. Boils, follicular pustules or ecthyma are staphylococcal. Impetigo and erysipelas, streptococcal infections, are uncommon (Fig. 15.19). Eruptive xanthomata are a rare feature of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (Fig. 15.20) produces reddish-brown plaques, usually on the shins, with central atrophy of the skin. It has to be distinguished from peritibial myxoedema (which is hypertrophic, not atrophic), the dermatoliposclerosis of chronic venous disease in the legs and the epidermal hypertrophy of chronic lymphatic obstruction.</p>

                        <p>Neuropathic ('perforating') ulcers are found on pressure points of the heel, ball of foot or toes and are characteristically painless. Arteriopathic ulceration resulting from large vessel disease is seen on the foot, and due to small vessel disease on the calves. Spider naevi consist of a central arteriole feeding a cluster of surrounding vessels. Many young people have up to seven naevi on the face, shoulders or arms. In older age groups, pregnancy, the administration of oestrogens (as in oral contraceptives) and liver disease may cause multiple lesions. Pregnancy and liver disease may also produce a blotchy erythema of the thenar and hypothenar eminences ('liver palms'). Leukonychia is seen in liver disease. Erythema nodosum is a condition in which tender, painful, red nodules appear, typically on the shins. They fade slowly over several weeks, leaving bruising, but never ulcerate. Sarcoidosis and drug sensitivity are the commonest causes, but other systemic disorders should be considered (Box 15.8). Xanthomata are yellow or orange papules or nodules in the skin caused by dermal aggregations of lipid-loaded cells. Different patterns of hyperlipoproteinaemia may induce varying patterns of xanthomatosis. Thus, the type la (hypercholesterolaemia) pattern typically causes tuberous xanthomata on the extensor aspects of the knees and elbows and on the buttocks, sometimes associated with tendon xanthomata. Widespread eruptive xanthomata are more characteristic of hypertriglyceridaemia. White deposits of lipid (arcus senilis) in the cornea may have a similar explanation but may be a normal feature in those over 60. Flat lipid deposits around the eyes (xanthelasma) may be due to hyperlipidaemia, but are also seen in the middle-aged and elderly without any general metabolic upset. Carotenaemia produces an orange-yellow colour to the skin, especially of the palms and soles. It occurs in those who eat great quantities of carrots and other vegetables, in hypothyroidism, in diabetic patients and also in those taking beta-carotene for the treatment of porphyria.</p>

                        <p>Aggregations of extravasated red blood cells in the skin cause purpura (Fig. 15.21). Purpura may be punctate, from capillary haemorrhage or may form larger macules, depending on the extent of haemorrhage and the size of vessels involved. Palpable pupura should raise suspicion of leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The Hess test for capillary fragility involves deliberately inducing punctate purpura on the forearm by inflating a cuff above the elbow at 100 mmHg for 3 minutes. Sensitivity to drugs such as aspirin may cause widespread 'capillaritis'. The term ecchymosis implies a bruise, usually with cutaneous and subcutaneous haemorrhage causing a palpable lump. A frank fluctuant collection of blood is a haematoma. Unlike erythema and telangiectasia, purpura cannot be blanched by pressure. It must not be confused with senile haemangioma (cherry angioma or Campbell de Morgan spot), which is common in later life on the trunk and has no pathological significance. Haemorrhage into the thick epidermis of the palm or sole due to trauma (e.g. 'jogger's heel') may induce brown or almost black macules that take weeks to disappear, inviting confusion with melanoma.</p>

                        <p>The skin is involved in various sexually transmitted diseases. The primary chancre of syphilis may occur on the genitalia of either sex, at or near the anus, on the lip or, rarely, elsewhere. The rash of secondary syphilis is brownish-red, maculopapular and is one of the few rashes involving the palms and soles. It does not itch. Other manifestations of the secondary stage are condylomata lata around the anogenital area, snailtrack ulceration and 'mucous patches' in the mouth. There may be low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Septicaemia is a rare complication of gonorrhoea that occurs particularly in pregnant women presenting with pustular skin lesions. Recurrent type II herpes simplex is common on the penis; it occurs less often on the buttocks, where relapses may be heralded by a radiating neuralgia. Genital viral warts are common in both sexes. They are particularly important in females because there is evidence that certain viral subtypes are responsible for chronic cervical dysplasia with malignant potential.</p>
                        <p>HIV-related syndromes have many cutaneous manifestations, including disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma candidiasis, molluscum contagiosum, seborrhoeic dermatitis, folliculitis and oral hairy leukoplakia (Fig. 15.22).</p>

                        <p>Several of the most common viral infections and illnesses of childhood are characterized by fever and a distinctive rash (exanthem), including measles, varicella and rubella. In measles, upper respiratory symptoms are quickly followed by a characteristic maculopapular and erythematous rash. In rubella (German measles), the rash is more transient, with small papules, and associated with occipital lymphadenopathy and only slight malaise. The exanthem of varicella (chickenpox) is papulovesicular and centripetal, and there may be lesions in the mouth. In herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections (Fig. 15.23), there is a non-follicular papulovesicular rash in which the vesicles are planted in an inflamed base. The rash is painful. In herpes zoster, the rash follows a segmental distribution, in the skin of a dermatome. The vesicular lesion becomes encrusted (Fig. 15.24) and, later, secondary infection may occur.</p>

                        <p>In the last 40 years, eruptions caused by drugs have become common. Most such rashes are due to allergic hypersensitivity. Drug rashes can mimic almost every pattern of skin disease. Thus, urticaria may be caused by penicillin or opiates; a measles-like (morbilliform) rash may be induced by ampicillin, especially when given to patients with infectious mononucleosis; eczema-like rashes are seen with methyldopa and phenylbutazone therapy; and gold and chloroquine rashes mimic lichen planus. A palpable rash looking like Henoch-Schönlein pupura indicates leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Generalized exfoliative dermatitis may be induced by sulphonylureas, indometacin and allopurinol. Increasing use of biologics in clinical medicine has identified unusal skin eruptions.</p>
                        <p>Drugs that may sensitize the skin to sunlight (phototoxic reaction) include tetracyclines, sulphonamides and nalidixic acid. Acne-like rashes may follow high-dose prednisolone therapy, and are common with phenytoin therapy. Certain cytotoxic drugs and sodium valproate cause hair loss. Both erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme may be induced by sulphonamides, including co-trimoxazole. Laboratory tests are of little value in the diagnosis of drug eruptions. Careful history taking and knowledge of the common patterns of drug reactions usually allow accurate diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3 id="tumours-in-the-skin">Tumours in the skin</h3>
                        <p>Exposure to the sun may, after many years, result in the development of many common skin tumours, for example squamous or basal cell carcinoma, or melanoma. These tumours are especially common in fair-skinned people. Basal cell carcinoma arises especially on the face, near the nose or on the forehead (Fig. 15.25). The lesion may be ulcerated with a firm, rounded edge, or papular. Melanomas may develop on the torso in men, and legs in females. They may be pigmented or amelanotic, and may in a third or so develop rapidly in a pre-existing benign mole (Fig. 15.26). Staging by assessing draining regional sentinel lymph nodes is becoming increasingly routine in cutaneous oncology. Seborrhoeic keratoses are familial resulting in a raised warty pigmented lesion found in the sun-exposed elderly, especially on the dorsa of hands as 'liver spots' (Fig. 15.27). A symptomatic pigmented skin lesion having an asymmetric, ragged border, three or more colours and diameter of > 7 mm, particularly if it is increasing in size or bleeding and found on sun-damaged freckled skin, should be regarded as suspicious of malignant melanoma.</p>

                        <h2>Special techniques in examination of the skin</h2>
                        <p>The skin is uniquely available to the examining physician. There are a number of diagnostic procedures.</p>

                        <h3 id="tzanck-preparation">Tzanck preparation</h3>
                        <p>This technique is useful for rapid diagnosis of vesicular infections or blistering eruptions such as pemphigus. The intact blister is opened and the base gently scraped. The material obtained is smeared onto the microscope slide, allowed to air dry and then stained. Viral lesions will show typical multinucleated giant cells and pemphigus will show acantholytic cells.</p>

                        <h3 id="microscopic-examination">Microscopic examination</h3>
                        <p>Dermoscopic and/or microscopic examination is useful in the diagnosis of scabies, pediculosis (lice) and fungal infection (tinea and candidiasis).</p>

                        <h4 id="scabies">Scabies</h4>
                        <p>Scabies is caused by the mite Acarus (Sarcoptes) scabei. The female is larger than the male and burrows in the epidermis, depositing eggs. These burrows should be looked for between the fingers, on the hands or wrists and on the sides of the feet. They can be recognized with the naked eye as short dark lines terminating in a shining spot of skin. The eggs lie in the dark line, the mite in the shining spot. It may be picked out by means of a flat surgical needle and placed on a microscope slide for more detailed examination.</p>

                        <h4 id="pediculosis">Pediculosis</h4>
                        <p>Three forms of pediculosis or louse infestation occur: Pediculus capitis on the head, Pediculus corporis on the trunk, and Pediculus pubis on the pubic and axillary hairs. The eggs or nits of P. pubis and P. capitis adhere to the hairs. From their position on the hairs, one can judge roughly the duration of the condition, as they are fixed at first near the root of the hair and are carried up as the hair grows, so the higher the nits are, the longer the pediculi have been present. P. corporis should be looked for in the seams of the clothes, especially where the clothes come into contact with the skin, for example over the shoulders. The bites of the parasite produce haemorrhagic spots, each with a dark centre and a paler areola. Marks of scratching should be looked for on parts accessible to the patient's nails. P. pubis is venereally acquired and causes intense pubic itching. The nits are laid on the pubic hair and the lice themselves are easily visible. P. corporis is seen only in the grossly deprived, in those living rough and in conditions of war and social upheaval. In contrast, P. capitis is common in school children, however clean they and their families may be, and is endemic in many schools.</p>

                        <h4 id="fungal-infections">Fungal infections</h4>
                        <p>Fungus may grow in the skin, nails or hair and can cause disease (ringworm or tinea), for example athlete's foot (tinea pedis). The skin between the toes (tinea pedis), the soles of the feet and the groin (tinea cruris) are the commonest sites of fungal infection. The lesions may be scaly or vesicular, tending to spread in a ring form with central healing (Fig. 15.28); macerated, dead, white, offensive-smelling epithelium is found in the intertriginous areas, such as the toe clefts. Nail discoloration, deformity, hypertrophy and abnormal brittleness may result from fungus infection (tinea ungium). Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) is most common in children. It presents as round or oval areas of baldness covered with short, lustreless broken-off hair stumps. These hair stumps may fluoresce bright green under Wood's light. Some fungi do not fluoresce with Wood's light, however, and these can be detected only by microscopy and culture (Figs 15.29 and 15.30).</p>

                        <h4 id="microscopic-examination-for-fungus-infection">Microscopic examination for fungus infection</h4>
                        <p>Scales from the active edge of a lesion are scraped off lightly with a scalpel, or the roofs of vesicles are snipped off with scissors. The material is placed in a drop of 10-20% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution on a microscope slide, covered with a coverslip and left for 30 minutes to clear. It is then examined under the light microscope with the 8-mm or 4-mm objective using low illumination. The mycelia are recognized as branching, refractile threads that boldly transgress the outlines of the squamous cells. Nails are examined in much the same way, but it is necessary to break up the snippings and shavings into small fragments. These are either heated in potassium hydroxide or are left to clear in it overnight before being examined. A scalp lesion is cleaned with 70% alcohol or with 1% cetrimide; infected stumps and scales are removed by scraping with a scalpel. The hairs are cleaned in potassium hydroxide in the same way as skin scales. Examination under the microscope reveals spores on the outside of the hair roots, and mycelia inside the hair substance. The species of fungus responsible may be established by culture on Sabouraud's glucose-agar.</p>

                        <h3 id="wood-s-light">Wood's light</h3>
                        <p>A Wood's light lamp emits long-wave ultraviolet light at a peak of 360 nm. Wood's light examination is performed in a darkened room and is useful to identify the fluorescence of fungi and corynebacterial infection (erythrasma), elevated porphyrins in urine or in the localization of pigmentary abnormalities.</p>

                        <h3 id="contact-allergy-patch-testing">Contact allergy patch testing</h3>
                        <p>This is an important and valuable tool for the diagnosis of suspected allergic dermatitis due to contact (contact dermatitis). The formulation of the allergens is critical, and various standard contact allergen test batteries have been developed in different countries and clinics to include the commonest culprits. Patch testing is simple, but the results are not always easy to interpret. Allergens are placed in shallow aluminium 1-cm² wells and applied in strips to the patient's back for 48 hours for initial reading and a second reading at 96 hours. This ensures that any delayed-type hypersensitivity (e.g. Coomb's type IV reaction to an allergen) can be identified.</p>

                        <h3 id="skin-biopsy">Skin biopsy</h3>
                        <p>Biopsy of the skin is used not only for the excision of benign and malignant tumours but also to identify the nature of reactive and/or inflammatory lesions. Punch biopsy (Figs 15.31 and 15.32) is popular because of its convenience and results in minimal scarring. The biopsy can be studied by conventional histology, often supplemented by immunofluorescence, and sometimes immunohistochemistry or molecular biology, to identify specific proteins or genetic abnormalities. Skin biopsy of fresh tissue can be sent for the microbiology of unusual infections and is increasingly used in diagnosis and in assessing the progress of skin diseases.</p>
