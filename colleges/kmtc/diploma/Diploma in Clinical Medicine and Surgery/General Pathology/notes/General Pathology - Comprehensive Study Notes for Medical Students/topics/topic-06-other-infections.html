                            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Epstein- Barr Virus (EBV) is a herpes virus and is the causative agent of Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa, nasopharyngeal cancer in the orient and infectious mononucleosis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Mode of transmission:</strong> The virus is spread by close contact (kissing). The virus can also be spread by blood transfusion.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pathogenesis:</strong> EBV only infects a small number of cell types that express the receptor for complement C3d component (CR2 or CD21). These are certain epithelial cells (oro &amp; naso-pharynx) and B lymphocytes. This explains the cellular tropism of the virus. The virus is replicated in pharyngeal epithelial cells, shed into the saliva and is taken up by B lymphocytes. As a result of EBV infection, these lymphocytes become stimulated to divide and are protected from undergoing apoptosis (cell death). They become transformed cells and they begin to appear in high levels in the bloodstream.</p>

                            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fungi are microscopic plant single-celled or multicellular organism. They are not always pathogenic. Many fungi are saprophytes (living on dead organic matter). Fungi can be true pathogens that cause infections in healthy persons or they can be opportunistic pathogens that cause infections in immunocompromised persons. Others are used for the development of antibiotics, antitoxins, and other drugs used to control various human diseases.</p>

                            <p>Fungal infections or mycoses can be classified depending on the degree of tissue involvement and mode of entry into the host. These are:</p>

                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Superficial &amp; cutaneous:</strong> localized to the skin, hair, nails&amp; mucosa. Examples include oral candidiasis (thrush), vaginal candidiasis, athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and diaper fungal infections of babies.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Subcutaneous infection:</strong> Are rare conditions, in which Infection may arise following the wounding of the skin and the introduction of soil saprophytes. The infection is chronic, localized, confined to the dermis, subcutaneous tissue or adjacent structures, leading to ulcerative lesion. Madura foot is an example of this type of affection.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Systemic Mycoses:</strong> These are invasive infections of the internal organs. They are uncommon in normally healthy persons. They may be caused by:

                                        <li><em>Primary pathogenic fungi:</em> These are fungal infections of the body caused by fungal pathogens which can overcome the physiological and cellular defenses of the normal human host by changing their morphological form. The primary site of infection is usually pulmonary. Infection by Histoplasma capsulatum (histoplasmosis) is an example of this type of affection.</li>
                                        <li><em>Opportunistic fungi</em> that are of marginal pathogenicity (non pathogenic or of low virulence) but can infect the immunocompromised host causing potentially fatal infections. Examples include systemic Candidiasis.

                            A. Surface factors that help in adherence to host tissue.<br>
                            B. Enzymes which facilitate tissue invasion</p>
                            <p><strong>Immunological response against fungi:</strong> immunological reaction against pathogenic fungi may be mediated By:</p>

                            Lesions: similar to US but polyps are more common than sandy patches &amp; ulcers. There is no predisposition to cancer. Finally, a feature of colonic bilharziasis in cases of whole wall fibrosis is that ova are deposited outside the colonic wall in the form of a tumor-like mass of bilharzial GT attached to the outer aspect of colon (Bilharzioma). In such cases, there will be no ova in stools since ova have no way of reaching the lumen (closed intestinal bilharziasis)</p>

                            1- Hemorrhage: fresh blood in stools since lesions are rectosigmoidal and lower down the tract.<br>
                            2-2ry infection of ulcers resulting in dysentery (diarrhea, blood, mucus &amp; tenesmus)<br>
                            3- Fibrosis causing stenosis &amp; intestinal obstruction is rare since colon is wide &amp; lesions generally superficial. Nevertheless, submucosal fibrosis may result in Silharzioma<br>

                            <p>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the parasite called Plasmodia. There are four identified species of this parasite causing human malaria, namely, Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale and P. malariae. It is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="pathology-malaria">Pathology of Malaria:</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Anaemia:</strong> Red blood cells are the principal sites of infection in malaria. All the clinical manifestations are primarily due to the involvement of red blood cells. Anemia is caused mainly by repeated hemolysis of infected red cells. The bone marrow shows marked normoblastic hyperplasia</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Spleen:</strong> Spleen plays an important role in the immune response against malarial infection. Splenic enlargement is one of the early and constant signs of malarial infection. Spleen may become palpable as early as the first paroxysm. The early enlargement of the spleen is due to congestion and oedema of the pulp. Later it is due to lymphoid and reticulo-endothelial hyperplasia with an increased hemolytic and phagocytic function of the organ. Frequent relapses and reinfections lead to pulp sclerosis and dilated sinuses. Rapid and considerable enlargement of spleen may sometimes result in splenic rupture, which is a serious complication of malaria</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Liver:</strong> Enlargement of the liver also occurs early in malaria. The liver is enlarged after the first paroxysms, it is usually firm and may be tender. It is oedematous, coloured brown, grey or even black as a result of deposition of malaria pigment. In patients with repeated attacks of malaria, liver also enlarges significantly along with a large and hard spleen. However, there is no functional abnormality of the liver in these patients.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>kidneys:</strong> In falciparum malaria an acute and transient self-limiting glomerulonephritis is common, whereas in P.malariae a chronic glomerulonephritis presents as nephrotic syndrome.</li>
                                <li class="list-item"><strong>Nervous system:</strong> gets involved predominantly in P. falciparum malaria and only very rarely in the other forms. Increased cytoadherence and rosetting of red cells, occlusion of the microcirculation by the red cell rosettes and their thrombosis all result in cerebral anoxia, development of malaria granulomas and punctate haemorrhages leading to malarial encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.</li>

                            <h3 id="hydatid">Hydatid disease (echinococcosis)</h3>
                            <p><strong>Infectious agent:</strong> The causative agent is Echinococcus granulosus (dog tapeworm).<br>
                            <strong>Mode oftransmission:</strong> Human infection occurs by hand-to-mouth transfer of tapeworm eggs from dog faeces. The larvae penetrate the intestinal mucosa, enter the portal system and are carried to various organs where they produce cysts in which infectious protoscoleces develop called hydatid cysts.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Pathological features:</strong><br>
                            Symptoms depend on the location of the cyst within the body The most common site for the cysts is the liver. Less commonly brain, lungs and kidneys are affected.</p>
                            <p>The wall of the cyst is formed of the following layers:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">Ectocyst: fibrous advential layer due to host response</li>
                                <li class="list-item">Middle layer: laminated membrane of proteinaceous material</li>
                                <li class="list-item">Endocyst: inner germinal layer from which the scolices may be detached</li>
