                            <p>Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources in an attempt to satisfy their unlimited wants. Health economics on the other hand is the study of how (scarce) resources are allocated to and within the health economy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Desire:</strong> refers to people’s willingness to own a good. Demand is the amount of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price.</p>

                            <p>For many people the word market conjures up a picture of a town square with lots of small stall holders selling everything from fruit and vegetables to meat and fish. For economists, the term has a much wider meaning. It is used to describe any process of exchange between buyers and sellers.</p>
                            <p>Formally, a market can be defined as any set of arrangements which allows buyers and sellers to communicate and thus arrange exchange of goods, services or resources. A free market is where such exchange occurs without interference from the government.</p>
                            <p>Information is a vital ingredient for any market. Both buyers and sellers need to have access to sufficient information to allow them to make rational decisions. So a market for health care must involve two groups: the buyers and the sellers, who interact to trade health care. Who would the buyers and sellers be in such a market? We all want good health and so most of us would be prepared, if necessary, to purchase medical treatment to cure an illness. This suggests that everybody is potentially a buyer (or consumer) of health care. More precisely, at any moment, a buyer would be anybody who was ill or who wanted preventative medical treatment such as vaccination or who wanted guidance about their health. The sellers would be those people who could provide medical and health care services, such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists and high street chemists.</p>
                            <p>The concept of supply and demand analysis helps to understand exactly how this spending of money operates in a market system. The answers to these and a thousand other questions can be found in the theory of supply and demand. This theory shows how consumer preferences determine consumer demand for commodities, while business costs underpin the supply of commodities. Finally, we will see how supply and demand are brought into balance by the movement of prices – by the prices.</p>

                            <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
                            <p>When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. At this point, the allocation of goods is at its most efficient because the amount of goods being supplied is exactly the same as the amount of goods being demanded. Thus, everyone (individuals, firms, or countries) is satisfied with the current economic condition. At the given price, suppliers are selling all the goods that they have produced and consumers are getting all the goods that they are demanding.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Law of supply and demand</h4>
                            <p>For higher prices less quantity is demanded and vice versa. Moreover, determinant of demand are taste, number of buyers, income, price of related goods and technology.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Law of supply</h4>

                            <p><strong>Healthcare financing</strong> is much more than a matter of raising money for health.

                                    <h4>General revenue or earmarked taxes</h4>
                                    <p>The most traditional way of financing health care finances a major portion of the health care (especially in low income countries) Social insurance. It is compulsory. Everyone in the eligible group must enroll and pay a specific premium contribution in exchange for a set of benefits. Social insurance premiums and benefits are described in social compacts established through legislation. Premiums or benefits can be altered only through a formal political process.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Private insurance</h4>
                                    <p>Private contract offered by an insurer to exchange a set of benefits for a payment of a specified premium. Marketed either by nonprofit or for profit insurance companies, consumers voluntarily choose to purchase an insurance package that best matches their preference. Private insurance is offered on individual and group basis. Under individual insurance the premium is based on that individuals risk characteristics. Major concern in private insurance is buyer’s adverse selection, under group insurance; the premium is calculated on a group basis. Risk is pooled across age, gender and health status.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Who Funds The Health Sector In Kenya?</h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The health sector in Kenya obtains varying levels of funding from the traditional sources: public (government), private firms, households and donors. According to the 2005/06 National Health Accounts (NHA), households remain the largest contributors of health funds, at 35.9%, followed by the government, and then donors, who contribute approximately 30%.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Health Financing: How much is available?</h3>
                            <p>The GOK funds25 the health sector through budgetary allocations to the MoH and the MoPHS and related government departments. As far as government spending is concerned, the Ministry of Finance sets three year budget ceilings for each sector in Kenya. In practical terms this means that the Ministry of Health creates a budget based on what the Ministry of Finance has said it will allocate for health expenditures rather than submitting a budget request based on actual needs. The Ministry of Health then disburses the funds it receives through its District Health Management Boards. The health budget shortfalls are manifest in the widespread lack of adequate drugs and pharmaceuticals, staff shortages and poor maintenance of equipment, transport, and facilities.</p>
                            
                            <h3>From the Kenyan People (Cost Sharing)</h3>
                            <p>Over the past two decades, the GOK has pursued a policy of cost sharing to bridge the gap between actual budgets and the level of resources needed to fund public health sector activities. The revenue from the cost-sharing programme has continued to grow in absolute terms and as a percentage of the recurrent government budget. In 2002-03, cost-sharing contributed over 8% of the recurrent expenditure and about 21% of the non-wage recurrent budget of the MoH. However, because of the worsening poverty situation in the country, the MoH has changed its cost-sharing policy and replaced it with a “10/20” policy, in which dispensaries and health centres are not to charge user fees for curative care other than Ksh 10 or 20 for client cards28.</p>
                            
                            <h3>From the Donors</h3>
                            <p>Kenya depends significantly on donor funds, many of which supplement the development component of the national health budget. In 2009/10, on-budget external resources accounted for 15.1% of all health spending in Kenya, or Kshs 7.1 million. In 2005/06, Kenya’s health budget was made up to 11.3% by donor contributions. Over the years, Kenya’s health sector has increased its dependency on external sources.</p>
                            
                            <p>All donor commitments for Kenya’s health sector—on and off budget—represent USD 99 million in 200831, down from USD 147 million in 2005. The United States is the largest bilateral donor, channelling funds through PEPFAR, the President’s Malaria Initiative and USAID with USD 32.4 million in 2008. The United Kingdom also commits significant bilateral funds to the health sector (USD 30 million). When analyzing donors’ actual health disbursements to Kenya’, the picture looks different. In 2008, donors provided USD 116 million up from USD 102 million in the previous year. The biggest donors were GAVI, Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United Kingdom. This graph shows that the US ranks only fifth.</p>

                            <p>In Kenya the budgetary process comprises three main stages: drafting, legislation, and implementation and audit. Reforms aimed at improving the budgetary process have sought to impose greater fiscal discipline on the government among other objectives such as attaining allocative and operational/technical efficiency. The constitution requires the executive to raise and allocate resources for government projects within this rigorous budget process. The Budget cycle is based on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) cycle. The MTEF process prioritizes definition of a global resource envelope, determination of inter-sectoral allocations based on core functions and proposals of inter-sectoral allocations based on outcomes, activities and outputs. Public hearings and involvement of private and civil society in the budget preparation enhances transparency.</p>
                            <p>The MTEF process revolves around the activities of ten MTEF sectors, including the human resource development sector. To guide the preparation of MTEF, the Ministry of Finance issues to all ministries, departments and government agencies in August a circular detailing the guidelines with objectives for the financial year. The Circular-Budget preparation guidelines for budget 2010-11 for example directed that the preparation of the budget for the next MTEF period should be within the context of stimulating growth and creating jobs, reducing poverty and enhancing food security, and protecting the poor and most vulnerable of the society while improving government efficiency in delivering services.</p>
                            <p>The budget is prepared through Sector Working Groups (SWGs) comprising different ministries, departments, and agencies. The overall fiscal and macroeconomic framework—including strategies, outlook and forecast—determines the role of ministerial working groups (MWGs). The Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MoPHS) and the Ministry of Medical Services (MoMS) both appoint representatives to the ministerial working group who then work within the SWG. The two ministries fall under the human resource development sector.</p>
                            <p>The Sector Working Groups are urged to ensure that they only consider proposals for funding that support the achievement of the objectives and priorities outlined in the Medium Term Strategy of Vision 2030. The Circular from the Ministry of Finance encourages the involvement of districts and other stakeholders in the MTEF budget process through the sector hearings. The purpose of the Sector Hearings is to ensure transparent discussions of priorities of government for the next financial year with key stakeholders including development partners, civil society, private sector and research institutions.</p>
