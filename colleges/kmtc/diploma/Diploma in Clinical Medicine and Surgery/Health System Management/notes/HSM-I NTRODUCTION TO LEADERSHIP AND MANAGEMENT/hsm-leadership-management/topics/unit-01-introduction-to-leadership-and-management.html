It involves planning, leading, organizing and controlling an organization, as well as more the intangible qualities of inspiration and motivation.

                            <h3>Who Is a Manager and What Are Their Roles?</h3>
                            <p>A manager is a person who has the responsibility for achieving certain outcomes, along with the authority to utilize the resources of the organization in doing so. The combination of responsibility and authority is crucial to the concept of management. Timeliness is another critical aspect. The timely use of the resources – whether human, financial, information or physical assets – is essential for effective management. In an ideal management team, the team members recognize the authority of the manager and provide support in a constructive way.</p>
                            
                            <p>A manager is therefore a person who can or¬ganize people to work together harmoniously and make effective use of resources to achieve laid-down objectives, through a process that includes planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A dis¬tinction should be made between a manager who is a leader, and one who is an administrator. Adminis¬tration is a subset of management. An administrator is somebody who interprets policies and directives from above for implementation, knows the rules and applies them well. The administrator and the manager do not have to be different people.</p>

                            <h3>Process Management</h3>
                            <p>Process management means documenting processes (the way work should be done in the organization), measuring the results of that work as seen by the end users, target populations and policy makers, and taking corrective action if results don’t meet ex¬pectations. In a well-managed organization, all staff members have two responsibilities – to do their job and to improve their work processes. It is upon the management to direct and support staff in realizing these responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>A health system is managed by a team and will be most productive and efficient if the team focuses on technique – the way the team members work together, the methods through which services are delivered. It is very easy to focus on what you do. It is more important to focus on why you do it. To¬day the paradigm of health care is becoming more client-centred, a concept that leads to demands for client-oriented, health promoting and higher quality health care services. Thus managers need to keep focused on the population for whom they are working to reduce suffering and mortality caused by disease. Continuous improvement is at the heart of process management.</p>

This type of management places emphasis on the members of the organization usually referred to as “body corporate”, that is, the personnel or employees. The Administrative theory was developed by a French top Management specialist called <strong>Henri Fayol</strong>, (1841-1925). The theory emerged in 1916 and it emphasized the perspective of senior managers within the organization. Taylor argued that management was a profession and could be taught.</p>

                                    <p>The shortcomings to this theory are:</p>

                                    <p>These limitations come because of the complexity of organizations. It is better for small organizations, although it is mainly applied in the government organizations.</p>
                                    <p>Bureaucratic theory served to fit the traditional organizations which were less innovative in their operations and later around 1930's, human relations theory was developed to look at the human aspect of the organization.</p>

                            <p>In this management approach the manager sets clear objectives to be realized. This is repeated in every department in the organization to help realize the broad organizational goal. It is worth noting that objectives must be SMART so as to ensure the organization realizes its objectives. To recap, SMART refers to:</p>

Vague language or generalities are not results. It identifies the nature of expected changes, the target, region, etc. It should be as detailed as possible without being wordy.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Measurable:</strong> The objective is measurable quali¬tatively and/or quantitatively.</span></li>

                            <p><strong>Central goal setting-</strong> this is the basic stage in MBO process where central management sets the definition and clarification of the organizational objectives usually in consultation with other managers (group and top manager jointly involved). The objectives should be specific and realistic……idea should be floated from top to bottom</p>
                            <p><strong>Manager-subordinate involvement-</strong> here the subordinates work with the managers in setting individual goals. These goals are specific and short range and primarily indicate what the subordinates must set goals in consultation with individuals who comprise his unit. In this manner everyone is involved in the goal setting</p>
                            <p><strong>Matching goals and resources-</strong> objectives can only be achieved if resources are available. There4 management should provide the subordinates with the necessary tools and materials to effectively achieve these goals. The resources should be allocated precisely in line with the goals set and should be done in consultation with the subordinates</p>
                            <p><strong>Freedom of implementation-</strong> there should be adequate freedom for the manager subordinate task force in deciding on the utilization of resources and means of achieving the objectives</p>
                            <p><strong>Review and appraisal of performance-</strong> there should be regular reviews of progress between managers and subordinates. These reviews would-:</p>

By separating a small part of work, the workers’ speed and accuracy in its performance increases. This principle is applicable to both technical and managerial work.</span></li>
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Authority and responsibility:</strong> The issue of com¬mands followed by responsibility for their consequences. Authority means the right of a superior to give orders to subordinates; responsibility means obligation for performance. This principle suggests that there must be parity between au¬thority and responsibility. They go together and are two sides of the same coin.</span></li>

If an employee receives orders from more than one superior, it is likely to create confusion and conflict. Unity of command also makes it easier to fix responsibility for mistakes.</span></li>
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content"><strong>Unity of direction:</strong> All those working in the same line of activity must understand and pursue the same objectives. All related activities should be put under <em>one group</em>, there should be <em>one plan</em> of action for them, and they should be under the control of <em>one manager</em>. Unity of action seeks to ensure a focus of efforts and coordination of strength.</span></li>

Therefore the interests of the goals of the organization must prevail over the personal interests of individuals.</span></li>

The quantum and methods of re¬muneration payable should be fair, reasonable and rewarding of effort.</span></li>

Centralization implies the concentration of decision making authority at the top management. Sharing of authority with lower levels is called decentralization. The organization should strive to achieve a proper balance.</span></li>

The principle suggests that there should be a clear line of authority from top to bottom linking all managers at all levels. It is considered a chain of command. It involves a concept called a “gang plank”, through which a subordinate may contact a superior or the supe¬rior’s superior in case of an emergency, defying the hierarchy of control. However, the immediate superiors must be informed about the matter.</span></li>

Initiative on the part of employees is a source of strength for the organization because it provides new and better ideas. Employees who know their ideas are respected are likely to take greater interest in the functioning of the organization.</span></li>

                            <h3>Definition:</h3>
                            <p>Leading is the process of influencing people, that is, personnel, followers so that they could contribute to the goals of the organization or group. Leadership on the other hand is the interpersonal influence, exercised in situations and directed through the communication process towards the organizational goals. It is concerned with guiding others or activities of followers/subordinates towards the pre-determined objectives/goals. A leader/manager must use influence (positive) to achieve the set objectives or goals.</p>
                            <p>However, there are as many definitions of leadership as there are people who have attempted to define it. One common theme that runs through each of them is the ability of an individual to inspire confidence and to provide support to members of a group to achieve the programme objectives.</p>
                            <p>Leadership is a process or ability to influence the behaviour of others, to motivate and mobilize others to work together and achieve a common aim. It is a way of focusing and motivating a group of people to enable them to achieve their own aims and develop themselves. It also involves being accountable and responsible for the group as a whole. Leadership comprises three factors: the leader, the people, and the situation or conditions. Thus leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail in the programme or organization.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Process of leading</h4>
                            <p>Leading involves various activities and not merely leading people. It comprises of:</p>

                            <p>A leader uses power in influencing group behavior. Power the ability to influence, command, or apply force is central to leadership and derives from several resources, including:<sup class="footnote-ref">6</sup></p>

                            <p>Power can also be referred to a measure of a person’s potential to get others to do what he or she wants them to do, as well as to avoid being forced by others to do what he or she does not want to do.</p>
                            <p>Effective leadership in organizations creates a vision of the future that considers the legitimate long-term interests of the parties involved in the organization, develops a strategy for moving toward that vision, enlists the support of employees to produce the movement, and motivates the employees to implement the strategy.</p>
                            <p>In summary leadership can be defined as a process by which a person influences others to accomplish an objective and directs the organization in a way that makes it more cohesive and coherent. This definition is similar to Northouse's (2007, p3) definition — Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.</p>

                            <p>It is important to understand the difference between management and leadership. While management deals with the administrative aspects of a manager’s work (planning, organizing, monitoring), leadership deals with the interpersonal aspects (inspiration, mo¬tivation, influence).</p>
                            <p>Qualities of both a manager and a leader are necessary. While performing managerial or administrative roles (planning, orga¬nizing and controlling), managers are often called upon to take up leadership roles that deal with the interpersonal aspects of their job (inspiration, motiva¬tion, influence) that may have a long-lasting impact on individuals and the group.</p>
                            <p>A manager without leadership skills is an admini¬strator, while a creative, far-sighted leader who is un¬able to implement a vision (without managerial skills) will confuse and lose the team. There may be only one or two designated leaders in an organization, such as the director or team leader, but leadership qualities can be found in many others within the team.</p>
                            <p>Clearly, the managers must perform both leader¬ship and management functions. The major responsi¬bilities of a manager are to operate and maintain the organization efficiently, ensuring that it provides use¬ful services to clients and the community. Managers tend to be problem-solvers, seeking better ways to use their resources to get the job done. Effective managers bring order and consistency to programmes.</p>
                            <p>Leaders, on the other hand, are pathfinders; they branch out more in their thinking. They are concerned with building the organization for the future, provid¬ing direction, securing new resources, developing new capacities, preparing the organization to meet challenges and take advantage of emerging oppor¬tunities, adapting to change, and networking.</p>

                            <p>Theories of leadership Interest in leadership increased during the early part of the twentieth century. Early leadership theories focused on what qualities distinguished between leaders and followers, while subsequent theories looked at other variables such as situational factors and skill levels. While many different leadership theories have emerged, most can be classified as one of eight major types:</p>

                                        <p>Great man theories assume that the capacity for leadership is inherent – that great leaders are born, not made. These theories often portray great leaders as heroic, mythic and destined to rise to leadership when needed. The term "Great Man" was used because, at the time, leadership was thought of primarily as a male quality, especially in terms of military leadership.</p>

Trait theories often identify particular personality or behavioral characteristics shared by leaders. If particular traits are key features of leadership, then how do we explain people who possess those qualities but are not leaders? This question is one of the difficulties in using trait theories to explain leadership.</p>

                                        <p>Contingency theories of leadership focus on particular variables related to the environment that might determine which particular style of leadership is best suited for the situation. According to this theory, no leadership style is best in all situations. Success depends upon a number of variables, including the leadership style, qualities of the followers and aspects of the situation.</p>

                                        <p>Situational theories propose that leaders choose the best course of action based upon situational variables. Different styles of leadership may be more appropriate for certain types of decision-making. For example, in a situation where the leader is the most knowledgeable and experienced member of a group, an authoritarian style might be most appropriate. In other instances where group members are skilled experts, a democratic style would be more effective.</p>
