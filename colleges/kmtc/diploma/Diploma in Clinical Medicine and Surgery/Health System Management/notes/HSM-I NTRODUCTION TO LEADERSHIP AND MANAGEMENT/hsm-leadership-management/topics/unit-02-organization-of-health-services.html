                            <p>Kenya’s health system has undergone significant change and reform in recent years and with the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution will continue to evolve. Even so, the system will reflect the inter-linked levels of national, provincial, district, sub-district and community. (These levels of local administration are subject to change in line with the implementation of the new Constitution of Kenya 2010, which provides for devolution of both authority and financial resources). The national level is made up of the MOMS and MOPHS headquarters, with the provincial level serv¬ing as de-concentrated units of the national level. (Figures 3.1 and 3.2 outline the organization of the Ministry of Medical Services and the Ministry Public Health and Sanitation, respectively.)</p>
                            
                            <p>The government health service is supplemented by privately owned and operated hospitals and clinics and faith-based organisations’ hospitals and clinics, which together provide between 30 and 40 percent of the hospital beds in Kenya.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The functions of the national level are:</h3>

                            <p>The oversight and policy formulation functions are managed through the Ministers and Assistant Minis¬ters. The Permanent Secretary (PS) is the link between the technical, administrative and oversight functions, while the Director of Medical Services (DMS) and the Director of Public Health and Sanitation (DPHS) are the coordinators of the technical functions of the respective ministries. The DMS and the DPHS execute their functions through the departments in the respec¬tive ministries. These departments are further divided into divisions as illustrated in the figures below.</p>

                            <h3>Purpose of Health structures</h3>
                            <p>The purpose of an organizational structure is to define the guidelines, parameters and the procedural process necessary for a group to accomplish a main objective. For example, the anatomy of an organizational structure is further reduced to the distribution of authority, span -of-control, and line vs. staff structures, organizational height and departmentalization.</p>
                            <p>An organizational structure organizes priorities hierarchically by means of identifying tasks critical to a group realizing an end goal. An organizational structure may adopt a live structure or a staff structure or both to achieve their main objectives. A line structure, sometimes called a product structure, identifies the activities directly responsible for the organization's main goal, such as the labor involved in making an actually product. A staff structure is the support staff or network assisting the line structures in their goals.</p>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The health sector comprises the public system, with major players including the MOH and parastatal or¬ganisations, and the private sector, which includes private for-profit, NGO, and FBO facilities. Health services are provided through a network of over 4,700 health facilities countrywide, with the public sector system accounting for about 51 percent of these facilities.</p>
                            <p>The public health system consists of the following levels of health facilities: national referral hospitals, provincial general hospitals, district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries.</p>
                            <p>National referral hospitals are at the apex of the health care system, providing sophisticated diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. The two national referral hospitals are Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital in Eldoret. The equivalent private referral hospitals are Nairobi Hospital and Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.</p>
                            <p>Provincial hospitals act as referral hospitals to their district hospitals. They also provide very specialized care. The provincial level acts as an intermediary between the national central level and the districts. They oversee the implementation of health policy at the district level, maintain quality standards, and coordi¬nate and control all district health activities. Similar private hospitals at the provincial level include Aga Khan Hospitals in Kisumu and Mombasa.</p>
                            <p>District hospitals concentrate on the delivery of health care services and generate their own expenditure plans and budget requirements based on guidelines from headquarters through the provinces.</p>
                            <p>The network of <em>health centres</em> provides many of the ambulatory health services. Health centres generally offer preventive and curative services, mostly adapted to local needs. <em>Dispensaries</em> are meant to be the system’s first line of contact with patients, but in some areas, health cen¬tres or even hospitals are effectively the first points of contact. Dispensaries provide wider coverage for preventive health measures, which is a primary goal of the health policy.</p>
