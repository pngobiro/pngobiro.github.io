                            <p><strong>A Disaster:</strong> A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental loses which exceed the ability of the affected community/society to cope using its own resources.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>A Disaster Risk:</strong> The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Disaster Risk Management:</strong> The systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Disaster Risk Reduction:</strong> The concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analyzing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variabilities of its properties and that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate Change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Adaptation to Climate Change:</strong> The adjustment in natural or human activities in responses to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that makes it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard.</p>

                            <p>Disaster occurs when a hazard results in devastation that leaves communities or even whole nations unable to cope unaided but disasters are neither inevitable nor ‘natural’. There is no such thing as a ‘natural’ disaster. Many hazards are natural and usually inevitable, like cyclones, floods, droughts and earthquakes. They are ‘hazards’ in that they can potentially harm people, economies and the environment if they are not adequately prepared.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the world has witnessed an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of disasters. Disaster cases are rising throughout the world due to a number of factors that include:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>While better emergency response systems will save lives and properties, many of these losses can be avoided – or reduced – if appropriate policies and programmes are instituted to address the root causes and set in place <strong>mitigation, preparedness and response mechanisms</strong> that are effectively integrated into overall development planning.</p>
                            <p>These issues were debated during the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (January 2005). It was therefore insisted on the need to move from theory to concrete action in disaster risk reduction.</p>

                            <p>In comprehensive emergency management model (CEMM), there should be disaster preparedness in such as way that if there is a disaster, there is effective disaster response and therefore, able to deal effectively with rehabilitation and reconstruction. Moreover, disaster mitigation is crucial in dealing with disaster.</p>

                            <p>Risk management has three components namely:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Risk identification has to be done through mapping and using other available technological options</p>
                            <p>It is usual to allocate risk management to special body at national level. Usually, it is a national disaster management organization at national level. Others support should be obtained within a National Action Plan for disaster management.</p>
                            <p>At local, it may be the responsibility of a disaster mitigation committee, which administers risk management.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Risk reduction:</h4>
                            <p>Effective risk reduction involves mitigation measures in hazard prone areas. It may also involve overcoming the socio-economic, institutional and political barriers to the adoption of effective risk reduction strategies and measures in developing countries.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Risk Management:</h4>
                            <p>This is the process by which assessed risks are mitigated, minimized or controlled through engineering, management of land use prances or other operational means. This involves the optimal allocation of available resources in support of group goals</p>
                            
                            <h4>Risk Transfer:</h4>
                            <p>Effective risk transfer involves different tools such as insurances; tax polices special measures focused on land management. Organizational structures, policies, legislation etc is required for effective implementation of risk transfer strategies for a country or local government areas.</p>
