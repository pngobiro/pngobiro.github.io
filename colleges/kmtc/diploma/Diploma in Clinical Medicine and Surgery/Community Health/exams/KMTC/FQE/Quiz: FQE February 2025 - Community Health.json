        { "id": "d", "text": "Immunization", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Secondary prevention focuses on early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Surveillance often involves active case finding and early detection, which fits this category. Immunization/Child spacing are Primary; Rehabilitation is Tertiary.",
      "hint": "Think about early detection rather than prevention of onset or disability limitation."
