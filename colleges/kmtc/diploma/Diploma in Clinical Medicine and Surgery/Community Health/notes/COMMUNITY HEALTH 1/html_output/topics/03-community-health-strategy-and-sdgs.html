                            <li>Rising infant mortality rate from 64 per 1,000 live births in 1993, to 72 in 1998, 74 in 2000 and 77 per 1,000 live births in 2003 (KDS 2003).</li>
                            <li>Rising under five mortality rate from 90.9 per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 115 per 1,000 live births in 2003 (KDS 2003).</li>
                            <li>High maternal mortality rate of 590 per 100,000 in 1998 and 414 in 2002 per 100,000 live births (MOH 2005).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Specific challenges- KDHS 2003.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>30.7% of the children under 5 years were stunted.</li>
                            <li>Only 2.6% children were still exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months while 56.8% (of 2.6%) were still breastfeeding by end of 2003.</li>
                            <li>Only 59.2 per cent of children in the second year of life were fully immunized.</li>
                            <li>Only 4.3% under-fives and 4.5% pregnant mothers sleep under ITNs respectively.</li>
                            <li>Only 40.8 per cent of deliveries were assisted by a health professional and only 39.4 per cent occur in health facilities.</li>
                            <li>There were rising levels of communicable diseases (Malaria, TB, HIV etc).</li>
                            <li>There was poor state of sanitation and water supply.</li>
                            <li>Community members take care of preventive, promotive and some of the critically ill cases.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Justification of community health strategy.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Studies in Tanzania and Malawi have shown that 70% of child deaths occur at home, caused by preventable or easily curable diseases such as malaria, measles, ARI, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition.</li>
                            <li>Formal health providers are supply driven (assume what they advised or give has been accepted or is practical), usually not true.</li>
                            <li>Traditional and non-formal care is the first option for many people and they compete with formal health care system at community level.</li>
                            <li>An effort to strengthen community level health care has been scattered, uncoordinated and vertically managed by various actors resulting on weak public health interventions.</li>
                            <li>These contributed to the deterioration of health indices.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What does community health strategy entail?</h3>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Establishing a level one care community unit to serve a local population of about 5000 people (CU).</li>
                            <li>Instituting a cadre of well-trained community health volunteers (CHVs) who will each provide level one service to about 20 households.</li>
                            <li>Supporting every 25 CHVs with a community health extension worker (CHEW) ensuring that the recruitment and management of CHVs is carried out by village and community health committees.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Organize communities into functional units of 1000 households.</li>
                            <li>Use CHVs who will work on voluntary basis.</li>
                            <li>Incentives to CHVs to include protective wear, where necessary, drug kits, reimbursement of direct costs and periodic reward for excellent performance.</li>
                            <li>CHV to be nominated by the communities on the basis of pre-defined criteria.</li>
                            <li>Community heath extension workers (CHEWs) to be on government payroll and facilitated (e.g. transport and lunches).</li>
                            <li>Community to play a leading role in joint health actions.</li>
                            <li>Coordination structure to bring all actors at all levels.</li>

                            <li>End of extreme poverty in all forms by 2030.</li>
                            <li>In 2000, the world committed to cutting the number of people living in extreme poverty by half in 15 years and we met this goal.</li>
                            <li>However, more than 800 million people around the world still live on less than $1.25$ a day, that's about the equivalent of the entire population of Europe living in extreme poverty.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Improve food security and nutrition.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In the past 20 years, hunger has dropped by almost half.</li>
                            <li>Many countries that used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet the nutritional needs of their most vulnerable people.</li>
                            <li>That means doing things such as promoting sustainable agriculture and supporting small farmers.</li>
                            <li>It's a tall order but for the sake of the nearly 1 out of every 9 people on earth who go to bed hungry every night, we've got to try.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>We all know how important it is to be in good health.</li>
                            <li>Since 1990, we've made big strides, preventable child deaths are down by more than half, and maternal mortality is down by almost as much.</li>
                            <li>Some other numbers remain tragically high, like every year 6 million children die before their fifth birthday.</li>
                            <li>AIDS is the leading cause of death for adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>4. Ensure equitable quality education.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Poverty, armed conflict and other emergencies keep many kids around the world out of school.</li>
                            <li>In developing regions, kids from the poorest households are four times more likely to be out of school than those of the richest house- holds.</li>
                            <li>Since 2000 , there has been enormous progress on the goal to provide primary education to all children world- wide.</li>
                            <li>The primary school enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91%.</li>
                            <li>More girls are in school now compared to the year 2000.</li>
                            <li>Most regions have reached gender parity in primary education.</li>
                            <li>This goal aims to ensure that there is an end to discrimination against women and girls everywhere.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>5. Ensure gender equality and women empowerment.</h3>

                            <li>Women and girls continue to suffer from distribution and violence in every part of the world.</li>
                            <li>1 in 5 women and girls between the ages 15-49 have reported experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner.</li>
                            <li>Many countries have no laws protecting women from domestic violence.</li>
                            <li>Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work and representation in political and economic decision-making processes.</li>
                            <li>Many countries have taken action to track budget allocation for gender equality.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>6. Ensure availability of water and sanitation.</h3>

                            <li>Everyone on earth should have access to safe and affordable drinking water.</li>
                            <li>That's the goal for 2030.</li>
                            <li>Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of people around the world, and that number is projected to go even higher as a result of climate change.</li>
                            <li>If we continue the path we're on, by 2050 at least one in four people are likely to be affected by recurring water shortages.</li>
                            <li>Diarrhea, caused by inadequate access to water and sanitation, is the fifth leading cause of death in the world.</li>
                            <li>Unsafe water and sanitation facilities account for most of the 1.2 million deaths of children under five each year caused by diarrhea.</li>
                            <li>They also cause great suffering in both adults and children through diseases associated with intestinal parasites.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>7. Ensure access to affordable energy.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity increased by 1.7 billion. That's progress to be proud of.</li>
                            <li>As the world's population continues to rise, more people will need cheap energy to light their homes and streets, use phones and computers and do their everyday business.</li>
                            <li>The way we get energy is an issue. Fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions (e.g Water vapour, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, methane, nitrous oxide, Ozone, etc) are making drastic changes in the climate, leading to big problems on every continent.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>An important part of economic growth is that people should have jobs that pay enough to support themselves and their families.</li>
                            <li>The middle class is growing worldwide, almost tripling in size in developing countries in the last 25 years.</li>
                            <li>But in 2015, there was widening inequalities where over 200 million people had no jobs.</li>
                            <li>We can promote policies that encourage entrepreneurship and job creation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>9. Build infrastructure and sustainable industrialization.</h3>

                            <li>Technological progress helps us address big global challenges such as creating jobs and becoming more energy efficient.</li>

                            <li>The more connected we are, the more we benefit from the wisdom and contributions of people everywhere on earth.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.</li>
                            <li>We can and must adopt policies that create opportunity for everyone, regardless of whom they are or where they come from.</li>
                            <li>Income inequality is a global problem that requires global solutions.</li>
                            <li>That means improving the regulation of financial markets and institutions, sending development aid where it is most needed and helping people migrate safely so they can pursue opportunities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>11. Make cities and human settlements safe.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>More than half the world's population now lives in cities and that figure will go to about two- thirds of humanity by the year 2050 .</li>
                            <li>In 1990 there were ten "mega-cities" with 10 million inhabitants or more.</li>
                            <li>In 2014, there were 28 mega-cities, home to 453 million people.</li>
                            <li>To make cities sustainable for all, we can create good affordable public housing, upgrade slum settlements, invest in public transport, create green spaces and get involved in urban planning decisions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>12.Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.</h3>
