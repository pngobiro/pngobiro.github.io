                            <li>Primary Health Care: This is an essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound, and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participations and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination.</li>
                            <li>Community: This is a group of people living together in the same geographical area, sharing common interests.</li>
                            <li>Community participation/involvement: It implies sensitizing the people to their health problems, increasing their receptivity and ability to prevent disease, death and handicap.</li>
                            <li>Community based programs: These are public Health interventions that are designed, implemented and evaluated with the participation of the community representatives and with the guidance of professional experts.</li>
                            <li>Essential health care: Group of functions essential for the health of the people given at lower level of health service. E.g. Medical care, MCH/FP, school health, environmental health, control of communicable diseases, health education, referral, etc.</li>
                            <li>Scientifically sound: Scientifically explainable and acceptable.</li>
                            <li>Socially acceptable methods and technology: Intervention should consider the local value, culture and belief.</li>
                            <li>Universally accessible: Because of the inequitable distribution of the available resources, the services are not reachable by all who need them. Only a few can afford or within the reach to use them, while the majority are excluded from the service. Therefore, PHC being health care as close as possible to where people live and work, guarantee universal accessibility.</li>

                        <h3>Early Approaches.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In the 1950's, there were vertical health service strategies that included mass campaigns, specialized control programs for communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), etc., but the strategy was very expensive and so unsuccessful.</li>
                            <li>The concept of basic health service came into being in the mid1960s. This gives more attention to rural areas through the construction of health centers and health stations providing both curative and preventive services.</li>
                            <li>Early 1970: Integration of specialized disease control programs with basic health services came to appear. However, even this approach was disease oriented, based on high cost health institutions and requires advanced technology.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Summary on effect of health services and programs during 1950-1970s.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Despite health being a fundamental human right the health status of hundreds of millions people in the world was unacceptable.</li>
                            <li>In spite of the tremendous efforts in medicine and technology, the health status of people in disadvantaged areas of most countries remained low.</li>
                            <li>The organized limited health institutions failed to meet the demands of those most in need who are usually too poor or geographically or socially remote to benefit from such facilities (Accessibility).</li>
                            <li>The health services often created were in isolations, neglecting other sector (Agriculture, Education, Water Supply etc.), which are relevant to the improvement and development of health.</li>
                            <li>Health institutions stressed curative services with insufficient priority to preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care.</li>
                            <li>The community has already been given the opportunity to play an active role in deciding the types of activities they want and have not participated in the actual services they receive.</li>
                            <li>All the above facts summed up and led WHO and UNICEF to evaluate and reexamine the existing policies in 1978, Alma-Ata, and the concept of PHC.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Emphasized principles in PHC are:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Inter-sectoral collaboration.</li>
                            <li>Community participation.</li>
                            <li>Use of appropriate technology.</li>
                            <li>Equity.</li>
                            <li>Focus on prevention and promotion of health.</li>
                            <li>Decentralization.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>1. Inter-sectoral collaboration:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Means a joint concern and responsibility of sectors responsible for development in identifying problems, programs and undertaking tasks that have important bearing on human well-being.</li>
                            <li>Inter-sectoral collaboration is very important, as the intrinsic relationship of health to other sectors is evident. That is low level of education, poor access to transport, limited access to safe water supply can affect health status.</li>
                            <li>Similarly, development in these sectors cannot process smoothly without health development.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Benefit of Inter-sectoral collaboration.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It enhances communication and good relationship among the sectors.</li>
                            <li>It avoids resource wastage by minimizing duplications of projects and programs.</li>
                            <li>Encourages a forum for exchanging and sharing ideas, skills, resources and technologies.</li>
                            <li>It leads to a successful project implementation.</li>
                            <li>Avoids confusion of the community.</li>
                            <li>As a long term outcome it promotes integrated and fast development of a country.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>2. Community participation:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Community is a group of people living together in the same geographical area, sharing common interests.</li>
                            <li>Community participation/involvement implies sensitizing the people to their health problems, increasing their receptivity and ability to prevent disease, death and disability.</li>
                            <li>This helps them to respond to development programmers and encourages local initiatives.</li>
                            <li>Community participation/involvement in programs is a spectrum that ranges from receiving the benefits to actually planning and evaluating them.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Types of community participation/involvement.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Marginal: Participation of people in the health programs in a limited and transitory way.</li>
                            <li>Substantial: The community plays active role in determining priorities and helping in carrying out health related activities, such as, health education, provision of drinking water and maintenance of good personal and food hygiene.</li>
                            <li>Structural: Participation of the community in health care becomes an integral part of the program and a major basis for health activities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Interpretations on community involvement.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>At a WHO sponsored meeting on community participation in health, held at Brioni, Yugoslavia, in 1985, two broad and distinct interpretations on community involvement were identified.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Those were:</h3>
                        <ol type="i" class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Creating awareness and understanding, regarding the causes of poor health, thus making it a basis for their involvement in health related activities.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring easy access to information and knowledge about health service programs and projects.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Therefore, in this approach, people have the right and duty to actively involve themselves in:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Solving their own health problems.</li>
                            <li>Assessing their health needs.</li>
                            <li>Taking responsibility for mobilizing local resources.</li>
                            <li>Supporting new approaches and solutions to their problems.</li>
                            <li>Creating and maintaining local organizations.</li>
                            <li>Administration and financing of the health services.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Advantages of a community participation approach.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is a cost-effective way of extending a health care system to the geographical and social periphery of a country.</li>
                            <li>Communities that begin to understand their health status objectively rather than fatalistically may be moved to take a series of preventive measures.</li>
                            <li>Communities that invest labor, time, money and materials in health-promoting activities are more committed to the use and maintenance of the things they produce, such as water supplies.</li>
                            <li>Health education is most effective as part and parcel of village activities.</li>
                            <li>Community health workers, if well chosen, have the people's confidence because they know the most effective techniques for achieving commitment from their neighbors and they are not likely to exploit them.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Factors that hinder involvement of the community in health:</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Rigid professional behavior of health service providers, which need to be tempered to allow greater community involvement.</li>
                            <li>The professional staff generally takes decisions in health services and there is no tradition of allowing people to be involved in decision making.</li>
                            <li>Wrong assumption by health staff that community does not know what is good for them and that only health staff can determine their needs.</li>
                            <li>Lack of flexibility in health service and general unwillingness to change.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Mechanisms for supporting community Involvement.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Political commitment: National health policy should clearly design the need and support of community involvement in health care, and lay down working arrangement. The government should assure full political support.</li>
                            <li>Reorientation of bureaucracy: Bureaucracy has the power to make all decisions. Their role should be changed and they should learn to seek community involvement in health, so that people can determine their own priorities and decide on the process to achieve their goals.</li>
                            <li>Support to the community in managing health project: Management support and guidance should be given to the community to help the people in overseeing primary health care activities in their area.</li>
                            <li>Inputs: There should be critical minimum inputs for basic health services and coverage to ensure co-operation of the community. People can be involved in health activities only if these are available to their satisfaction.</li>
                            <li>Partnership: Genuine partnership between health professionals and people is necessary for success.</li>
                            <li>Leadership: Individual and collective leadership at the community level should be promoted.</li>
                            <li>Active community involvement: Community involvement in decision making should be at a realistic level so that it is sustainable and durable.</li>
                            <li>Decentralization: There should be decentralization of administrative and decision making functions. This should be accompanied by shift of resources to the locality.</li>
                            <li>Safeguards: Sufficient safeguards should be built in to prevent local political and elite from exploiting the resource for their own end benefits.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3. Use of appropriate technology.</h3>

                            <li>It takes account of both the health care and the socio-economic context of the country.</li>
                            <li>This must include consideration of cost (efficiency and attractiveness) in dealing with the health problem.</li>
                            <li>It should also take consideration of the acceptability of the health care approach to both target community and health service technology and it does not necessarily mean low cost.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Criteria for technology appropriateness.</h3>
                        <p>To be appropriate, a technology must be;</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Effective, i.e should meet its objectives.</li>
                            <li>Culturally acceptable and valuable.</li>
                            <li>Affordable.</li>
                            <li>Locally sustainable: We should be not over dependent on important skills and supplies for its continuous function, maintenance and repair.</li>
                            <li>Environmentally accountable: The technology should be environmentally harmless or at least minimally harmful.</li>
                            <li>Measurable: - The impact and performance of technology should be measurable.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>4. Equity.</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>This is to close the gaps between the "haves and have nots" which will help to achieve more equitable distribution of health resources.</li>
                            <li>If all cannot be served, those most in need should have priority.</li>
                            <li>While planning for equity in PHC, one requires the identification of groups, which are currently disadvantaged in terms of health services access and utilization of service.</li>
                            <li>Generally, it implies that the rural and peri-urban poor population should also have a reasonable access to health service.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>5. Focus on prevention.</h3>

                            <li>In addition to the fact that prevention is better, cheaper and easier than cure, the main health problems plaguing developing countries are preventive in nature. Community should engage more on preventive services.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">THE BAMAKO INITIATIVE.</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>In 1987 Sub-Saharan Africa was in a deep political and economic crisis. In several Countries child mortality rates exceeded 200 per 1,000 live births. The debt service obligations were crashing stagnant economies. National budgets for health, education and other social services were declining, despite a rapidly increasing population.</li>
                            <li>The Government financial allocation to public health, in the best cases, was barely enough to pay the salary of the staff. As a result the availability of public health services was deteriorating fast.</li>
                            <li>During this period, the philosophy of Primary Health Care (PHC) was the main strategy to improve health service delivery. However, African countries were bogged down by the lack of resources and of practical implementation strategies.</li>
                            <li>In many African Ministries of Health, PHC became one of the several, externally financed, vertical programs.</li>
                            <li>At that time, the World Bank was tentatively moving into the health sector with little experience, a strong ideological framework based on privatization, cost recovery and big loans.</li>
                            <li>This led to the introduction of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The ideology of SAPs was to assist the third world countries in using donor money prudently. The health sector was much affected.</li>
                            <li>The Bamako Initiative (BI) was a pragmatic strategy to implement primary health care (PHC) in the era of economic structural adjustment.</li>
                            <li>UNICEF, then under the leadership of Mr. James P. Grant, had embarked in a strong advocacy effort (Adjustment with a Human Face) to call the world's attention to the need of rescheduling the debt and of guaranteeing that under the adjustment program imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) social safety nets were solidly in place.</li>
                            <li>Mr. Grant had launched the Child Survival Revolution, which was accused by the WHO of lacking the comprehensiveness of Primary Health Care and thus missing the sustainability component.</li>
                            <li>The surprise launch of the Bamako Initiative during the September 1987 WHO Regional Meeting of the African Ministers of Health was his response to the critics of the Growth Monitoring, Oral Rehydration, Immunization, Family Planning, Female Education approach and his attempt to focus the world attention to the African situation.</li>
                            <li>The Bamako Initiative (BI) was a pragmatic strategy to implement primary health care (PHC) in the era of economic structural adjustment.</li>
                            <li>Championed by UNICEF's charismatic leader, James Grant, it sought to fill the gap created by WHO's open-ended approach to health for all and a hard economic reforms pursued by the World Bank and IMF.</li>
                            <li>Economic reforms virtually destroyed social services and safety nets. The idea of BI was to select a few critical elements of PHC for child survival, which would be funded partly through community contributions.</li>
                            <li>These contributions were expected to be in addition to donor and Government expenditure.</li>
                            <li>Grant's proposal was based on the awareness that many health facilities lacked the medicines and the cash in hand to function. As a result, the health workers were merely prescribing drugs to be bought from private outlets, very often unlicensed an unsupervised.</li>
                            <li>Many patients were not even bothering to turn up, when sick, to the inefficient public clinics. They were just buying drugs in pharmacies and markets or visiting private clinics, where they were available and affordable.</li>
                            <li>So in Grant's mind several questions were urgently in need of practical answers.</li>
                            <li>E.g. How could we increase and sustain the progresses in immunization?</li>
                            <li>How could we ensure that diarrhea, respiratory infections and, maybe, malaria, could get properly addressed in an efficient way?</li>
                            <li>How could we guarantee that drugs were always available in public facilities to attract a large number of clients to the curative and preventive services required to drastically reduce child mortality?</li>
                            <li>The core of the challenge was to promote additional donor investment, stop and reverse the decline of Government expenditure and attract back into the public health system the money spent by people to purchase drugs in the private and informal sector.</li>
                            <li>The communities were not expected to contribute more resources out of their pocket, but on the contrary to receive better quality services, curative as well as preventive, from a fraction of what they were already spending in the informal system.</li>
                            <li>The cost reduction was to be achieved by improvement of the infrastructure, supply of drugs and consumables, training of the staff (all financed by donors) and by introducing a mechanism of oversight, run by community representatives.</li>
                            <li>The expected advantages of this reform process were the availability of a limited, but lifesaving package of health services, both preventive and curative and a community of users responsible for running their basic health units, while primed for health action at community level.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>INTRODUCTION OF USER FEES FOR HEALTH</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>One principal vehicle for implementation of user fees is the Bamako Initiative (BI), adopted by African health ministers in 1987, and aimed primarily at increasing availability of resources for essential drugs.</li>
                            <li>The Initiative was promoted by the UNICEF and the WHO, and stressed the need for community and individual self-reliance and participation in planning, organization, operation and control of primary healthcare, making fullest use of local, national and other available resources.</li>
                            <li>The BI proposed decentralizing health decision making to the district level; establishing a realistic national drug policy; and providing basic essential drugs.</li>
                            <li>It advocated a combination of financing by users, communities, districts and the central government, depending on the specific circumstances in each country.</li>
                            <li>It stipulated that fees collected from patients should not replace existing health budgets. The community would control locally generated funds with consideration for protecting the poorest.</li>
                            <li>The BI recognized that fees could be a barrier to treatment for low-income districts or households, and included ways of dealing with this. Charges were supposed to be set at a level which is modest in relation to household income, but which still generates enough income to allow for a proportion of patients not to pay anything.</li>
                            <li>Community health committees or the government could subsidize those on low incomes.</li>
                            <li>Preventive care, such as vaccinations, could be given free or heavily subsidized.</li>
                            <li>Charges for less essential but very popular treatments, such as injections, were allowed to be higher than for vital treatments. It was also expected that low-income areas would receive larger government subsidies.</li>
                            <li>The emphasis of the resolution adopted by African health ministers was on community participation in the financing of health services, through "drug revolving funds" (in which an initial supply of drugs is provided to a community, and proceeds from the sale of these drugs are used to buy further supplies).</li>
                            <li>Although countries followed different paths in implementing the Bamako Initiative, in practice they had a common core objective: providing a basic package of integrated services through revitalized health centers that employ user fees and community co-management of funds.</li>
                            <li>A number of common support structures were organized around this core agenda, including the supply of essential drugs, training and supervision, and monitoring.</li>
                            <li>The pace of expansion of BI varied depending on the availability of internal and external resources, local capacity, the need to work at the speed of community needs and pressure from governments and donors.</li>
                            <li>Most of the sub-Saharan countries that adopted the BI employed some form of phased scaling up, and several countries - most notably Benin, Mali and Rwanda - achieved significant results.</li>
                            <li>In essence, implementing the BI was a political process that involved changing the prevailing patterns of authority and power.</li>
                            <li>Community participation in the management and control of resources at the health-facility level was the main mechanism for ensuring accountability of public health services to users.</li>
                            <li>Health committees representing communities were able to hold monitoring sessions during which coverage targets, inputs and expenditures were set, reviewed, analyzed and compared.</li>
                            <li>It is estimated that the initiative improved the access, availability, affordability and use of health services in large parts of Africa, raised and sustained immunization coverage, and increased the use of services among children and women in the poorest fifth of the populace.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>LIMITATIONS OF BAMAKO INITIATIVE</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The application of user fees to poor households and the principles of cost recovery drew strong criticism, and though many African countries adopted the approach, only in a handful were initiatives scaled up.</li>
                            <li>Even in those countries where BI has been deemed a success, poor people viewed price as a barrier in the early 2000s, and a large share did not use essential health services despite exemptions and subsidies.</li>
                            <li>Public accountability is now well recognized as a non-optional component in the production of public goods and can be achieved in several ways depending on the cultural and political context. The group of people with a vested interest in public health, i.e. local community, creates a system of checks and balances. The users and providers are both accountable. If the users are powerless, the system works for the provider's exclusive interest.</li>
                            <li>The user power is not free to have and it needs to be maintained. A substantive amount of control by the users of the resources needed for the functioning of the health unit is a prerequisite for accountability.</li>
                            <li>If money is essential, information is equally important. In the BI, health committees representing communities were able to hold monitoring sessions in which coverage targets, inputs and expenditures were set, reviewed, analyzed and compared. The health staff acted as technical resources, not as masters of the facilities.</li>
                            <li>To gain the popular support needed to win over the resistance of staff to changes of their power, it is important to start by producing rapid improvements at the service delivery end. In the BI experience, the bulk of resources were invested in the basic health units to improve availability, quality and affordability of services to gain a rapid support of the people in the early phase of the process.</li>
                            <li>The challenge to provide quality services for the poor is compounded today by the AIDS pandemic. Health statistics in Africa are worse today than they were in 1987.</li>
                            <li>Africans are today more aware that it is up to them to hold their leaders accountable. The experience gained in implementing the BI could provide them with few practical hints of how to assert their rights to essential social services.</li>

                            <li>International Conference on Primary Health Care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 6-12 September 1978.</li>
                            <li>It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all the people of the world.</li>
                            <li>It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care.</li>
                            <li>The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) as the key to achieving the goal of "Health for All".</li>

                            <li>The Conference strongly reaffirms that health, is a fundamental human right.</li>
                            <li>The existing gross inequality in the health status of the people, is politically, socially, and economically unacceptable and is, therefore, of common concern to all countries.</li>
                            <li>Economic and social development, is of basic importance to the fullest attainment of health for all and to the reduction of the gap between the health status of the developing and developed countries.</li>
                            <li>The people have a right and duty to participate individually and collectively in the planning and implementation of their health care.</li>
                            <li>Governments have a responsibility for the health of their people which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures. A main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole world community should be the attainment by all peoples by the year 2000 .</li>
                            <li>Primary health care is essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound, and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of selfreliance and self-determination.</li>
                            <li>An acceptable level of health for all the people of the world by the year 2000 can be attained through a fuller and better use of the world's resources, a considerable part of which is now spent on armaments and military conflicts.</li>
                            <li>All governments should formulate national policies, strategies and plans of action to launch and sustain PHC as part of a comprehensive national health system and in coordination with other sectors.</li>
                            <li>All countries should cooperate in a spirit of partnership and service to ensure PHC for all people since the attainment of health by people in any one country directly concerns and benefits every other country.</li>
