                        <h3>Definition.</h3>
                        <p>HCBC is Care of persons with chronic or terminal illnesses extended from health facility to the patients' home through family participation and community involvement within available resources and in collaboration with health care workers.</p>

                        <h3>Why HCBC?</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Most patients with chronic and terminal illnesses are discharged before full recovery and therefore the need for continuity of care.</li>
                            <li>Health institutions have many limitations such as shortage of health workers and bed capacity.</li>
                            <li>Most care providers at home lack basic knowledge on self-protection when caring for patients especially those with HIV and other infectious infections.</li>
                            <li>HCBC helps reduce the stigma attached to some chronic diseases.</li>
                            <li>There is need to offer continuity of care to prolong lives and reduce suffering of patients with chronic/terminal illness.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Objectives of HCBC.</h3>

                            <li>When services or resources within reach are not able to meet the patients' immediate needs.</li>

                            <li>When the caregiver experiences burnout and has no access to counselling services for personal growth.</li>
                            <li>When the caregiver has limitations in meeting certain needs of the patient, for example, based on religious beliefs.</li>
                            <li>For better, more competent management in the next stage of referral.</li>
                            <li>For specialised care in a hospital setting, especially if the patient is deteriorating.</li>
