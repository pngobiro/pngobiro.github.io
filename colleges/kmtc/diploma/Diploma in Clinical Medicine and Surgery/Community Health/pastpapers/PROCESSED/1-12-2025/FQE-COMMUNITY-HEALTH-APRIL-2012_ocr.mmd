\section*{COMMUNITY HEALTH APRIL 2012}

PART 1 Essays
Q1. Highlight the routes of exposure to occupational health hazards
Answer

ROUTES OF EXPOSURE (to be expounded on by the candidates)
- Topical or Subcutaneous tissues - fat soluble substances or lipids e.g. analine, hydrogen, cyanide, phenols, mercury, benzene, organophosphates, organochlorides, organonitrogens
- Respiratory system via Inhalation e.g dust, mist, fumes, gases, smoke, vapours
- GIT via ingestion e.g. infections, poisoning
- Bodily or organ impaction e.g. radiation, vibration, noise, electromagnetic waves

Exposure to hazards mainly affects body organs e.g. liver, kidney, skin, nervous system, lungs

\section*{Q2. Describe the impact of HIV/AIDS on the health systems in a developing country like Kenya}

\section*{Answer}

\section*{The impact of HIV/AIDS on the Health system}
- An increased demand of patients on the weak health systems to cope with the increase in demand for HIV related services. These health systems weak in human and financial resources which stand to be stretched further.
- a devastating impact by increasing medical and health expenditures among families, loss of savings, and increasing funeral expenses.
- It undermines efforts in achieving some of the international targets such as those of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
- Generally, the lack of enough health professionals that continue playing a critical role in prevention, treatment and management of HIV/AIDS is compounded by the fact that the available health personal are also getting infected and dying from this epidemic.
- HIV also adversely affects the health workers' morale as more and more patients with HIV respond poorly to treatment and die.
- This implies that patients suffering from other curable and manageable diseases could increasingly be failing to gain admission for close medical health care resulting in worsening morbidity and mortality from other diseases due to HIV related ailments.
- Due to high numbers of people infected with HIV/AIDS, more health resources and workforce are being diverted to HIV/AIDS treatment which further exacerbates the shortages for other health care needs

Q3. Describe the health effects of floods in Kenya
Answer
Health effects of floods in Kenya (to be expounded on by the candidates)
- Death and injury of both people and animals
- Mental and physical stress (e.g. anxiety, depression, loss of security, domestic problems)
- Health -related problems (contamination of water resources, sewerage problems etc)
- Nutrition problems- lack of food as the floods destroy food reserves
- Increased diseases and epidemics especially water related ones like diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, and cholera due to contamination of water resources.
- Increased conflicts over water resources

\section*{Q4. Describe the principles of prevention and control of Communicable Diseases}

\section*{Answer}

\section*{Principles of Managing Communicable Diseases}

The aim of managing (preventing and controlling) communicable diseases is to reduce the effect of the life-threatening disease and thus reduce mortality and morbidity.
When a disease is under control, measures usually have to be continued indefinitely since the incidence may rise again if they are stopped.

Ideally, all communicable diseases should be eradicated, but in practice this is only possible occasionally e.g. smallpox.

To turn the ecological "balance" against the agent and break the transmission cycle, any of the following methods may be used either in combination or isolation:
- Attacking the source
- Interrupting the route of transmission
- Protecting the susceptible host.

\section*{Q5. By use of a table, illustrate the immunization of the under 5 children in Kenya}

\section*{Answer}

\section*{IMMUNISATION SCHEDULE}

To protect children from these infections as rapidly, effectively and cheaply as possible, an immunisation schedule is needed (see Figure 8.1). This schedule will certainly change as new developments occur, but it does give a standard plan that is widely used.

Immunisation schedule for children in Kenya

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\multirow[t]{2}{*}{Vaccine}} & \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Age} \\
\hline & & Birth & 6 weeks & 10 weeks & 14 weeks & 9 months \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{BCG} & X & & & & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Oral polio} & $\mathrm{X}^{+}$ & x & x & x & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{DPT} & & X & X & X & \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Hepatitis B} & Scheme A & x & x & & x & \\
\hline & Scheme B & & x & x & x & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Haemophilus Influenza Type B} & & x & x & x & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Yellow fever} & & & & & x** \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Pneumococcal Vaccine (PC10)} & & x & x & x & \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Measles} & & & & & x*** \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Vitamin A} & \multicolumn{5}{|l|}{Every 6 months starting from 6 months to 5 years} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- ** in countries where yellow fever poses risk
- ***In exceptional situations where measles morbidity and mortality before 9 months of age represent more than $15 \%$ of cases and deaths, give an extra vaccine at 6 months of age. The scheduled dose should also be given as soon as possible after 9 months of age.
