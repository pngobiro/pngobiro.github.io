                                    <strong>Contingency Theory</strong>
                                    <p>This theory proposes that no one way or style of leadership may be applicable to all situations.</p>
                                    <p>In other words, it recognizes that there might be variables influencing any particular situation, and a leader must choose the right course of action, taking into account those variables.</p>
                                    <p>In this regard, leadership researchers White and Hodgson state, "Effective leadership is about striking the right balance between needs, context, and behavior." The best leaders have not only the right traits but also the ability to assess the needs of their followers, analyze the situation at hand, and act accordingly.</p>

                                    <p>Like the Contingency Theory, the Situational Theory stresses the importance of situational variables and doesn't consider anyone's leadership style to be better than the others.</p>
                                    <p>Put forward by US professor, Paul Hersey and leadership guru, Ken Blanchard, the situational theory is a combination of two factors; the leadership style and the maturity levels of the followers. According to this theory, different situations demand different styles of leadership and decision-making. Leaders must act by judging the situation they are facing.</p>

This theory talks about the kind of leader who is inspirational and charismatic, encouraging their followers to transform and become better at a task.</p>
                                    <p>Transformational leaders typically motivated by their ability to show their followers the significance of the task and the higher good involved in performing it.

In sharp contrast to the Great Man Theory and the trait approach to leadership, this theory considers effective leadership to be the result of many learned or acquired skills. It proposes that an individual can learn to become a good leader. This is one of the best leadership theories.</p>

                                    <strong>Great Man Theory of Leadership</strong>
                                    <p>This is one of the earliest leadership theories and is based on the assumption that leadership is an inborn phenomenon and that leaders are "born" rather than "made." According to this theory, a person capable of leading has the personality traits of a leader; charm, confidence, intellect, communication skills, and social aptitude; from birth, which set them apart. This theory emphasizes leadership as a quality that you either possess or you don't; it isn't something that you can learn.</p>
                                    <p>While the theory sounds pretty discouraging to those wanting to learn the ropes of leadership, you might take heart in the fact that most modern theorists dismiss it and even by some leaders themselves. It's still an interesting take on leadership and one that highlights the qualities of great leaders, which have more or less remained unchanged over time.</p>

                                    <p>This theory walks in the footsteps of the Great Man theory in assuming that leaders are born with traits that make them more suitable for the role of a leader than others who lack those natural-born traits.</p>
                                    <p>As such, the theory pinpoints certain qualities such as intelligence, accountability, sense of responsibility, and creativity, among others, that lets an individual excel at leadership.</p>

                                <p>Theory X and theory Y are theories of human motivation. They describe two very different attitudes towards workforce motivation. McGregor thought that the key to connecting self-actualization with work is determined by the managerial trust of subordinates.</p>
                                
                                <h5>Theory X (Negative view)</h5>
                                <p>Management assumes employees are inherently lazy and will avoid work if they can and they inherently dislike work. Management beliefs that workers need to be closely supervised and comprehensive systems of controls developed.</p>
                                <p>Theory X is based on the following assumptions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>People are by nature indolent. That is, they like to work as little as possible.</li>
                                    <li>People lack ambition, dislike responsibility, and prefer to be directed by others.</li>
                                    <li>People are inherently self-centered and indifferent to organizational needs and goals.</li>
                                    <li>People are generally gullible and not very sharp and bright.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5>Theory Y (Positive view)</h5>
                                <p>Management assumes employees may be ambitious and self-motivated and exercise self-control. It is believed that employees enjoy their mental and physical work duties and to them, work is as natural as play.</p>
                                <p>Theory Y assumes that:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>People are not by nature passive or resistant to organizational goals.</li>
                                    <li>They want to assume responsibility.</li>
                                    <li>They want their organization to succeed.</li>
                                    <li>People are capable of directing their own behavior.</li>
                                    <li>They have need for achievement.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Urwick's Theory Z</h4>
                        <p>Much after the propositions of theories X and Y by McGregor, the three theorists Urwick, Rangnekar and Ouchi—propounded the third theory labeled as Z theory.</p>
                        <p>Theory Z is based on the following four postulates:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strong Bond between Organization and Employees.</li>
                            <li>Employee Participation and Involvement.</li>
                            <li>No Formal Organization Structure.</li>
                            <li>Human Resource Development.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Argyris's Theory</h4>
                        <p>Argyris has developed his motivation theory based on proposition how management practices affect the individual behaviour and growth. In his view, the seven changes taking place in an individual personality make him/her a mature one.</p>

                        <h4>Vroom's Expectancy Theory</h4>
                        <p>One of the most widely accepted explanations of motivation is offered by Victor Vroom in his Expectancy Theory. It is a cognitive process theory of motivation. The theory is founded on the basic notions that people will be motivated to exert a high level of effort when they believe there are relationships between the effort they put forth, the performance they achieve and the outcomes or rewards they receive.</p>

                        <p>Thus, Vroom’s motivation can also be expressed in the form of an equation as follows:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$Motivation = Valence \times Expectancy \times Instrumentality$$
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Valence:</strong> Valence, according to Vroom, means the value or strength one places on a particular outcome or reward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expectancy:</strong> It relates efforts to performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Instrumentality:</strong> By instrumentality, Vroom means, the belief that performance is related to rewards.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Porter and Lawler’s Expectancy Theory</h4>
                        <p>Porter and Lawler’s theory is an improvement over Vroom’s expectancy theory. They posit that motivation does not equal satisfaction or performance.</p>
                        <p>There are three main elements in this model. Thus;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Effort:</strong> Effort refers to the amount of energy an employee exerts on a given task. How much effort an employee will put in a task is determined by two factors: (i) Value of reward. (ii) Perception of effort-(reward probability).</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> One’s effort leads to his/her performance. Both may be equal or may not be. However the amount of performance is determined by the amount of labour and the ability and role perception of the employee.</li>
                            <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> Performance leads to satisfaction. The level of satisfaction depends upon the amount of rewards one achieves.</li>
                        </ul>
