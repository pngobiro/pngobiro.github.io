\section*{FOREWORD}

The Health Policy Framework (2014-2030) goal is to offer the highest attainable standard of health and be responsive to the needs of the Kenyan citizens. Kenya has made remarkable progress in improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. According to the 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) report, Maternal and Newborn health indicators had improved compared to the KDHS 2008-9 report. Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) reduced from 448 to $362 / 100,000$ live births while Neonatal Mortality Rate reduced from 31 to $22 / 1000$ live births over the last decade. However, more needs to be done as many women and neonates continue to suffer or die from conditions, which are preventable or treatable.

Improving quality of Maternal and Newborn Health services is a priority for the Government of Kenya. Quality of care employs evidence based best practices and provision of actionable interventions with appropriate and timely referral of patients.

The review of this guideline is in response to the need for emerging, updated evidence-based interventions that have proved successful when applied throughout the continuum of care of the woman's preconception, pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. This National guidelines on Quality Obstetrics and Perinatal care standardizes evidence best practices, informs policy and advocacy in maternal, neonatal and new-born health for individual and societal healthier outcomes in Kenya. Both obstetric and neonatal conditions and the complications that would affect a mother and her newborn during this period have extensively been described along with their management. This guidelines aim is to have a healthy and well mother-baby dyad that survives, thrives and transforms having been provided with a satisfactory pregnancy, childbirth and beyond that ultimately impacts gainfully to be productive Kenyan citizenry contributing to our development agenda.

The target population for this guideline include National and County duty bearers, health policy makers, Regulators and Administrators, Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Paediatricians, Researchers, Academia, Clinical officers, Midwives, Nurses and those in-pre-service training. The use of this guidelines as a reference manual is highly recommended in order to ensure provision of standard quality Maternal and Newborn Health services at all levels of the Kenya Health System.

It is my sincere hope that this document which is designed to provide a practical guide and equip health care providers with maternal and newborn health knowledge, skills and positive attitudes at all levels of service delivery implementation will go a long way in accelerating the reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality and get the country on track to Vision 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.

\section*{PREFACE}

The Kenya Constitution and Health Policy Framework (2014-2030) goal is to offer the highest attainable standard of health and be responsive to the needs of the Kenyan populace. Quality of care employs evidence based best practices; provision of actionable interventions with appropriate and timely referral of patients. In the quality-of-care framework KQMH recognizes that patient experience critical to be universally accessible; provides dignified and respectful care with effective communication on a bedrock of a supportive health-care system and as a basic human right. This National guideline on Quality Obstetrics and Perinatal Care standardizes evidence best practices, informs policy and advocacy in maternal, neonatal and new-born health for individual and societal healthier outcomes in Kenya.

This guideline addresses provision of evidence based best practices in obstetrics and perinatal health addressing in every topic: definition, epidemiology, prevention, screening, diagnosis and management in the continuum of care. This continuum in maternal and perinatal care includes: preconception, antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum care related complications that can coexist or develop in the course of follow up. The perinatal health principally includes fetal surveillance in utero; during childbirth and in the immediate new-born period for the first 7 days of life. This guidelines outcome is to have a healthy and well mother- baby dyad to thrive having been provided with a satisfactory pregnancy, childbirth and beyond that ultimately impacts gainfully to be productive Kenyan citizenry contributing to our development agenda.

The target population for this guideline include National and County duty bearers, health policy makers, regulators and administrators; Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Consultant Paediatricians, researchers, academia, clinical officers, midwives and nurses, auxiliary service providers and those in-pre- service training working in maternity and new-born Health- care.

At the initiation phase of development of this guideline a county mixed method survey ( $51 \%$ coverage) was conducted amongst implementers, Focus group discussions and key informants. The survey revealed the need for a robust implementation plan to address guideline distribution, capacity building, facilitative supervision, monitoring and evaluation. This was followed by Phase two - scoping and literature review identified evidence gaps and new topic areas such as: nutrition, pre-conceptual care, intrapartum fetal surveillance, dysfunctional labour, caesarean section, FGM and childbirth, maternal mental health, maternal shock, near miss and MPDSR. In the neonatal section, updates were made. Newer methods of the management of respiratory distress like CPAP, surfactant and mechanical ventilation have been included. Parenteral nutrition and hypothermic therapy for asphyxia have also been added as these are important methods of management available in the country.

In each topic an outline of clinical questions covered the following: definition, Intervention(s) or exposure(s); comparison of interventions or therapies where appropriate; outcome(s) and related to the Country and County context with level of care, the health system; the cost implication and cultural acceptability.

\section*{Methodology used in the development of the guideline}

Guideline review commenced with desk review and scoping of the existent National guideline of Obstetrics and Perinatal care of 2012 that informed the topic requirements. The search per topic commenced with a defined health question, search for guidelines guided by the Geneva Foundation of medical education and research www.gfmer.org. The ADAPTE process which used Agree II tool informed selection for in-depth review and critique. Only guidelines that attained an aggregate score of $70 \%$ and above were used in the adapted revised draft for both Obstetric and perinatal care. Further review of this synthesized guideline was made by stakeholders drawn from policy makers, professionals, academia, researchers, implementer of services and the community conducted at two technical workshops. The developed second draft was then subjected to external review using the Delphi technique before the final edition of the guideline and validation meeting.

Recommendations in the guideline are based on the evidence level as indicated below:

\section*{Classification of evidence level}

I++ High quality met- analyses, systematic reviews of RCT or RCT with very low risk of bias
+ Well conducted met-analyses, systematic reviews of RCT or RCT with low risk of bias

\section*{Grades of recommendations}

A
At least one met- analysis, systematic reviews or RCT rated as I++ and directly applicable to the target population; or a systematic review of RCT or a body of evidence consisting principally of studies rated I+, directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results

\section*{B}

A body of evidence including studies rated as population and demonstrating overall consistency of results; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as $\mathrm{I}++$ or $\mathrm{I}+$

I- Met- analyses, systematic reviews of RCT or RCT with a high risk of bias

A body of evidence including studies rated as $2+$ directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating overall consistency of results; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as $2++$

2+ Well conducted case - control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or chance and a

Evidence level 3 or 4; or extrapolated evidence from studies rated as $2+$
moderate probability that the relationship is causal

✓ Good practice

The guideline can be used by duty bearers, donors, policy makers, academia, researchers, professionals and implementers of services at the national and county levels. It further informs curriculum review; standard operating procedures and protocols; the essential drug lists; future research areas, policy and advocacy in maternal and perinatal healthcare.

\section*{MATERNAL NUTRITION}

\section*{Introduction}

The nutritional status of a woman before and during pregnancy is important for a healthy pregnancy outcome. Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning in early stages of life, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health. Poor availability or access to food of adequate nutritional quality or the exposure to conditions that impair absorption and use of nutrients leads to undernutrition, poor vitamin and mineral status or overweight and obese may often present simultaneously. Maternal malnutrition is a key contributor to poor fetal growth, low birthweight (LBW) and short- and long-term infant morbidity and mortality.

Nutrition plays a pivotal role in determining health outcomes across the life course. ${ }^{1,5}$ In resource-poor Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Central and South-East Asia, maternal under-nutrition is highly prevalent and is recognized as a key determinant of maternal and perinatal outcomes. ${ }^{1}$, ${ }^{2}$.Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning in early stages of life, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health outcomes. $\underline{2}$ While obesity has historically been a condition associated with affluence, there is some evidence to suggest a shift in the burden of overweight and obesity seen across populations. Obesity and overweight have been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes ${ }^{1}$

\caption{Figure I: The role of nutrition across the life course and across generations.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Social \& environmental factors}

All stages in a woman's life are connected by the effects of good nutrition. Poor nutrition at any stage has negative consequences that disrupt the cycle and impact later life stages, including future generations. ${ }^{6}$

In 2015, Kenya was recognized as being on course to meet the global MDG targets for underfive overweight, under-five stunting, under-five wasting, and infant exclusive breastfeeding, however, was off course to meet the targets for anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight.

The Global Nutrition Targets 2015-2025 address nutrition conditions that are responsible for a large burden of nutrition-related morbidity and mortality from conception through to the first two years of life: stunting, maternal anaemia, low birth weight, child underweight and overweight. These are the largest causes of deaths and disability-adjusted life years in children under the age of five years, and iron deficiency contributing to maternal mortality.

Sustainable Development Goal 2.2 targets, to end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant, lactating women and older persons ${ }^{\underline{3}}$ This is shown in Figure 2.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 2: WHO global targets 2025 on scaling up nutrition ${ }^{\underline{\underline{2}}}$}
\end{figure}

\section*{Intergenerational cycle of undernutrition}

The cycle of poor nutrition perpetuates itself across generations. Young girls who grow poorly become stunted women and are more likely to give birth to low--birthweight children. If those infants are girls, they are likely to continue the cycle by being stunted in adulthood if something is not done to break the cycle. Adolescent pregnancy heightens the risk of low birthweight and the difficulty of breaking the cycle. Support is needed for good nutrition at all these stages; infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood especially for girls and women.

\section*{Intergenerational Cycle of Growth Failure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-026.jpg?height=992&width=1000&top_left_y=371&top_left_x=582}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 3: The intergenerational cycle of growth failure}
\end{figure}

The intergenerational cycle of growth failure can be turned into a vicious cycle. However, Low birth weight can be prevented, even amongst undernourished women by improving their diet in quantity and quality. Nutrition in the early months of pregnancy has the greatest benefit on birth outcomes. The effects are greater if the mother is reached before the first semester of pregnancy or early into the pregnancy. Tackling anemia during adolescence and preventing or delaying teenage pregnancy may help to break the intergenerational cycle.

Increasing birth weight contributes to reduction in child growth faltering in the first 2 years of life, resulting in less stunting at two years of age. This is eventually reflected in increased adult height, improved cognitive function and intellectual development across the life-course, all associated with an increase in birth weight and a reduction in stunting.

There is often little emphasis on maternal nutrition because the priority focus has been placed on interventions that produce short-term gains in child survival. An understanding of the importance of growth and development outcomes is critical and a focus on birth weight should be strengthened. Furthermore, the importance of maternal nutrition for mothers' own health and development must be emphasized.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Both low body mass index (BMI) and short stature are highly prevalent among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. This leads to poor fetal development, increased risk of complications in pregnancy, and the need for assisted delivery ${ }^{2}$.

In some countries in South-Central Asia, more than 10\% of women aged 15-49 years are shorter than 145 cm . In Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Central and South-Eastern Asia, more than 20\% of women have a BMI less than $18.5 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. ${ }^{1,2}$ Recent trends show an increased proportion of women starting pregnancy with a $\mathrm{BMI}>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, leading to increased risk of complications in pregnancy and delivery as well as heavier birth weight and increased risk of obesity in children. $34.3 \%$ of females in Kenya are overweight with a BMI of above $25 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{M}^{2}$ while $11.1 \%$ are obese with a BMI of above $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{M}^{2} \stackrel{\perp, 2,14}{ }$

Globally, iron-deficiency anemia affects $30 \%$ women of reproductive age ( 468 million), and $42 \%$ of pregnant women ( 56 million). Maternal anemia is associated with reduced birth weight and increased risk of maternal mortality. In Kenya, the prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age is $27.2 \%$ out of which, $38.2 \%$ are pregnant. ${ }^{\underline{1}, 2,14}$

Every year an estimated 13 million children are born of pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. Another 20 million children are born with low birth weight. In Kenya, 8\% of newborns are low birthweight with regional disparities ranging from $13 \%$ in the coastal region to $4 \%$ in Nyanza. Low birth weight babies have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality and are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, later in life. ${ }^{2,15}$

\section*{Key nutritional issues for mother and baby through different stages}

Maternal nutritional status has benefits for the mother and child's growth and development. Dietary diversity, micronutrient supplementation and the use of fortified foods can help achieve this. The effects will be greater if the mother is reached during preconception or early into the pregnancy. The potential for breaking the cycle of growth failure would be great, with obvious benefits both for the mother and her baby. The following figure illustrates key nutritional issues for the mother and baby through different stages of pregnancy.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Figure 4: Key nutritional issues for mother and baby through different stages of pregnancy. ${ }^{\underline{6}}$

\section*{Nutrition in the Pre-Conception Period}

Pre-pregnancy nutrition is as important as nutrition during pregnancy. It influences a woman's ability to conceive and determines the fetal growth and development. ${ }^{5}$ Deficiencies of nutrients such as calcium, iron, Vitamin D and folic acid, as well as the use of certain drugs and alcohol have detrimental effects in embryonic growth even before a woman realizes she is pregnant. ${ }^{5}$

Pre-pregnancy BMI influences gestational weight gain, pregnancy outcomes and risk for noncommunicable disease in mother and baby. It is recommended that more emphasis be placed on preconception and early pregnancy nutrition due to the following reasons: ${ }^{5}$
- In Kenya, $17-18 \%$ of all births are to women under the age of 20 years. This is a time of rapid physical growth with increased nutritional requirements. The additional energy and nutrient demands of pregnancy places the adolescents at increased nutritional risk.
- Approximately $70 \%$ of cases of neural tube defects may be prevented by adequate intakes of folic acid from the pre-conception period and throughout the early months of pregnancy.
- Women of reproductive age planning to conceive are adviced to consume a healthy diet check their health and nutritional status and correct any anomalies. It is recommended that they consume folic acid three months prior to the planned conception.

The diagram below illustrates intergenerational cycle of the double burden of malnutrition

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-029.jpg?height=1038&width=1649&top_left_y=713&top_left_x=282}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 5: The double burden of malnutrition in a low/middle-income country.}
\end{figure}

Under-nutrition predisposes the next generation to obesity and non-communicable diseases when faced with increased food availability and lifestyle changes. ${ }^{6}$
- Birth weight is closely associated with child survival, well-being, and growth. Nutrient stores built up in adolescence determine the nutrition of the mother when she enters pregnancy during and between pregnancies. This in turn impacts on birth weight and child survival
- Obese women have an increased risk of complications such as hypertension, gestational diabetes and higher risk of caesarean sections since they tend to deliver babies who are larger than average and with excessive birthweight. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Nutritional Interventions in Pregnancy}

Pregnancy is an opportune moment for reaching women (who may otherwise be neglected) with nutritional support. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recommends integrating maternal nutrition into the continuum of care offered to women. ${ }^{3}$ Pregnancy is a critical period in the life cycle due to the many body changes in both the mother and the fetus. Optimal maternal nutrition is critical for optimal fetal growth and development, as well as for safe delivery. ${ }^{3,5}$

Poor nutritional status during pregnancy has been associated with Intra-uterine growth restriction/ retardation (IUGR), Low Birth Weight (LBW), premature delivery (PTB), birth defects and stillbirths (SB). This is made worse by dietary practices that increase nutritional risk at the time of pregnancy e.g. change from the traditional diet (high fiber, low fat) to highly refined foods, adherence to a vegetarian diet and rigid dieting / eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. ${ }^{5}$

Pregnancy demands additional nutrients due to the physiological changes that occur. Weight gain is one of the obvious changes that occur during pregnancy. Adequate weight gain is essential for fetal growth and desired weight gain is based upon pre-pregnancy weight using BMI criteria and pre-conceptual nutritional status of the woman. Maternal weight should be routinely monitored throughout pregnancy and the baseline measurement should be taken if possible. ${ }^{\underline{3}, 5}$

According to the revised US institute of medicine guidelines

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Abbreviation: BMI, body mass index, GWG, gestational weight again.

\section*{General Nutrition Requirements in Pregnancy}

Indicators of good nutritional status during pregnancy include:
- Weight gain between 11.5-16 kg during pregnancy
- Hemoglobin level $\geq \mathrm{IIg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Absence of clinical signs of micronutrient deficiencies

\section*{Energy and Protein Requirements in Pregnancy}

During pregnancy, the needs for energy and protein are increased in order to meet the demands for adequate maternal gestational weight gain, as well as the growth and development of the fetus. ${ }^{3}, 5$ Extra energy is needed to sustain the increased basal metabolic rate and there is normal accumulation of fat as the energy reserves. ${ }^{5}$ Maternal stores of nitrogen are increased in pregnancy, hence increased need for protein, especially those with low BMI <18.5.

An increase of protein from $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} \mathrm{BW}$ per day to $\mathrm{l} . \mathrm{l} \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{kg}$ BW per day is required to facilitate the physiological changes of pregnancy, including: Tissue growth, nitrogen balance, fetal growth and development, enlargement of mammary glands, uterus and placenta, increased circulating blood volume and plasma proteins, formation of amniotic fluid, reserves for labor, delivery and lactation. There is evidence that providing adequate energy and protein during pregnancy improves fetal growth and may reduce the risk of stillbirth, low birthweight and infants born small for gestational age even among under nourished women. A proper dietary balance is necessary to ensure sufficient intake for adequate growth without drawing from the mother's own tissues to maintain her pregnancy. It is recommended that the woman consume one small extra meal equivalent to 300 Kcal . Further, meals should be drawn from at least five of the ten food groups daily. ${ }^{5,13}$

\section*{Micronutrient Requirements for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers}

\section*{$\underline{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{5}$}
- During pregnancy, there is an increased need for micronutrient requirements. All major and trace minerals and vitamins have a role in maternal health.
- The pregnant and lactating mothers need extra folic acid and vitamin B I2 due to the great increase in blood volume /cells and the rapid growth of the fetus.
- Iron demands increase as the body conserves more than usual during pregnancy and the growing fetus draws on maternal iron stores.
- Minerals involved in building the skeleton- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are also in great demand. A non-pregnant adult woman would require 800 mg calcium, 280 mg magnesium and 800 mg of phosphorus. In pregnancy, these requirements are increased.
- Micronutrients are required by the body for multiple physiological functions, including: production of enzymes \& hormones; formation of brain cells; regulation of physical growth \& development; regulation of the immune system and reproductive system; and for optimal functioning of the muscular and the nervous system.

The following micronutrients play a critical role in pregnancy.

\section*{Iron}

Pregnant women require additional iron for their own nutritional needs and for the developing foetus. Daily oral elemental iron is recommended for pregnant women to prevent maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birthweight and preterm birth. It is essential for many enzymes
that are required for metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. It plays a vital role in the body's immune system as well as in the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters. Women of reproductive age and infants have the highest need for iron.

Extra iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis during pregnancy; the recommended daily dose in pregnancy is $60 \mathrm{mg} /$ day . Inadequate iron intake, resulting in iron deficiency, is the commonest cause of anemia.

\section*{Consequences of Iron Deficiency Anemia}
- Anemic women are more likely to die from Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) and in the postpartum period
- Severe anemia can precipitate heart failure or circulatory shock at the time of labor, delivery and post-partum
- Anemic women are also more susceptible to puerperal infection

\section*{Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include:}
- Inadequate consumption, or low intake of heme iron
- High consumption of staple foods with low bio available iron
- Inadequate intake of foods that enhance iron absorption from diet, such as Vitamin C containing foods
- Consumption of foods high in phytate or phenolic compounds that inhibit iron absorption (legumes, cereals, coffee, tea, sorghum and millet)
- Parasitic infestation such as hookworms, ascaris and schistosomiasis
- Malaria in pregnancy
- Chronic infections such as TB and HIV
- Heavy blood loss prior to or during pregnancy
- High consumption of cow's milk. (it contains high amounts of calcium which inhibit the absorption of iron)
- Pica can result in helminthic infestation, intestinal obstruction and metal poisoning

\section*{Dietary Management of Iron deficiency}

Encourage consumption of foods rich in iron, folic acid, proteins and other nutrients needed for blood production.
- Animal sources - Red meat, Liver, Kidneys, fish, poultry, eggs
- Plant source - legumes (cow peas, kidney beans, Soya beans) fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables. Provide foods rich in Vitamin B 12, Folic acid, Vitamin E and C.

NOTE: Iron from plant sources is however not readily bio available as they contain phytates, oxalates and malic acid which inhibit iron absorption. Reduce intake of beverages that contain phenolic compounds and tannin such as tea leaves, wheat and bran.

\section*{Prevention of Iron Deficiency}

The following public health interventions have been shown to increase availability of iron and prevent iron deficiency during pregnancy and in the postpartum period:
- Dietary improvement through consumption of iron-rich foods
- Fortification of foods
- Supplementation of vulnerable groups
- Intestinal worm control
- Malaria and other disease control
- Strengthening health promotion and prevention in school health programs.

\section*{Zinc}

Zinc is the essential trace mineral occurring in the body in larger amounts than any other trace element because it is present in all tissues. Zinc promotes normal growth and development. It is a major component in body enzymes, hormones, genetic material proteins. It promotes wound healing and maintains an effective immune system.

Zinc requirements are highest in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ trimester when the fetus acquires two-thirds of its zinc stores. The RDA for zinc is $15 \mathrm{gm} /$ day for pregnant women, $25 \%$ higher than for non-pregnant women. Inadequate zinc in pregnancy increases the risk of delivering low birth weight infants.

Diets that are very high in calcium, fiber or phytates may decrease zinc absorption. Routine iron and folate supplementation may also impair zinc absorption. Therefore, good dietary sources of zinc as well as dietary habits should be reinforced.

\section*{Food sources:}
- Organs (offal, liver, kidneys), red meat (beef, lamb) white meat (fish and chicken)
- Eggs and dairy products
- Nuts and seeds e.g., pumpkin seeds, water melon seeds, simsim seeds

\section*{Zinc deficiency increases the risk of the following conditions /complications:}
- Pre-eclampsia
- Anemia
- Miscarriage
- Preterm labor and delivery
- Fetal growth restriction
- Premature rupture of the membranes

\section*{lodine}
lodine is essential for the normal functioning of the thyroid gland and for normal mental and physical development. Pregnant women and young children have special needs for iodine. lodine deficiency is the main cause of preventable mental retardation globally. lodine deficiency also causes cretinism, congenital anomalies, stillbirths and abortions.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for a pregnant woman is $175 \mathrm{mg} /$ day and this covers for the extra demands of the fetus. Use of iodized salt is highly recommended.

\section*{Health and economic impact of lodine Deficiency Disorders}
- Increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and impaired fetal brain development
- Goiter and cretinism
- Reduced mental capacity and productivity.

\section*{Causes of iodine deficiency:}
- Consumption of diets low in lodine
- Low consumption of iodine fortified foods such as iodized salt
- Anti-nutrient factors such as goitrogens that bind iodine

Food sources: lodized salt, sea/marine fish (shellfish and sardine), lobsters, oysters and crabs, seaweed and plants growing in iodine rich soils.

\section*{Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)}

Definition: This refers to the average daily dietary intake levels sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of $97-98 \%$ of healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.

Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the nutrient intake estimated to meet the requirement of half of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group.

Adequate Intake ( Al ) is the level thought to meet or exceed the requirements of almost all members of a life stage/gender group. An Al is set when there is insufficient data to define an RDA.

Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the highest average daily intake level of a nutrient likely to pose no danger to most individuals in the group.

Tolerable Lower Intake Level is the lowest average daily intake level of a nutrient likely to pose no danger to most individuals in the group

\section*{Vitamin A}

Vitamin A is an essential nutrient, which is required in small amounts for epithelial cell integrity, effective immune system function and normal sight. Improving Vitamin A status among pregnant women dramatically reduces maternal mortality, fetal growth retardation and is necessary for embryo development and spermatogenesis.

NOTE: Vitamin A supplementation IS NOT recommended in pregnancy as high dose preparations have teratogenic effects.

\section*{Vitamin A Deficiency:}
- Is associated with an increased risk of night blindness, which causes corneal scarring and in severe cases blindness and death
- Increases vulnerability to infections and leads to increased risk of maternal mortality and miscarriage
- Impairs immune system thereby increases risk of infections
- Results in Low Birth Weight and Vitamin A deficient infants
- Is associated with inadequate pregnancy weight gain
- Results in low Vitamin A concentration in Breast Milk

\section*{Food sources:}
- Animal sources (liver, eggs)
- Plant source- Dark green leafy vegetables
- Yellow/orange fruits (Mango, passion, pawpaw)
- Orange-fleshed vegetables (sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrot and yellow sweet pepper)
- Fortified foods (fats and oils)

\section*{Calcium}

Calcium is needed during pregnancy to promote adequate mineralization of the maternal skeleton \& teeth, for normal blood clotting mechanism, normal muscle action and rapid fetal mineralization of skeletal tissue especially in the 2 nd and 3rd trimester. The RDA for pregnant women is $1200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day $^{10}$. During pregnancy, approximately $25-30 \mathrm{~g}$ of calcium is transferred to the fetus. Most of this is acquired during the third trimester, when calcium is deposited into the fetal skeleton at a rate of about 330 mg per day. To meet the recommended calcium requirements in pregnancy, women should be advised to consume small amounts of milk with snacks and drink fermented milk.

Dietary sources of calcium include:
- Milk, yogurt and cheese
- Sardines ('omena')
- Whole grain cereals
- Green leafy vegetables.
- Food fortified with calcium

\section*{Folic Acid}

The body needs folic acid for the production, repair, and functioning of DNA. Folic acid is particularly important for the rapid cell growth that occurs during pregnancy. Its deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects. Birth defects are congenital malformation and are structural or functional abnormalities present from birth, they can be caused by a number of factors including micronutrient deficiencies. Spina Bifida is the most common neural birth defect and can be prevented by daily pre conception supplementation with $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ of folic acid or a combination with other micronutrients. These birth defects occur early in gestation, before pregnancy is apparent.

\section*{Food sources:}
- Folate is present in a variety of foods such as green leafy vegetables, liver, fruits and brussels.
- The richest sources are spinach, kidney beans, groundnuts, kidney and liver

The nutritional status of a woman before she conceives and in early pregnancy greatly influences the pregnancy outcome.

\section*{Nutritional care during Labour and delivery}

Labor and delivery is a period of high-energy expenditure. At this time, the woman needs energy which should be provided in the form of light foods and drinks that are high in energy such as yoghurt, milk, fruits, soup and fruit juice. ${ }^{5}$ Higher intake of fluids helps prevent dehydration and is associated with shorter duration of labor and reduced need for augmentation of labor with oxytocin. ${ }^{5}$

NB: Encourage mothers to feed and take plenty of fluids during labour especially first stage of labour

\section*{Nutritional Care following delivery by Caesarean Section}

A balanced diet supplies you with all the macro and micronutrients that are required for you and your growing baby. Here are some of the nutrients that you need on your road to recovery after delivery both normal and C -section ${ }^{(3)}$.

\section*{Foods to avoid after C-Section}

Avoid highly processed, refined, high-fat foods, especially because your physical activity is low after C -section due to increased weight. Avoid spicy foods as they can lead to gastric problems. Maintain variety in your diet and consume everything in moderation.

Here are a few more foods that are best avoided:
- Carbonated drinks, as they cause bloating and flatulence.
- Citric juices should be taken with caution. You may take them in small amounts and then increase to moderate quantities.
- Caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea have diuretic properties hence moderate intake.
- Avoid alcohol intake.
- In cases of bloating and gas, then you may stop eating gas-forming foods such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, lady's finger and onions, for a few days. You may also eat white lentils, red kidney beans, chickpeas, black-eyed beans, and green peas in small quantities and one variety at a time.
- Avoid spicy foods, especially the ones not prepared at home.
- Avoid cold foods and drinks. They may make you catch a cold.

\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Daily value for calcium is 1300 mg . \\
- Beans, lentils, almond and dark green leafy vegetables.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline 3. & Iron & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Iron is essential to maintain hemoglobin levels in the mother. Whereas for infants, it is required to support proper neurological development (9). \\
- However, its demand during lactation is less when compared to pregnancy (7).
\end{tabular} & - RDA for iron is 10 mg per day for women of ages 14 to 18 years, and 9 mg per day for those older than 19 years (10). \\
\hline 4. & Vitamins C & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Vitamin C helps strengthen the immune system. \\
- Optimum levels of Vitamin-C are important for a mother postdelivery, as it could support prompt healing by boosting collagen production. \\
- In babies, it is a key milk antioxidant that could help fight infections.
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- The RDA is 115 mg for lactating women of 14 to 18 years, and 120 mg for those above 19 years. \\
- Vitamin-C rich fruits and veggies, e.g., oranges, melons, papayas, strawberries, grapefruits, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and broccoli.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline 5. & Multivitamins \& Multiminerals & - Recovering after a s/c is very important and warrants proper nutritional care of the mother to ensure effective care of the baby. Therefore, it is wise to consume a well-balanced diet, rightly planned with the help of a nutritionist. & \\
\hline 6. & Fiber & - Fiber mitigates constipation, which, otherwise, causes undue pressure on the incisions formed after C -section. Thus, a diet rich in fiber is crucial. & - Plenty of whole grains, raw fruits and veggies, as they add roughage to your diet. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{NOTE:}
- Water and fresh juices and soups to avoid dehydration and constipation. Fluids help in smooth bowel movement and recovery from the surgery.

\section*{Things to Remember}

Follow these basic tips to ensure you get the best out of what you eat:
I. Have small meals throughout the day instead of consuming three heavy meals.
2. Avoid gulping down your food. Instead, take some time to chew it slowly. It may be difficult for you to have a relaxing meal while having a newborn around, but you can ask your family members to look after your baby for some time.
3. With a newborn, you may not get enough sleep. So, try to rest whenever possible. Sleep will help your body repair and heal better.
4. Try to eat home-cooked meals as you can include lots of fresh ingredients.

\section*{POSTNATAL PERIOD}

This is a crucial stage for both the mother and the baby. Adequate nutrition for the mother should be maintained to ensure that the mother remains healthy and to enhance lactation performance. ${ }^{5}$ Lactation is a physiological condition that places extra demand on the mother hence the need for nutrition support and care. In addition, breastfeeding is a learned behavior that needs a supportive environment at the facility, home and at the community level. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Nutritional Care in Pregnancy with Complications}

\section*{Hyperemesis Gravidarum}

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are extremely common, affecting up to $80 \%$ of pregnant women.
- Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affect the health of the pregnant woman and her baby, and it can reduce quality of life and significantly contribute to healthcare costs and time lost from work.
- Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is severe, intractable nausea and vomiting affecting 0.3-3.6\% of pregnancies. Recurrence rate of HG ranges from $\mathbf{1 5 . 2} \boldsymbol{\%}$ to $\mathbf{8 1 \%}$.
- The onset of symptoms is usually early in the first trimester at around 4-6 weeks gestation and peaks at 9 weeks gestation. Vomiting abates in $90 \%$ of cases by 20 weeks. It may persist beyond 20 weeks in $13 \%$ of cases.

HG is typically characterized by: severe nausea and vomiting that causes dehydration and imbalance of fluid and electrolyte; disruption of nutritional intake and metabolism; physical and psychological debilitation; loss of $\geq 5 \%$ pre-pregnancy weight; and often necessitates hospital admission. Poorly managed patients may incur severe maternal and fetal morbidity and are at increased risk of death.

\section*{Recommendations on management of Hyperemesis}

\section*{Gravidarum ${ }^{\text {" }}$}
- Treatment in the early stages of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may help prevent hospitalization and other serious complications, because it can become more difficult to control symptoms if left untreated.
- Lifestyle and dietary changes may resolve mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases.
- The woman's perception of symptom severity greatly affects the decision of whether, when, and how to seek treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.
- Clinicians should distinguish nausea and vomiting of pregnancy from nausea and vomiting due to other causes.
- Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy nearly always begins before 9 weeks of gestation; symptoms presenting later in pregnancy should prompt the clinician to consider other causes.
- Use of prenatal vitamins for 3 months before conception may decrease the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (level A recommendation).
- First-line pharmacotherapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is vitamin B6 or vitamin B6 plus doxylamine, which are safe and effective (level A).
- Women with HG and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should not be treated for hyperthyroidism without evidence of intrinsic thyroid disease, such as goiter and/or thyroid autoantibodies (level A).
- A non-pharmacologic option to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is ginger, which has been shown to reduce nausea (level B).
- To prevent progression to HG, ACOG recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (level B).\}
- In refractory cases, methylprednisolone may be effective for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or HG, but it should be a last resort because of its risk profile (level B).
- Women who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or who have clinical signs of dehydration should receive intravenous hydration including dextrose and vitamins. Thiamine should be given before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy (level C).
- Women with HG who are unresponsive to medical therapy and who cannot maintain their weight should receive nutritional support by nasogastric or naso-duodenal enteral tube feeding as first-line treatment (C).

Note: Because of significant complications and the potential of severe maternal morbidity associated with peripherally inserted central catheters, these should not be used routinely in women with HG but only as a last resort.
Aims of Management
1. Correction of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
2. Prophylaxis against recognized complications
3. Provision of symptomatic relief
Fluid therapy with HG
- Patients who are unable to tolerate oral fluid and who are ketotic shouldreceive intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement.
- Sodium chloride $0.9 \%$ with $20-40 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{KCL}$ and Hartmann's solution arerecommended.
- Ready prepared bags of intravenous fluid, including potassium chloride (KCl)can be prescribed according to patient's serum potassium level
- Sodium chloride $0.9 \%$ contains $\mathrm{Na}+150 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$; Hartmann's solutioncontains $\mathrm{Na}+131 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{K}+5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{I} 9.5$
- Dextrose containing fluid should be avoided except in women with diabetesas neither $5 \%$ dextrose nor dextrose saline contain sufficient sodium tocorrect the commonly associated hyponatremia.
- Dextrose is contraindicated if no thiamine is given prior. High concentrationof dextrose may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy.
- Double strength saline should be avoided, even in case of severehyponatremia
Vitamin - Thiamine Hydrochloride oral $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$ TDS.
Supplementation • Pabrinex 2 vials given intravenously diluted in $100 \mathrm{ml} 0.9 \%$ sodium chloride over $30-60 \mathrm{~min}$ (if patient is unable to tolerate oral thiamine).
Management as in-patient is recommended if:
1. Symptoms are severe despite 24 hours of medication
2. There is evidence of dehydration and the patient is ketotic.
3. A lower threshold for admitting to hospital if the patient has co-existing condition (i.e. diabetes) which can be adversely affected by nausea and vomiting
Antiemetic Therapy
- The use of antiemetic therapy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting inpregnancy is recommended.
- Patients with severe hyperemesis may require regular parenteral doses ofmore than one antiemetic to control symptoms
- Ondansetron 4 mg, 8 hourly orally, intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV)can be used if hyperemesis is not responding to above antiemetics.
- Side effects of antiemetics include drowsiness, particularly with phenothiazineand extra pyramidal effects and oculogyric crisis, particularly withmetoclopramide and phenothiazines.
- Metoclopramide is not suitable for younger patients (younger than 20 yearsof age) as acute dystonic reactions involving facial and skeletal muscle spasmsand oculogyric crisis are common in younger people. Metoclopramide shouldbe given for a maximum 5 days. (Provide reference and more rationale)
Corticosteroid Treatment- Steroids should be used for intractable hyperemesis which is not respondingto above management, after discussion with a consultant.
- Steroid should be accompanied by histamine receptor antagonist or protonpump inhibitor to counteract gastric effect of steroid.
- Hydrocortisone 100 mg , twice daily (BD) for 48 hours until the patient isable to tolerate tablets. It is followed by prednisolone $30-40 \mathrm{mg}$ daily in asingle or divided dose. The response is usually rapid. Steroids should bediscontinued if there is no effect after 2 days.

\section*{Nutritional needs in patients with Hyperemesis Gravidarum}

\section*{Nutrition Advice}
- Nil by mouth or suck ice cubes for the first 24 hours until anti-emetics are effective.
- Afterwards, small and frequent dry meals are usually tolerable.
- Drinking a small amount of fluid regularly is important to maintain hydration.
- Eating before getting out of bed and at times when nausea is less severe may reduce severity of nausea and vomiting.
- Try sipping on herbal teas containing ginger, lemon or peppermint.
- Ginger Igm per day as treatment is an effective means of reducing symptoms

\section*{Thromboprophylaxis}

Hyperemesis is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to dehydration and immobilization if patients are needed to be hospitalized.

Table 7: Management Options for Extremely Severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum

\section*{Management Options for Extremely Severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum Cases that fail to respond to all of the above therapies:}
I. Enteral nutrition
2. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
3. Termination of pregnancy

\section*{Enteral Nutrition}
- The cost of enteral nutrition is considerably less than that of TPN and it is safer
- It is successful in patients with meal related nausea and vomiting only.
- But enteral hyperalimentation may be poorly tolerated due to nausea and vomiting and may be even contraindicated because of the risk of aspiration.
- To minimize the risk of aspiration, a nasojejunal feeding tube may be placed beyond the pylorus, but this necessitates radiation exposure for correct position of tube or insertion under endoscopic guidance. Patients should be allowed to make an informed decision given the risks, benefits and alternatives of any invasive procedure aimed at improving nutrition.
- Discussion with the gastroenterology and / or nutrition team is recommended.
- Enteral nutrition is the management for hyperemesis in the first trimester and early second trimester.

\section*{Total \\ Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)}
- It is very rarely necessary.
- Because of substantial metabolic, infectious and thrombotic risks, it should be regarded as a measure of last resort.
- Discussion with a tertiary nutrition centre should be considered Because TPN involves the use of high concentration of glucose, thiamine supplementation is mandatory. Recurrence Risk of Hyperemesis Gravidarum
The risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancy is $15.2 \%$ to $81 \%$. The risk is reduced by a change of paternity

\section*{Nutritional needs of women with Gestational Diabetes}

The aim of nutrition counselling in gestational diabetes is to: ${ }^{\perp} \underline{5}$
- Provide appropriate energy and nutrients for the health of the mother as well as the growth and development of the fetus
- Attain and maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible
- Attain optimum blood lipids and blood pressure control and so reduce the risk of macro vascular disease
- Prevent and treat diabetic related complications
- Achieve and maintain optimal metabolic and physiologic outcomes

\section*{Nutritional Management in Gestational Diabetes: ${ }^{\underline{1}, \underline{\mathbf{5}}}$}
- Calories need to come from proteins and carbohydrates, but not sugar.
- Eat three small meals and two or three snacks at regular times every day.
- Eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients required.
- Avoid feasting and fasting
- Eat at the right time every day. Sticking to the timings is important.
- Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day.
- Try to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrate during each meal and snack.
- Eat less carbohydrate at breakfast than at other meals because this is when insulin resistance is highest.
- Choose foods high in fiber such as whole-grain breads, cereals, cassava, yams, green bananas, fruits and vegetables etc.
- Eat foods with less sugar and fat and avoid fatty, fried and greasy foods. Avoid foods with added sugar, such as honey, jellies, jams, sodas, biscuits, cakes, ice cream and molasses.

\section*{Nutritional needs of women with Pre-Eclampsia ${ }^{5}$}

The aim of the Dietary Management in Pre-eclampsia
I. Maintain adequate nutrition
2. Restrict fat, fluid and sodium intake
3. Ensure optimal protein intake in the absence of renal disease

\section*{Nutritional management}
I. Manage the calorie content in the diet if the patient is overweight in an effort to reduce excessive weight gain
2. Regulate fat intake. Encourage intake of unsaturated fats (oils). Fats should be $20 \%$ of total caloric intake
3. Restrict sodium by encouraging choice of foods low in sodium, limit the amount of salt added to food, restrict the use of processed foods and use of sodium containing spices
4. In case of overt edema, it may be necessary to restrict fluid intake
5. Encourage physical activity for those leading a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity has measurable biological effects affecting cholesterol levels, insulin sensitivity and vascular reactivity.

\section*{Avoid}
I. Excess fluids
2. 5\% dextrose and normal saline

\section*{Nutritional Needs Among Women With HIV/AIDS ${ }^{5}$}

In a HIV positive pregnant mother, it is important to control symptoms, support the immune system and lower the viral loads in the blood.

Good nutrition supports the immune system thus preventing opportunistic infections. The role nutrition plays will vary along the disease continuum, with consideration given to the patient's age, behavior, current medication, drug history, socioeconomic status, and associated health concerns.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-051.jpg?height=1000&width=1632&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=245}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 8: Relationship between HIV infection and nutrition $\underline{1}$}
\end{figure}

An effective nutritional care and support programme will improve the quality of life of the pregnant HIV positive mother by:
- Maintaining body weight and strength
- Providing the nutrients needed by the growing fetus
- Replenishing lost vitamins and minerals
- Improving the function of the immune system and the body's ability to fight infections
- Prolonging the period from infection to the development of the AIDS disease
- Improving response to treatment; reducing time and money spent on health care

\section*{Nutrient Requirements for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) ${ }^{\underline{5}}$}

There is increased nutrient needs due to:
- Increased resting energy equilibrium.
- Viral load (body trying to cope with illness/inflammation)
- Opportunistic Infections that increase energy demand
- Malabsorption of nutrients

The recommended amount of energy increments in HIV positive pregnant/lactating women is $10 \%$ for the asymptomatic mother and $20-30 \%$ for the symptomatic mothers. This is in addition to extra energy, proteins and micronutrients required by pregnant or lactating mothers. In case of fever and multiple infections, consider addition of $10 \%$ on the calorie requirement. The protein
and fat needs for the HIV infected pregnant mother are the same as those recommended for a healthy non-HIV infected mother.

\section*{Summary of Critical Nutrition Interventions for pregnant/lactating PLHIV}
- Advise the client to have periodic nutritional status assessments, especially of their weight, every $2^{\text {nd }}$ month for symptomatic clients and every $4^{\text {th }}$ month for asymptomatic clients
- Educate and counsel PLWHA of the increased energy needs for their disease stage, and the need to consume a balanced diet. Clients with severe malnutrition should be supported with therapeutic supplementary foods.
- Educate and support clients to maintain high levels of sanitation, food hygiene, and water safety at all times.
- Educate and support clients to carry out physical activity or exercise in order to build muscles and increase appetite and improve health.
- Drink plenty of clean safe water (filtered and boiled or treated) and use clean safe water to swallow medicines and prepare juice.
- Counsel PLWHA to seek prompt treatment for all opportunistic infections and symptoms, and especially those that may interfere with food intake.
- Those on medicine, including ARVs, should be informed about managing the drug food interactions and side-effects that can be managed by food and nutrition interventions.

\section*{OBESITY IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Pregnant women who are obese are at greater risk of a variety of pregnancy related complications compared with women of normal BMI, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and longterm risk of non-communicable diseases for mother and baby. Pregnant women who are obese are also at increased risk of caesarean birth. Maternal size can make the assessment of fetal size, presentation and external monitoring of fetal heart tracing more challenging during pregnancy. Initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding may be challenging in the women with obesity especially positioning and attachment of the baby at the breast.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Overweight and obesity are associated with increased rates of chronic disease and death globally. In Kenya, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among women is high and increasing (CDC, 2018) Overall, approximately one in $3(32.8 \%)$ women in Kenya are either overweight or obese. ${ }^{13}$

According to world health organization, adults can be classified according to BMI as shown in the table below.

Classification of adults according to BMI

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Classification & BMI (kg/m2) & Risk of Developing Health Complications \\
\hline Underweight & < 18.50 & Increased \\
\hline Normal range & 18.50-24.99 & Least \\
\hline Overweight & $\geq 25.00$ & Increased \\
\hline Pre-obese & 25.00-29.99 & Increased \\
\hline Obese class I & 30.00-34.99 & High \\
\hline Obese class II & 35.00-39.99 & Very high \\
\hline Obese class III & $\geq 40.00$ & Extremely high \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Being obese during pregnancy increases the risk of various pregnancy complications, including: The risk of miscarriage-, stillbirth; recurrent miscarriage and Gestational diabetes. A pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to other organs and systems, most often the kidneys.

\section*{Risks associated with Obesity during Pregnancy}

\section*{Risk of fetal structural anomalies for obese pregnant women}

Screening and diagnostic tests for structural anomalies (at gestational age of 16-20 weeks' scan is recommended), despite their limitations in the obese population, should be offered. However, women should be counselled that all forms of screening for structural anomalies are more limited in obese pregnant women.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Evidence \\
\hline Primary care service should ensure that all women of childbearing age have the opportunity to optimize their weight before pregnancy. Advice on weight and lifestyle should be given during preconception counselling or contraceptive consultation. Weight and BMI should be measured to encourage women to optimize their weight before pregnancy. & ✓ \\
\hline Women should be informed that weight loss between pregnancies reduces the risk of stillbirth, hypertensive complications and fetal macrosomia. Weight loss increases the chances of successful vaginal birth after caesarean section. & B \\
\hline Obese women are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. However, although Vitamin D supplementation may ensure that women are vitamin D replete, the evidence on whether routine Vitamin D should be given to improve maternal and baby outcomes remains uncertain. & B \\
\hline Women with a BMI $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ or greater wishing to become pregnant should be advised to take 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily, starting at least 1 month before conception and continuing during the first trimester of pregnancy. & D \\

\section*{Clinical Management the obese mother during pregnancy}

\section*{Recommendation}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Evidence \\
\hline All pregnant women should have their weight and height measured using appropriate equipment, and their BMI calculated at the antenatal booking visit. Measurements should be recorded in the handheld notes and electronic patient information system & D \\
\hline For women with obesity in pregnancy, consider reweighing women during the third trimester to allow appropriate plans to be made equipment and personnel required during labor and birth. & ✓ \\
\hline Anti-obesity or weight loss drugs are not recommended for use in pregnancy & C \\
\hline Clinicians should be aware that women with class II obesity and greater have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared with those with normal BMI & B \\
\hline Difficulties with venous access and regional and general anaesthesia should be assessed. In addition, an anaesthetic management plan for labour and birth should be discussed and documented. Multidisciplinary discussion and planning should occur where significant potential difficulties are identified. & D \\
\hline All pregnant women with a booking BMI $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ or greater should be screened for gestational diabetes accordingly. & B \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Antenatal Screening obese mother during pregnancy}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Evidence \\
\hline All women should be offered antenatal screening for chromosomal anomalies. Women should be counselled, however, that some forms of screening for chromosomal anomalies are slightly less effective with a raised BMI. & B \\
\hline Screening and diagnostic tests for structural anomalies, despite their limitations in the obese population, should be offered. However, women should be counselled that all forms of screening for structural anomalies are more limited in obese pregnant women & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Fetal surveillance for obese pregnant women}

Women with a BMI greater than $35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ are more likely to have inaccurate SFH measurements and should be referred for serial assessment of fetal size using ultrasound. Where external palpation is technically difficult or impossible to assess fetal presentation, ultrasound can be considered as an alternative or complementary method. The following method of estimating fetal growth are recommended.
- Clinical judgement and abdominal palpation
- Ultrasound scanning

NB: In women with obesity, all of these methods are technically more difficult, increasing the risk of false-negative results. This is particularly for women with obesity with class III obesity

Serial measurement of symphysis fundal height (SFH) is recommended at each antenatal appointment from 24 weeks of gestation as this improves the prediction of a small-for-gestational-age fetus.

There is a lack of definitive data to recommend routine monitoring of postdates pregnancy. However, obese pregnant women should be made aware that they are at increased risk of stillbirth.

In the absence of good-quality evidence, intrapartum fetal monitoring for obese women in labour should be provided.

\section*{Planning labour and birth in obese women}

Planning for labour and birth is a dynamic process, which requires ongoing review of the woman's antenatal progress and development of complications during the antenatal period. When discussing labour with the woman, it is important to consider maternal comorbidities, fetal complications, and access to services for emergency birth and neonatal resuscitation if required.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Evidence \\
\hline Women who are multiparous and otherwise low risk can be offered choice of setting for planning their birth in midwifery-led units (MLUs), with clear referral pathways for early recourse to consultant-led units (CLUs) if complications arise. & C \\
\hline Active management of the third stage should be recommended to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). & A \\
\hline Safe vaginal delivery is highly recommended & A \\
\hline Elective induction of labour at term in obese women may reduce the chance of caesarean birth without increasing the risk of adverse outcomes; the option of induction should be discussed with each woman on an individual basis & B \\
\hline The decision for a woman with maternal obesity to give birth by planned caesarean section should involve a multidisciplinary approach, taking into consideration the individual woman's comorbidities, antenatal complications and fetal surveillance result/ outcomes. & C \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Care during childbirth in obese women}

Class III obesity is associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labour and neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is highly associated with an increased risk of serious maternal morbidity because anesthetic and operative difficulties are more prevalent in these women than in women with a healthy BMI. This should also be taken into account when discussing the risks and benefits of mode of delivery.

Establishing venous access in women with class III obesity is more like to be difficult than in women with class I and II obesity.it is important that this is not attempted for the first time in an emergency situation when urgent venous access is required for intravenous medication or for resuscitation
Women with obesity are at increased risk of PPH. There is strong evidence from the general maternity population that active management of the third stage of labour reduces the risk of PPH, anaemia and the need for blood transfusion.

Women with class III obesity who are in established labour should receive continuous midwifery care, with consideration of additional measures to monitor the fetal condition

Women with class I obesity or greater having a caesarean section are at increased risk of wound infection and should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery
Women undergoing caesarean section who have more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space in order to reduce the risk of wound infection and wound separation.

\section*{Postnatal care and follow-up after pregnancy in obese women}

Obesity is associated with low breastfeeding initiation and maintenance rates. Women with a booking BMI $30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ or greater should receive appropriate specialist advice and support antenatally and postnatally regarding the benefits, initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.

Maternal obesity is associated with a physiological delay in lactogenesis, lower rates of breastfeeding initiation, earlier cessation of breastfeeding and earlier introduction of solids. This is likely to be multifactorial in origin and may be due to women's perceptions of breastfeeding, difficulty with correct positioning of the baby and the possibility of an impaired prolactin response to suckling.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Evidence \\
\hline Dedicated breastfeeding support during the postnatal period is needed as the onset of breastfeeding is likely to be more complicated than for other women. & $\sqrt{ }$ \\
\hline Women should be supported to lose weight postpartum and offered referral to weight management services where these are available to prevent weight retention/ increase. & $\sqrt{ }$ \\

\section*{PRECONCEPTION CARE}

\section*{Introduction}

Preconception care is the provision of biomedical, behavioral and social health interventions to women and couples before conception occurs (WHO, 2012). It aims at improving their health status and reducing behaviors and individual and environmental factors that contribute to poor maternal and child health outcomes. Its ultimate aim is to improve maternal and child health, in both the short and long term.

\section*{Life course - when to intervene?}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure II: Pre-conception care}
\end{figure}

Adopted from WHO 2012 Preconception care policy brief 2
Opportunities to prevent and control diseases occur at multiple stages of life; strong public health programmes that use a life-course perspective from infancy through childhood and adolescence to adulthood are needed. Preconception care contributes to these efforts. Even if preconception care aims primarily at improving maternal and child health, it brings health benefits to the adolescents, women and men, irrespective of their plans to become parents. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Why is pre-conception care a public health concern?}

Despite advances in maternal and newborn health care, poor birth outcomes continue to be a problem in Kenya. Newborn mortality now contributes to $59 \%$ of all infant mortality rate ${ }^{6}$, with prematurity, asphyxia and infection accounting for the majority of the deaths. HIV prevalence in WRA has increased to $9.2 \%$; among youth women 15 to 24 years are 4 times more likely to be infected with HIV than men ${ }^{7}$. This is also the group of women with the highest total fertility rate.

Among women of reproductive age, risks associated with poor pregnancy outcomes e.g. malaria and anemia remain prevalent; smoking, alcohol use and drug abuse are on the increase. Events in childhood/adolescence e.g. malnutrition, stunting, obesity may also lead to poor obstetric outcomes later. All of these factors could be addressed with proper health interventions prior to conception.

Although the recommended timing of the first ANC visit is before 16 weeks, most women present when it is too late to prevent the majority of serious maternal and newborn health problems. The foetus is most susceptible to developing certain problems in the first 4-10 weeks of intrauterine life. At this time many women are not even aware that they are pregnant and they are therefore unable to recognize and address the risks to their own and their baby's health, hence, the need for interventions to begin before conception. ${ }^{8}$

Managing long-term health conditions includes ensuring that mental health issues, metabolic disorders and other chronic medical conditions-including obesity-are well managed and sufficiently monitored. Women should be informed regarding the effect of their condition on potential pregnancy and vice versa. Additionally, women and men taking teratogenic medications should be advised regarding effective contraception and provided with information about switching to alternative treatments when trying to conceive.

Assistance in stopping or avoiding risky behaviors includes counselling on smoking cessation, excessive alcohol intake and drug misuse. Promoting healthy behaviors covers advice regarding nutrition, folic acid and other supplements, vaccinations such as rubella, sexually transmitted infection and cervical screening, if appropriate, and reproductive planning. Healthcare providers should discuss effective contraception with individuals who do not wish to conceive in the near future. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Target Population}

The target population for preconception care is women of reproductive age (WRA - 15 to 49 years), although men are also targeted by several components of preconception care. ${ }^{9}$

At risk populations to whom special attention should be provided include teenage girls, refugees, women living in disaster prone regions, survivors of gender-based violence.

Inter sectoral collaborations with other key stakeholders including the Ministries of Education, Gender and Social Services, Internal Security and others including religious organizations, to support develop and implement guidelines aiding in preconception care.

\section*{Objectives of Preconception Care ${ }^{\mathbf{2 , 6}}$}
- To provide health promotion and education to improve knowledge attitudes and behaviors of men and women with regard to pregnancy
- To provide Evidence - based screening for pregnancy risks
- To provide interventions to address identified risks and conditions
- To achieve universal coverage of Essential Obstetric Care

\section*{Scope/focus areas}

Pre-conception care can be divided into three main focus areas:
- management of long-term health conditions
- assistance in ceasing risky behaviors
- promoting healthy behaviors.

\section*{Why Preconception Care? ${ }^{\mathbf{2}}$}

\section*{ANTENATAL CARE}

\section*{Introduction}

Antenatal care offers a great opportunity to prevent and manage existing and potential causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The new 2016 WHO ANC model advocates for 8 contacts with the first occurring within the first trimester. ${ }^{\underline{\mathbf{1 4}}}$

Definition- Antenatal care (ANC) can be defined as the care provided by skilled health-care professionals to pregnant women and adolescent girls in order to ensure the best health conditions /outcomes for both mother and baby during pregnancy. The components of ANC include: risk identification; prevention and management of pregnancy-related or concurrent diseases; and health education and health promotion. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Epidemiology}

Only $50 \%$ of women worldwide receive the recommended amount of care during pregnancy ${ }^{1}$. Globally, while $86 \%$ of pregnant women access antenatal care with skilled health personnel at least once, only three in five ( $62 \%$ ) receive at least four antenatal visits. In regions with the highest rates of maternal mortality, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, even fewer women receive at least four antenatal visits ( $52 \%$ and $46 \%$, respectively). ${ }^{\underline{17}}$

History of Antenatal Care - In 2002, the WHO recommended a focused or goal-orientated approach to ANC to enhance the quality of care and increase ANC coverage, especially in LMICs. ${ }^{3}$ The focused ANC (FANC) model entailed four ANC visits occurring between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation, between 24 and 26 weeks, at 32 weeks, and between 36 and 38 weeks. Guidance on each visit included specific evidence-based interventions for healthy pregnant women with appropriate referral of high-risk women and those who develop pregnancy complications.

On November 7 ${ }^{\text {th }}$, 2016, the World Health Organization released its comprehensive recommendations on routine ANC for pregnant women and adolescent girls and this model entailed 8 visits. ${ }^{4}$

No. Interventions Recommendations
- Group antenatal care provided by qualified health-care professionals may be offered as an alternative to individual antenatal care for pregnant women in the context of rigorous research, depending on a woman's preferences and provided that the infrastructure and resources for delivery of group antenatal care are available (Context-specific recommendation (research)
- Packages of interventions that include household and community mobilization and antenatal home visits are recommended to improve antenatal care utilization and perinatal health outcomes, particularly in rural settings with low access to health services (Context-specific recommendation)
- Task sharing the promotion of health-related behaviours for maternal and newborn health to a broad range of cadres, including lay health workers, auxiliary nurses, nurses, midwives and doctors is recommended.
- Policy-makers should consider educational, regulatory, financial, and personal and professional support interventions to recruit and retain qualified health workers in rural and remote areas.
- Antenatal care models with a minimum of eight contacts are recommended to reduce perinatal mortality and improve women's experience of care.

\section*{Justification of the new 2016 ANC Model}

This guideline recommendation was informed by: ${ }^{\underline{1}}$
- Evidence suggesting increased perinatal deaths in 4-visit ANC model
- Evidence supporting improved safety during pregnancy through increased frequency of maternal and fetal assessment to detect complications
- Evidence supporting improved health system communication and support around pregnancy for women and families
- Evidence indicating that more contact between pregnant women and respectful, knowledgeable health care workers is more likely to lead to a positive pregnancy experience.
- Evidence from HIC studies indicating no important differences in maternal and perinatal health outcomes between ANC models that included at least eight contacts and ANC models that included II to I5 contacts

NB: As comprehensive as the current recommendations are, the guideline development process also identified several knowledge gaps such as antenatal screening of gestational diabetes mellitus and future updates will also aim at including more extensive health system-level recommendations on how to improve utilization and quality of antenatal care

\section*{Summary of the 2016 ANC Guidelines ${ }^{1}$}

49 recommendations are grouped into five topic areas:
- Nutritional interventions (14)
- Maternal and fetal assessment (I3)
- Preventive measures (7)
- Interventions for common physiological symptoms (6)
- Health systems interventions to improve the utilization and quality of ANC (9)

Antenatal care models with a minimum of eight contacts are recommended to reduce perinatal mortality and improve women's experience of care. There are five contacts in the third trimester, one contact in the first trimester, and two contacts in the second trimester. The new model recommends pregnant women to have their first contact during the first 12 weeks' gestation, with following contacts taking place at $20,26,30,34,36,38$ and 40 weeks of gestation.

\section*{GROUP ANC ${ }^{24}$}

This is an alternative model. ANC conventionally takes the form of a one-on-one consultation between a pregnant woman and her health-care provider. Group ANC (GANC) integrates the usual individual pregnancy health assessment with tailored group educational activities and peer support, with the aim of motivating behavior change among pregnant women, improving pregnancy outcomes, and increasing women's satisfaction.

Group ANC needs to be delivered in a space large enough to accommodate a group of pregnant women based on the gestational ages, with a private area for examinations.

The intervention typically involves:
- Self-assessment activities (e.g., Blood pressure measurement)
- Group education with facilitated discussion
- Socialization activities

Group antenatal care provided by qualified health-care professionals may be offered as an alternative to individual antenatal care for pregnant women in the context of rigorous research, depending on a woman's preferences and provided that the infrastructure and resources for delivery of group antenatal care are available.

Group care studies conducted in Kenya and Nigeria showed improved quality of ANC. Patient and provider experience was more satisfactory with group care. There was more empowerment and self-efficacy with the pregnancy, newborn care, postpartum family planning and healthier outcomes. ${ }^{\underline{25}}$

\caption{Figure 14: Outcomes to track during Group ANC}
\end{figure}

\section*{Advantages}
- Reducing health inequalities by improving health literacy among less-educated women.
- Providing social support. The flexibility of the format allows women to exchange valuable information with each other and discuss pregnancy-related concerns in a relaxed and informal manner
- Improving maternal and neonatal outcomes
- Enhances the move towards the 8 -contact model
- Resources are effectively put into good use

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Group ANC may take longer than individual ANC, and this may pose practical problems for some women in terms of work and childcare.
- In settings with poor transport systems or variable weather, the appointment system with group ANC may not be suitable and may have a negative impact on equity for women living in remote areas.
- Group ANC may have acceptability and feasibility issues in settings where perceived differences keep people apart, e.g. women from different castes in India may not wish to be in a group together.

Health-care facilities need to be seeing sufficient numbers of pregnant women, as allocation to groups is ideally performed according to gestational age.

\section*{Recommendations and Conclusions (ACOG 2018)}

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists makes the following recommendations:
- Group prenatal care models are designed to improve patient education and include opportunities for social support while maintaining the risk screening and physical assessment of individual prenatal care.
- Studies appear to demonstrate high levels of patient satisfaction, obstetric outcomes equally efficacious as individual prenatal care, and improved outcomes for some populations.
- Specific group prenatal care models can be challenging to initiate and maintain. The cost of initiating a group prenatal care model in current obstetric practices may be a barrier to implementation.

\section*{Preventive measures during pregnancy}

IFAS: When anemia in pregnancy (hemoglobin level less than $||\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{d}|$ ) is diagnosed, the dose of elemental iron should be increased to 120 mg until the Hb concentration rises to normal or higher.

Vitamin A: Vitamin A supplementation is not recommended to improve maternal or perinatal outcomes unless in areas where Vitamin A deficiency is considered a significant public health problem. When indicated Vitamin A is given daily or weekly (up to 10,000 IU per day or weekly dose of up to $25,000 \mathrm{IU}$ ) to prevent night blindness.

\section*{Tetanus Diphtheria (TD) vaccination:}
- If a pregnant woman has not been previously vaccinated, or her immunization status is unknown, she should receive two doses of TD vaccine one month apart with the second dose given at least 2 weeks before delivery/childbirth. 2 doses protect against TD infection for I3 years. A third dose is recommended six months after the second dose, which should extend protection to at least 5 years.
- Two further doses for women who are first vaccinated against TD during pregnancy should be given after the third dose, in the two subsequent years or during two subsequent pregnancies.
- If a woman has had I-4 TD injections in the past, she should receive one dose of TT during each subsequent pregnancy to a total of 5 doses ( 5 doses offer protection throughout the childbearing years).

\begin{table}

\hline $5^{\text {th }}$ injection & I year after $4^{\text {th }}$ injection/ subsequent pregnancy \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

IPTp: Intermittent preventive treatment with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is recommended for all pregnant women living in the malaria endemic areas. Dosing should start in the second trimester (I3 weeks) and be given at least one month apart; with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received.

The National guidelines on Malaria prevention - start at 13 weeks, monthly till delivery. HIV positive mothers on Cotrimoxazole should not take IPT.

Deworming: Preventive chemotherapy (deworming), using single-dose albendazole ( 400 mg ) or mebendazole $(500 \mathrm{mg})$ is recommended as a public health intervention for pregnant women living in hook-worm infested areas from the $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimester. (WHO, 2016)

\section*{Ancillary ANC Investigations as Per Facility Level ${ }^{\underline{19}}$}
- Additional investigations that can be done prenatally include:
- Chlamydia: Selective testing for Chlamydia should be considered for those who may be at increased risk according to local prevalence.
- Hepatitis B serology: Women found to be chronic carriers of Hepatitis B, should have an assessment of their viral replicative status (i.e. HBV DNA level and HBe antigen status) and liver function performed, and be referred for specialist support.
- Hepatitis C serology: Women who are known to be Hepatitis C antibody positive should have liver function tests performed and an assessment of their viral load (Hepatitis C RNA PCR).I Consider referral to an appropriate specialist for counseling and planning postnatal follow up.
- Varicella: Consideration should be given to checking varicella antibodies at the first visit where there is no definite history of chickenpox.
- Cervical screening: Cervical screening for HPV/dysplasia should be recommended at the first antenatal visit if this would fall due during the pregnancy, according to cervical screening guidelines.
- Screening for Down syndrome: Chorionic venous sampling and amniocentesis
- Screening for haemoglobinopathies: Hemoglobin electrophoresis (HbEPG) or highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and exclusion of iron deficiency (ferritin level) should be performed in the event of low MCV. Full assessment of fetal risk requires investigation of the partner.
- Vitamin D: Gravid women at risk for vitamin D deficiency should be tested in early pregnancy or provided with vitamin D supplementation.
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Routine serological screening for CMV infection in pregnancy is not recommended.
- Toxoplasmosis: Routine serological screening for toxoplasmosis infection in pregnancy is not recommended.
- Thyroid function tests (Serum TSH assessment): Routine screening for subclinical thyroid disease remains controversial. Screening for thyroid dysfunction to be considered for at risk groups.
- Group B Strep status (GBS) and gonorrhea screening (first catch urine or self-applied swab)
- Rubella titres
- Vaginal fluid fibronectin, Nitrazine test and Ferning test to evaluate for premature rupture of membranes.
- Gestational diabetes in women at risk: OGTT (If high risk OGTT (preferred) or HbAIc at 5-12 weeks). Fasting -For high risk I-2-hour HbAIc (Ist trimester only)

\section*{The Mandatory ANC Profile}
- TB
- HIV
- VDRL
- Blood sugars
- Full hemogram
- BS for malaria
- Blood group and rhesus factor
- Urinalysis

\section*{HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES}
- A high-risk pregnancy defined as one which is complicated by factor or factors that adversely affects the pregnancy outcome (maternal, perinatal or both). ${ }^{\underline{20}}$
- Several factors can make a pregnancy high risk, including existing health conditions, the mother's age, lifestyle, and health issues that happen before or during pregnancy.
- High-risk pregnancy can have serious maternal, obstetric, and neonatal complications if left undetected. ${ }^{\underline{22}}$

NB: Pregnancy itself predisposes the client and puts the client at health risk.

\section*{Classification of high-risk pregnancies ${ }^{21}$}
- Pre-existing health conditions: Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, sexually transmitted diseases, Renal disorders, Thyroid disorders, Autoimmune diseases, Acute surgical problems, genital tract abnormalities, Obesity, Hemoglobinopathies, Severe anemia (Hb $<7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ )
- Age: Young (adolescent pregnancy), Advanced maternal age
- Lifestyle factors: Alcohol abuse, Tobacco smoking, illicit drug use,
- Conditions of pregnancy: Multifetal gestation, Gestational diabetes mellitus, Pre-eclampsia, previous preterm delivery, previous stillbirth, birth defects or genetic conditions in the fetus, placental anomalies, premature rupture of membranes, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, prior birth trauma, late spontaneous abortion.

Management and prevention is tailored to the specific pre-existing medical disorder or risk factor. For instance, in a woman suffering from hyperthyroidism, antithyroid drugs would be useful in mitigating against complications that may arise in pregnancy and thus lead to favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Risk assessment in pregnancy helps to predict which women are most likely to experience adverse health events and enables providers to administer risk-appropriate perinatal care. ${ }^{23}$

Effective communication, control and early detection are important tools that doctors must be able to use to plan the best treatment strategies and to minimize the risks of maternal and / or fetal. ${ }^{\underline{26}}$

\section*{Individual Birth Plan (IBP)}

\section*{Women at low risk of complications}
- Explain to both multiparous and nulliparous women who are at low risk of complications that giving birth is generally very safe for both the woman and her baby.
- Explain to low-risk nulliparous women that:
- Planned births need to be under skilled birth atrendance
- When discussing the woman's choice of place of birth with her, do not disclose personal views or judgements about her choices.
- Explain to both multiparous and nulliparous women that they may choose any birth setting support them in their choice of setting wherever they choose to give birth.
- Advise low-risk nulliparous women that they should have emergency preparedness as medical or obstetric complications can arise necessitating referral.

\section*{RESPECTFUL MATERNITY CARE (RMC)}

\section*{Introduction}

Respectful maternity care - which refers to care organized for and provided to all women in a manner that maintains their dignity, privacy and confidentiality, ensures freedom from harm and mistreatment, and enables informed choice and continuous support during labour and childbirth.

Respectful maternity care (RMC) is not only a crucial component of quality of care; it is a human right. In 2014, WHO released a statement calling for the prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth, stating that "every woman has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the right to dignified, respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth." ${ }^{\prime}$

The aim of RMC is to give total respect and to preserve the dignity of all women throughout their stay in the health facility. Their privacy and confidentiality should be respected at all times, and any kind of mistreatment, such as physical, sexual or verbal abuse, discrimination, neglect, detainment, extortion or denial of services, should be avoided.

Effective communication and engagement among health care providers, health service managers, women and representatives of women's groups and women's rights movements is essential to ensure that care is responsive to women's needs and preferences in all contexts and settings.

Interventions should aim to ensure a respectful and dignified working environment for those providing care, acknowledging that staff may also experience disrespect and abuse in the workplace and/or violence at home or in the community.
- All women and newborns have privacy around the time of antenatal, labour/childbirth, and postnatal care and their confidentiality is respected.
- No woman or newborn is subjected to mistreatment, such as physical, sexual or verbal abuse, discrimination, neglect, detainment, extortion or denial of services.
- All women can make informed choices about the services they receive, and the reasons for interventions or outcomes are clearly explained.

\section*{MATERNITY OPEN DAYS}

This concept was introduced by WHO in 2019 with the aim of public health facilities showcase what services they offer in maternal health and increase facility delivery in order to utilize the free maternal health care services being offered in public health facilities. Targeted to increase antenatal attendance, skilled birth attendance and targeted postnatal care coverage to over $80 \%$ by 2030 in order to meet maternal and newborn care indicators of ICPD+25, (2019). This can be achieved through open maternity day in health facilities and community dialogue. ${ }^{27}$
- During Maternity open day the pregnant mother, her partner, family and the community are provided with an opportunity to visit and tour the maternity unit, meet with obstetricians/gynecologists, midwives and other health care providers. ${ }^{27}$
- They interact with the health care providers one on one, learn about birth preparedness, choice of birth place and see services offered in maternity. Information on preconception care, breastfeeding, health and wellbeing, Insurance services/Linda mama package, birthing positions, danger signs in pregnancy, nutrition in pregnancy and other services relevant to pregnancy are given. ${ }^{\mathbf{2 7}}$
- The pregnant mother, her male partner, family and community are taken round the maternity wing to see the environment and equipment available.
- Maternity open days exist to facilitate birth preparedness and encourage more mothers to deliver in hospitals and also involve the male partner and community in maternal health issues ${ }^{27}$.

\section*{ANTEPARTUM HEMORRHAGE}

\section*{Definition}

Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or into the genital tract occurring after 24 weeks of gestation which is unrelated to labor and delivery ${ }^{19}$. Any vaginal bleeding after 24 weeks should be assumed to be due to either placenta previa or placental abruption, unless proven otherwise.

\section*{Causes}
- Placenta previa (20 percent)
- Placental abruption ( 30 percent)
- Uterine rupture (rare)
- Vasa previa (rare)
- Cervical Lesions
- Vaginal lesions
- Unidentified causes

Prediction: APH has a heterogeneous pathophysiology and cannot reliably be predicted

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Clinical history to identify:}
- The possible causes of bleeding
- The gestational age and presence of ultrasound reports of the current pregnancy
- Any history of bleeding in previous pregnancies
- Duration taken since onset of bleeding
- Any medical attention sought
- Fetal status in terms of movement
- Any clinical symptoms indicative of shock

\section*{Assessment of the mother's and baby's condition}

\section*{Maternal assessment}
- Signs of shock (Pallor, sweating, cold and clammy, restlessness)
- Pulse rate-tachycardia if in shock
- Blood pressure- expected hypotension
- Uterine palpation for size, tenderness, softness/hardness

NB: Vaginal examination should not be performed until ultrasound is done to exclude placenta praevia

\section*{Fetal Assessment}
- Presence of or absence of fetal heart (Differentiate from maternal pulse due to maternal tachycardia)
- Closely monitor fetal heart if present for gestation of over 28 weeks
- Auscultation with Doppler, pinnards or fetoscope

\section*{Diagnosis is mainly clinical with the following raising suspicion:}
- Per vaginal bleeding associated with or without abdominal pains.
- Uterus is tender and, irritable,
- Signs of shock i.e. maternal tachycardia, hypotension
- Evidence of fetal distress if abruption'

Ultrasound is helpful when ruling out placenta praevia and in assessing fetal condition

\section*{Initial Resuscitation and General Management $\underline{\mathbf{3}}^{\mathbf{1} 3}$}
- SHOUT FOR HELP!!! To urgently mobilize all available personnel.
- Perform a rapid evaluation of the woman's general condition and then start DR. ABC protocol;
- D - Danger
- R - Response
- Airway
- Breathing
- Circulation

Evaluate the level of consciousness (AVPU; A- alertness, V-verbal response, P- pulse, UUnresponsive).

Perform secondary review to assess presence of anxiety and/or confusion, volume of blood loss, whether bleeding is accompanied by pain, color and temperature of skin.

Do not do a vaginal examination at this Stage.
If shock is suspected, immediately position appropriately and begin treatment. Pregnant uterus compresses vena cava causing blood pressure to drop there is need to provide a left lateral tilt.

\section*{How to Position Pregnant Woman: > 20 weeks}

\section*{Check the fetal heart rate and ask about fetal movements:}
- If there are fetal heart rate abnormalities (less than 110 or more than 160 beats per minute), suspect fetal distress.
- If fetal heart cannot be heard, ask several other persons to listen or use a Doppler, stethoscope, if available.

If fetal movements are not felt, the fetal heart cannot be heard, suspect fetal death. Start an IV infusion and infuse IV fluids.

NB: Send a blood sample for haemoglobin or haematocrit and type and screen, and order blood for possible transfusion, before IV fluids infusion. For the classification of shock (in stages) refer to the section on 'Shock'

\section*{PLACENTA PREVIA}
- Placenta Previa refers to the implantation of the placenta over or near the internal os of the cervix. ${ }^{7}$
- All placentas overlying the os (to any degree) are termed as Previa and those near to but not overlying the os are termed low-lying ${ }^{15}$.
- Placenta Previa is commonly diagnosed by ultrasonography in the third trimester, often between 28 and 32 weeks ${ }^{16}$.

Epidemiology: The estimated global prevalence of placenta previa was 5.2 per 1000 pregnancies in 2014'

\section*{Types of Placenta Previa}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-096.jpg?height=675&width=1646&top_left_y=1007&top_left_x=242}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 17: Types of Placenta Previa}
\end{figure}

Placenta Previa is divided into four categories according to the distance from placental edge to internal os ${ }^{16}$.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Classifications of Placenta Previa & Position \\
\hline Type I (low-lying placenta) & Placenta encroaches the lower segment, and does not reach internal os. \\
\hline Type II (marginal) & Placenta reaches the margin of internal os but does not cover it. \\
\hline Type III (partial) & Placenta partially covers the internal os. \\
\hline Type IV (complete/total) & Placenta completely covers the internal os, the cervix cannot dilate. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Risk factors ${ }^{7}$ Signs/ Symptoms}

Several risk factors implicated in placenta Previa.
- Multi-parity
- Prior cesarean delivery
- Multi-fetal pregnancy

\section*{PLACENTAL ABRUPTION}

Placental abruption refers to the premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the uterus before the delivery of the fetus. $\underline{6} \underline{14}$

Epidemiology: Present in an estimated 0.4-1 \% of pregnancies, placental abruption is a major cause of perinatal death and maternal morbidity ${ }^{17}$

\section*{PRETERM PRELABOUR RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES}

\section*{Introduction}

Pre-Labour Rupture of Membranes (PROM) refers to spontaneous rupture of membrane before the onset of uterine contractions. Previously the condition was referred to as premature rupture of membranes.

Preterm Pre-labour Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) refers to spontaneous rupture of membranes occurs beyond 28 weeks but before 37 completed week's gestation and least one hour before the onset of labour

\section*{Epidemiology}

PPROM occurs in about $3 \%$ of pregnancies. It varies considerably between different areas due to different population risk factors. ${ }^{\perp, 2,3}$

Preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes is the primary etiology for $40 \%$ of pre-term births. It is the single most common identifiable factor associated with preterm delivery ${ }^{1,2,3,4,5}$. It precedes about $30-40 \%$ of spontaneous preterm labour. $30-40 \%$ of women with PPROM will deliver within 48 hours and 56 to $63 \%$ within 7 days. ${ }^{2}$

PPROM can lead to significant perinatal morbidity including: Birth asphyxia, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), neonatal sepsis, umbilical cord prolapse, placental abruption and fetal death. ${ }^{1,} \underline{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{4}$

It has been established that preterm birth is a significant risk factor for long term sequelae such as chronic lung disease, neurosensory impairment, cerebral palsy and developmental delay. ${ }^{4}$

The 3 major causes of death associated with PPROM are: prematurity, neonatal sepsis and pulmonary hypoplasia.

PPROM may be complicated by chorioamnionitis which together with retained products of conception are the major causes of secondary postpartum hemorrhage. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

\section*{Summary recommendations}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendation & Grading of evidence \\
\hline 1. Avoid digital examination unless immediate induction is planned as this has been shown to increase the rate of infection & Consensus \\
\hline 2. If there are no maternal or fetal contraindications, recommend expectant management to women with PPROM before $34+0$ weeks gestation & Level A \\
\hline 3. Recommend antibiotics (as identified in the guideline) to women with PPROM to reduce maternal and neonatal infection & Level A \\
\hline 4. Recommend antenatal corticosteroids to women with PPROM less than $35+0$ weeks gestation & Level A \\
\hline 5. Recommend intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for Early Onset Group B Streptococcal Disease to women with PPROM & Level A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 2I: Summary recommendations on preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes ${ }^{(7)}$}
\end{table}

\section*{Etiology}

Causative factors are multifactorial. Infection appears to have an important role, either as a cause or as a consequence of PPROM and is an independent risk factor for subsequent cerebral palsy. ${ }^{5}$

There is evidence demonstrating an association between ascending infection from the lower genital tract and PPROM ${ }^{\underline{5}}$

In majority, the causes are not known, however possible risk factors include: ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{5}}$

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{Possible Risk Factors to PPROM} \\
\hline 1 & Previous history of PPROM & 7 & Decreased tensile strength of the membranes \\
\hline 2 & Genital tract infection or colonization with: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Bacterial vaginosis, Group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis & 8 & Cervical incompetence \\
\hline 3 & Multiple gestation & 9 & Cervical length < 2.5 cm (short cervix) \\
\hline 4 & Polyhydramnios & 10 & Abruption placentae and Placenta Previa \\
\hline 5 & Increased friability of the membranes & 11 & latrogenic (Invasive procedures amniocentesis, fetal blood sampling) \\
\hline 6 & Fetal malformations & 12 & Trauma \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 22: Possible Risk Factors to PPROM}
\end{table}

\section*{Clinical Presentation ${ }^{2,}, \underline{3}, \underline{5}$}

The only subjective symptom is escape of watery discharge per vagina either in the form of a gush or slow leak. This is often confused with Hydrorrhea gravidarum; a state where periodic watery discharge occurs probably due to excessive decidual glandular secretion and incontinence of urine especially in the last trimester.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 23: Signs and Symptoms of PROM}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Signs & Symptoms \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
- Decrease in size of the uterus \\
- Temperature may be raised (above $37.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) \\
- Intermittent or slow leaking from the vagina soaking a vulva pad. \\
- Fluid seen escaping from cervical canal on speculum examination is diagnostic \\
- An increase in fetal rate \\
- Increased white blood cell count
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Abnormally heavy watery vaginal discharge which may run up to the feet or a sudden gush of fluid from the vagina. \\
- The fluid may be clear/transparent, pink, yellow, green or brown and may be foul smelling \\
The fluid may leak constantly OR only when walking, standing, after sitting, lying down or on exertion \\
- There may be fever, chills or abdominal pains \\
- Contraction and tenderness of the uterus
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Assessment of a patient with PPROM ${ }^{2,3,5}$}

\section*{Obstetric history}

The following information should be obtained from the patient
- Last menstrual period, regularity of the menstrual cycles and hence duration of gestation
- History of similar episode in previous pregnancies
- Duration of drainage and amount of fluid
- Pattern of fetal movements

\section*{Physical Examination}
- General examination with vital sign monitoring
- Abdominal examination for any tenderness
- Obstetric examination- Leopold's maneuvers
- Vaginal examination: Sterile speculum examination is done taking aseptic precautions to check for any cord prolapse, presenting fetal parts.

Inspect the liquor escaping out through the cervix; color and consistency, features of vernix and meconium staining. The patient may be asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver or cough to confirm leakage. Collect fluid for analysis from the posterior fornix (vaginal pool)

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Laboratory investigations}
- Full blood count: Hb, WBC (total and differential count), ESR
- pH test: Detection of pH by litmus or Nitrazine paper. The pH becomes 6-6.2 (Normal vaginal pH during pregnancy is $4.5-5.5$ whereas that of liquor amnii is $7-7.5$ ).

Nitrazine paper turns from yellow to blue at $\mathrm{pH}>6$.
Competing differential diagnoses of a positive nitrazine test include: vaginal infections, blood, semen, cervical mucous - all of which cause an alkaline vaginal PH.
- Nile blue sulfate test: Centrifuged cells stained with $0.1 \%$ Nile blue sulfate show orange blue coloration of the cells (exfoliated fat containing cells from sebaceous glands of the fetus)
- Phosphatidyl glycerol and Lecithin Sphingomyelin ratio of the draining liquor to assess fetal lung maturity
- Urinalysis
- HIV
- TB Screening

Note the characteristic ferning pattern when a smeared slide is examined under the microscope

\section*{Microbiology}
- Amniotic fluid for microscopy, culture and sensitivity
- High vaginal swab for microscopy, culture and sensitivity
- Urine culture, microscopy and sensitivity

\section*{Imaging}
- Obstetric ultrasound for fetal biophysical profile and to determine: viability, maturity, amount of liquor, any fetal abnormalities and presentation

\section*{Cardiotocography}
- For a non-stress test. Indeed, fetal tachycardia is used in definition of clinical chorioamnionitis

\section*{Treatment ${ }^{\underline{1}, 2,3,5,6}$}

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, management depends on: -
- Gestational age of the fetus
- Whether the patient is in labor or not
- Any evidence of sepsis
- Prospect of fetal survival in that institution, if delivery occurs

\section*{Principles of treatment}
- The main concern is to balance the risk of infection in expectant management (while pregnancy is continued) versus the risk of prematurity in active intervention.
- Vaginal digital examination is generally avoided to prevent infection
- Ideally the patient should be transferred with the "fetus in utero" to a unit able to manage preterm neonates effectively.
- If the gestational age is 34 weeks or more, perinatal mortality from prematurity is less compared to infection.
- Labor generally starts spontaneously within 48 hours; otherwise, induction with oxytocin is instituted.
- Presentation other than cephalic merits cesarean section.
- When gestational age is less than 34 weeks, conservative attitude generally followed in absence of any maternal or fetal indications.
- On rare occasions with bed rest, the leak seals spontaneously and pregnancy continues.

\section*{Supportive treatment modalities}
- Admit the patient
- Patient is put on bed rest and a sterile vulval pad is applied to observe any further leakage.
- Continuous fetal monitoring
- Maternal vital signs monitoring i.e., pulse and temperature
- Monitoring for uterine tenderness by abdominal palpation is performed.

\section*{Use of antibiotics ${ }^{5,6}$}
- Prophylactic antibiotics are given to minimize maternal and perinatal risks of infection. Studies have shown that prophylactic antibiotics prolong pregnancy and reduce maternal and neonatal sepsis. ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$

\section*{Recommendations for antibiotic use ${ }^{\mathbf{8}}$}
- Following PPROM at 32 weeks' gestation, antibiotics should be administered to women who are not in labour in order to prolong pregnancy and to decrease maternal and neonatal morbidity (I-A).
- The use of antibiotics should be gestational-age dependent. The evidence for benefit is greater at earlier gestational ages (<32 weeks) (I-A).
- For women with PPROM at $>32$ weeks' gestation, administration of antibiotics to prolong pregnancy is recommended if fetal lung maturity cannot be proven and/or delivery is not planned (I-A).
- Antibiotic regimens may consist of an initial parenteral phase followed by an oral phase, or may consist of only an oral phase (I-A).
- Antibiotics of choice are penicillin or macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin) in parenteral and/or oral forms. (I-A) In patients allergic to penicillin, macrolide antibiotics should be used alone (III-B).
- The following two regimens may be used (the two regimens were used in the largest PPROM randomized controlled trials that showed a decrease in both maternal and neonatal morbidity): (I) ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours and erythromycin 250 mg IV every 6 hours for 48 hours followed by amoxicillin 250 mg orally every 8 hours and erythromycin 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days (I-A); (2) erythromycin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 10 days (IA). Used if there is no evidence of maternal chorioamnionitis.
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid should not be used because of an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates exposed to this antibiotic. Amoxicillin without clavulanic acid is safe (I-A).
- Women presenting with PPROM should be screened for urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, and group B streptococcus carriage, and treated with appropriate antibiotics if positive (II-2B).

\end{tabular} \\

\section*{Magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus}

Studies have shown that magnesium sulphate given before preterm birth has a neuroprotective role in the fetus. ${ }^{5}$

A loading dose of 4 g IV with a maintenance infusion of $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{hr}$ is recommended and should be given for a maximum of 24 hours ${ }^{9}$.

\section*{Tocolysis}
- Prophylactic tocolysis in women with PPROM without uterine activity is not recommended.
- Women with PPROM and uterine activity who require intrauterine transfer or antenatal corticosteroids may be considered for a short course of tocolysis. However, this decision needs to be considered in light of the possibility of pre-existing intrauterine infection, the only clinical feature of which might be uterine activity. If there is a significant suspicion of chorioamnionitis, then tocolysis is not recommended ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Amnioinfusion ${ }^{10}$}

There is some evidence to show that restoring amniotic fluid volume with saline or a similar fluid (amnioinfusion) following preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) may be beneficial for preterm babies (by preventing infection, lung damage and death) and mothers (by preventing infection of the womb after childbirth). However, current evidence is insufficient to recommend amnioinfusion for routine use in PPROM.

\section*{Chorioamnionitis and PPROM}

The diagnosis of chorioamnionitis relies on the clinical presentation and may be difficult in its early manifestations.

The clinical picture may include maternal fever with 2 or more of the following:
- Increased white cell count >15*10^9/|
- Maternal tachycardia (>100bpm)
- Fetal tachycardia (>160bpm)
- Uterine tenderness
- Offensive smelling vaginal discharge
- C-Reactive Protein >40

If signs of chorioamnionitis, use:
- Ampicillin or amoxicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours
- Gentamicin $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV daily
- Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 12 hours
- If allergic to penicillin, give clindamycin 600 mg IV in $50-100 \mathrm{ml}$ over at least 20 minutes every 8 hours and gentamicin $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV daily until recovery

\section*{PRETERM LABOR}

\section*{Definition}

Preterm labour denotes regular uterine contractions accompanied by progressive cervical dilation with or without effacement at less than 37 weeks of gestation. '

Preterm birth occurs between 24- and 37weeks gestation. In two-thirds of cases it occurs following spontaneous onset of labour. Only a minority of women who present with preterm contractions known as threatened premature labour (TPTL) progress to actual labour and delivery ${ }^{2}$

Spontaneous preterm labor, a syndrome caused by multiple pathologic processes, contributes to about $70 \%$ of preterm deliveries. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Causes of preterm labour ${ }^{\mathbf{1} \boldsymbol{,} \mathbf{4}}$}

\section*{Maternal causes}
- Demographic factors:
- Maternal age $<18$ years and $>35$ years
- Maternal weight $<55 \mathrm{~kg}$
- Uterine distortion due to: müllerian duct abnormalities, fibroids
- Cervical incompetence due to: trauma, cone biopsy
- Infection e.g., chorioamnionitis, UTI
- Physical injury
- History of spontaneous preterm birth
- Hormonal imbalances

\section*{Pregnancy/ fetal causes}
- Preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes in current pregnancy
- Antepartum hemorrhage
- Uterine over distension due to multi-fetal gestation or poly-hydramnios
- Fetal anomaly
- Utero-placental insufficiency (e.g., hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes, drug abuse, smoking>10 cigarettes/day, alcohol consumption)

\section*{Prevention of Preterm Labour and Delivery}

\section*{Progesterone Therapy}

In women with single gestation pregnancy and a history of spontaneous preterm delivery, antenatal progesterone therapy is the most effective strategy to decrease the risk of a recurrent preterm delivery. Progesterone supplementation is beneficial in these women starting at 16 to 24 weeks' gestation and continuing through 34 weeks' gestation. ${ }^{5}$

Two types of progesterone therapy are currently in use for the prevention of preterm delivery. They include a weekly intramuscular injection of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate or medroxy progesterone acetate 5 mg tablet and daily administration of natural micronized progesterone vaginal gel, vaginal suppository, or oral capsule. ${ }^{6}$

\hline
\end{tabular}

17α-OHPC, 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate.

Table 26: Illustrating progesterone administration for prevention of preterm birth ${ }^{(6)}$

\section*{Cervical Cerclage and Pessary}

Cervical cerclage, an encircling suture placed around the cervix before or during pregnancy, has been used to help correct structural defects or cervical weakening in high-risk women with a shortened cervix. ${ }^{7}$

Studies have shown that cerclage is associated with a decrease in preterm delivery and in perinatal death when used in women with a prior preterm delivery and a cervical length of 25 mm or less.

\section*{Guidance on evaluation and management of a shortened cervical length (CL) ${ }^{5,8}$}
- CL should be confirmed using a standardized technique, with the TV US being the current gold standard.
- A multidisciplinary team approach should be initiated, with involvement of an obstetrician and neonatologist to discuss risks of PTB if the patient is found to have a short cervix.
- Repeat TV US in I-2 weeks, or consider commencement of progesterone for a CL of 20-25 mm.
- Progesterone should be offered for prevention of PTB in women at low risk if CL is $<20 \mathrm{~mm}$ at 18-22 weeks.
- For women deemed to be high risk, cervical cerclage should be considered if there is cervical dilatation pre-viability or if the cervix continues to shorten during surveillance.
- Progesterone is generally the preferred treatment because of the lower risk of surgical complications.

\section*{Other prevention methods of preterm births ${ }^{9,10}$}
- Preconception care package, including immediate post pregnancy family planning (e.g., Birth spacing and adolescent friendly services), education and nutrition especially for girls, and STI prevention
- Antenatal care packages for all women, including screening for and management of STIs, high blood pressure and diabetes; behavior change for lifestyle risks; and targeted care of women at increased risk of preterm birth
- Provider education to promote appropriate induction and caesarean section.
- Policy support including smoking cessation and employment safeguards of pregnant women

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Assessment in a woman with suspected preterm labor '}
- Establish dates

Review history of pregnancy (estimated date of delivery, menstrual history, ultrasounds)
Examine the prenatal record for menstrual history, estimated date of delivery, information from dating ultrasound, and clinical growth
- Evaluate contractions

History (frequency, intensity, duration, changes with time)
Abdominal examination for uterine activity using a tocodynamometer, if available
- Cervical assessment

Sterile speculum exam initially to rule out preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes (PPROM) and to obtain cultures

If indicated digital examination can be performed after premature rupture of membranes is ruled out for the purposes of determining cervical position, dilatation and effacement.

NB: Women should be instructed early in their antepartum care to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of impending preterm labour and to contact their health care provider or go to their health care facility. Signs and symptoms may include:
- Contractions
- Vaginal fluid loss
- Vaginal bleeding
- Maternal perception of changes in pelvic pressure, low dull backache, or vaginal discharge

In the presence of worrisome signs and symptoms, women should be encouraged to report to their health care provider, health center, or local hospital immediately. ${ }^{1}$

Clinical suspicion should be raised by the presence of uterine contractions combined with a cervical examination suggesting early dilation and/or effacement. This approach facilitates early institution of therapy but results in a $50 \%$ over-diagnosis of preterm labor (PTL). '

\section*{Investigations ${ }^{\text {1,2 }}$}

Initial investigations include:
- Non-stress cardiotocogram
- Tocography
- Trans-vaginal ultrasound of the cervix
- Cervico-vaginal swab for fetal fibronectin

\section*{Other investigations to consider:}
- Nitrazine test
- Microscopy, culture and sensitivity of vaginal fluid
- Kleihauer-Betke blood test
- Urine toxicology screen
- TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other infections i.e. syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, herpes simplex)
- Immunoglobulin ( IgG and IgM ) screening whenever historical or clinical suspicion is present.

In patients with a history of mid-trimester loss, laboratory tests for risk assessment include:
- Rapid plasma reagin test
- Gonorrhea and chlamydia screening
- Vaginal pH/wet smear/whiff test
- Anticardiolipin antibody (e.g., anticardiolipin immunoglobulin $[\mathrm{Ig}] \mathrm{G}$ and IgM , anti-beta2 microglobulin)
- Lupus anticoagulant antibody
- Activated partial thromboplastin time
- One-hour glucose challenge test

\section*{Management of preterm labour}

\section*{Prolongation of pregnancy ${ }^{1}$}

No intervention has been shown to reduce the incidence of preterm birth. However, tocolysis has been shown to prolong pregnancy for 48 hours or more.

This provides the window of opportunity for the administration and absorption of corticosteroids. It also allows for the transportation of the woman to a tertiary center if necessary.

Tocolytic treatments (acute and maintenance treatments) are not recommended for women at risk of imminent preterm birth for the purpose of improving newborn outcomes.

\section*{Contraindications to Tocolysis ${ }^{\text {I }}$}

In a significant percentage of women in preterm labor, tocolysis may be contraindicated:
- Gestational hypertension with proteinuria or other medical indication
- Chorioamnionitis
- Mature fetus
- Imminent delivery
- Intrauterine fetal death or lethal fetal abnormality

\section*{Antenatal corticosteroid therapy '}

Dexamethasone and betamethasone cross the placenta and induce enzymes that accelerate fetal pulmonary maturity. It takes 48 hours after the first dose for the full benefit to be achieved.

Four doses of dexamethasone $(6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{M}) / 2$ hours apart are recommended for acceleration of fetal lung maturity. Alternatively, two doses of betamethasone ( 12 mg IM) 24 hours apart can be used.

Antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for women at risk of preterm birth from 24 weeks to 34 weeks of gestation when the following conditions are met: ${ }^{10}$
- Gestational age assessment can be accurately undertaken;
- Preterm birth is considered imminent;
- There is no clinical evidence of maternal infection;
- Adequate childbirth care is available (including the capacity to recognize and safely manage preterm labour and birth);
- The preterm newborn can receive adequate care if needed (including resuscitation, thermal care, feeding support, infection treatment and safe oxygen use).

\section*{Mode of delivery ${ }^{10}$}

\section*{Recommendation}

Routine delivery by caesarean section for the purpose of improving preterm newborn outcomes is not recommended, regardless of cephalic or breech presentation. Caesarean section should only be performed for obstetric indications. (Conditional recommendation based on very low-quality evidence).

Pertaining to the following interventions, there is no evidence of any benefit. However, there may not have been sufficient studies to evaluate the effectiveness of some of these interventions ${ }^{1,11}$ :
- Bed rest
- Fluid bolus
- Sedation, narcotics
- Home uterine activity monitoring

\section*{PRETERM BIRTH}

\section*{Definition}
- This is the birth that occurs between 24- and 37-weeks' gestation. In two-thirds of cases it occurs following spontaneous onset of labour. Only a minority of women who present with preterm contractions known as threatened premature labour (TPTL) progress to actual labour and delivery ${ }^{1}$
- Spontaneous preterm labor, a syndrome caused by multiple pathologic processes, contributes to about $70 \%$ of preterm deliveries ${ }^{2}$.
- The risk of preterm deliveries increases with low social-economic status. Countries with the highest rates of preterm deliveries also report that these deliveries occur in persons of lower socioeconomic status ${ }^{3}$.
- Preterm birth is the leading cause of mortality in children under the age of 5 with the incidence increasing in babies of lower gestational ages ${ }^{3}$.

\section*{Epidemiology}
- Yearly, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 completed weeks) with $60 \%$ of this happening in Africa and South Asia. ${ }^{3}$
- The rate of preterm births in countries analyzed in the WHO Global Action report ranged between $5-18 \%$ with Kenya having an estimated range of between $10-15 \% .^{3}$
- A study at the Kenyatta National Referral Hospital in Kenya in 2018 put the prevalence at the institution at $18.3 \% .^{4}$

\section*{Recommendations on preterm births/deliveries ${ }^{5}$}
- Deferring delivery to the 39th week is not recommended if there is a medical or obstetric indication for earlier delivery.
- Recommendations for the timing of delivery for a number of specific conditions (Table I)
- In the case of an anticipated late-preterm delivery a single course of antenatal betamethasone is recommended within 7 days of delivery in select women who have not received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids.
- However, a medically indicated late-preterm delivery should not be delayed for the administration of antenatal corticosteroids
- The decisions regarding delivery timing are complex and must take into account relative maternal and new-born risks, practice environment, and patient preferences.
- Secondly, late-preterm or early-term deliveries may be required for maternal benefit or new-born benefit, or both.
- In these cases, health care providers will need to weigh competing risks and benefits for the woman and her fetus and the support at the level of health facility adequate or referral mechanisms provided prior to delivery decision.

\section*{Mandatory Responsibility for health Care Providers}
- Prepare the mother and partner for the outcome of the pregnancy
- Prepare resuscitation equipment
- Prepare the environment and alert NBU

\section*{Classification and etiology of preterm labour ${ }^{3}$}

Preterm birth can be termed as a syndrome with a variety of causes which can be classified into two broad subtypes:
- Spontaneous preterm birth - spontaneous onset of labor or following pre-labor premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)
- Provider-initiated preterm birth - defined as induction of labor or elective caesarian birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation for maternal or fetal indications that could be urgent or discretionary or not related to any medical conditions

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Typo: & Risk Factors: & Examples: \\
\hline \multirow[t]{8}{*}{Spontaneous preterm birth:} & Age at pregnancy and pregnancy spacing & Adolescent pregnancy, advanced maternal age, or short interpregnancy interval \\
\hline & Multiple pregnancy & Increased rates of twin and higher order pregnancies with assisted reproduction \\
\hline & Infection & Urinary tract infections, malaria, HIV, syphilis, bacterial vaginosis, \\
\hline & Underlying maternal chronic medical conditions & Diabetes, hypertension, anaemia, asthma, thyroid disease \\

\end{tabular}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 28: Classifying and illustrating the contributors to preterm birth ${ }^{3}$}
\end{table}

Babies born preterm are further categorized based on their gestational age as follows: ${ }^{\mathbf{3}}$
- Extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks)
- Very preterm (28 to 32 weeks)
- Moderate to late preterm (32 to 37 weeks)

Other than the gestational age, babies can also be categorized based on their birth weight. For preterm births, birth weight is a big determinant on the kind and quality of care needed to ensure survival. This categorization is as follows: ${ }^{6}$
- Extreme Low Birth Weight ( $<1,000 \mathrm{~g}$ )
- Very Low Birth Weight $(<1,500 \mathrm{~g})$
- Low Birth Weight ( $<2,500 \mathrm{~g}$ )
- Normal Birth Weight ( $<4,000 \mathrm{~g}$ )
- High Birth Weight ( $>4,000 \mathrm{~g}$ )

\section*{Complications associated with preterm birth}

\section*{Neonatal risks ${ }^{3}$}
- Feeding difficulties in babies less than 34 weeks of gestation since the coordinated suck and swallow process only starts at 34weeks gestation.
- Severe infections are more common with increased chances of neonatal sepsis.
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to lung immaturity and lack of surfactant in the alveoli, resulting in collapsing lungs that take extra pressure to inflate.
- Jaundice is more common in premature babies since the immature liver cannot easily metabolize bilirubin.
- Brain injury in preterm babies is most commonly intra-ventricular hemorrhage.
- Necrotizing enterocolitis. Formula feeding increases the risk ten-fold compared to babies who are fed breast milk alone
- Retinopathy of prematurity due to abnormal proliferation of the blood vessels around the retina of the eye.
- Anemia of prematurity

\section*{Maternal risks ${ }^{3}$}
- Risk of preterm deliveries in subsequent pregnancies
- Mental distress
- Increased hospital stays

\section*{Preterm Birth in Multiple Gestation ${ }^{\mathbf{7}}$}

Twin pregnancies are associated with a three-fold greater perinatal mortality than singleton pregnancies. Prematurity is a main contributor, with $50 \%$ of twin pregnancies delivering before 37 weeks and $10 \%$ delivering before 32 weeks of gestation. The etiology of preterm delivery in twin pregnancies is likely multifactorial and different from that of singletons.

Cervical cerclage reduces preterm birth rates in singletons but has mixed results in twins with some studies showing harm.

The use of progesterone to prevent preterm birth in singletons has conflicting results and has not been proven to prevent preterm birth in twins.

Studies continue to determine whether the cervical pessary is effective in preventing preterm birth in multiple pregnancies.

There is a paucity of data available on the prevention of preterm birth in triplets/higher order multiples but similar principles to twin pregnancy apply

\section*{Care of the premature baby}

Care of the premature baby entails the following: ${ }^{3,8}$
- Essential and extra newborn care, especially feeding support
- Neonatal resuscitation
- Kangaroo Mother Care
- Chlorhexidine cord care
- Management of premature babies with complications, especially respiratory distress syndrome and infection
- Comprehensive neonatal intensive care, where capacity allows

\section*{Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)}

Kangaroo mother care is defined as care of preterm infants or infants weighing less than 2000 g carried skin-to-skin with the mother. It aims to promote the health and wellbeing of infants born preterm or at term. ${ }^{9}$

This method of care was developed in Colombia as an alternative method of care in resource poor settings for preterm infants who had no underlying medical condition and only needed to feed and grow. ${ }^{9}$

Kangaroo mother care can either be: ${ }^{9,10}$
- Continuous: This is the recommended modality of care, in which the baby is maintained on skin to skin contact with the mother full time except during times of feeding and cleaning.
- Intermittent care is recommended rather than conventional care in instances where continuous kangaroo care is not possible.

\section*{When to start kangaroo care:}

At birth, preterm babies and those small for gestational age are expected to have certain complications. These complications should be managed as per the institutions/ national guidelines and once clinically stable then kangaroo mother care can be initiated. However, in instances where no complications are present, kangaroo mother care can be initiated after birth. 9

Birth weight ranges are given as guides for initiation as follows:
- Babies weighing 1800 g or more at birth (gestational age $30-34$ weeks or more) may have some prematurity-related problems, such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This may raise serious concerns for a minority of those infants, who will require care in special units. In most cases, however, KMC can start soon after birth. ${ }^{9}$
- Babies with birth weight between 1200 and 1799g (gestational age 28-32 weeks), prematurity related complications are expected and therefore initial management in specialized units is needed and once the baby is stable, then kangaroo care can be initiated, usually after a week or more depending on the severity of the complications. ${ }^{9}$
- Babies weighing less than 1200 g (gestational age below 30 weeks) incur frequent and severe problems due to preterm birth: mortality is very high and only a small proportion survives prematurity-related problems. These babies benefit most from transfer before birth to an institution with neonatal intensive care facilities. It may take weeks before their condition allows initiation of KMC. ${ }^{9}$

\section*{When to wean the baby off kangaroo care ${ }^{9}$}

KMC tends to be used until the baby reaches term (gestational age around 40 weeks) or 2500 g . Around that time the baby also outgrows the need for KMC. Certain subtle signs from the baby indicate discomfort associated with skin to skin contact. At this point, it is recommended that the mother weans the baby off |KMC however; she can still use the method in instances of extreme cold temperatures.

\section*{Factors to consider when counselling the mother on KMC ${ }^{9}$}
- Willingness: the mother must be willing to provide KMC;
- Full-time availability to provide care: other family members can offer intermittent skin-toskin contact but they cannot breastfeed;
- General health: if the mother suffered complications during pregnancy or delivery or is otherwise ill, she should recover before initiating KMC;
- Adequate support systems

\section*{Advantages of kangaroo mother care. ${ }^{9,10}$}
- Early, continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the baby;
- Promotes exclusive breastfeeding
- Can be carried out at home
- Short hospital stays since babies pick up quickly
- It is a gentle, effective method that avoids the agitation routinely experienced in a busy ward with preterm infants.
- Can be done by any member of the family including the father. This is especially useful to assist the mother in taking breaks to rest.

\section*{MEDICAL DISORDERS IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy constitute one of the major direct causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.

\section*{Epidemiology}
- Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate up to $10 \%$ of pregnancies globally. They account for $12 \%$ of the direct causes of maternal mortality which includes obstetric hemorrhage $(25 \%)$, puerperal sepsis $(15 \%)$, unsafe abortion $(13 \%)$ and obstructed labor $(8 \%)$. 1, 3, 4, 15, 18
- Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy account for $26 \%$ of deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean and 9\% of deaths in Africa ${ }^{5}$
- Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia is a major contributor to prematurity. ${ }^{1,3}$
- Pre-eclampsia complicates $2 \%$ to $8 \%$ of all pregnancies, contributes to $15 \%$ of preterm deliveries, and between $9 \%$ to $26 \%$ of maternal deaths globally. ${ }^{\perp[5}$
- Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia related deaths can be avoided if women received timely and effective care, delivered according to evidence-based standards. ${ }^{\underline{1} \underline{3}}$

\section*{Definition}

Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg measured on 2 occasions and at least 4 hours apart ${ }^{1,4,7,8}$

\section*{Classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy}

There are 4 manifestations of hypertension in pregnancy $1,3,4,5,7,8,15,18$
- Chronic hypertension (both essential and secondary hypertension): Hypertension confirmed pre-conception or prior to 20 weeks gestation
- Gestational hypertension/Pregnancy induced hypertension: New onset hypertension arising after 20 weeks gestation in the absence of proteinuria and other systemic symptoms. It resolves generally within 3 months post-partum
- Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia: Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology characterized by elevated BP of $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or more with proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation in a previously normotensive and non-proteinuric woman.
- Pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension: Features of pre-eclampsia developing in a woman who had hypertension prior to conception

The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in pregnancy (ISSHP) in 2018 recommended inclusion of the following as part of the hypertension disease spectrum in pregnancy ${ }^{\underline{6,18}}$
- White coat hypertension: White-coat hypertension refers to elevated office/clinic blood pressure ( $\geq 140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), but normal blood pressure measured at home or work ( $<135 / 85 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ); it is not an entirely benign condition and conveys an increased risk for Pre-eclampsia
- Masked hypertension: Masked hypertension is more difficult to diagnose. Characterized by blood pressure that is normal at a clinic or office visit but elevated at other times and is typically diagnosed by 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or automated home BP monitoring.
- Transient gestational hypertension: Transient gestational hypertension arises in the second or third trimester. Usually detected in the clinic but settles with repeated BP readings. It differs from white-coat hypertension that, by definition, must be present from early pregnancy. It is associated with a $40 \%$ risk of developing true gestational hypertension or Pre-eclampsia in the remainder of the pregnancy, a fact that highlights the importance of carefully follow-up of such women.

Additionally, the following findings are indicative of Pre- eclampsia:
I. Proteinuria (i.e., $\geq 30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mol}$ protein: creatinine ratio; $\geq 300 \mathrm{mg} / 24$ hour; or $\geq 2+$ dipstick );
2. Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including: acute kidney injury (creatinine $\geq 90 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$; $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase $>40 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{L}$ ) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); or hematological complications (thrombocytopenia-platelet count $<150000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis);
3. Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth).

\section*{Classification of pre-eclampsia ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{7}, 8,18}$}

The current consensus is that pre-eclampsia should be classified as follows:
- Pre-eclampsia without severe features
- Pre-eclampsia with severe features

\section*{Subclassification of Pre-eclampsia includes:}
I. Early-onset PE (with delivery at < $34+0$ weeks of gestation);
2. Preterm PE (with delivery at < $37+0$ weeks of gestation);
3. Late-onset PE (with delivery at $\geq 34+0$ weeks of gestation);
4. Term PE (with delivery at $\geq 37+0$ weeks of gestation).

This sub-classification is not discrete but used to address maternal and perinatal morbidity/ mortality in relation to gestation.

\section*{Risk factors ${ }^{\underline{\mathbf{1}}, \underline{\mathbf{3}}, \underline{\mathbf{4}}, \underline{\mathbf{7}}, \underline{\mathbf{8}}, 18}$}

\section*{Maternal-specific risk factors}
- Extremes of age (maternal age <20 and>35 years)
- Black race: (In the United States, the incidence of Pre-eclampsia is $1.8 \%$ among white women and $3 \%$ in African Americans).
- Family history of Pre-eclampsia
- Nulliparity (more common in primigravidae)
- Pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancyChange of male partner
- Diabetes
- Obesity: Body weight is strongly correlated with progressively increased risk, ranging from $4.3 \%$ for women with a BMI $<20 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$ to $13.3 \%$ in those with a BMI $>35 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$.
- Chronic hypertension
- Renal disease
- Collagen vascular disease
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Periodontal disease
- Vitamin D deficiency: literature suggests that maternal vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of Pre-eclampsia and fetal grown restriction.
- Inherited thrombophilias
- Inter-pregnancy interval of > 10years

\section*{Pregnancy-associated risk factors}
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Hydatidiform mole
- Multiple pregnancy: Incidence is increased in twin gestations but is unaffected by their zygosity
- In-vitro fertilization, oocyte donation or donor insemination

\section*{Prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications}
- Preventive interventions may be started before 16 weeks gestation when most of the physiologic transformation of the uterine spiral arteries occurs or even before pregnancy ${ }^{8}$
- Pregnant women have been classified as "low" or "high" risk of pre-eclampsia by presence or absence of one or more risk factors (family history, previous history of pre-eclampsia, chronic diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension) ${ }^{8}$
- There is strong evidence that low risk women who may have low dietary intake of calcium $(600 \mathrm{mg} /$ day $)$ may benefit from calcium supplementation of at least Ig/day, orally ${ }^{8}$
- Vitamin D may play a protective role against pre-eclampsia through beneficial effects on immune modulation and vascular function ${ }^{8}$
- High risk women are recommended to take calcium supplementation of at least Ig/day if intake is low ${ }^{8}$
- A screening guide for first trimester for pre- eclampsia using the following can be offered:
- Mean arterial pressure
- Biomarkers - placental growth factor, pregnancy associated plasma protein A
- Uterine artery pulsatility index
- Combination of these above risk assessment tests

NOTE: With first- trimester screening and assessment for preterm PE, women identified at high risk should receive aspirin prophylaxis commencing at $I I$ to $14+6$ weeks of gestation at a dose of $\sim 150 \mathrm{mg}$ to be taken every night until either 36 weeks of gestation, when delivery occurs, or when PE is diagnosed.?

\section*{Pre-eclampsia with severe features $2, \underline{7,8,18}$}
- Systolic BP greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP more than or equal to 110 mm Hg
- Proteinuria equal to or greater than 3 gm per 24 hour urine collection or the equivalent in a test strip
- Serum creatinine $>1.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Thrombocytopenia less than $150000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$
- Lactate Dehydrogenase equal to or more than 600 IU
- Elevated serum transaminase levels (ALT, AST)
- Persistent headache
- Visual disturbances-scotomas/blurring of vision
- Right upper quadrant pain
- Epigastric pain
- Intrauterine growth restriction of the fetus
- Oligohydramnios
- Oliguria less than 500 ml in 24 hours
- Pulmonary edema

\section*{Diagnostic criteria of pre-eclampsia ${ }^{\text {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, } 18}$}

In the absence of proteinuria, new onset hypertension with the following may be diagnostic of pre-eclampsia

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Thrombocytopenia & Platelet count $<100,000 / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ \\
\hline Renal insufficiency & Serum creatinine concentration $>1.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ or doubling of serum creatinine in absence of other renal disease \\
\hline Impaired liver function & Elevation of transaminase levels to more than twice the normal levels \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Pulmonary edema} \\
\hline Cerebral/visual symptoms & Severe headache, blurring of vision \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

NOTE: Proteinuria is not mandatory for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia ${ }^{\underline{7}}$
Some degree of edema is normal in pregnancy. However, gradual or sudden swelling of the face, hands and legs is strongly suggestive of pre-eclampsia. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Investigations for fetal assessment}
- Cardiotocograph (CTG) if greater than 24weeks gestation
- Ultrasound scan for assessment of:
- Fetal growth
- Amniotic fluid volume (AFV) or deepest vertical pocket (DVP)
- Umbilical artery flow (Doppler)
- Follow-up to assess fetal growth velocity

\section*{Severe complications of pre-eclampsia ${ }^{\text {1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 6, 7, }} 8$}
- Eclampsia
- HELLP syndrome
- Cerebral hemorrhage
- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
- Reversible Cerebral vaso-constriction Syndrome
- Intra uterine growth restriction and fetal compromise
- Renal failure
- Placenta abruptio

\section*{Eclampsia}

Defined as occurrence of one or more generalized tonic clone seizures superimposed on pre-eclampsia. Seizures may occur ante-partum, intra-partum or post-partum usually within 24 hours of delivery. ${ }^{1,4,8}$
- Imminent eclampsia is defined in the Magpie trial as at least 2 of the following: frontal headache, visual disturbances, altered sensorium, hyper-reflexia, epigastric tenderness. ${ }^{4}$
- A common finding in eclampsia is posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Vasogenic edema in the posterior cerebral circulation, a finding also seen in hypertensive encephalopathy. ${ }^{5}$
- The hypertension associated with eclampsia and PRES is often less severe than in nonpregnant hypertensive encephalopathy, and it is possible that the endothelial damage associated with Pre-eclampsia predisposes to this syndrome even at lower blood pressure 5

\section*{HELLP syndrome}

HELLP syndrome describes a constellation of Hemolysis (anemia with blood film evidence of hemolysis), Elevated Liver enzymes showing hepatic dysfunction (transaminases greater than twice the normal range), and Low Platelets (platelet count of less than 150,000/dl). ${ }^{5}$

HELLP is associated with maternal mortality and severe morbidity including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, liver hematoma, liver failure, and renal failure ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Pulmonary edema}

Hypoalbuminemia leads to reduced oncotic pressure and relative intravascular volume depletion with significant interstitial fluid. Women with Pre-eclampsia are thus much more vulnerable to pulmonary edema, especially those with significant renal impairment. For this reason, careful fluid management is critical in all women with Pre-eclampsia, and pulmonary edema secondary to iatrogenic fluid overload is a cause of maternal mortality in Pre-eclampsia ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Treatment of Patients with Pre-Eclampsia/}

\section*{Eclampsia. ${ }^{\mathbf{1}}, \mathbf{2}, \mathbf{3}, \mathbf{4}, \mathbf{5}, \boldsymbol{6}, \mathbf{7}, \mathbf{8}$}

\section*{General principles:}
- BP control
- The goal is to lower BP to prevent cerebrovascular and cardiac complications while maintaining utero-placental blood flow.
- Antihypertensive treatment is indicated for diastolic blood pressure above 110 mm Hg and systolic pressure above 160 mm Hg
- Patients with pre-eclampsia with severe features who have BP below $160 / 110 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ may benefit from antihypertensive drugs because of the possibility of unpredictable acceleration of the disease and sudden increases in blood pressure
- The goal is to maintain diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 100 mm Hg and systolic pressure between 130 and 150 mm Hg . Target rate of lowering the acutely elevated BP
- First-line medications are labetalol 100 mg BD, given orally or IV; nifedipine 20 mg OD, given orally or IV; or IV hydralazine 25 mg BD. (Atenolol, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics should be avoided).

The goals of antenatal care in the presence of hypertension include control BP, recognize Preeclampsia early, prevent eclampsia, and optimize birth for both the woman and her baby.

\section*{Moderately elevated BP}

- Control of seizures
- The basic principles of airway, breathing, circulation (the ABCs) should always be followed as a general principle of seizure management.
- Active seizures should be treated with intravenous magnesium sulphate as a first-line agent.
- Prophylactic treatment with magnesium sulphate is indicated for all patients with Preeclampsia with severe features
- Magnesium levels, respiratory rate, reflexes, and urine output must be monitored to detect magnesium toxicity. Magnesium sulphate is mostly excreted in the urine, and therefore urine output needs to be closely monitored. If urine output falls below $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$, the magnesium infusion should be stopped.
- There is a risk of seizures following delivery since up to $44 \%$ of eclampsia cases have been reported to occur post-partum. This risk is especially elevated 48 hours postpartum, but it can occur at any time up to 4 weeks after delivery.
- For seizure refractory to magnesium sulphate therapy or with acute kidney injury, benzodiazepines and/or phenytoin may be considered.

\section*{Magnesium Sulphate Preparation and Regimen 9,10,16,17, 18}

\section*{MgSO4 dosing and monitoring checklist ${ }^{10}$}

\section*{Preparation of $\mathbf{4 g} \mathbf{2 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ solution of magnesium sulfate (mgso4) from $\mathbf{5 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ ampule}
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and running water or use $70 \%$ alcohol hand rub and air dry.
- Using a $20-\mathrm{mL}$ syringe, draw 12 mL of sterile water for injection.
- If $50 \% \mathrm{MgSO} 4$. is available, add 8 mL of $\mathrm{MgSO} 450 \%$ solution* to 12 mL of water for injection to make 20 mL of $20 \%$ solution ( 4 g per 20 mL ).
- If the concentration is different, correctly mix 4 gm of MgSO 4 . * vial containing ( $\mathrm{Ig} / 2 \mathrm{~mL}$ )

\section*{Calculation of the drug}
- x "\% of Magnesium sulphate contains " x " gm in 100 ml
- I ampoule contains $50 \%$ of 2 ml Magnesium sulphate
- I ampoule contains 1 gm of Magnesium sulphate in 2 ml
- 4 ampoule provides 4 gm of Magnesium sulphate in 8 ml
- To prepare $20 \%$ of 4 gm Magnesium sulphate, " $y$ " ml of Normal saline (NS) must be added:
- $20 \mathrm{gm} / 100 \mathrm{ml}=4 \mathrm{gm} /(8 \mathrm{ml}+$ "y" ml$)$
- $8+" y "=20$
- $" y "=12$

Mg SO 4 regimens include:
- Zuspan regimen is a treatment regimen using Magnesium sulphate for the treatment of eclampsia via the intravenous route

- Inject the drug from the 2 nd syringe deep IM injection into the other buttock $(5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{MgSO} 4)$

\section*{Monitoring for signs of toxicity "}
- Count respiration rate for $I$ minute every hour. The rate should be $\geq 16$.
- Patella reflexes should be present. Check every hour: - Place one hand under woman's knee and lift leg off bed. - Tap patellar tendon just below kneecap with a reflex hammer.
- Insert an indwelling urinary catheter and measure urinary output hourly. Output should be $\geq 30 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour

\section*{Administration of maintenance dose of MgSO4 ${ }^{\text {II }}$}

Before repeating administration of MgSO 4 , check that:
- Respiratory rate is at least 16 per minute.
- Patellar reflexes are present.
- Urinary output is at least 30 mL per hour over 4 hours.

Give 5 grams of $\mathrm{MgSO} 450 \%$ solution, together with 1 mL of $2 \%$ lignocaine in the same syringe, by deep IM injection into alternate buttocks (every 4 hours).

WITHHOLD or DELAY drug if:
- Respiratory rate falls below 16 per minute. -
- Patellar reflexes are absent. -
- Urinary output has fallen below 30 mL per hour over the preceding 4 hours.

In case of respiratory arrest:
- Shout for help!
- Assist ventilation with mask and bag.
- Give calcium gluconate Ig ( 10 mL of $10 \%$ solution) IV slowly.

\section*{Monitoring Hourly for Magnesium Sulphate toxicity:}

Suspend or postpone use of Magnesium sulphate, if any of the following is present:
- Respiratory rate $<16 / \min$ (Respiratory depression)
- Absent patellar reflex (Muscle paresis)
- Urine output $<30 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour in preceding 4 hours (lmpaired renal function)

Note: Loss of patellar reflex is the Ist sign of Magnesium toxicity.
- The therapeutic level of serum magnesium is $4-7 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{I}$. Serum levels of Magnesium toxicity:
- $8-12 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{I}$ : Loss of patellar reflex, flushing, warmth, somnolence, slurred speech
- $15-17 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{I}$ : Muscular paralysis, Respiratory difficulty
- $30-35 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{I}$ : Cardiac arrest

\section*{Management of Magnesium Sulphate toxicity:}

If urine output $<30 \mathrm{ml} /$ hour:
- MgSO 4 withheld
- IV Ringers lactate infusion I litre over 8 hours
- Monitor for pulmonary oedema

If respiratory arrest occurs:
- Perform assisted ventilation
- Antidote: Calcium gluconate 1 gm ( $10 \%$ of 10 ml ) IV slowly over 10 minutes

\section*{Contraindication of Magnesium Sulphate:}
- Myasthenia gravis
- Impaired renal function

\section*{Other Magnesium Sulphate regimens: ${ }^{16}$}
- High dose regimens (Loading dose $>10 \mathrm{gm}$ ): Pritchard, Lucas
- Low dose regimens (Loading dose < 10 gm): Zuspan or Sibai, Suman sardesai

Loading dose: 4-6 gm IV over 15-20 minutes
Maintenance dose: I-2 gm/hr IV infusion
- Single dose regimen: VIMS regimen

Single doses of 4 g diluted $50 \%$ Mgso4 intravenously, with simultaneous $4 \mathrm{~g} 50 \% \mathrm{MgSo} 4$ intramuscularly.

Note: Researches have found that the Zuspan regimen is up to 8 times less effective than the Pritchard regimen in preventing convulsions in severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The 'VIMS' regimen can be used at First Referral Units, before shifting the patients to tertiary care centres. This approach has special implications in the developing countries, especially at the primary care level, where the standard obstetric care is not widely available. ${ }^{12}$

\section*{Phenytoin ${ }^{6}$}

Phenytoin has been used successfully in eclamptic seizures, but cardiac monitoring is required due to associated bradycardia and hypotension.

Central anticonvulsant effect of phenytoin is by stabilizing neuronal activity by decreasing the ion flux across depolarizing membranes.

Some benefits to using phenytoin are:
- It can be continued orally for several days until the risk of eclamptic seizures has subsided,
- It has established therapeutic levels that are easily tested,
- It has no known neonatal adverse effects are associated with short-term usage.

Dosage: $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose infused IV no faster than $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, followed by maintenance dose started 2 hours later at $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$

\section*{Fluid management}
- Despite the peripheral edema, patients with Pre-eclampsia are intravascularly volume depleted with high peripheral vascular resistance. Diuretics should be avoided.
- Aggressive volume resuscitation may lead to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema occurs most frequently 48-72hours post-partum, probably due to mobilization of extravascular fluid.
- Volume expansion has no demonstrated benefit, patients should be fluid restricted when possible, at least until the period of postpartum diuresis. Total fluids should generally be limited to $80 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{h}$ or $1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$.
- Careful measurement of fluid input and output is advisable, particularly in the immediate postpartum period. Many patients will have a brief (up to 6 h ) period of oliguria following delivery; this should be anticipated and not overcorrected.
- If fluids are required, preferably use Ringer's Lactate or Normal saline at a rate of $80 \mathrm{mls} /$ hour or $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$. Avoid using Dextrose or Dextrose- Saline infusion

\section*{Delivery}
- Delivery is the definitive treatment for antepartum Pre-eclampsia.
- Patients with mild Pre-eclampsia are often induced after 37 weeks' gestation. Prior to this, the immature fetus is treated with expectant management with corticosteroids to accelerate lung maturity in preparation for early delivery.
- In patients with severe Pre-eclampsia, induction of delivery should be considered after 34 weeks' gestation. In these cases, the severity of disease must be weighed against the risks of prematurity.
- Eclampsia is common after delivery and has occurred up to 6 weeks after delivery. Patients at risk for eclampsia should be carefully monitored postpartum.

\section*{Indications for delivery:}

Non-Reassuring Fetal Status, severe fetal growth restriction, gestational age>/=37weeks, eclampsia, placental abruption, acute pulmonary edema, deteriorating platelet count, persistent neurological symptoms, persistent epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.

\section*{Medication}
- Magnesium sulphate is the first-line treatment of prevention of primary and recurrent eclamptic seizures.
- Evidence has also shown that magnesium sulphate has a neuroprotective role in preventing cerebral palsy following preterm birth
- For eclamptic seizures refractory to magnesium sulphate, Diazepam and phenytoin may be used as second-line agents
- In the setting of severe hypertension (systolic BP, $>160 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$; diastolic BP, $>110 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), antihypertensive treatment is recommended. Antihypertensive treatment decreases the incidence of cerebrovascular problems but does not alter the progression of Pre-eclampsia.

Labetalol: Initially 20 mg IV bolus over 2 mins . Repeated doses $40-80 \mathrm{mg}$ IV every 10 mins to max of 300 mg if required

\section*{BIRTH}

Continue close fetal monitoring

Stabilize mother prior to birth

Ergometrine should not be used in both pre-eclampsia and eclampsia

\section*{HYPERGLYCAEMIA/DIABETES IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy is increasingly becoming a public health concern due to the increase in prevalence of non-communicable diseases. This is aggravated by: increasing maternal ages with pregnancy, lifestyles that include poor nutritional choices and sedentary habits, assisted reproductive technology that predisposes to multiple pregnancies with a higher risk of metabolic syndromes. ${ }^{1,9}$

\section*{Epidemiology ${ }^{\text {1, 3, } \text { 9 }}$}
- One in six live births occurs to women with some form of hyperglycaemia. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that diabetes affects about 415 million people globally, which is projected to increase to 642 million people by 2040.
- There is an equally high burden of pre-diabetes-approximately 318 million are estimated to have pre-diabetes, which is likely to increase to about 481 million by 2040 . There are currently over 199 million women living with diabetes and this is projected to increase to 313 million by 2040.More than one-third of people with diabetes and a majority of people with pre-diabetes remain undiagnosed and unaware.
- Overweight and obesity, which increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, are also on the rise globally. According to WHO data, in 2014 more than half of the world's adult population was overweight $(39 \%)$ and 41 million children under the age of 5 were obese (13\%). The high levels of overweight and obesity in the adult population including women in the reproductive age (estimated 42 million pregnant women) has important ramification for the future burden of HIP, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. ${ }^{3}$
- In Africa, diabetes was essentially unknown in 1901, yet in 2013, 19.8 million people were reportedly living with the condition and this number gestational diabetes is estimated to complicate $\mathrm{I}-14 \%$ of pregnancies with mild degrees of glucose intolerance being even higher $(4-7 \%)$ predicted to increase to 41.5 million in 2035.4 Prevalence of gestational diabetes is higher in African than white women.

In Kenya, there is paucity of data in relation to hyperglycaemia in pregnancy

\section*{Definition}

Diabetes Mellitus: is a clinical syndrome characterized by a deficiency of or insensitivity to insulin and exposure of organs to chronic hyperglycaemia.

Gestational diabetes Mellitus: Is any degree of glucose intolerance with first recognition during pregnancy.

\section*{Aetiology}

Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes that occur in all women during pregnancy.

Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy differs from GDM in that the hyperglycaemia is more severe and does not resolve after pregnancy as it does with GDM.

Increased levels of placental hormones interfere with the ability of insulin to manage glucose. This condition is called "insulin resistance." Usually, the mother's pancreas is able to produce more insulin (about three times the normal amount) to overcome insulin resistance. If this does not occur, glucose levels will rise, resulting in gestational diabetes. Usually, blood glucose levels return to normal after childbirth.

\section*{Risk factors ${ }^{\mathbf{1} \boldsymbol{,} \mathbf{9}}$}

Women with risk factors for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy should be screened or tested at first contact. Some of these risk factors include: ${ }^{1}$
- Pre-pregnancy BMI >30;
- Previous macrosomia (baby with birth weight $\geq 4000 \mathrm{~g}$ );
- Previous hyperglycaemia in pregnancy;
- Age $\geq 35$ years; Asian, Indian subcontinent, Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Pacific Islander, Maori, Middle Eastern, non-white African ethnic background;
- Family history of first degree relative with diabetes or a sister with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, PCOS etc.
- History of stillbirths
- The baby born from a previous pregnancy showing any complications known to be associated as arising from maternal GDM
- History of infants with congenital abnormalities
- Poor obstetric history including recurrent pregnancy loss, hypertension, eclampsia, polyhydramnios
- History of recurrent or persistent urinary tract infection
- Glycosuria manifesting during pregnancy

\section*{Recommendations}
- Pregnant women at high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus based on multiple risk factors, should be screened at first contact and repeated at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation if initially normal. If for any reason it was missed or if there is a clinical suspicion of later onset of gestational diabetes, a screening or diagnostic test should be performed. (II-2B)
- Universal screening should be offered to all pregnant women at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.
- Women with pre-existing or gestational diabetes mellitus should be provided with care by a multidisciplinary team aimed at attaining and then maintaining euglycemia (II-2B)
- For patients with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus, baseline sonographic assessment of foetal growth and amniotic fluid volume is recommended starting at 28 weeks' gestation, with subsequent serial assessment of foetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, every 2 to 4 weeks, to assess the effect of maternal glycaemic control on foetal growth rate and amniotic fluid volume. (II-2B).
- Initiation of weekly assessment of foetal well-being at 36 weeks is recommended in pregestational diabetes mellitus and medically treated gestational diabetes mellitus. It is also reasonable to consider weekly foetal assessment for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus beginning at 36 weeks. Acceptable methods of assessment of foetal wellbeing near term can include the non-stress test, non-stress test + amniotic fluid index, biophysical profile, or a combination of these. (III-A)
- If comorbid factors are present, such as obesity, evidence of suboptimal glycaemic control, large for gestational age (> 90\%), previous stillbirth, hypertension, or small for gestational age (< $10 \%$ ), earlier onset and/or more frequent foetal health surveillance is recommended. In specific cases in which foetal growth restriction is suspected, the addition of umbilical artery and foetal middle cerebral artery Doppler assessment may be helpful. (II-2A).
- Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus or pre-gestational diabetes mellitus should be offered induction between 38 to 40 weeks' gestation depending on their glycaemic control and other comorbidity factors. (II-2B) Should be induced at 38-39 weeks' gestation, guided by clinical practice, experience and country context.
- The administration of betamethasone or dexamethasone to pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be restricted to the routine obstetric indications related to the risk of preterm and late preterm delivery between 24 to 36 weeks' gestation, when clinically indicated. When administered, close maternal glycaemic surveillance is recommended. (I-A).
- If not previously done, in women with threatened preterm labour requiring betamethasone, screening for gestational diabetes mellitus should be performed either before or at least 7 days after the administration of betamethasone. (III-B).
- Women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be offered testing with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum to detect prediabetes and diabetes. I (II-2A).
- Breastfeeding is strongly recommended after delivery for all women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus. (II-2A)
- The adverse outcomes associated with diabetes in pregnancy are substantially associated with hyperglycemia and the coexisting metabolic environment. Women with preexisting diabetes should receive preconception care to optimize blood sugar control and other comorbidities. Outcomes for the fetus/neonate and the mother in both pre-gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies are improved by multidisciplinary management in which the goal is achieving optimal blood sugar control and appropriate fetal surveillance. (II-2)
- Retrospective studies indicate that women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of stillbirth before 40 weeks' gestation compared with the general obstetrical population. Similarly, large recent cohort and simulation studies of women with gestational
diabetes mellitus pregnancies also indicate a higher risk of stillbirth between 36 to 39 weeks' gestation. (II-2)
- Women with gestational diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of Pre-eclampsia, shoulder dystocia, Caesarean section, and large for gestational age infants. (II-2)
- The occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future for the mother. (II-2)

\section*{Prevention}

Considering the trend towards the epidemic of obesity, a substantial burden of GDM is anticipated in Africa ${ }^{1,2,9}$.

\section*{Prevention measures include:}
- Weight reduction for overweight and obese women
- Closer attention to women having a family history of DM including early screening for women with a history of the previous GDM is strongly recommended to mitigate the burden.
- Long-term chronic care

\section*{Pre-conception care ${ }^{3}$}
- Women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant should be informed that establishing good glycaemic control before conception and continuing this throughout pregnancy will reduce the risk of miscarriage, congenital malformation, stillbirth and neonatal death. It is important to explain that risks can be reduced but not eliminated.
- The importance of avoiding unplanned pregnancy should be an essential component of diabetes education from adolescence for women with diabetes. Women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant should be offered pre-conception care and advice before discontinuing contraception.

\section*{Information and advice should include the following:}
- The role of diet, body weight and exercise
- The risks of hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia unawareness during pregnancy
- How nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can affect glycaemic control
- The increased risk of having a baby who is large for gestational age, which increases the likelihood of birth trauma, induction of labour and caesarean section
- The need for assessment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy before and during pregnancy
- The importance of maternal glycaemic control during labour and birth and early feeding of the baby in order to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia
- The possibility of transient morbidity in the baby during the neonatal period, which may require admission to the neonatal unit
- The risk of the baby developing obesity and/or diabetes in later life.
- Taking folic acid supplements ( $5 \mathrm{mg} /$ day ) from pre-conception until 12 weeks of gestation
- Review of, and possible changes to, medication, glycaemic targets and self-monitoring routine
- Frequency of appointments and local support, including emergency telephone numbers/contacts.

\section*{Provide/offer the following:}
- Blood glucose meter for self-monitoring
- Ketone testing strips to women with type I diabetes and advice on use if hyperglycaemic or unwell
- Diabetes structured education program
- Offer monthly HbAI c. Advise women to aim for an HbAI c below 6.1 \%. Inform women that
- Any reduction in HbAIc may reduce risks. Advise women with HbAIc above $10 \%$ to avoid pregnancy.

\section*{Antenatal care ${ }^{3}$}

The following should be observed on top of the routine ANC care. Note that diabetic patients will require more ANC visits.

Before or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed:
- Stop oral hypoglycaemic agents, apart from metformin ${ }^{2}$, and commence insulin if required
- Stop angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and consider alternative antihypertensive
- If it is safely achievable, women with diabetes should aim to keep fasting blood glucose between 3.5 and 5.9 mmol /litre and I-hour postprandial blood glucose below 7.8 mmol /litre during pregnancy.
- Diabetics have triple the normal rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Therefore, a urine culture is obtained initially, and appropriate treatment initiated if it is positive. After cessation of therapy, urinary culture is again obtained to confirm the elimination of the infection.
- Protein detected in clean-catch urine specimens should be evaluated by 24 -hour urine testing and repeated as needed.
- In addition to routine prenatal care, the development of oedema (including carpal tunnel syndrome) is closely monitored. If oedema occurs, greater attention to glucose control (e.g. returning to daily monitoring) and enhanced bed rest are necessities.
- Clinical/ultrasound assessment of foetal growth should be routinely carried out. In addition, women with diabetes should be offered an antenatal examination of the four-chamber view of the foetal heart and outflow tracts at 18-20 weeks.
- Weekly NSTs (from 32 weeks' gestation) is recommended in patients with insulin-requiring gestational diabetes, with an increase to biweekly recommend after 36 weeks as well as the addition of AFI evaluation. For diet-controlled gestational diabetics, weekly NSTs are usually begun at 36 weeks.
- All patients should be instructed to make daily assessments of foetal movements and to alert the physician if a decrease is noted.
- A biophysical profile should be done if decreased movement is noted or if a nonreactive NST occurs.
- During pregnancy, women who are suspected of having ketoacidosis should be admitted immediately for critical care, where they can receive both medical and obstetric care.
- In the case of abnormal foetal testing, the practitioner should assess gestational age and, if the foetus is found to be mature, delivery should be expedited. If the foetus is intermediate in maturity, amniotic fluid assessment for pulmonary maturity may assist in the decision regarding whether delivery should be effected. Lung maturity should also be assessed before elective induction if glucose control is questionable or if the foetus is less than 38 weeks unless foetal jeopardy is suspected. The lecithin: sphingomyelin ratio should be 2.5 or higher due to the higher incidence of respiratory distress in the foetus. If the foetus is immature, further testing such as contraction stress tests or hospitalization with continuous foetal heart rate monitoring is advised.
- Preterm labour is increased in patients with diabetes, and they should be treated with magnesium sulphate as the initial tocolytic agent because the beta mimetic markedly influences glucose control. Corticosteroids increase maternal glucose levels, and therapy should be prescribed to keep levels in the desired range. This therapy may consist of continuous insulin infusion in certain cases.
- Induction of labour is recommended at 38 weeks in patients with poor glucose control and macrosomia. Use of Prostaglandin to ripen the cervix reduces the caesarean section rate,
but is not advised without a negative contraction stress test if oligohydramnios is the indication for induction.

Screening for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy

\section*{GDM Diagnosis: Two Approaches}

\end{figure}
- Unrestricted diet and unlimited physical activity at least 3 days prior to the OGTT
- The patient should fast for 8 hours before the OGTT, no fasting before the GCT

\section*{Diagnosis and Classification}

Recommendation A: Hyperglycaemia first detected at any time during pregnancy should be classified as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or diabetes mellitus in pregnancy according to WHO criteria. ${ }^{1,4}$

\section*{Classification and Diagnosis Pathway}

\begin{figure}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While this is the optimal recommendation, alternatives are given in acknowledgement of limitations faced in diverse settings. Pragmatic guidelines for testing, diagnosis and management must be based on a country's available finances, human resources and infrastructure.'

\section*{Glucose Measurements}

Blood glucose control can be evaluated in one of three ways:
I. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc)
2. Self-monitoring of blood glucose
3. Continuous glucose monitoring.

\section*{Glycosylated haemoglobin}

This test reflects the average glucose level in the three months prior to measurement. It is correlated with the risk of congenital malformations, not to any other adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is best used for pregnancy planning and prenatal follow-up in cases of diabetes in pregnancy. HbAIc does not replace the OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM. However, in women with GDM, HbAIc may be used to verify the reliability of their self-monitored glucose reports.

\section*{Self-monitoring of blood glucose}

Self-monitoring of capillary glucose is achieved by multiple daily measurements of capillary blood glucose with a handheld glucometer. It only provides glucose values at the time of measurement and misses in between hyper/hypoglycaemic events.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended for all pregnant women with diabetes, $3-4$ times a day:
- Fasting: once daily, following at least 8 hours of overnight All fasting
- Postprandial: 2-3 times daily, I or 2 hours after the onset of meals, rotating meals on different days of the wee
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended for all
Low pregnant women with diabetes at least once daily, with documented relation to timing of meal

\section*{Continuous glucose monitoring}

The device consists of a subcutaneous enzymatic sensor attached to a non-implanted transmitter that sends readings to a receiver and provides numerous automated readings of interstitial tissue glucose, calibrated to reflect plasma glucose. The continuous measurement enables detection of virtually all glucose fluctuations and helps modify treatment. Continuous glucose monitoring may help achieve a small HbAIc reduction in a non-pregnant population. It can detect high postprandial blood glucose levels and nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

Treatment should include: ${ }^{\text {1,9 }}$
I. Self-monitoring of blood glucose for all pregnant women with DM
2. Non-Medical interventions e.g. lifestyle change, \& Medical interventions
3. ANC with DM-trained Healthcare provider

\section*{Prenatal supervision}

There is no evidence to support a particular universal protocol of prenatal care and monitoring for women with diabetes.

\section*{Non-pharmacological modalities}

Recommendations for nutrition therapy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & Resource Setting \\
\hline We recommend that the following principles should be adhered for all pregnant women with diabetes: & ALL \\
\hline - Design an appropriate diet with respect to pre-pregnancy BMI, desired body weight, physical activity, habits, and personal and cultural preferences. & \\
\hline - Provide routine follow-up and diet adjustments throughout pregnancy to achieve and maintain treatment goals. & \\
\hline - Offer training, education, support, and follow-up by a qualified dietician experienced in care of women with diabetes. Issues for discussion include: weight control, food records, carbohydrate counting, prevention of hypoglycaemia, healthy foods, and physical activity. & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

We suggest that caloric intake be calculated based on pre-pregnancy BMI and desirable weight gain as follows:
- $35-40 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ desirable body weight for underweight women
- $30-35 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ desirable body weight for normal weight women
- $25-30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ desirable body weight for overweight women

We recommend limiting carbohydrate intake to $35 \%-45 \%$ of total calories, with a minimum of 175 g carbohydrate per day, distributed in three small-to-moderate sized meals and $2-4$ snacks.

\section*{Recommendations for physical activity in women with gestational diabetes mellitus}

We suggest that appropriate, personally adapted, physical activity be recommended for all women with diabetes:
- Planned physical activity of $30 \mathrm{~min} /$ day
- Brisk walking or arm exercises while seated in a chair for 10 min after each meal.
- Women physically active prior to pregnancy should be encouraged to continue their previous exercise routine.

\section*{Pharmacological modalities}

\section*{Recommendations}

Resource Setting

Insulin, glyburide, and metformin are safe and effective therapies for GDM
High during the second and third trimesters, and may be initiated as first-line treatment after failing to achieve glucose control with lifestyle modification. Among OADs, metformin may be a better choice than glyburide. Insulin should be considered as the first-line treatment in women with GDM who are at high risk of failing on OAD therapy, including some of the following factors:
- Diagnosis of diabetes $<20$ weeks of gestation
- Need for pharmacologic therapy $>30$ weeks
- Fasting plasma glucose levels $>110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$
- I-hour postprandial glucose $>140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Pregnancy weight gain $>12 \mathrm{~kg}$

\section*{Insulin treatment in women with gestational diabetes mellitus}

Recommendations
Resource Setting
The following insulins may be considered safe and effective treatment during
All pregnancy: regular insulin, NPH, lispro, aspart and determine

\section*{Targets of therapy}

The main goal for treatment of GDM is to prevent adverse effects on the mother and foetus; the most important and proven factor to achieve this goal is the reduction of glucose levels without undue hypoglycaemia. This should be achieved throughout pregnancy and during labour
and delivery. Attempts must be made to achieve glucose levels as close as possible to those seen in normal pregnancy.

Recommendations for glycaemic targets for gestational diabetes mellitus
Recommendations
Resource Setting
Targets for glucose control during pregnancy:
- Fasting glucose $<5.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(95 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl})$
- I-hour postprandial $<7.8 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl})$

All
- 2-hour postprandial $<6.7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d})$

Educate to recognize and treat signs of hypoglycaemia:
- Ingest 15 g of simple carbohydrate (sugar, rapidly absorbed

All tablets, sweetened liquids)

Teach family members how to use the glucometer
Target for glucose control during labour and delivery:
All
- $4-7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(72-126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl})$

\section*{Timing and mode of delivery}

Maternal hyperglycaemia and macrosomia are associated with increased risk of intrauterine foetal death and other adverse outcomes. Therefore, induction of labour may be considered at 38-39 weeks, although there is no good-quality evidence to support such an approach.

Given the significantly greater risk of shoulder dystocia at any birthweight above 3750 g for babies of women with diabetes, consideration may be given to elective caesarean delivery when the best estimate of foetal weight exceeds 4000 g

\section*{DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

DKA in pregnancy is a significant complication of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. It is caused by a relative or absolute insulin deficiency and simultaneous increase in counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon and growth hormone)"

DKA occurs more commonly in Type I DM, but can also be observed in patients with Type II DM and GDM ${ }^{12}$. DKA may be the first presentation of Diabetes in pregnancy ${ }^{12}$.

\section*{DKA Pathogenesis}

Insulin deficiency results in decrease in glucose uptake by peripheral tissues accompanied by significant metabolic changes including, proteolysis, increased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis resulting in hyperglycemia as well as lipolysis which fuels hepatic ketogenesis with subsequent ketoacidosis. ${ }^{\boldsymbol{1}}$

There are 3 major pathophysiologic syndromes associated with hyperglycemia in DKA;
- Metabolic acidosis
- Osmotic diuresis
- Electrolyte disturbance

A patient's susceptibility to metabolic acidosis is increased by;
- Ketone production
- Severe dehydration from osmotic diuresis
- Electrolyte disturbances

Flowchart adopted from the Manual of Medicine

\section*{Precipitating factors for DKA}
- Protracted vomiting
- Hyperemesis gravidarum
- Infections
- Insulin non-compliance
- Medications precipitating DKA
- Insulin pump failure
- Conditions such as gastroparesis

\section*{Signs and symptoms of DKA}
- Nausea or vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Polyuria or polydipsia
- Blurred vision
- Muscle weakness
- Drowsiness
- Lethargy
- Change in mental status
- Hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing)/pear drop odour
- Tachypnoea
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Coma
- Shock
- Abnormal fetal heart tracing

\section*{Investigation for DKA}
- Positive serum or urine ketones
- Lab glucose hyperglycemia ( $\geq 11.0 \mathrm{mmol}$ ), but DKP can develop at lower glucose levels
- Low serum bicarbonate (< $15 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{l}$ )
- Arterial $\mathrm{pH} \leq 7.30$
- Anion gap > 12
- Elevated base deficit $\geq 4 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{l}$
- Potassium (K+) level may be falsely normal / elevated

\section*{Anion gap calculation}
$$\text { Anion gap }=\left(\mathrm{NA}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{NaCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$$

\section*{Base excess or deficit calculation}
- A means of quantifying $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$-levels
- Base excess $=0.02786 \times \mathrm{pCO} 2 \times 10^{\wedge}(\mathrm{pH}-6.1)+13.77 \times \mathrm{pH}-124.58$

A base excess is the quantity of base ( $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$in $\mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{l}$ ) that is above or below the normal range of buffer base in the body ( $22-28 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{I}$ )
- A positive number is called a base excess and indicates metabolic alkalosis
- A negative number is called a base deficit and indicates metabolic acidosis
- Base excess / deficit of +/-2 is normal
- Severe metabolic acidosis is associated with a base deficit of -10

\section*{Principles of Management of DKA in Pregnancy}

\section*{Multidisciplinary approach}
- Intravenous fluid therapy
- Intravenous insulin therapy
- Electrolyte correction
- Evaluation of the need for bicarbonate administration
- Identification and treatment of any precipitating factors
- Monitoring of maternal and foetal responses

Multidisciplinary approach to care involving an obstetrician, diabetologist/endocrinologist in a higher-level facility or physician in a low-level facility, anaesthesiologist/intensivist, neonatologist/paediatrician is key in optimizing favorable outcomes in patients on treatment for DKA.

DKA in Pregnancy is an emergency and immediate care should take place in the ICU until the patient is stable.

\section*{Note: Use of bicarbonate is not recommended ${ }^{{ }^{\mathbf{1 3}}}$}

There is no benefit associated with use of bicarbonate, neither is it safe to the patient and fetus. Bicarbonate inhibits the compensatory hyperventilation that washes out carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to an increment in CO2 partial pressure (PCO2), which may, in turn, decreased fetal oxygen delivery ${ }^{14}$ It also results in paradoxical cerebral acidosis, due to faster diffusion of CO2 through the blood brain barrier compared to infused bicarbonate ${ }^{15}$ Further, bicarbonate administration delays the wash out of ketones ${ }^{16}$ and can worsen hypokalemia

\section*{EUGLYCEMIC DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS IN PREGNANCY}

Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis refers to DKA with normal or below normal blood glucose levels. ${ }^{19}$ It can occur in patients with DM in pregnancy or GDM. ${ }^{12,20}$

Possible mechanisms include ${ }^{\mathbf{2 0}}$;
- Use of glucose by the fetoplacental unit, with decreased maternal glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
- Increased renal loss of glucose as the renal blood flow increases with increased glomerular filtration of glucose without a corresponding increase in tubular glucose reabsorption
- Increase in estrogen and progesterone in pregnancy accompanied by increased maternal usage of blood glucose
- Dilutional effect on blood glucose because of the increased plasma volume during pregnancy
- Starvation accompanied by depletion of glycogen stores results in normoglycemic DKA

\section*{Management of euglycemic DKA}

Principles mirror those of hyperglycemic DKA; however, concurrent administration of 5\% dextrose with IV saline through a separate IV access is advisable to prevent hypoglycemia caused by IV insulin.

Majority of the fetal abnormalities improve after correction of the metabolic derangements and maternal stabilisation.

The decision to continue the pregnancy or to proceed with delivery can be challenging. The consultant obstetrician should therefore be involved. The MFM consultant's opinion should be sought if possible. The aforementioned decisions should consider the following ${ }^{18}$ :
a) Gestational age of the fetus
b) Maternal status
c) Fetal status
d) Response to treatment
e) Background medical history of co-morbidities
f) Past obstetric history

NOTE: DKA on its own is NOT an indication for urgent delivery as this increases both maternal morbidity and mortality as well as delivery of a hypoxic, acidotic and usually preterm neonate. ${ }^{18}$

\section*{Differential diagnosis of DKA in Pregnancy}
- Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)
- Lactic acidosis
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Acute abdominal surgical emergencies e.g. acute pancreatitis

\section*{Complications of DKA in Pregnancy ${ }^{12}$}
- Maternal
- Acute renal failure,
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Cerebral oedema
- Coma
- Death
- Foetal
- Fetal distress (pathological fetal heart tracing - reduced variability, unprovoked decelerations)
- Demise (9-36\%)

\section*{Prevention of DKA in Pregnancy}

\section*{Pre-Pregnancy}
- Education - the woman should plan her pregnancy with support from a team of diabetes experts, she should receive information regarding risks associated poor glycemic control during pregnancy ${ }^{21}$
- Self monitoring - of blood glucose levels using a glucometer. If hyperglycemia is found or the patient feels unwell, availed urine ketone strips for checking for ketonuria should be in place. ${ }^{21}$
- Pre pregnancy counselling - from primary care physician or at the diabetes clinic. Discuss effective contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancy ${ }^{23}$

\section*{During Pregnancy}
- Team - diabetes specialist nurse/midwife, diabetes specialist dietician and/or joint obstetricdiabetes consultations for effective management
- Screening - universal screening for Diabetes at $24-28$ weeks of gestation and at first contact in patients at risk of DM
- Education - of women diagnosed with DM on precipitating factors and manifestations of DKA. Use of simple language is advised.
- Self monitoring - through use of a glucometer and patients with Type I should monitor for ketones through use of ketone strips. ${ }^{21}$
- Suspected DKA - pregnant women with any form of DM should be advised to seek medical attention if blood glucose levels are persistently above $11.1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{I}(200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl})$ or if
they develop precipitating features outlined in Box I) ${ }^{12}$ Assessment for admission should be done
- Corticosteroid treatment (ACS for fetal lung maturity) - if required in suspected or anticipated preterm birth, insulin dose should be adjusted gradually (usually increased by 25 40\%) ${ }^{22}$
- Tocolysis treatment - if needed betamimetics should be avoided (they increase susceptibility to DKA). Tocolytics that are safer include oxytocin receptor antagonists (atosiban) or calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine) ${ }^{\mathbf{2 3}}$

In order to prevent recurrence of DKA, the following are recommended prior to discharge; ${ }^{13}$
- Educating the patient about how to identify and rectify the precipitating factors;
- Review with the patient, the pre-admission diabetes control, injection technique, injection sites, reliability of the glucometer, and storage of insulin
- Provision of the contact information of the diabetes team and a written plan of care to the patient

Further, prior to discharge, planning of future monitoring of the fetus and a follow-up should be organised to review both maternal and fetal antenatal progress, and ensure continuity of care.

\section*{SYPHILIS IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health problem worldwide with direct and indirect impacts affecting quality of life and causing serious morbidity and mortality.

STIs have a direct impact on reproductive and child health through infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications and an indirect impact through their role in facilitating sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on national and individual economies through increased morbidity and mortality.

Simple, cost-effective screening and treatment options during pregnancy can eliminate most of these complications.

Screening all pregnant women for syphilis at first antenatal care visit is recommended in many countries of the world and is being scaled up rapidly in countries committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV and syphilis.

Elimination aims to reduce incidence of disease or infection in a defined geographical area to zero. Given the fact that both HIV and syphilis remain a public health issue, the goal of eMTCT is to reduce MTCT of HIV and syphilis to a very low level, such that it is no longer a public health problem.

\section*{Epidemiology}

In 2015, nearly I million pregnant women worldwide were infected with Syphilis. In 2012, an estimated 350000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis, including 143000 early foetal deaths/stillbirths, 62000 neonatal deaths, 44000 preterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102000 infected infants. A recent study conducted among women attending an antenatal clinic in a rural setting in Kenya found that $20.8 \%$ of the study participants had a curable STI with prevalence of C. trachomatis (14.9\%), N. gonorrhoea (1\%), T. vaginalis (7.4\%), bacterial vaginitis (19.3\%) and genital ulcers $(2.5 \%)^{8}$.

\end{figure}
*The reduction of case rates targets are not expected to be achieved within the lifetime of the Framework due to high burden generalised epidemic

Figure 30: The end-term targets for eMTCT of HIV and syphilis

\section*{Recommendations}
- All women should be screened serologically for syphilis early in pregnancy
- For communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for women at high risk for infection, serologic testing should also be performed twice during the third trimester: once at 28-32 weeks' gestation and again at delivery.
- Any woman who has a foetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis.
- No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy, and if the mother is considered high risk, documented at delivery ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Aetiology}

Syphilis is a bacterial STI caused by Treponema pallidum. Syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person, via blood transfusion, or transplacentally from a pregnant woman to her foetus.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Syphilis is associated with a complex pathophysiology. The clinical features are best categorized into stages (primary, secondary, early, and late latent and tertiary).

\section*{Clinical stages of syphilis}

Approximately $50 \%$ of women will have no symptoms and will only be diagnosed by serological testing. Without treatment syphilis progresses through $\mathbf{4}$ stages: -

Early syphilis refers to the primary, secondary and early latent stages.
Late Syphilis refers to late latent syphilis or tertiary syphilis.

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{Based on the stage of disease at presentation}

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 32: The clinical features (4) of Syphilis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Stage & Presentation \\
\hline Primary & \begin{tabular}{l}
Lesions begin as a raised papule that ulcerates (chancre) and may: \\
- Be painless or painful (approximately half reported as painful) \\
- Be solitary or multiple (approximately one third reported as multiple) \\
- Typically occur at the site of inoculation (e.g. vagina, penis, anus, rectum, lips, in or on the mouth) \\
- Discharge clear serum-may also be purulent, destructive \\
- Spontaneously heals within three to six weeks without treatment
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Secondary & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Follows untreated primary stage four to eight weeks after appearance of the primary lesion (can occur while primary lesion still present) \\
- Diffuse inflammatory response characterised by generalised mucocutaneous lesions affecting skin, mucous membranes and lymph nodes \\
- Rash may be generalised but characteristically affects palms and soles \\
- Can vary widely and mimic other infectious and non-infectious conditions (e.g. drug eruptions, pityriasis rosea) \\
- Often symmetrical and non-itchy \\
- May be maculopapular (50-70\%), papular (12\%) or macular (10\%) \\
- In warm and moist areas of the body (e.g. anus, labia) flat, wart-like plaques develop as a result of the spread of the treponemes from the primary lesion 16 (condylomata lata) \\
- May be associated with non-specific constitutional symptoms lasting two to six weeks (e.g. malaise, fever, lymphadenopathy, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, patchy alopecia, sore throat) \\
- Resolves spontaneously without treatment in 3-12 weeks
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Latent & \begin{tabular}{l}
- May be divided into: \\
- Early latent (infection for less than two years) \\
- Late latent (infection for two years or more) \\
- Syphilis of unknown duration \\
- Characterised by reactive serology with no clinical manifestations \\
- If untreated $15-40 \%$ develop tertiary infection
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Tertiary & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Can affect any organ system \\
- Occurs in approximately one-third of untreated patients \\
- Main manifestations are: \\
- Neurological disease (neurosyphilis)which can occur at any stage of syphilis.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Signs can include: cranial nerve dysfunction, hearing loss, tinnitus, diminished vision, meningitis, stroke (acute), mental status changes/alteration and loss of vibration sense
- Cardiovascular disease (cardiosyphilis)

Signs can include: aortic root dilatation, aortic regurgitation and/or coronary ostial lesions
- Gummatous lesions (gumma)

\section*{Prevention}

The prevention and control of STIs is an integral component of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services that are needed to attain the related targets under Sustainable Development Goal- No. 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages)

This can be achieved through:
- Advocacy for safer sexual practices
- Screening campaigns
- Treatment and contact tracing of infected persons

\section*{Screening}

\section*{Recommendations for maternal syphilis screening}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Recommendations & Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence \\
\hline Screening for maternal syphilis & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Recommendation 1 \\
The WHO STI guideline recommends screening all pregnant women for syphilis during the first antenatal care visit. \\
Remarks: This recommendation applies to all settings, including settings with high or low prevalence of syphilis.
\end{tabular} & Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence \\
\hline Screening strategies ${ }^{\boldsymbol{*}}$ & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Recommendation 2 \\
In settings with low coverage of syphilis screening and treatment for pregnant women, high loss to follow-up of pregnant women, or limited laboratory capacity, the WHO STI guideline suggests on-site tests ( Strategies A, B and C ) rather than the standard off-site laboratory-based screening and treatment strategy. \\
Recommendation 3 \\
In settings with a low prevalence of syphilis (below 5\%), the WHO STI guideline suggests a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) be used to screen pregnant women (Strategy A) rather than a single on-site rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (Strategy B). \\
Recommendation 4 \\
In settings with a high prevalence of syphilis (5\% or greater), the WHO STI guideline suggests an on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) and, if positive, provision of a first dose of treatment and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, and then, if the RPR test is positive, provision of treatment according to duration of syphilis (Strategy C). The WHO STI guideline suggests this sequence of tests and treatment rather than a single on-site RST (Strategy A) or a single on-site RPR test (Strategy B). \\
Remarks: These recommendations do not apply to countries that can provide appropriate/high-quality laboratory-based screening and treatment strategies. However, in some settings there may be challenges providing such strategies and/ or a sequence of tests. When resources do not permit the use of a sequence of tests, a single on-site rapid syphilis test (RST) (Strategy A) is suggested to ensure greater screening coverage despite the number of pregnant women who will be over-treated due to the high rate of false-positive results. Treatment is based on duration of syphilis, according to the WHO guideline for the treatment of Treponema pallidum (syphilis) ${ }^{\mathrm{b}}$.

\section*{Effect of Syphilis on Pregnancy}

Syphilis in primary, secondary and latent phase if untreated is associated with severe adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is advisable to treat before the second trimester.

Syphilis in pregnancy is associated with:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Aspect & Consideration \\
\hline Maternal impact & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Maternal syphilis is thought to increase the risk of vertical transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) \\
- Although estimates vary, approximately $50 \%$ of women with syphilis requiring treatment in pregnancy suffer adverse pregnancy outcomes \\
- In the absence of effective treatment maternal/foetal impacts include: \\
- $25 \%$ of pregnancies result in a second trimester miscarriage or stillbirth \\
- 11\% of pregnancies result in a neonatal death at term \\
- $13 \%$ of pregnancies result in a preterm or low birth weight infant
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Foetus/baby & \begin{tabular}{l}
- Placental infiltration reduces blood flow to the foetus and may lead to growth restriction \\
- Rates of transmission to babies born to women with untreated syphilis are estimated to be: \\
- $70 \%$ for primary and secondary syphilis \\
- $40 \%$ for early latent syphilis \\
- $10 \%$ for late latent syphilis
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Longer term implications & \begin{tabular}{l}
- $27 \%$ of untreated babies who survive to 30 days are likely to develop symptoms of congenital syphilis, including: \\
- Neurological and developmental delays \\
- Musculoskeletal problems
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Risk reduction & - Early screening of all pregnant women, and identification of high risk pregnancies and babies can prevent adverse perinatal outcomes \\

\section*{Laboratory Diagnosis}

\section*{Specimen}
- Freshly collected fluid or scrapings from chancre or ulcerated lesions of secondary syphilis
- Serum
- CSF fluid for suspected neurosyphilis

\section*{Investigations: by serological tests}
- Non- specific (non-treponemal) tests:
I. Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)
2. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)
- Specific (treponemal) tests:
- Treponema Pallidum Haemaglutination Test (TPHA)
- Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody Absorption test (FTA - ABS).
- Treponema Pallidum Immobilisation test (TPI).

VDRL is based on the detection of anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Non-treponemal tests can be positive in other conditions as collagen diseases, lymphomas, mononucleosis, and febrile illnesses. These tests can be performed as screening tests.

If positive, a specific (treponemal) test is done to confirm or refute syphilis.
False negative results can occur in up to $25 \%$ of the individuals in the latent stages of the disease. Since this situation is more frequently observed in pregnant women, it is recommended to screen for serum with non-treponemal and treponemal tests simultaneously.

Treponemal tests are specific for syphilis and they confirm diagnosis. Nevertheless, even after successful treatment of syphilis, the tests still react and persist as a serum scar for the infection, and the patient can have positive results for treponemal tests forever ${ }^{5,6}$. Increasingly cost effective rapid diagnostic dual testing for HIV and syphilis being done in the antenatal period to prevent MTCT ${ }^{7}$.

\section*{Rapid Syphilis Tests (RSTs)}

RSTs provide treponemal antibody results in 10-15 minutes and can be performed on-site in any setting since they do not require refrigerated storage or laboratory equipment.

Most of the initial range of RSTs use T. pallidum antigens to detect treponema-specific antibodies. Many of the tests use immunochromatographic strips, which work by having a test strip impregnated with treponemal antigens that react with antibodies to syphilis in whole blood or serum. The tests work on the same principle as the specific treponemal tests described above, thus a positive result does not distinguish between active and previously treated infections.

The standard screening strategy is an RPR or VDRL test, followed (if positive) by confirmation testing using TPHA or TPPA with the same blood sample; both tests are usually conducted at an off-site laboratory. Treatment is based on confirmed syphilis. Since confirmation takes $\mathbf{2 - 3}$ days, this strategy typically requires the pregnant woman to make two visits to the clinic: first to provide the blood sample for testing, and second to receive the final test results and appropriate treatment.

Standard laboratory-based screening strategy (WHO 2018)

\section*{Treatment}

Aims of Syphilitic treatment include:
- Counselling
- Contact tracing
- Compliance to treatment
- Prevention of in - utero transplacental transfer of the spirochetes

\hline Recommendations & Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence \\
\hline Early syphilis (primary, secondary and early latent syphilis of not more than two years' duration) & \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Recommendation 5 \\
In pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline recommends benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over no treatment. \\
Recommendation 6 \\
In pregnant women with early syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests using benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units once intramuscularly over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once daily for 10 days. \\
When benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stockouts), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly once daily for 10-14 days or azithromycin 2 g once orally. \\
Remarks: Although erythromycin and azithromycin treat the pregnant women, they do not cross the placental barrier completely and as a result the fetus is not treated. It is therefore necessary to treat the newborn infant soon after delivery (see recommendations 9 and 10 in the WHO guidelines for the treatment of syphilis, which refer to congenital syphilis). Ceftriaxone is an expensive option and is injectable. Doxycycline should not be used in pregnant women. Because syphilis during pregnancy can lead to severe adverse complications to the fetus or newborn, stock-outs of benzathine penicillin for use in antenatal care should be avoided.

Recommendation 8 \\
In pregnant women with late syphilis (more than two years' duration) or unknown stage of syphilis, the WHO STI guideline suggests benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for three consecutive weeks over procaine penicillin 1.2 million units intramuscularly once a day for 20 days \\
When benzathine or procaine penicillin cannot be used (e.g. due to penicillin allergy where penicillin desensitization is not possible) or are not available (e.g. due to stockouts), the WHO STI guideline suggests using, with caution, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for 30 days. \\

\end{tabular}
- Women treated for syphilis during the second trimester are at risk for premature labour and/or non - reassuring foetal status if the treatment precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. These women should be advised to seek obstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever, contractions, or decrease in foetal movements. Stillbirth is a rare complication of treatment, but concern for this complication should not delay necessary treatment. No data is available to suggest that corticosteroid treatment alters the risk for treatment-related complications in pregnancy.
- Missed doses are not acceptable for pregnant women receiving therapy for late latent syphilis. Pregnant women who miss any dose of therapy must repeat the full course of therapy.
- All women who have syphilis should be offered testing for HIV infection.

\section*{Evidence of syphilis in products of conception}
- Placenta: is bulky with hypertrophied villi and endartritis of their vessels. Spirochetes may be detected in the villous stroma. These changes are detected in still born only.
- Umbilical cord: shows endarteritis, chronic cellular infiltration and sometimes spirochetes. These changes are detected in all cases.
- Foetus:
- Stillborn: is macerated with syphilitic epiphysitis and hepatosplenomegaly in which spirochetes may be detected
- Live birth: small - for -date with saddle nose, skin rash, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, osteochondritis and positive serological tests for syphilis

\section*{MALARIA IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Malaria is a protozoan infection by the Plasmodium species. The plasmodium parasite is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. There are various plasmodium species known to cause malaria with the severity and characteristics of disease varying from species to species.

The plasmodium species known to cause malaria in human beings based on severity of disease in decreasing frequency include:
- Plasmodium falciparum
- Plasmodium vivax
- Plasmodium ovale
- Plasmodium malariae
- Plasmodium knowlesi

Malaria can be classified based on transmission patterns and degrees of transmission as follows: 1,2

\section*{Transmission patterns ${ }^{\mathbf{3}}$}
- Stable malaria (endemic malaria)-A type of malaria transmission that is characterized by a steady prevalence pattern with little variation from one year to the next except as a result of scaling up of malaria interventions or exceptional environmental changes that affect transmission. People living in endemic areas exhibit a high level of immunity (usually acquired) against the malaria parasite. The vulnerable persons in this area are children under 5 years of age and pregnant women.
- Unstable malaria (epidemic malaria) - characterized by large variations in incidence patterns from one year to the next. Epidemics can be attributed to human behavior i.e. migration, environmental and climate factors. People living in areas of unstable malaria exhibit low immunity against the disease.
- Seasonal malaria- Transmission that occurs during some months of the year and is markedly reduced in others particularly when climatic factors do not favor transmission.
- Residual malaria -Persistence of malaria transmission following the implementation of a widely effective malaria program.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Globally, there were 219 million cases of malaria in 2017 and the estimated mortality from malaria related deaths stood at 435,000. The burden was heaviest in the WHO African Region, where an estimated $93 \%$ of all malaria deaths occurred. ${ }^{6}$

Annually, around 125 million pregnancies around the world are at risk from malaria. In subSaharan Africa, an estimated 25 million pregnant women are at risk of infection yearly. $7,8,9$

Malaria in pregnancy is a significant contributing factor to maternal death. It was estimated to have been responsible for approximately $15 \%$ of maternal deaths globally. Annually, Malaria in pregnancy is responsible for $20 \%$ of stillbirths and $11 \%$ of neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. 10

In Kenya, on an annual basis, approximately I million women who become pregnant are at risk of getting malaria. ${ }^{12}$

\end{figure}

WHO: World Health Organization.

\section*{Distribution in Kenya}

Locally, there are four major epidemiological zones with diversity in risk determined mainly by altitude, temperature, rainfall patterns and the prevalence of malaria. ${ }^{\underline{\mathbf{3}}}$

These epidemiological zones include:
- Highland epidemic prone areas: Western highlands of Kenya
- Endemic areas (lake and coast)
- Semi-arid, seasonal malaria transmission areas
- Low risk malaria areas: Central Highlands and Nairobi

\section*{Pathophysiology of malaria}

Lifecycle of the malaria parasite (plasmodium). ${ }^{1}$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-200.jpg?height=1312&width=1643&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=239}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 34: Life cycle of the malaria parasite. Adapted from CDC 1}
\end{figure}

The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts (Anopheles mosquito and the human being). In the human being, the lifecycle involves the exo-erythrocytic (liver stage) and the erythrocytic cycles. The Plasmodium vivax and ovale species have the capability to persist in the liver in dormant state which if untreated properly is responsible for relapses and this is a key contributor to malaria in pregnancy in areas where these species are dominant. The erythrocytic cycle (blood stage parasites) are responsible for the clinical manifestations of malaria.

\section*{Pathogenesis ${ }^{\underline{1,14,15}}$}

The median pre-patent period (time from sporozoite inoculation to detectable parasitemia) is 10 days (range $5-10$ days), and the median incubation period (time from sporozoite inoculation to development of symptoms) is 11 days (range 6-14 days) in non-immune individuals.

The incubation period may be significantly prolonged by the level of immunity acquired through previous exposures, use of antimalarial prophylaxis, or by prior partial treatment, which may mitigate, but not prevent the disease

For non-falciparum malaria the incubation period is usually longer (median 15-16 days), and both P . vivax and P . ovale malaria may relapse months or years after exposure due to the presence of hypnozoites in the liver.

Of all the four species, Plasmodium falciparum is known to cause the most severe disease. This lies in its capability to infect red blood cells at any stage of production unlike the other species which have a preference for either young red blood cells or old blood cells.

Also, Plasmodium falciparum causes clumping of infected red blood cells which then stick to endothelial cells lining small blood vessels (sequestration) thus blocking blood flow. Red cell sequestration decreases tissue perfusion and leads to ischemia, which is responsible for the manifestations of cerebral malaria.

Infected red blood cells undergo hemolysis (in circulation and at the spleen). This continuous breakdown of red cells is responsible for anemia which is one of the complications of malaria infection. Hemolysis occurring in the circulation causes a tinge of jaundice due to increased amounts of unconjugated bilirubin which is not water soluble and thus cannot be easily excreted. Sequestration and increased functionality of the spleen causes enlargement; which is a common finding in persons with heavy parasitemia.

In high-transmission settings, where levels of acquired immunity tend to be high, P. falciparum infection is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy. However, parasites may be present in the placenta and lead to maternal anaemia even in the absence of documented peripheral parasitaemia.

In low-transmission settings, where women of reproductive age have relatively little acquired immunity to malaria, malaria in pregnancy is associated with anaemia, an increased risk of severe malaria, and it may lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity and low birth weight. In such settings, all pregnant women, regardless of the number of times they have been pregnant, are highly vulnerable to malaria.

\section*{Placental Malaria}

Increased susceptibility to malaria infection during pregnancy results in high parasitemia and heavy infiltration of parasite-infected RBCs in placental vasculature, a privilege site where the parasite can evade maternal immune response especially filtration by the spleen. ${ }^{16}$

Malarial infection in the placenta is characterized by sequestration of Plasmodium falciparuminfected erythrocytes and the infiltration of immune cells within the intervillous spaces of the placenta. Deposition of the malarial pigment (hemozoin) turns the placenta black. ${ }^{16}$

Pathologies associated with placental malaria are postulated to be the consequence of a change in immune status from antibody-mediated immune response to cell-mediated immune response.

This increase in cell-mediated immune response is deleterious to the placenta which causes oxidative stress, excess inflammation and apoptotic cell death in the placenta. ${ }^{17}$

Moreover, Heat Shock Proteins that are important for maintenance of normal morphology and physiology of the placenta have been reported in low quantities in malaria-infected placenta.

This causes thickening of the placental basement membrane, perivillous fibrinoid deposits, and syncytial knotting which culminate in an altered exchange system in the feto-maternal circulation.

The resultant placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth retardation leading to poor pregnancy outcome, such as abortions, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight. ${ }^{17}$

\section*{Algid Malaria ${ }^{15}$}

This is a form of severe malaria although rare notably due to P . falciparum. Individuals with algid malaria have feature indicative of shock (hypotension), metabolic derangements and hypothermia.

Factors involved in algid malaria include:
- Impaired microcirculation due to effect of the malaria parasite on red blood cells
- Production of cytokines which induce inflammatory responses against the parasite whilst at the same time resulting in tissue damage.
- Metabolic derangements due to associated impaired renal dysfunction
- Gastro-intestinal involvement due to obstruction of the mesenteric arteries resulting in ischemia and probable peritonitis.
- Super infection with gram negative bacteria.

\section*{Population risk groups of malaria ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}
- Young children in stable transmission areas who have not yet developed protective immunity against the most severe forms of the disease;
- Non-immune pregnant women especially in the first pregnancy
- Semi-immune pregnant women in areas of high transmission in the first pregnancy,
- Semi-immune HIV-infected pregnant women in stable transmission areas, during all pregnancies.
- People with HIV/AIDS;
- International travelers from non-endemic areas because they lack immunity;
- Immigrants from endemic areas and their children living in non-endemic areas and returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives are similarly at risk because of waning or absent immunity.

\section*{Prevention}

WHO recommends the following package of interventions for the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy: ${ }^{\underline{\text { II }}}$
- Use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); Sleeping under an insecticide-treated net (ITN) can reduce contact between mosquitoes and humans by providing both a physical barrier and an insecticidal effect.
- In all areas with moderate to high malaria transmission in Africa, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), as part of antenatal care services (shown in figure 5 below)
- Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria infections.
- Indoor residual spraying in malaria-endemic zones
- Use of malaria vaccine

\section*{Malaria vaccine}

RTS, S/ASOI (RTS, S) is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show partial protection against malaria in young children. It acts against P. falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa. Among children who received 4 doses in large-scale clinical trials, the vaccine prevented approximately 4 in 10 cases of malaria over a 4-year period. ${ }^{2,27}$

Currently, there is a pilot program launch in Malawi up-scaled to Kenya and Ghana to ascertain the effectiveness of the vaccine in malaria prevention amongst children less than 5 years.

In pregnancy, the identification of VAR2CSA protein as a major target of protective immunity against $P$ falciparum malaria has increased efforts to develop a pregnancy-specific malaria vaccine. However, knowledge of the importance of different genetic variants of this protein is still scarce. ${ }^{28}$

\section*{Clinical features}

The symptoms and complications of malaria in pregnancy vary according to malaria transmission intensity in a given geographical area an individual's level of acquired immunity ${ }^{19}$.

\section*{Uncomplicated malaria}

In addition to documented peripheral parasitemia, symptoms of uncomplicated malaria are very non-specific. They include ${ }^{20,21}$ :
- Fever
- Chills

\section*{Diagnostic tests ${ }^{\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{2 1}, \mathbf{2 2}}$}

\section*{Peripheral blood film}

This is a technique employed to detect malaria parasites in circulation. It is the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of malaria. A drop of the patients' blood is placed on a microscope slide and prepared for viewing by use of Giemsa stains. There are two preparations used, they include: Thick film and thin film.

Thick film- Used for detection of malaria parasites but is not used for identification of the species
Thin film- Used for species identification

\section*{Rapid diagnostic test (RDT)}

An alternative method for diagnosis of malaria particularly in areas where good microscopy services cannot be assured.

Malaria RDTs detect specific antigens produced by the plasmodium parasite in the blood of infected individuals. RDTs are lateral flow immune-chromatographic antigen detection tests which rely on the capture of dye-labelled antibodies to produce visible test bands indicating the presence or absence of disease.

The RDTs vary depending on the brand and the impregnated antibodies on the strips. There are some RDTs that only detect one species with others having the capability to detect multiple species. It is recommended that kits with the capability to detect $P$. falciparum be used due to the severity of disease caused by this species.

\section*{Advantages}
- Can be used as point of care test
- Do not require specialized training to perform/interpret the results
- Quick to perform

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Test not confirmatory. Need for microscopy for confirmation of diagnosis
- Lack of data to determine the ability of the test to detect fewer common species

Note: PCR and nucleic acid amplification tests have no role in clinical diagnosis of malaria. However, they can be used for research purposes.

\section*{Other relevant investigations}

\section*{Laboratory}
- Full haemogram: Increased white blood cell count, Anaemia, Reticulocytosis, Reduced platelet counts
- Random blood sugars because of risk of hypoglycemia in pregnancy
- Renal function tests: Features of prerenal acute kidney injury and in cases of intrinsic renal damage, features of intrarenal kidney injury
- Liver function tests: Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Blood Gas Analysis
- Urinalysis in severe malaria due to hemoglobinuria

\section*{Radiological}
- Obstetric ultrasound for assessment of fetal well-being.

\section*{Treatment of malaria in pregnancy}

\section*{Supportive treatment}

Antipyretics (Paracetamol PO Ig 8hrly or PO Ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hrly for 3days)

\section*{Continuous supportive care ${ }^{\underline{21}}$}
- Intensive nursing care (ICU)
- Monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output as frequently as possible
- Blood glucose monitoring every 4 h , particularly in unconscious patients
- Continuous fetal monitoring

\section*{Definitive treatment}

\section*{Uncomplicated malaria ${ }^{19,21,23,26}$}

\section*{First trimester}

For P falciparum malaria infections during the first trimester, WHO recommends oral quinine hydrochloride $(600 \mathrm{mg}$ every 8 hours $)$ with clindamycin $(10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ twice a day) for 7 days (or quinine alone if clindamycin is not available)
In situations of failure or unavailability, an artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) or oral artesunate with clindamycin for 7 days.

Malaria caused by Plasmodium species other than P falciparum (non-falciparum malaria) should be treated with chloroquine; quinine is recommended for chloroquine-resistant infections.

\section*{Second and third trimester}
- Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) currently available as a co-formulated dispersible tablet containing 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine. This is administered as a 6-dose regimen given over three days (that is 4 tablets stat, repeat after 8 hours, $24 \mathrm{hrs}, 36 \mathrm{hrs}, 48 \mathrm{hrs}$ and 60 hrs ).

Other treatment regimens that can be considered include:
- Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
- Artesunate-mefloquine
- Artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine- obsolete in Kenya
- Artesunate-amodiaquine- significant resistance to amodiaquine in Kenya

\section*{Severe malaria in pregnancy}

Intensive care and prompt parenteral antimalarial treatment are crucial to the mother's survival.
The WHO recommends intravenous artesunate as the drug of choice or, if unavailable, intramuscular artemether.

Artesunate-First choice in all trimesters
Dosage IV $2.4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose given STAT, at 12 h and at 24 h .

Treat for at least 24 h . Once the patient has received at least 24 h of parenteral therapy and can tolerate oral therapy, complete treatment with 3 days of an ACT.

\section*{Quinine}

Loading dose ( 20 mg salt $/ \mathrm{kg}$ ) provides therapeutic plasma concentrations within 4 hours
The maintenance dose of quinine ( $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{salt}$ ) is administered at 8 h intervals, starting 8 h after the first dose.

If there is no improvement in the patient's condition within 48 h , the dose should be reduced by one third, i.e. to 10 mg salt/kg every 12 h .

Parenteral quinine has an increased risk of hypoglycemia hence the need for frequent blood glucose monitoring.

\section*{Management of complications associated with severe malaria 21}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Manifestation/complication & Immediate management ${ }^{\text {a }}$ \\
\hline Coma (cerebral malaria) & Maintain airway, place patient on his side or her side, exclude other treatable causes of coma (e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacterial meningitis); avoid harmful ancillary treatment, such as corticosteroids, heparin and adrenaline; intubate if necessary. \\

\section*{HIV IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

A key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimize a woman's own health and zero rate infection to the neonate. Furthermore, one of the major successes in the management of individuals living with HIV has been the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV ${ }^{1}$.

\section*{Epidemiology}

HIV is a public health threat globally. Around 1.4 million HIV infections among children were prevented between 2010 and 2018 due to the implementation of PMTCT services.

In 2017, $80 \%$ of pregnant women living with HIV were receiving ART, a significant increase from 2010 levels when only $51 \%$ had access. Testing and treating HIV positive pregnant women has markedly reduced transmission of HIV to less than 2\%. In 2017, just over half (52\%) of the 1.8 million children living with HIV were receiving ART. Among those without access to effective treatment, 110,000 died due to AIDS-related illnesses and roughly half the 180,000 children newly infected with HIV were infected during breastfeeding.

Kenya aims to eliminate mother-to-child transmission (eMTCT) of HIV by 2021. To achieve this, targets of 90\% antenatal care (ANC) attendance, 90\% HIV testing among pregnant women, and 90\% ART use among HIV-positive pregnant women were set to be reached by 2019.

HIV-positive pregnant women in need of PMTCT services has decreased over time from 83,200 in 2005 to 69,500 in 2017; while the PMTCT coverage has increased over time from about $23 \%$ to $76 \%$ in the same time period. With the scale-up of PMTCT services, there has been a significant decline in EMTCT rate (final transmission rate including breastfeeding) from about 29.7\% in 2005 to $11.5 \%$ in 2017.

Antenatal care ANC is the most critical platform for providing the interventions needed for PMTCT, which reduce risk of death for HIV-positive mothers and their babies. Among women aged 15-49 years who delivered within the three years preceding the survey, 97.3\% (KENPHIA 2018) reported having attended at least one ANC visit for their most recent birth.

Among women aged $15-49$ years who gave birth within the 12 months preceding the survey (KENPHIA 2018) and attended ANC, $96.0 \%$ knew their HIV status ( $92.4 \%$ reported an HIVnegative status and $3.6 \%$ reported an HIV-positive status and $4.0 \%$ reported an unknown status (either not tested or tested but had not received results). Among the pregnant women who reported that they tested or were already aware that they were HIV positive at ANC, 92.1\% reported receiving ART during their pregnancy.

The transmission of HIV from a HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called mother-to-child transmission. In the absence of any intervention, transmission rates range from $15 \%$ to $45 \%$. This rate can be reduced to below $5 \%$ with effective
interventions during the periods of pregnancy, labour, delivery and breastfeeding. These interventions primarily involve antiretroviral treatment for the mother and a short course of antiretroviral drugs for the baby before confirmation of the baby's HIV status. They also include measures to prevent HIV acquisition in the pregnant woman and appropriate breastfeeding practices. ${ }^{4}$

HIV prevalence in Kenya reducing, is currently at $4.7 \%$ among adults 15-49 years ${ }^{4}$

Figure 40: The Four Prongs to Eliminate MTCT of HIV

HIV testing should be voluntary and conducted ethically in an environment where Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct results and Connection (linkage) is assured. To optimize access to testing services, HIV testing can be conducted in three different settings i.e.
- Facility-based,
- community-based,
- Self-testing

Integrated HIV/Tb screening programmes and routine screening of partners/spouses plays a key role in management of HIV.

\section*{Management}

Preconception care refers to interventions that identify and modify risks to a couple's health and future pregnancies. It includes prevention and management of health issues that require action before conception. These interventions include:
- Knowledge of HIV status to make informed choices
- Partner involvement
- Good nutrition
- Provision of Comprehensive Post Rape Care services
- STI screening and management
- Contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies
- Life style and behavior change
- Early ART initiation

To reduce MTCT, the woman should conceive when the viral load is undetectable and the CD4 is above 500 cells $/ \mathrm{mm} 3$. She should be advised to ensure that:
- She is in good health, without Opportunistic infections (Ols) or other illnesses due to HIV
- If HIV positive, she should be on optimal therapy with HAART
- She needs to be screened for TB and complete treatment as necessary
- She needs to be on double strength co-trimoxazole $(960 \mathrm{mg})$
- She needs to be treated for any existing STIs and other comorbidities

\section*{Male Partner's Health}

Before the woman tries to get pregnant, the man should be:
- Informed, educated and communicated on PMTCT
- Tested for HIV to rule out discordant couples
- Be in good health and taking and responding to therapy with ARVs for several weeks if HIV-positive and eligible
- Be treated for any existing STIs
- Be circumcised if he is HIV-negative

\section*{Safer Methods to Conceive}
- Encourage condom use during most of the month to prevent transmission of HIV, re-infection with other strains of HIV, or STIs. Consider unprotected sex only when the woman is most fertile. (If cycles are 26-32 days, the fertile period is 8-19th day)
- In case of discordance consider artificial insemination after counselling the couple.

\section*{During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding ${ }^{2}$}

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) should be offered as part of a comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions. Lifelong ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of gestational age, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 count ${ }^{\mathbf{2}}$.

PrEP can complement established prevention strategies for pregnant and breastfeeding women as part of a comprehensive package to reduce HIV transmission.
- ART should be started, ideally, on the same day as HIV diagnosis is made with ongoing enhanced adherence support
- The preferred first line ART regimen for pregnant and breastfeeding women is TDF + 3TC + DTG (WHO JULY 2019) ${ }^{3}$
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women who are virally suppressed on a different first-line regimen should continue their current regimen until complete cessation of breastfeeding, after which they can be considered for regimen optimization
- For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding
- For HIV positive women already on ART at the time of confirming pregnancy or breastfeeding, obtain a VL irrespective of when prior VL was done, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding
- For pregnant or breastfeeding women with a detectable VL (any value above LDL): assess for and address potential reasons for viremia, including intensifying adherence support, repeat the VL after 3 months of excellent adherence
- If the repeat VL is $\geq 1,000$ copies $/ \mathrm{ml}$, change to an effective regimen
- If the repeat VL is detectable but $<1,000$ copies $/ \mathrm{ml}$ consult the Regional or National HIV Clinical TWG
- If the repeat VL is undetectable then continue routine monitoring
- All HEI should receive infant ARV prophylaxis consisting of 6 weeks of AZT + NVP and thereafter NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding
- All infants irrespective of HIV status should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life, with timely introduction of appropriate complementary foods after 6 months, and continued breastfeeding up to 24 months or beyond

\section*{Intrapartum}

\section*{a) Optimal Intrapartum Care}
- Intrapartum care is the management of women from the onset of labour to delivery.
- This period poses the greatest risk for transmission of HIV from the mother to the child (MTCT) with 10 to 20 percent of exposed infants becoming infected at this time in the absence of any intervention.
- In the context of HIV/AIDS, it is, therefore, important to establish the HIV status of women prior to, or during labour and delivery and provide interventions aimed at reducing the risk of transmission.
- With appropriate interventions, the risk of MTCT can be reduced significantly.

The following guidelines should be followed for all women admitted to labour and delivery units
- Minimize vaginal examinations.
- Follow infection prevention and control protocols in conducting delivery.
- Avoid routine artificial rupture of membranes (ARM).
- Avoid routine episiotomy
- Avoid prolonged labour by use of a partograph.
- Avoid unnecessary trauma during delivery.
- Minimize the risk of postpartum haemorrhage
- Assisted vaginal delivery is not a contra-indication in HIV
- Use safe blood transfusion practices.

\section*{b) Specific Management of HIV Positive Pregnant Women}

\section*{Prophylactic Antiretroviral therapies}

The ARV prophylactic regimen depends on whether the mother had ARVs during pregnancy or not. Thus, the health care worker should establish the regimen used during the ANC, whether the woman had taken ARVs at the onset of labour and determine the appropriate intra-partum ARV care as per the national algorithms.

\section*{Mother:}

In Labor and delivery and postnatal period: Combination drug regimens are considered the standard of care for treatment of HIV infection and for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. Start the mother on lifelong ART and continue with adherence support.

Preferred ART regimen TDF+3TC+DTG (WHO guideline 2019)
Infant: Refer to section 2 on perinatal care of this guideline

\section*{Breastfeeding infant}

All HIV exposed infants (HEI) should receive ARV prophylaxis consisting of 6 weeks of AZT + NVP and thereafter NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

All infants including HIV Exposed infants should be exclusively breastfed upto 6 months.

\section*{Mode of delivery}
- Vaginal delivery is appropriate for HIV-infected pregnant women who have been maintained on combined antiretroviral therapy and who have viral loads of 1,000 copies $/ \mathrm{mL}$ or less at or near delivery

The risk of mother-to-child transmission in HIV-infected women with high viral loads can be reduced by performing caesarean deliveries before the onset of labor and before rupture of membranes (termed scheduled caesarean delivery)

\section*{Postpartum care - infant}

All HIV-exposed infants (HEI) should have DNA PCR at 6 weeks and if negative repeat at 6 months and 12 months. An antibody test should be done at 18 months and then repeated every 6 months during breastfeeding. The final antibody test should be performed 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding.

All infants irrespective of HIV status should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life, with timely introduction of appropriate complementary foods after 6 months, and continued breastfeeding up to 24 months or beyond.

\section*{Contraception}

Family planning choices amongst PLHIV emphasize on:
- The importance of advocacy for dual contraception especially in HIV positive clients
- Counselling, especially clients with method failure, and those on ARVs or anti TB therapy
- Strengthening linkages with HIV program and ensuring consistent supplies of condoms
- Strengthening capacity and health system for FP logistics management and information systems

\end{tabular}

Category 1: No restriction for the use of the contraceptive method
Category 2: Advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks
Category 3: The theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method
*DTG was not included in the WHO 2018 MEC Guidelines, however, based on limited data, drug interactions between DTG and hormonal contraception are not anticipated

\section*{Adapted from: Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing HIV Infection in Kenya - 2018 Edition}
- Combined hormonal contraceptives or progestogen-only contraceptives, if they are not breastfeeding otherwise use after 6 months
- For women taking ART, WHO recommends they are generally eligible to use hormonal contraception. Special consideration for Efavirenz or Nevirapine and some protease inhibitors may be warranted
- Women and couples at high risk of HIV infection \& using POls should be informed about (and have access to) HIV preventative measures, including male and female condoms.
- LNG -IUDs can generally be used; however, initiation should be generally avoided if advanced/severe disease (WHO Stage IV)
- Consistent and correct use of condoms, male or female, is critical to protect against STIs/HIV and for prevention of HIV transmission (dual method of protection)

ECHO trial study concluded that there is no substantial difference in risk of HIV infection among women using any of the 3 methods (DMPA-IM, LNG Implant and the copper IUD). All methods are safe and highly effective ${ }^{5}$.

\section*{TUBERCULOSIS IN PREGNANCY}

\section*{Introduction}

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by a bacillus belonging to a group of bacteria in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The most common agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. I, 2,4

Other agents include: Mycobacterium bovis (transmitted through contaminated milk and milk products), Mycobacterium africanum. In rare situations Mycobacteria other than TB (MOTT) may cause a disease similar to typical TB. ${ }^{4}$

The bacillus is transmitted from person-to-person through aerosolized droplet nuclei. Aerosols droplets are generated through coughing, laughing, talking, sneezing, singing and spitting from an infectious case of TB. The most infectious patient is one with positive sputum smear. ${ }^{1,4}$

It affects the upper lung lobes mostly, but can also affect other parts of the body and most infections are latent. ${ }^{1}$

The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. ${ }^{1,2,4}$

\section*{Epidemiology}

TB is among the top 10 causes of death globally and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS). Kenya is among the 30 high burden countries and is ranked 13. ${ }^{1}$

In 2017, TB caused an estimated 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative people and there were an additional 300000 deaths from TB among HIV-positive people. ${ }^{1}$

Globally, it is estimated that $\mathbf{1 0 . 0}$ million people developed TB disease in 2017. Of this, 5.8 million were men, 3.2 million women and 1.0 million children. ${ }^{1}$

About 1.7 billion people, $23 \%$ of the world's population, are estimated to have a latent TB infection, and are thus at risk of developing active TB disease during their lifetime. ${ }^{1}$

A small proportion ( $5-10 \%$ ) of the estimated 1.7 billion people infected with M. tuberculosis will develop TB disease during their lifetime. However, the probability of developing TB disease is much higher among people infected with HIV; it is also higher among people affected by risk factors such as undernutrition, diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumption. ${ }^{1,2,3,4}$

Overall, about $90 \%$ of cases occur among adults, with more cases among men than women. The male: female ratio among adults is approximately $2: I^{, ~}{ }^{\underline{2}}$

Drug-resistant TB remains a public health crisis. in 2017, globally, 558000 people developed TB resistant to rifampicin; the most effective first-line drug, and of these, $82 \%$ had multidrug-resistant

TB. 3 countries accounted for almost half of the world's cases of MDR/RR-TB: India ( $24 \%$ ), China (13\%) and the Russian Federation (10\%). ${ }^{1}$

${ }^{a}$ Indicates countries that are included in the list of 30 high TB burden countries on the basis of the severity of their TB burden (i.e. TB incidence per 100000 population), as opposed to the top 20, which are included on the basis of their absolute number of incident cases per year.

\section*{Global commitments to end TB ${ }^{\underline{1}, 2,3,4}$}

The overall goal is to "End the global TB epidemic"
There are three high-level, overarching indicators and related targets (for 2030 -linked to the SDGs, and for 2035) and milestones (for 2020 and 2025). The three indicators are:
- The number of TB deaths per year
- The TB incidence rate (new cases per 100000 population per year)
- The percentage of TB-affected households that experience catastrophic costs as a result of TB disease.

The 2030 targets are a $\mathbf{9 0 \%}$ reduction in TB deaths and an $\mathbf{8 0 \%}$ reduction in the TB incidence rate, compared with levels in 2015. The 2035 targets are a $95 \%$ reduction in TB deaths and a $90 \%$ reduction in the TB incidence rate, compared with levels in 2015.

The most immediate milestones, set for 2020 , are a $\mathbf{3 5} \%$ reduction in TB deaths and a $\mathbf{2 0} \%$ reduction in the TB incidence rate, compared with levels in 2015.

Pillar I of end TB strategy is "Integrated, patient centered care and prevention". It has four components: ${ }^{\text {1 }}$
- Early diagnosis of TB, including universal drug susceptibility testing, and systematic screening of contacts and high-risk groups;
- Treatment of all people withTB, including drug resistant TB, and patient support;
- Collaborative TB/HIV activities and management of comorbidities;
- Preventive treatment of persons at high risk and vaccination against TB

\section*{Pathogenesis of TB ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{4}}$}
- Droplet nuclei containing tubercle bacilli once inhaled, enter the lungs and travel to the alveoli. Tubercle bacilli then multiply in the alveoli.
- A small number of tubercle bacilli enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. The bacilli may reach any part of the body, including areas where TB disease is more likely to develop (such as the lungs, kidneys, brain, or bone)
- Within 2-10 weeks the immune system produces special immune cells that surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a hard shell that keeps the bacilli contained and under control. (TB infection).

If the immune system cannot keep the bacilli under control, the bacilli begin to multiply rapidly (TB disease). This process can occur in different places in the body, such as the lungs, kidneys, brain, or bone.

\section*{Microbiology ${ }^{\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{4}}$}
- M. tuberculosis is an aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacillus with a high cell wall content of high-molecular-weight lipids.
- Its generation time is 15 to 20 hours, compared with less than 1 hour for most common bacterial pathogens. Visible colonies require 3 to 4 weeks to grow
- Delay in identification impacts the decision whether to initiate chemotherapy and at what intensity. Unfortunately, the decision to treat with three to four powerful antibiotics for 6 to 9 months may be made without the benefit of positive cultures and rest on the epidemiology and clinical presentation

\section*{Natural history of TB infection ${ }^{\underline{4}}$}

Infection refers to a situation in which a person has TB bacilli in the body (Usually lungs-Ghon focus) but does not have signs and symptoms of the disease.

Following exposure to the bacillus the risk of infection is related to the extent of contact
Risk factors for infection with the TB bacillus following exposure include:
- Bacillary load of infectious cases (smear positivity)
- Extent of contact with infectious cases
- Proximity to infectious case
- Length of contact with infectious case

Figure 1: Natural progression of TB infection ${ }^{\mathbf{4}}$

\section*{TB disease (Active TB)}
- TB disease is a state where a person has signs and symptoms of the disease. In this state, there is active multiplication of the bacilli in the body. ${ }^{4}$
- The risk factors for developing disease following infection with the tubercle bacillus include factors that affect body immunity. A significant proportion of cases of TB however does not have any obvious risk factor for disease and unknown biological factors may play a role. ${ }^{1,2,4}$
- Major risk factors: HIV infection, time since infection (Recent infection), poorly treated previous TB ${ }^{4}$
- Other factors: Age (extremes of age), sex (males more than females), malnutrition, diabetes, alcoholism, tobacco smoking, immune suppressing therapy, long term treatment with oral corticosteroids. ${ }^{\underline{4}}$

\section*{Classification of TB disease ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{4}}$}

TB occurs in two clinical forms:
- TB in the lungs-- Pulmonary TB (PTB) and
- TB outside the lungs - Extra pulmonary TB (EPTB)

PTB is the most common form of TB accounting for $80 \%$ of the total cases and is of public health concern as it serves as the source of infection.

Extra-pulmonary TB: Extra-pulmonary TB affects other parts of the body outside the lung tissue. Body organs affected by EPTB include: lymph nodes, bones, spine, kidneys, liver, bladder, skin, eyes, and gastro-intestinal system. EPTB can occur in any organ of the body (except nails, hair and teeth)

Pulmonary tuberculosis: This is further classified on the basis of smear microscopy into:
- Smear positive PTB
- Smear Negative PTB

\section*{Smear positive PTB:}

A patient with at least one initial sputum smear examination positive for acid fast bacilli.

\section*{Smear negative PTB}
- At least two sputum specimens at the start of treatment are negative for Acid Fast Bacilli
- Radiologic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis
- No response to a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (excluding anti-TB drugs, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides especially in HIV negative patients

\section*{Tuberculosis in pregnancy}
- Tuberculosis remains the most common cause of death from infectious agents in childbearingage women (14 to 49 years) worldwide ${ }^{2}$
- Overpopulation, HIV infection, increasing poverty, and the increasing incidence of antibioticresistant isolates are increasing the burden of tuberculosis on women and society. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$
- In the era before chemotherapy, pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period were associated with higher rates of active tuberculosis and faster progression of the disease. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$
- In developing countries, women contribute $40 \%$ to $60 \%$ of household income. Children whose mothers die are 3 to 10 times more likely to die within 2 years than those with both parents alive. This impact is twice that if the father were to die. Tuberculosis kills or maims reproductive-age women, leaving orphans, impoverished families, and limited economic development. ${ }^{1,2,3,4}$
- Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state and diabetes can worsen the clinical course of TB, and TB can worsen glycemic control in people with diabetes. Rates of TB are higher in people with diabetes than in the general population, and diabetes is a common co-morbidity in people with TB. Individuals with both conditions thus require careful clinical management. Strategies are needed to ensure that optimal care is provided to patients with both diseases: TB must be diagnosed early in people with diabetes, and diabetes must be diagnosed early in people with TB.

\section*{KEY CRITICAL POINTS}
- The decision to treat tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy must consider the potential risks to mother and fetus from medication, and the benefits to mother, foetus and the community. The benefits of treating TB in pregnancy are widely considered to outweigh any risk of treatment.
- Although small concentrations of anti-TB drugs are excreted in breast milk, treatment for TB is generally not considered a contra-indication to breastfeeding, and is not associated with toxicity to the baby.

\section*{Diagnosis of PTB in pregnancy poses unique challenges because: ${ }^{\mathbf{2 ,} \boldsymbol{4}}$}
- The non-specific nature of early pregnancy symptoms (such as frequency of malaise and fatigue) that can mimic early symptoms of TB
- Screening for PTB is not routinely or systematically done in PMTCT programs
- Fear of use of chest radiography in pregnancy due to concerns regarding radiation-induced teratogenicity

\section*{TB in HIV Positive pregnant women ${ }^{3,4}$}
- HIV has led to a rapid increase in the global incidence of TB.
- HIV also increases the likelihood of dying from TB; TB is a leading cause of death among people who are HIV-positive accounting for about $13 \%$ of AIDS deaths worldwide
- HIV and TB form a lethal combination. Someone who is HIV- positive and infected with TB bacilli is many times more likely to develop active tuberculosis.
- TB contributes to the rapid progression of HIV/AIDS
- Both TB and HIV independently increase maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality
- Risk of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) when ART for PMTCT is given on undiagnosed active TB. This is because ART for PMTCT starts from pregnancy diagnosis for life.

\section*{Effects of TB on pregnancy ${ }^{2,} 3,4$}

Maternal TB has been associated with an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcomes. The outcome is unfavourably influenced by delays in diagnosis or treatment, along with disease other than in lymph nodes.
- Pregnancy does not alter the course of active TB.
- Spontaneous abortion, prematurity, small size for gestational age, neonatal low birth weight, and perinatal deaths ${ }^{3}$
- Women with a late diagnosis of pulmonary TB have an increased risk of obstetric morbidity and a higher risk of miscarriage, eclampsia, and intrapartum complications. ${ }^{3}$

Congenital TB is a rare complication of in utero TB infection due to maternal haematogenous spread. Congenital TB is difficult to diagnose because it is seldom distinguishable from other neonatal or congenital infections. Symptoms usually arise in the second or third week postpartum. Hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory distress and fever are common, and chest radiography is almost universally abnormal ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{Pulmonary TB presentation ${ }^{2, ~ 3, ~} 4$}
- Tuberculosis should be suspected in any person presenting with a cough of more than two weeks. The cough may be associated with production of blood stained sputum. Other symptoms include: fevers, night sweats, loss of weight, chest pain and shortness of breath.
- All persons presenting with a cough of a duration longer than two weeks should be screened for TB using sputum smear microscopy unless there is another obvious cause of the cough.
- Physical signs may include: Bronchial breath sounds, tachypnea, wasting, hemoptysis

\section*{Differential diagnoses ${ }^{2,} \underline{4}$}

Chronic bronchitis/ COPD, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, lung cancer, heart failure, sarcoidosis, atypical pneumonias e.g. pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia

\section*{Diagnosis of TB ${ }^{\underline{2,4}}$}

The diagnosis of PTB is based on the following:
- History of presenting complaints (History of prolonged cough is a key symptom)
- Past medical history (Diabetes, HIV)
- History of Contact with TB
- Physical examination
- Sputum AFB microscopy
- Other supportive investigation
- Chest x-ray (Supportive for smear negative TB)
- Specialized bacteriological examination: Culture, molecular tests and drug susceptibility tests for Anti-TB drugs

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Sputum smear examination ${ }^{\underline{2}, 4}$}

Patients suspected to have PTB should have two sputum samples collected examined for Acid Fast Bacilli (At least one sample should be collected in the morning)

The recommended sputum collection procedure is the morning.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 36: Sputum sample collection $\underline{4}$}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Sample} & When is it collected? & Where is it collected? \\
\hline Spot & $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ sample & On the spot & In the health facility \\
\hline Morning & $2^{\text {nd }}$ sample & Patient collects upon waking up the following morning & At home and brings to health facility (Or in hospital if patient is hospitalized) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Important considerations in sputum examination ${ }^{\underline{2}}$
- An estimated 10,000 organisms $/ \mathrm{ml}$ of sputum are required for acid-fast stain positivity. Identification of a single organism on the entire slide is therefore highly suspicious.
- Paucity of organisms dictates the acquisition of specimens with a high concentration of organisms and thorough examination of the prepared slides.
- At least three early mornings (before rising) specimens are recommended. Early morning gastric aspirates are effective if obtained before ambulation. Thin fluid (i.e. urine) should be examined after sedimentation with centrifugation.
- The use of Gene X-pert in the diagnosis is rapidly changing the specific identification of M. tuberculosis. It can identify as few as 10 organisms in clinical specimens, compared with the 10,000 organisms necessary for AFB smear positivity, possibly within a day.

\section*{Instructing patients to collect sputum specimen ${ }^{4}$}

The following should be observed in the process of collecting and submitting sputum samples to the laboratory for TB diagnosis to ensure production of a quality sputum sample and results:
- Label the sputum containers on the side (NOT ON THE LID) before sputum samples are collected
- Fill in the sputum examination forms ensuring that the patient's contacts are included
- Instruct the patient to collect sputum samples in a well ventilated area preferably outdoors
- The patient should take a deep breath, cough and attempt sputum production. This can be repeated several times
- The patient should close the lid tightly After collecting the sputum
- All collected sputum samples should be submitted to the laboratory as soon as feasible together with a correctly filled sputum examination form

\section*{Sputum induction ${ }^{4}$}
- Inhalation of hypertonic saline (greater $0.9 \%$ ) solution preferably by ultrasonic nebulization
- Bronchial wash or Broncho-alveolar lavage sample obtained through fiber-optic bronchoscopy

Note: These procedures are available only in tertiary institutions in Kenya and because they may lead to a substantial generation of infectious aerosols, should only be carried out in clinical environments with appropriate infection prevention measures in place.

\section*{Sputum culture examination ${ }^{4}$}

Indications for sputum TB culture and DST are:
- Failure of first line treatment (Smears still remains positive at month 5 )
- Lack of smear conversion at end of month 2 while on first line treatment
- Returning after defaulting treatment
- Symptomatic contacts of drug resistant TB cases
- Health care workers
- Relapse

\section*{Chest X-ray ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{4}}$}

The chest x-ray may aid the diagnosis of PTB but it should not be used as the sole means of establishing a TB diagnosis.

All patients with chest x-ray features suggestive of TB should have sputum specimens submitted for microbiological examination. It is a major omission to diagnose TB on the basis of a chest xray ONLY

Radiographic features that usually suggestive PTB include:
- Patchy shadows in lung apices. There may be evidence of cavitation and scarring (fibrosis)
- In HIV infected persons the radiological picture is more often atypical with lower or mid-zone shadows and hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement being relatively common.
- Miliary mottling, Pleural and/or pericardial effusion (Cases of Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis)

Sample from invasive procedures ${ }^{4:}$ TB can be diagnosed through the examination of lung biopsy specimens obtained through:
- Fiber-optic bronchoscopy
- Open lung biopsy or the trans-thoracic route.
- Peritoneal biopsy

Obtaining lung biopsy specimens demands the availability of a technically qualified person and equipment, and therefore these diagnostic techniques are rarely done

Tuberculin skin test: Mantoux test should not be used to diagnose TB in adults. It only indicates that the person has previously been infected with the TB bacillus. Similarly, most serological tests are not able to distinguish latent infection from current active disease and therefore should not be used to diagnose PTB. ${ }^{2,4}$

ESR and other tests ${ }^{4}$ : ESR is usually elevated in active TB, but this test is not sensitive or specific enough to be of value in the diagnosis of PTB

\section*{Screening for TB}
- Reduction of tuberculosis (TB) transmission, morbidity and mortality relies largely on intensified case finding, with consequent early initiation of adequate treatment. This is particularly important among pregnant women in resource-limited settings where TB is a cause of non-obstetrical (indirect) maternal deaths ${ }^{3}$
- Data from Western Cape, South Africa, indicate that there is a 24.2 -fold higher incidence of TB disease among infants born to HIV-infected mothers, diagnosed at a mean age of 6 months, than among those of HIV-negative mothers. This suggests possible under-diagnosis of active tuberculosis during antenatal care ${ }^{3}$
- The World Health Organization recommends ruling out active TB and identifying those in need of further testing among HIV-infected adults using specific symptoms (current cough of any duration, fever, weight loss or night sweats) ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Treatment of new cases of TB (pulmonary TB \& extra-pulmonary}
\section*{TB) in adults ${ }^{4}$}

\section*{Basic Principles of TB treatment}
- Never use single drugs
- Always use drugs in combinations -using Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs)
- Drug dosage based on weight
- Drug intake should be directly observed
- Ensure the entire $6-8$ months' treatment is achieved

First line ant-drugs TB: Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (Z), Ethambutol (E), Streptomycin (S)
- TB treatment. After two months two drugs are used for $4-6$ months and this phase is called the continuation Phase of treatment
- Tuberculosis treatment involves the use of multiple drugs taken in combination. This is done to prevent the emergence of drug resistance to any of the drugs.
- Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC): Contain two or more medicines within the same tablet or capsule. Advantages of FDCs include:
- Reduced risk of resistance developing to the drugs in the event of missed doses, fewer medication errors and fewer prescription errors

In the first two months of treatment four drugs are used to rapidly reduce the number of tubercle bacilli (bacillary load) in the body. This phase is called the Intensive phase of anti-TB Treatment

\section*{WHO-TB treatment guidelines $2018{ }^{5}$}

All forms of PTB and EPTB except TB meningitis and osteo-articular TB
- Intensive phase: 2months Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide
- Continuation phase: $\mathbf{4}$ months of Rifampicin and Isoniazid

\section*{TB meningitis and Osteoarticular TB}
- Intensive: $\mathbf{2}$ months Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide
- Continuation: 10 months of Rifampicin and Isoniazid

\section*{Retreatment}
- Intensive: 2months Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide
- Continuation: 5 months Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol

\section*{Treatment of TB in pregnancy ${ }^{\underline{4}}$}
- Pregnancy should be avoided during anti-TB treatment. However, when it occurs, termination of pregnancy is not recommended
- Anti-TB drugs have not been specifically studied in pregnancy. There is always some risk of teratogenicity with any drugs especially if given in the first trimester. There have been no significant reports that anti-TB drugs pose a greater than usual risk of teratogenicity and therefore all pregnant women with active TB should be treated with a full complement of anti-TB drugs.
- Rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide are classified under FDA category C meaning their risk cannot be ruled out in pregnancy.
- Pyridoxine should be given together with isoniazid to avoid neurological congenital malformations in the fetus
- Streptomycin is ototoxic and should not be used in pregnancy as it may cause deafness in the infant.
- In drug resistant TB, the amino glycosides (Kanamycin, Amikacin and Capreomycin) and the thioamides (Ethionamide and Prothionamide) should not be used in pregnancy because of associated ototoxity.

\section*{Adjuncts to treatment ${ }^{4}$}

\section*{Health education}
- Health staff should continuously educate patients with TB, their relatives and treatment supporters about tuberculosis. An understanding, sympathetic and concerned attitude on the part of the health staff is essential for getting the message across.
- Health education is essential for patient compliance during the whole treatment period. To attain a high cure rate and to prevent defaulting treatment, it should be provided every time the patient receives care from the health care provider
- Infection prevention measures like ventilation/ opening windows at home should be addressed

\section*{What the Patient Should Know}

\section*{At diagnosis the patient needs to know:}
- Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that is transmitted from one person to another through coughing, sneezing etc.
- The patient may have infected other people who may also develop tuberculosis. The patient should therefore, be asked to encourage other people with whom he/ she has been in close contact to undergo screening for TB.
- Infection prevention measures like hand capping, opening windows at home, and benefits of spending most of their time in open air.
- Tuberculosis drugs are available and free of charge at any government health facility, most mission hospitals and some private health facilities.
- Once treatment is initiated, the symptoms of tuberculosis disease will disappear quickly, but the drugs still need to be continued daily until the end of the prescribed treatment period. Failure to comply with medication may cause relapse, with possibility of drug resistance and treatment failure. This could also cause a greater risk for the patient's health and that of close contacts.
- Side effects may include urine discoloration by Rifampicin, skin reactions by Isoniazid, blurring of vision etc.
- The type of regimen, the exact number and type of tablets that the patients will take.
- How long the intensive phase and the continuation phase will take, where and when the drugs will be administered.
- A sputum-smear examination is required at certain intervals to monitor the progress towards cure. Explain to the patient when the examination will be required.
- HIV testing offers an opportunity for further treatment, care and support especially to those who are HIV positive. For those who are HIV negative it offers them an opportunity to know their HIV status and how to prevent HIV infection.

\section*{After initiation of treatment:}
- Encourage contacts (e.g. household members especially children under 5 years of age, PLHIV and persons above 65 years) to come for TB screening.
- Patients are requested to inform the staff at the clinic when they intend to travel. An adequate supply of drugs can then be given to cater for the period they are away from their local area.
- Patients are requested to inform the staff at the clinic when they intend to move to another area. The clinic staff will then write a transfer letter and give advice as to where they can continue treatment

\section*{At the end of treatment:}
- TB disease may occur again. The patient should therefore report immediately to the health care provider when similar symptoms recur.

\section*{Forms of drug resistance in treatment for $\mathrm{TB}^{2,4}$}
- Mono resistance: Documented resistance to only one drug
- Poly resistance (PDR): Documented resistance to at least 2 drugs but not to both Isoniazid and Rifampicin
- Multidrug resistant (MDR): Documented resistance to at least INH and Rifampicin
- Extensively Drug Resistant TB (XDR TB): Documented MDR TB and resistance to a Quinolone and at least one injectable second line drug

\section*{Treatment of Multi-Drug Resistant \& XDR /Tuberculosis in pregnancy}
- Multi- disciplinary approach with inclusion of a TB specialist and medication and best conducted under directly observed therapy.
- HCW and care givers should observe infection prevention measures

\section*{Regimen for Multidrug Resistant TB (MDR) in Pregnancy}

Intensive phase 6-9 months PAS, Levofloxacin, Cycloserine, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol
Conitunation phase: 18 months Levofloxacin, PAS, Ethambutol (reserve drugs Moxifloxacin and Capreomycin)

Note: In pregnancy gestation $<12$ weeks Kanamycin and Ethaathionamide are replaced by PAS

\section*{Regimen for XDR In Pregnancy}

Intensive phase 6-12 months: Capreomycin, PAS, Moxifloxacin, High dose INH, Clofazimine, Linezolid, Amoxyclav

Continuation phase 18 months: PAS, Moxifloxacin, High dose INH, Clofazimine, Linezolid, Amoxyclav

\section*{Immune reconstitution inflammatory (IRIS) SYNDROME in ptient with TB in pregnancy and HIV ${ }^{\mathbf{8}}$}

Risk factors for developing IRIS include starting ART in patients with severe immunodeficiency (CD4 $<50$ cell $/ \mathrm{mm} 3$ ); startingART early in the course of treating an opportunistic infection or starting ART in the presence of undiagnosed Opportunistic infection(OI). The infectious organisms commonly implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Cryptococcus, herpes viruses including varicella zoster, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and can also occur in association with malignancies like KS. The decision as to whether or not to start ART in patients with acute Ols should be made by clinicians experienced in the management of HIV infected patients.

\section*{MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH}

\section*{Introduction}

Mental health is defined as "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community." ${ }^{6}$

Maternal mental health aims to address mental health issues in women along a continuum so as to include preconception care, antenatal care, intrapartum care and postpartum care. Previously, maternal mental health issues mostly concentrated on the postpartum period. Major maternal mental health issues are now being referred to in the context of the perinatal period as opposed to the post-partum period.

Pregnancy and the arrival of a new baby signals a time of unparalleled change and hope for the future. For many women, however, it is a challenging time. For a minority of mothers, this period can be overshadowed by mental illness and aggravated by widespread stigma. ${ }^{1}$

Mental illness is treatable and requires the ability to recognize, assess and treat for sustained maternal, new-born and family well-being. The illness may be pre-existent or develop in the course of the mother's life cycle or specific to a given pregnancy. Challenges with continuation, change or cessation of psychotropic drugs exist during pregnancy and lactation.

Perinatal mental illness might also account for a substantial proportion of maternal deaths in lowincome countries if suicide causes were properly classified and reported. ${ }^{1}$

A multi- disciplinary approach is recommended in maternal mental ill health.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Perinatal mental health issues are a common problem globally. In high-income countries, it is estimated that about $10 \%$ of pregnant women and $13 \%$ of women who have just given birth experience some type of mental disorder ${ }^{2}$. In developing countries, the incidence is even higher with an estimate of about $15.6 \%$ mental health problems during pregnancy and $19.8 \%$ mental health problems after child birth ${ }^{3}$.

In Kenya, mental health illness reporting is still not on track and this has resulted in paucity of data relating to mental health problems . ${ }^{4}$

\section*{Maternal mental health recommendations}
- Practice recommendations relate to the screening and assessment of depression symptoms and include the implementation of effective preventive and non-pharmacological treatment interventions, including those focusing on psychosocial and psychological supports.
- Education recommendations include ongoing professional development to enhance nurses and the inter-professional team's knowledge and skills in mental health services and supports for perinatal depression.
- Organization and system policy recommendations have been developed to address the importance of comprehensive and coordinated mental health services and supports for perinatal depression to support care strategies provided by nurses and the inter-professional team ${ }^{5}$.

\section*{Aetiopathogenesis}

The specific causes of maternal mental health illnesses remain unknown. However, fluctuation of maternal hormones has been considered a possible factor but the evidence remains circumstantial.

In the case of peri-partum mood disorders, women might not show gross abnormalities in endocrine physiology, but rather the susceptibility to triggering by childbirth could represent an abnormal response to the normal hormonal fluctuations in the perinatal period. ${ }^{7,8}$

\section*{Risk factors for maternal mental health disorders ${ }^{2,7,9}$}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Biological risk factors & \begin{tabular}{l}
Pregnancy (normal pregnancy, unintended pregnancy, pregnancy losses) \\
Obstetric complications \\
Difficult delivery \\
Primiparity \\
Genetics (family history of mental health disorders) \\
Sleep deprivation \\
Medical comorbidities \\
Disability \\
Pre-term births \\
Delivery to defective children
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Psychological risk factors & \begin{tabular}{l}
Interpersonal conflicts \\
History of mental health disorders \\
Poor coping skills
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Social risk factors & \begin{tabular}{l}
Lack of support systems (single parenting, antagonistic partners, belligerent inlaws, no support from one's mother) \\
Gender based violence \\
Preferred sex of baby \\
Substance use \\
Low socioeconomic status
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Some of the maternal mental health disorders include:
- Perinatal depression
- Perinatal anxiety
- Postpartum blues
- Postpartum psychosis
- Bipolar mood disorder
- Non- affective psychosis
- Substance use disorders

\section*{Peri-natal anxiety disorders}

Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders with women, particularly those in their child bearing years being most affected. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more common in postpartum women relative to the general population. Medical diagnoses such as hypo/hyperthyroidism, anemia, and hypertension have a similar phenotype and should be ruled out ${ }^{8}$.

\section*{Peri-natal depression}

Depression related disorders are common during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. These disorders have a similar phenomenology as non-child bearing depressive disorders. The point prevalence of depression (major and minor) is estimated to be up to $11 \%$ in pregnancy and $13 \%$ in the first 3 months postpartum. A higher prevalence of antenatal and postnatal depression (major and minor) is generally reported in women in low and middle income countries than in women in high income countries ${ }^{11}$.

Perinatal onset of symptoms relating to depression defines symptoms occurring anytime during pregnancy up to I-month post-partum. In addition to depressed mood, loss of interest in pleasurable activities and decreased energy, perinatal depression with a postpartum onset is characterized by obsessive-compulsive, particularly intrusive violent thoughts, psychotic symptoms, and anxiety ${ }^{8,12}$.

For women with suspected post- natal depression, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale can be used for screening purposes prior to referral to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management ${ }^{\text {II }}$.

\section*{Postpartum blues}

Postpartum blues also known as baby blues is the commonest constellation of mood symptoms experienced by women in the immediate postpartum period. This affects approximately $50-80 \%$ of women ${ }^{8}$.

Postpartum blues are transient in nature with an onset after the third postpartum day, typically after the mother has left the hospital post-delivery. Symptoms typically peak by day five and resolve by day ten postpartum ${ }^{8}$.

Postpartum blues commonly affect first-time mothers with no relation to difficult deliveries or obstetric complications.

Symptoms include ${ }^{8}$ :
- Mood lability (rapid mood shifts)
- Tearfulness -not related to depressive episodes
- Irritability
- Anxiety
- Insomnia
- Lack of energy and increased fatigue
- Loss of appetite
- A general experience of feeling overwhelmed-particularly with regard to newborn caregiving tasks

\section*{Management ${ }^{8}$}

No need for pharmacological treatment.
Psychosocial treatment modalities apply and can include:
- Psychoeducation- Should begin in the antenatal period where the mother is informed on the psychological aspects of pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Also, the mother can join a support group of new mothers or talk to other mothers.
- Encourage the mother to seek for help from the spouse, family members and friends so as to ease the burden of child care
- Careful monitoring for a worsening or prolongation of symptoms.

\section*{Table showing differences between postpartum blues and postpartum depression ${ }^{10}$}

\section*{Postpartum psychosis}

Postpartum psychosis occurs in association with mood disorders (major depressive or manic episodes). It occurs in approximately I-2 women per 1000 childbirths. An increased risk exists in women with prior postpartum mood episodes, prior history of major depressive disorder, or bipolar I disorder- where a positive family history also plays part as a risk factor ${ }^{7,8,12}$.

The syndrome is often characterized by the mother's depression, delusions, and thoughts of harming either herself or her infant. The onset of florid psychotic symptoms is preceded by prodromal symptoms such as insomnia, restlessness, agitation, lability of mood, and mild cognitive deficits ${ }^{10}$

This disorder escalates rapidly to florid psychosis within days postpartum and often results in presentation for treatment within 3 weeks postpartum ${ }^{8}$.

Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency. Management is multi- disciplinary with the involvement of a psychiatrist. Suicidal patients may require transfer to a psychiatric unit to help prevent a suicide attempt ${ }^{8}$.

\section*{General principles of care of maternal mental health disorders}

\section*{Preconception advice for women with severe mental illness ${ }^{7}$}

All women with a severe mental illness in their reproductive years should be able to access advice with regard to pregnancy and parenting, ideally, this should be a multi-disciplinary activity involving a psychiatrist and a gynaecologist.

A checklist of issues to consider would include the following criteria:
- Planning for motherhood: Discussions of family and advice on methods of contraception should be offered to avoid unplanned pregnancies.
- Potential effects of pregnancy on illness: For each woman, her individual risk of a relapse or recurrence should be discussed based on the severity of her mental illness and coexisting family history in relation to childbirth.
- Optimisation of physical and mental health: Preconception is an ideal time to address a range of issues key to a healthy pregnancy. These issues will include smoking, nutrition, drug and alcohol use, domestic violence. In addition, optimisation of management of mental health is needed to ensure women enter pregnancy as well as possible.
- Medication: The risks and benefits of all options should be discussed, including continuation, stopping and switching of medication. Issues to consider in the risk-benefit analysis include; previous response to change in medications or dose reduction; alternative treatment options available; and risk of teratogenicity (e.g. neural tube defects). Options for restarting of medication later in pregnancy or in the postpartum can be discussed.
- Genetic risk: Women and their partners might have concerns about passing a susceptibility to severe mental illness to their children and these concerns can be addressed or the woman referred for further genetic counselling.
- Liaison with other services: All professionals involved in looking after a woman through pregnancy and the post-partum period should be informed about the history of severe mental illness.

\section*{Care during pregnancy ${ }^{7}$}
- A perinatal care plan for women with current or past severe mental illness should be present. Women in this group should be monitored for psychopathology throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period.
- Antenatal services should therefore identify women with histories that would put them at increased risk of a severe episode in the perinatal period, even if they are currently well and not in contact with psychiatric services.
- Other factors that can trigger or increase the risk of relapse need to be addressed. These include stress levels and sleep disorders.
- Proper parenting support systems should be established during this period.
- Evidence-based interventions for comorbid problems such as: smoking cessation interventions, domestic violence advocacy and weight management interventions can also be addressed.
- In cases of relapses, interventions by psychiatrists are necessitated so as to provide insight on available treatment modalities in pregnancy

\section*{Care during the postpartum period}
- Mothers should have support systems to help them through thee period. Her support systems include: her spouse, mother, siblings and friends
- Mothers should be made aware of the possible symptoms and signs that may indicate mental illness. They should also know the places where they may seek for help.
- Mothers can join support groups with other new mothers where they can exchange ideas and have a general feel that they are not alone in the process of motherhood

\section*{Decision making regarding admission in the post-partum period ${ }^{7}$}

Many women with severe mental illness in the post-partum period will require admission to hospital. The following factors/ presentation may necessitate admission:
- Severe episode with significant impairment
- Suspicion of post-partum psychosis-an acute onset of a new episode in the immediate postpartum
- Delusions involving the baby
- Poor social support from partner and other family members
- Previous severe episodes of illness
- Suicidal ideation
- Aggression to others
- Risk of harm to infant including poor infant care and lack of bonding

\section*{NORMAL LABOUR}

\section*{Introduction}

Quality maternal healthcare is key for the achievement of SDG-3.1 and 3.2. This includes: preconception care, antenatal care (including counselling for birth preparedness and possible complications), intrapartum care and post-partum care ${ }^{1}$

All pregnancies should be handled with caution. Amongst women selected for low obstetric risk, approximately $25 \%$ will develop peri-partum complications necessitating transfer to an obstetrician led service ${ }^{2}$.

Box 1. SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (?)

Target 3.1: By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than $\mathbf{7 0}$ per 100000 live births

Indicator 3.1.1: Maternal mortality ratio
Indicator 3.1.2: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel

Target 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as $\mathbf{1 2}$ per 1000 live births*

Indicator 3.2.2: Neonatal mortality rate
* Modified to focus only on newborns.

Box 2. Categories of MNH competencies
1. Scope of knowledge
2. Scope of practice
3. Pre-pregnancy and antenatal care
4. Intrapartum care
5. Postpartum and postnatal care
6. Newborn care
7. Care related to loss or termination
8. Leadership

All competent MNH professionals in a team provide evidencebased, human-rights-based, quality, socioculturally sensitive and dignified care to women, newborns and their families.

Pregnant women are being advised to attend antenatal care and deliver at health facilities under skilled birth attendants. A skilled birth attendant (SBA) is a health worker such as a midwife, doctor, or nurse who is well trained on matters relating to child birth- normal and complicated deliveries. The skills, attitudes and behaviour of SBAs, and the extent to which they work in an enabling working environment, impact on the quality of care provided.

In a systematic review SBA differed in the following ways:
- Curriculum, duration of training and/or education requirements obtained to be qualified;
- Regulation, accreditation, and/or certification by a professional organization;
- Skills and competency that each cadre are able to perform (i.e., signal functions and/or other key interventions required for the management of childbirth);
- Legislation to perform these signal functions and/or interventions;
- Location of work (urban/rural, hospital/health centre/community-based); and
- Continuing education requirements (curriculum, duration, and frequency). ${ }^{3}$

Box 3. The 2018 definition of skilled health personnel (competent health-care professionals) providing care during childbirth (often referred to as "skilled birth attendants" or SBAs)

Skilled health personnel, as referenced by SDG indicator 3.1.2, are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated, trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to:
(i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rightsbased, quality, socioculturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns;
(ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and
(iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications.

In addition, as part of an integrated team of MNH professionals (including midwives, nurses, obstetricians, paediatricians and anaesthetists), they perform all signal functions of emergency maternal and newborn care to optimize the health and well-being of women and newborns.
Within an enabling environment, midwives trained to International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) standards can provide nearly all of the essential care needed for women and newborns.* (In different countries, these competencies are held by professionals with varying occupational titles.)

Table 39: Definition of skilled health personnel providing care during childbirth (4)

\section*{Health Care system}

Health system considerations require resource and budgetary allocation to address HRH shortages, infrastructure, equipment and referral mechanisms; update of curricula for preservice and in- service ; standardized labour monitoring tools and their utilization; update of essential medical drug list; revision of national guidelines / protocols; facilitated supervision; supply chain logistics ; provision of care models in the maternity units for informed choice and cost effective; behaviour change to evidence best practices; documentation and audit cycles.

Safe childbirth checklists ${ }^{29}$ are utilized to standardize the documentation procedure, facilitate communication between health providers in the processes of labour, childbirth and immediate postpartum period; institution of interventions including emergency obstetric and neonatal care; facilitates conducting of clinical audits, benchmarking (score card) can be further used for prioritized planning and strengthening of the health system.

\section*{Intrapartum care for positive childbirth experience}

Over the last two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the application of labour practices to: initiate, accelerate, terminate, regulate or monitor the physiological process of labour. This is done with the aim of improving outcomes for women and babies.

Intrapartum care for positive childbirth experience articulates the norms of good practice to the desired end point of a healthy mother and healthy new-born. A positive childbirth experience
defined as one that fulfils or exceeds a woman's prior personal and sociocultural beliefs and expectations, including giving birth to a healthy baby in a clinically and psychologically safe environment with continuity of practical and emotional support from a birth companion(s) or kind, technically competent clinical staff.

It is based on the premise that most women want a physiological labour and birth, and to have a sense of personal achievement and control through involvement in decision-making, even when medical interventions are needed or wanted ${ }^{5,6}$.

\end{figure}

\section*{Rationale}

It's important to identify women in normal labour so as to enable proper monitoring of labour and effect appropriate management of labour which will reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Globally, approximately 140 million births occur every year, the majority of these are vaginal births among pregnant women with no identified risk factors for complications, either for themselves or their babies, at the onset of labour.

In Kenya, approximately 1.2 million women get pregnant every year, 85\% of these are normal births.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Recommendations-Intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Care option & Recommendation & Category of recommendation \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Care throughout labor and birth} \\
\hline Respectful maternity care & I. Respectful maternity care - refers to care organized for and provided to all women in a manner that maintains their dignity, privacy and confidentiality, ensures freedom from harm and mistreatment, and enables informed choice and continuous support during labor and childbirth, is recommended. & Recommended \\
\hline Effective communication & 2. Effective communication between maternity care providers and women in labor, using simple and culturally acceptable methods, is recommended. & Recommended \\
\hline Companionship during labor and childbirth & 3. A companion of choice is recommended for all women throughout labor and childbirth. & Recommended \\
\hline Continuity of care & 4. Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known midwife or small group of known midwives supports a woman throughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal continuum, are recommended for pregnant women in settings with well-functioning midwifery programmes. & Context-specific recommendation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{First stage of labor}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Definitions of the latent and active first stages of labor & 5. The use of the following definitions of the latent and active first stages of labor is recommended for practice. - The latent first stage is a period of time characterized by painful uterine contractions and variable changes of the cervix, including some degree of effacement and slower progression of dilatation up to 5 cm for first and subsequent labors. - The active first stage is a period of time characterized by regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial degree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical dilatation from 5 cm until full dilatation for first and subsequent labors. & Recommended \\
\hline Duration of the first stage of labor & 6. Women should be informed that a standard duration of the latent first stage has not been established and can vary widely from one woman to another. However, the duration of active first stage (from 5 cm until full cervical dilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12 hours in first labors, and usually does not extend beyond 10 hours in subsequent labors. & Recommended \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Care option & Recommendation & Category of recommendation \\
\hline Progress of the first stage of labor & \begin{tabular}{l}
7. For pregnant women with spontaneous labor onset, the cervical dilatation rate threshold of $1 \mathrm{~cm} /$ hour during active first stage (as depicted by the partograph alert line) is inaccurate to identify women at risk of adverse birth outcomes and is therefore not recommended for this purpose. \\
8. A minimum cervical dilatation rate of $1 \mathrm{~cm} /$ hour throughout active first stage is unrealistically fast for some women and is therefore not recommended for identification of normal labor progression. A slower than $\mathrm{I}-\mathrm{cm} /$ hour cervical dilatation rate alone should not be a routine indication for obstetric intervention. 9. Labor may not naturally accelerate until a cervical dilatation threshold of 5 cm is reached. Therefore the use of medical interventions to accelerate labor and birth (such as oxytocin augmentation or caesarean section) before this threshold is not recommended, provided fetal and maternal conditions are reassuring.
\end{tabular} & Not recommended \\
\hline Labor ward admission policy & 10. For healthy pregnant women presenting in spontaneous labor, a policy of delaying labor ward admission until active first stage is recommended only in the context of rigorous research. & Research-context recommendation \\
\hline Clinical pelvimetry on admission & II. Routine clinical pelvimetry on admission in labor is not recommended for healthy pregnant women & Not recommended \\

\section*{Definition}

Normal labour is a physiological process which commence spontaneously at term ( 37 completed weeks) with rhythmic regular contractions of increasing intensity and frequency accompanied by progressive cervical effacement and dilation, and descent of presenting part (preferably cephalic) resulting in expulsion of a healthy foetus, a complete placenta and membranes and a health mother.

Normal labour begins two weeks before or after the estimated delivery dates, in the first pregnancy labour usually ranges from 12-18 hours, subsequent labours are shorter ranging 6-8 hours.

\section*{Stages of Normal Labour}

Labour is divided into four main stages:

Ist Stage: from onset of labour to full dilatation of the cervix.
2nd Stage: from full dilatation to expulsion of the foetus.
3rd Stage: from delivery of the baby, to delivery of placenta.
4th Stage: Up to one hour after expulsion of placenta

\end{figure}

\section*{Management}

\section*{Diagnosis}

History taking- Important points to note:
- Gestational age
- Duration elapsed since onset of labour pains
- Any drainage of liquor
- Any per vaginal discharge noted
- Relevant medical history i.e. HIV status, diabetes, hypertension
- Past obstetric history
- Social history including recreational drug use

General Examination including vital signs on admission

\section*{Abdominal Examination - Leopold's manoeuvres}

Vaginal examination - Sterile speculum examination and digital vaginal examination at intervals of 4 hrs

The following criteria should be present to call it normal labour
- Spontaneous onset
- Spontaneous expulsion of a single mature foetus
- Presenting by vertex
- Through the birth canal within a reasonable time (not less than 3 hours
- Without complication to the mother or to the foetus

\section*{Interventions}
- Admission in the labour ward
- Notification of admission into the labour ward
- Standardised entry of patient record and details
- Clinical assessment:
- Triage and routine plotting of the MEOW Chart for timely recognition, treatment and referral of women who may develop a critical illness during labour or post-partum.
- History taking and reviewed against the mother - baby booklet or referral letter
- Clinical assessment This should be done within 4 hours of admission to make a comprehensive diagnosis and assess the progress of labour
- Routine clinical pelvimetry on admission in labour is not recommended for healthy pregnant women ${ }^{7}$
- Routine care- in labour ward should aim at $\mathrm{I}: \mathrm{I}$ (patient to midwife ratio)
- Effective communication and support - providers should introduce themselves and explain the procedures and processes associated with her labour management using simple and culturally acceptable language.
- The mother must be actively engaged in decision making in her management
- Health personnel must be trained on interpersonal communication and counselling

\section*{Effective communication}
- Introducing themselves to the woman and her companion and addressing the woman by her name;
- Offering the woman and her family the information they need in a clear and concise manner (in the language spoken by the woman and her family), avoiding medical jargon, and using pictorial and graphic materials when needed to communicate processes or procedures;
- Respecting and responding to the woman's needs, preferences and questions with a positive attitude;
- Supporting the woman's emotional needs with empathy and compassion, through encouragement, praise, reassurance and active listening;
- Supporting the woman to understand that she has a choice, and ensuring that her choices are supported;
- Ensuring that procedures are explained to the woman, and that verbal and, when appropriate, written informed consent for pelvic examinations and other procedures is obtained from the woman;
- Encouraging the woman to express her needs and preferences, and regularly updating her and her family about what is happening, and asking if they have any questions;
- Ensuring that privacy and confidentiality is maintained at all times;
- Ensuring that the woman is aware of available mechanisms for addressing complaints;
- Interacting with the woman's companion of choice to provide clear explanations on how the woman can be well supported during labour and childbirth.

Table 41: Recommendations for effective communication ${ }^{(8)}$

\section*{Maternal Observations}
- The tool used for monitoring labour is the partograph and initiated in active phase of labour. The periodicity of intermittent fetal heart auscultation is 30 minutes and vaginal examinations done 4 hourly
- Use of early ARM (Amniotomy) with early oxytocin for prevention of delay in labour not routinely recommended ${ }^{33}$
- Amniotomy can be done with augmentation of labour:
- Evidence that routine ARM shortens labour is largely lacking ${ }^{32}$
- The risk of infection increases following rupture of the membranes, whether by amniotomy or following spontaneous rupture of the membranes.
- ARM provides useful information on fetal wellbeing (liquor volume and colour). The presence of scanty amniotic fluid or meconium staining of liquor at ARM enables identification of a foetus that would benefit from Continuous Electronic Fetal Monitoring (CEFM) when this may not otherwise be known.

\section*{Relative Contraindications to Amniotomy}
- Infections i.e., Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HSV and HIV in order to minimise the hazards to the foetus of ascending infection.
- Presenting part high and mobile
- Active management of labour
- Intrapartum foetal surveillance

At admission intermittent auscultation and during labour CTG can be used

\section*{Position and ambulation}

Women should be encouraged to ambulate freely according to comfort, where it does not compromise maternal and fetal observations in labour

\section*{Provision of analgesia}
- The facility needs to inform the parturient the types of analgesia available and noting their limitations refer accordingly
- Pharmacological and non- pharmacological methods need to be offered and provided
- Each labour unit should have a guideline for opioid use during labour that includes the mechanisms of action, average and maximum doses, route of administration, possible maternal and fetal side effects, precautions, and opioid antagonists and resuscitative measures for each drug.
- Epidural analgesia provides the most effective pain relief for women in labour. The timing of initiation of labour epidural is dependent on the woman's choice once the diagnosis of labour has been established.

\section*{Fluids and oral intake}
- Women should be encouraged to only have clear fluids and light diet in the active phase of labour to minimise the small risk of aspiration pneumonitis.
- Routine intravenous fluids are not recommended in labour and increases unnecessary costs. 9
- Dehydration may increase the length of labour necessitating augmentation of labour
- Intravenous fluid replacement may be necessary in women unable to tolerate sufficient oral intake, and is recommended for volume loading prior to epidural anaesthesia.
- Oral medications can be given as usual in labour, although absorption may be impaired in established labour and another route may need to be considered (e.g. for anticonvulsants).

\section*{Antibiotics}
- Indications for antibiotic administration in labour:
- For prevention of early onset Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection
- For women at risk of chorioamnionitis or where other bacterial infection is suspected - E.g. fever > 38 on one occasion or > 37.5 on two occasions
- For women with cardiac lesions susceptible to infective endocarditis.

\section*{Antispasmodics in labour}

The use of antispasmodic agents for prevention of delay in labour is not recommended. ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Perineall pubic shaving at birth}

Routine perineal/pubic shaving prior to giving vaginal birth is not recommended. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Establishment of labour}

Women should be informed that a standard duration of the latent first stage has not been established and can vary widely from one woman to another. However, the duration of active first stage (from 5 cm until full cervical dilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12 hours in first labours, and usually does not extend beyond 10 hours in subsequent labours. ${ }^{12}$

Differences between true and false labour include:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline True Labour Pain & False Labour Pain \\
\hline Regular. & Irregular. \\
\hline Increase progressively in frequency, duration and intensity. & Do not. \\
\hline Pain is felt in the abdomen and radiating to the back. & Pain is felt mainly in the abdomen. \\
\hline Progressive dilatation and effacement of the cervix. & No effect on the cervix. \\
\hline Membranes are bulging during contractions. & No bulging of the membranes. \\
\hline Not relieved by antispasmodics or sedatives. & Can be relieved by antispasmodics and sedatives. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Standardized Monitoring of labour (WHO partograph)}

This is graphic representation of the maternal and fetal status during the process of labour. And used in detecting abnormal physiology to make appropriate and timely decision making. Following childbirth be it via spontaneous vaginal delivery, assisted delivery or caeserian section the maternal and fetal outcomes are recorded.

\section*{The Labour Care Guide}

In February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a consolidated set of recommendations on intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience. The recommendations include new definitions of the duration of the first and second stages of labour and provide guidance on the timing and use of labour interventions to improve the health and well-being of women and their babies. The recommendations are based on the principle that, through the use of effective labour and childbirth practices and avoidance of ineffective (and potentially harmful) practices, health personnel can support women to achieve their desired physical, emotional and psychological outcomes for themselves, their babies and their families.

WHO recommendations on intrapartum care specify evidence-based practices that should be implemented throughout labour and the immediate postnatal periods, and discourage ineffective practices that should be avoided. WHO recommendations cover:
- Care throughout labour and birth: respectful maternity care, effective communication, labour companionship, and continuity of care;
- First stage of labour: definition of the latent and active first stages, duration and progression of the first stage, labour ward admission policy, clinical pelvimetry on admission, routine assessment of fetal well-being on labour admission, pubic shaving, enema on admission, digital vaginal examination, vaginal cleansing, continuous cardiotocography, intermittent fetal heart rate (FHR) auscultation, pain relief, oral fluid and food, maternal mobility and position, active management of labour, routine amniotomy, oxytocin for preventing delay, antispasmodic agents, and intravenous fluids for preventing labour delay;
- Second stage of labour: definition and duration of the second stage of labour, birth position (with and without epidural analgesia), methods of pushing, techniques for preventing perineal trauma, episiotomy, and fundal pressure;
- Third stage of labour: prophylactic uterotonics, delayed umbilical cord clamping, controlled cord traction, and uterine massage;
- Care of the newborn: routine nasal or oral suction during resuscitation, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, haemorrhagic disease prophylaxis using vitamin K, and bathing and other immediate postnatal care of the newborn;
- Care of the woman after birth: uterine tonus assessment, use of antibiotics, routine postpartum maternal assessment, and discharge following uncomplicated vaginal birth

To facilitate effective implementation of the above recommendations, WHO reviewed and revised the design of the previous partograph ${ }^{37}$. The Labour Care Guide (LCG) was designed for health personnel to monitor the well-being of women and babies during labour through regular assessments to identify any deviation from normality. The tool aims to stimulate shared decisionmaking by health-care providers and women, and to promote women-centred care. The LCG is intended as a resource to ensure quality evidence-based care, with a special emphasis on ensuring safety, avoiding unnecessary interventions, and providing supportive care.

The principal aims of the LCG are to:
- Guide the monitoring and documentation of the well-being of women and babies and the progress of labour
- Guide skilled health personnel to offer supportive care throughout labour to ensure a positive childbirth experience for women
- Assist skilled health personnel to promptly identify and address emerging labour complications, by providing reference thresholds for labour observations that are intended to trigger reflection and specific action(s) if an abnormal observation is identified
- Prevent unnecessary use of interventions in labour
- Support audit and quality improvement of labour management.

\section*{For whom should the LCG be used?}

The LCG has been designed for the care of women and their babies during labour and childbirth. It includes assessments and observations that are essential for the care of all pregnant women, regardless of their risk status. However, the LCG was primarily designed to be used for the care of apparently healthy pregnant women and their babies (i.e., women with low-risk pregnancies). Women at high risk of developing labour complications may require additional specialized monitoring and care.

Upon arrival in the labour unit, women should have an initial assessment to determine whether labour has started. Women in labour will require further monitoring of the progress of labour with the LCG.

\section*{When should the LCG be initiated?}

Documentation on the LCG of the well-being of the woman and her baby as well as progression of labour should be initiated when the woman enters active phase of the first stage of labour ( 5 cm or more cervical dilatation), regardless of her parity and membranes status.

Although the LCG should not be initiated in the latent phase of labour, it is expected that women and their babies are monitored and receive labour care and support during the latent stage.

\section*{Where should the LCG be used?}

The LCG is designed to be used for all births in health facilities, including primary, secondary and tertiary care settings. Women giving birth in lower-level facilities may require referral to a higher level of care if complications ensue. Women in such settings should therefore have access to appropriate referral and transportation options for safe and timely transfer. The use of the LCG can facilitate early identification of potential complications; hence, it should contribute to timely referrals when required.

\section*{Structure of the LCG}

The LCG has seven sections, which were adapted from the previous partograph design. The sections are as follows:
1. Identifying information and labour characteristics at admission
2. Supportive care
3. Care of the baby
4. Care of the woman
5. Labour progress
6. Medication
7. Shared decision-making

Section 1 is for documenting the woman's name and labour admission characteristics that are important for labour management: parity, mode of labour onset, date of active labour diagnosis, date and time of rupture of membranes, and risk factors. This section should be completed with the information obtained when active labour diagnosis is confirmed.

Sections 2-7 contain a list of labour observations. The health-care provider should record observations for all sections soon after the woman is admitted to the labour ward. The remainder of the LCG is then completed following subsequent assessments throughout labour. For all observations, there is a horizontal time axis for documentation of the corresponding time of observation and a vertical reference values axis for determination of any deviation from normal observations. The LCG also provides a second-stage section to continue the observations made during the first stage of labour (except for cervical dilatation assessment, which ends at the first stage of labour)

\section*{Labour monitoring to action}

Regular assessments of labour events are required to ensure the well-being of women and their babies during labour. The decision to intervene in the course of labour is primarily based on observation of a deviation from expected observations during these assessments.

To facilitate action-oriented labour monitoring, the LCG provides explicit reference values for labour observations and includes a section to document shared decisions to address any deviation from the expected norm.

To ensure the systematic and consistent application of the LCG, health providers are encouraged to use the Assess, Record, Check, Plan approach, which involves:
- Assess (assess the well-being of woman and her baby, and progress of labour)
- Record (document labour observations)
- Check reference threshold (compare labour observations with reference values in the "Alert" column)
- Plan (decide whether and what interventions are required, in consultation with the woman, and document accordingly).

It is important for health-care providers to prospectively monitor the wellbeing of women and babies and the progression of labour, and to apply the Assess, Record, Check, Plan process at each assessment throughout labour.
The LCG is intended as a guide and is not a substitute for good clinical judgment with respect to the individual women's circumstances and preferences.

\section*{Definition of Latent phase of labour}

The latent first stage is a period of time characterized by painful uterine contractions and variable changes of the cervix, including some degree of effacement and slower progression of dilatation up to 5 cm for first and subsequent labours.

\section*{Definition of Active phase of labour}

The active first stage is a period of time characterized by regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial degree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical dilatation from 5 cm until full dilatation for first and subsequent labours ${ }^{14}$

\section*{Digital vaginal examination during labour}

Routine vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine during labour for the purpose of preventing infectious morbidities is not recommended. ${ }^{15,16}$

Digital vaginal examination at intervals of four hours is recommended for routine assessment of active first stage of labour in low-risk women. ${ }^{17}$

In cases of poor progress of labour (cervical dystocia) repeat digital vaginal examinations can be conducted after 2 hours.

Frequent digital vaginal examinations must be weighed against added maternal discomfort as well as the potential for introducing infection.

\section*{Package of active management of labour}

Package of care for active management of labour for prevention of delay in labour is not recommended. ${ }^{18}$

\section*{Failure of progress can occur in latent phase of labour}

With recurrent or prolonged episodes of latent labour it may contribute to a legitimate decision to induce the labour.

\section*{Failure of progress can occur in active phase of labour}

The cervical dilatation of Icm / hour as depicted by the alert line on the cervicograph is inaccurate in predicting the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and may cause unnecessary interventions. In health care facilities where interventions such as augmentation and caesarean section cannot be performed and where referral-level facilities are difficult to reach, the alert line could still be used for triaging women who may require additional care. In this instance, plotting should commence from a cervical dilatation of 5 cm , which signifies the onset of active first stage of labour for most women. ${ }^{19}$

A minimum cervical dilatation rate of $1 \mathrm{~cm} /$ hour throughout active first stage is unrealistically fast for some women and is therefore not recommended for identification of normal labour progression. A slower than $1-\mathrm{cm} /$ hour cervical dilatation rate alone should not be a routine indication for obstetric intervention.

Labour may not naturally accelerate until a cervical dilatation threshold of 5 cm is reached. Therefore, the use of medical interventions to accelerate labour and birth (such as oxytocin augmentation or caesarean section) before this threshold is not recommended, provided fetal and maternal conditions are reassuring. ${ }^{20}$

\section*{Second stage of labour}

\section*{Definition of second stage of labour}

The second stage is the period of time between full cervical dilatation and delivery of the baby. During which, the woman has an involuntary urge to bear down as a result of expulsive uterine contractions.

Women in the expulsive phase of the second stage of labour should be encouraged and supported to follow their own urge to push. ${ }^{21}$

Normal second stage for a primigravida is up to 2 hours and up to 1 hour for a multigravida. When these times are exceeded, assessment should occur by a medical practitioner with the view to correcting dystocia and effecting birth.

Women should be informed that the duration of the second stage varies from one woman to another. In first labours, birth is usually completed within 3 hours whereas in subsequent labours, birth is usually completed within 2 hours. ${ }^{22}$

\section*{Signs of second stage}

The following are signs of second stage of labour
- Complete dilatation of the cervix
- Gaping of the anus
- Presenting part seen at the vulva
- Urge to push
- Contractions of short intervals lasting for more than a minute and are occurring every 2-3 minutes.
- Crowning of the foetal head visible at the perineum
- Companionship in labour (doula)

A companion of choice is recommended for all women throughout labour and childbirth. ${ }^{23}$
This is any person chosen by the woman to provide her with continuous support during labour and childbirth. This may be someone from the woman's family (or social network, such as her spouse/partner, a female friend or relative, a community member (such as a female community leader, health worker or traditional birth attendant) or a doula (i.e. a woman who has been trained in labour support but is not part of the health care facility's professional staff).

Where TBAs remain the main providers of care at birth, dialogue with TBAs, women, families, communities and service providers is recommended in order to define and agree on alternative roles for TBAs, recognizing the important role they can play in supporting the health of women and new-borns. ${ }^{24}$

Birthing units should carefully consider adding family-centric interventions ${ }^{25}$

\section*{Birthing position}

For women without epidural analgesia, encouraging the adoption of a birth position of the individual woman's choice, including upright positions, is recommended

\section*{Examples of birthing positions}

\section*{Fundal pressure at birth}

Application of manual fundal pressure to facilitate childbirth during the second stage of labour is not recommended. ${ }^{26}$

\section*{Episiotomy}

This is no benefit from routine episiotomy. Indications where it may be considered is with a high likelihood of severe laceration;
- Soft tissue dystocia;
- A requirement to accelerate the birth of a compromised foetus;
- The need to facilitate operative vaginal birth;
- A history of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
- Third stage of labour

There is no room for expectant (physiological) management of third stage due to the risk of immediate postpartum haemorrhage, increased risk for blood transfusion and a flaccid uterus that can undergo acute uterine inversion.

\section*{Recommendation}

Active management of third stage of labour (AMSTL) includes
- Administration of uterotonics e.g. I..M 10 I.U oxytocin within one minute of delivery after ruling out absence of $2^{\text {nd }}$ twin
- Delivery of placenta by Controlled Cord Traction (C.T.T recommended for all women)
- Uterine massage

This is followed by assisted delivery of the placenta and membranes by controlled cord traction (CCT) and is recommended for all women.

\section*{Other drugs that can be used in AMTSL:}
- Oxytocin 5 or 10 units (intramuscularly or intravenously)
- Heat stable Carbetocin 100ug (intramuscularly or intravenously)
- Syntometrine intramuscularly l ml stat
- Ergometrine IM 0.2 mg stat
- Ergometrine and oxytocin (ergometrine $0.2 \mathrm{mg}+$ oxytocin 5 units)
- Misoprostol oral, sublingual, or per rectal 200 ug stat

N/B: Ergometrine contraindicated in hypertensive patients and cardiac patients and should not be injected into blood vessels

\section*{Delayed Cord clamping}
- There should be no urgency to cut the umbilical cord and this can be done between I-3 minutes.
- In preterm infants, delayed cord clamping is associated with a reduced risk of requiring transfusion, infection, necrotising enterocolitis and intraventricular haemorrhage.
- In term infants delayed cord clamping is associated with an increased haematocrit and reduced iron deficiency at $3-6$ months of age. This is more so amongst mothers where iron stores are low, or in infants who will be exclusively breastfed without iron supplementation.
- Approximately $75 \%$ of available placental blood for transfusion is achieved in the first minute after birth, and the transfer of blood from placenta to new-born is facilitated by the infant being held below the level of the in-situ placenta.
- If the infant is held between 10 cm above to 10 cm below the level of the placenta, transfusion is complete within 3 minutes.
- If the infant is held 40 cm below the placenta, transfusion time is shortened to 1 minute.
- Application of chlorhexidine digluconate $7.1 \%$ on the cord

\section*{Management of $4{ }^{\text {th }}$ Stage of Labour}
- The fourth stage of labour is the first hour after delivery of the placenta. The mother should remain in the labour ward where her condition should be assessed, the perineum, vagina, and cervix should be examined for tears.
- During this time, observe the mother every 15 minutes for vital signs and vaginal bleeding. Monitor the new-born's condition for bleeding from the cord, maintenance of body temperature and where appropriate, encourage initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth
- Continuity of care for positive childbirth experience (context specific recommendation)
- Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known midwife or small group of known midwives supports a woman throughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal continuum, are recommended for pregnant women in settings with well-functioning midwifery programmes. ${ }^{28}$

\section*{Immediate new-born care}
1. Initial assessment upon delivery
2. Skin to skin contact if no maternal and neonatal complications
3. Apgar scores should be completed at I and 5 minutes of age.
4. Secondary neonatal assessment in the early postpartum period
5. Intramuscular vitamin K administration is recommended, and in some centres, Hepatitis B vaccination

\section*{Routine (targeted) postpartum care}

Maternal assessment in fourth stage ( 6 hours)
- Routine MEOW Chart monitoring
- Initiation of breastfeeding health initiative
- Immediate postpartum family planning
- Maternal danger signs
- Clinical assessment
- Multimodal management of pain with analgesics an early ambulation
- Surgical site infection prevention and prophylaxis for DVT
- Access to emergency care with complications

\section*{Documentation and Debrief}
1. Patients and family expectations and experience are expressed
2. Provides an opportunity to explain an adverse outcome
3. Staff given opportunity to debrief with adverse outcome (Near miss and MPDSR)
4. Promotes learning, linkage and health system change
5. Identifies vulnerable team members that need support after an adverse outcome
6. Risk mitigation for medico legal issues

\section*{POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS DURING NORMAL LABOUR}

\section*{PEOPLE LIVING WITH DISABILITY}

\section*{Introduction}

People Living with Disability (PLWD) have less access to health care and health promotion services. According to WHO- World Bank, 2011 as cited by Unicef ', Women with disabilities are recognized as particularly disadvantaged, experiencing exclusion double burden to their gender and disability condition and often very vulnerable to abuse.

Throughout the developing world, it is reported that people with disabilities have less access to healthcare services due to barriers and often experience unmet healthcare needs. Women with disabilities face more challenges in accessing healthcare, particularly maternal healthcare-resulting in higher risk situations and poorer outcomes than women without disabilities ${ }^{2,4}$.

\section*{Definition}

Disability is defined as a long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which in interaction with various barriers may hinder a person's full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

Women with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies in healthcare services depending on disability type and setting. Some health conditions associated with disability result in poorer health and extensive healthcare needs, others do not. However, all people with disabilities also have the same general healthcare needs as everyone else, and therefore need access to mainstream healthcare services

Most women with disability are able to become pregnant and to have normal labour experience some women with disability have experiences that review some thoughts to advanced planning.

\section*{Epidemiology}

According to WHO and the World Bank, over a billion people, about $15 \%$ of the world's population and $16 \%$ of the world's women, have some form of disability, $80 \%$ of them live in limitedresource settings'. By 2009, 1.7 million persons were living with disability in Kenya. According to the KNBS report 2013, $3.5 \%$ women constitute persons living with disability in Kenya.

There are various types of disabilities ranging from physiological, functional to motor impairments.
Some of the common disabilities include:
- Visual impairment
- Auditory impairments
- Intellectual disabilities
- Speech and language disorders
- Physical disabilities

\section*{Recommendations ${ }^{\text {I, } 4}$}

Special programmes are needed to meet the special needs of women with disabilities. These should include:
- Training service providers on providing services to the women with disabilities e.g. in communication skills with sensory disabled and to provide individualized care on types of disability
- Disseminating guidelines for staff on how to deal with persons with disabilities during pregnancy, labour childbirth and in the postnatal period
- Ensure that the existing and proposed physical infrastructure is universally accessible and friendly to PWDs in all aspects to include pregnancy, labour and childbirth and postnatal care
- Integrate reproductive health and HIV/AIDS information and services for PLWD accessing pregnancy, delivery, and postnatal services.
- Designing services that can provide properly packaged information for PWDs.
- Make MCH programmes more inclusive by investing in outreach and family-based approaches:
- Disseminating accessibility standards and guidelines to promote removing the most noticeable architectural barriers in MCH clinics
- Implementing advocacy programmes with the communities to ensure that pregnant women with disabilities demand and use services in both rural and urban areas.
- Finding solutions to the transportation needs of pregnant women with disabilities, e.g. providing vouchers.
- Disability counsellors can provide support for pregnant women living with disabilities and other effective services in the community and the clinics as well. This would contribute to strengthening PHC programmes, which is one of the proposed platforms for meeting Universal Health Coverage

\section*{INTRAPARTUM FETAL SURVEILLANCE}

\section*{Introduction}
- Globally, approximately $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ million births occur every year.' The majority of these are vaginal births among pregnant women with no identified risk factors for complications, either for themselves or their babies, at the onset of labour. ${ }^{1,2}$ However, in situations where complications arise during labour, the risk of serious morbidity and death increases for both the woman and baby.
- Over a third of maternal deaths and a substantial proportion of pregnancy-related lifethreatening conditions are attributed to complications that arise during labour, childbirth or the immediate postpartum period, often as result of haemorrhage, obstructed labour or sepsis. ${ }^{1,2}$ Similarly, approximately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal deaths result from complications during labour and childbirth.'
- The burden of maternal and perinatal deaths is disproportionately higher in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs). Almost all perinatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and half occur intrapartum.
- On admission, women have unknown risk status owing to inadequate prenatal care and suboptimal assessment at first contact with a skilled birth attendant. During labor, women receive suboptimal support, including poor monitoring of their babies, who may die unnoticed. ${ }^{1}$ Therefore, improving the quality of care around the time of birth, especially in LMICs, has been identified as the most impactful strategy for reducing stillbirths, maternal and newborn deaths ${ }^{1}$, compared with antenatal or postpartum care strategies. ${ }^{1}$
- The partograph is associated with improved perinatal outcomes and is recommended for use with intermittent auscultation for intrapartum monitoring in low resource settings. In the active first stage of labour, auscultation is usually performed every $15-30$ minutes, whereas in the second stage it is usually performed every 5 minutes/after every contraction.
- There are facilities that have employed ISIA (Intelligent structured intermittent auscultation) which addresses: Admission Assessment or First Contact in Labour and "Ongoing intermittent auscultation in Active Labour. The findings affirm there is no need for continuous auscultation at admission for low risk mothers but to take due considerations of all elements of the patient care, provide critical thinking and decision making in active labor. ${ }^{1}$

Intelligent Structured Intermittent Auscultation (ISIA): evaluation of a decision-making framework for fetal heart monitoring of low-risk women"

WHO intrapartum fetal surveillance
- Routine cardiotocography is not recommended for the assessment of fetal well-being on labour admission in healthy pregnant women presenting in spontaneous labour. (Not recommended)
- Auscultation using a Doppler ultrasound device or Pinard fetal stethoscope is recommended for the assessment of fetal wellbeing on labour admission. ${ }^{12}$

In making interpretations of CTG tracings there is need to have clear understanding of the pathophysiology of the fetus oxygenation; relate this to intrapartum uterine contractions, underlying maternal / fetal medical and obstetric conditions, have competent staff for decision making and institution of appropriate and timely management with access to a robust and supportive health system to expedite delivery when complications occur.

Continuous monitoring is advocated for high-risk cases for fetal hypoxia/acidosis, whether due to maternal health conditions (such as vaginal haemorrhage and maternal pyrexia), abnormal fetal growth during pregnancy, epidural analgesia, meconium stained liquor, or the possibility of excessive uterine activity, as occurs with induced or augmented labor. Continuous CTG is also recommended when abnormalities are detected during intermittent fetal auscultation.

The use of continuous intrapartum CTG in low-risk women is more controversial, although it has become standard of care in many countries. An alternative approach is to provide intermittent CTG monitoring alternating with fetal heart rate (FHR) auscultation. There is some evidence to support that this is associated with similar neonatal outcomes in low-risk pregnancies.

\section*{Clinical screening of Non reassuring fetal status (NRFS)}

NRFS can be identified in any of the following ways: -
- Fetal heart rate that uses intermittent use of the fetoscope assessed before, during and after a uterine contraction.
- Presence of meconium stained liquor and grade either following spontaneous rupture of membranes or artificial rupture of membranes
- Non-stress testing done when monitoring the fetal heart rate during evaluation of the biophysical profile and doppler studies velocity- middle cerebral artery, umbilical artery (ultrasound)
- Fetal movement by maternal perception
- Fetal pulse oximetry, scalp blood pH assessment
- Fetal surveillance intrapartum: The relation of the passage and power to the passenger during the events of labour (monitored with use of the partograph)
- Fetal Stress testing associated with spontaneous labour or induction of labor or augmentation of labor
- By use of the CTG

\section*{Maternal position for CTG tracing}

The lateral recumbent, half-sitting, and upright positions are preferable alternatives for CTG tracing as the maternal supine position associated with aorto-caval compression by the pregnant uterus, affecting placental perfusion and fetal oxygenation and should be avoided for prolonged duration.

Paper scales have 1 to $3 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{min}$ is recommended ( $1 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{min}$ favorable) but differ with countries. The vertical scale used for registration and viewing may also be different, and available alternatives are 20 or $30 \mathrm{bpm} / \mathrm{cm}$. Important that the clinician familiarizes appropriately with the tracing to make sound judgement

\section*{External versus internal fetal heart monitoring}

External FHR monitoring uses a Doppler ultrasound transducer. External FHR monitoring is more prone to signal loss, to inadvertent monitoring of the maternal heart rate, and to signal artefacts such as double-counting and half-counting, particularly during the second stage of labor. It may also not record fetal cardiac arrhythmias accurately.

Internal FHR monitoring using a fetal electrode. It evaluates the time intervals between successive heart beats by identifying $R$ waves on the fetal electrocardiogram QRS complex, and therefore measures ventricular depolarization cycles. This method provides a more accurate evaluation of intervals between cardiac cycles, but it is more expensive because it requires a disposable electrode.

It requires ruptured membranes and has established contraindications, mainly related to the increased risk of vertical transmission of infections. It should not be used in patients with active genital herpes infection, those who are seropositive to hepatitis B, C, D, E, or to HIV. Fetal electrode placement should also preferably be avoided in very preterm foetuses (under 32 weeks of gestation).

Recommendation: External FHR monitoring is the recommended initial method for routine intrapartum monitoring. If an atypical tracing obtained, then internal fetal heart monitoring can be employed as long as there is no contraindication.

\section*{External versus internal uterine contraction monitoring}

External monitoring of uterine contractions using a tocodynamometer evaluates increased myometrial tension measured through the abdominal wall. This technology only provides accurate information on the frequency of contractions. It is not possible to extract reliable information regarding the intensity and duration of contractions, nor on basal uterine tone.

Internal monitoring of uterine contractions using an intrauterine catheter provides quantitative information on the intensity and duration of contractions, as well as on basal uterine tone, but it is more expensive as the catheter is disposable, and requires ruptured membranes. Contraindications include uterine haemorrhage of unknown cause and placenta Previa. It may
also be associated with a small risk of fetal injury, placental haemorrhage, uterine perforation, and infection. The routine use of intrauterine pressure catheters has not been shown to be associated with improved outcomes in induced and augmented labour, and so it is not recommended for routine clinical use.

\section*{Simultaneous monitoring of maternal heart rate}

CTG monitors provide the possibility of continuous MHR monitoring, either by electrocardiography or pulse oximetry. This is important with fetal heart block and in second stage of labor when accelerations coincide with contractions and expulsive efforts or there is maternal fever.

\section*{ANALYSING A CTG TRACING}

CTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features (baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and contractions) followed by overall CTG classification

A record of the tracing needs to be put in the patient file and with back up archiving accessible to clinical staff for review.

Footnote: bpm = beats per minute.

\section*{DR C BRAVADO}

Determine Risk (DR). The clinical risk status (low, medium, or high) of each foetus is assessed in conjunction with the interpretation of the continuous EFM tracing. A term, low-risk baby may have higher reserves than a foetus that is preterm, growth restricted, or exposed to uteroplacental insufficiency because of Pre-eclampsia. An increase in risk status during labor, such as the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, may necessitate a change in monitoring from structured intermittent auscultation to continuous EFM.

Contractions (C). It is important to review the pressure tracing before assessing the fetal tracing to accurately interpret decelerations. The electronic fetal monitor uses an external pressure transducer or an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) to measure amplitude and frequency of contractions. However, the strength of contractions cannot always be accurately assessed from an external transducer and should be determined with an IUPC, if necessary. Contractions are classified as normal (no more than five contractions in a 10 -minute period) or tachysystole (more than five contractions in a 10 -minute period, averaged over a 30 -minute window). Tachysystole is qualified by the presence or absence of decelerations, and it applies to spontaneous and stimulated labor. The term "hyperstimulation" is no longer accepted, and this terminology should be abandoned.

Baseline Rate. The normal range for baseline FHR is defined as 110 to 160 beats per minute (bpm). A change in baseline FHR is said to occur when the change persists for 10 minutes or longer. A baseline of less than 110 bpm is defined as bradycardia. Mild bradycardia ( 100 to 110 bpm) is associated with post-term infants and occipitoposterior position. Rates of less than 100 bpm may be seen in foetuses with congenital heart disease or myocardial conduction defects. A baseline greater than 160 bpm is defined as tachycardia. This is associated with certain maternal and fetal conditions, such as chorioamnionitis, fever, dehydration, and tachyarrhythmias.

Prolonged deceleration: Late deceleration lasting more than 3 minutes

Late deceleration: These decelerations are indicative of a chemoreceptor-mediated response to fetal hypoxemia. In the presence of a tracing with no accelerations and reduced variability, the definition of late decelerations also includes those with an amplitude of 10-15 bpm.
Prolonged deceleration: These are likely to include a chemoreceptor-mediated component and thus to indicate hypoxemia. Decelerations exceeding 5 minutes, with FHR maintained at less than 80 bpm and reduced variability within the deceleration are frequently associated with acute fetal hypoxia/acidosis and require emergent intervention

Sinusoidal pattern: A regular, smooth, Sinusoidal pattern occurs in association with undulating signal, resembling a sine wave, with an amplitude of $5-15 \mathrm{bpm}$, and a frequency of $3-5$ cycles per minute. This pattern lasts more than 30 minutes, and coincides with absent accelerations

- Cardiac malformations,

Fetal behaviour states: deep sleep (no eye movements), alternating with periods of active sleep (rapid eye movements) and wakefulness. Different behavioural states are a hallmark of fetal neurological responsiveness and absence of hypoxia/acidosis. Deep sleep can last up to 50 minutes and is associated with a stable baseline, very rare accelerations, and borderline variability. Active sleep is the most frequent behavioural state, and is represented by a moderate number of accelerations and normal variability. Active wakefulness is rarer and represented by a large number of accelerations and normal variability. In the latter pattern, accelerations may be so frequent as to cause difficulties in baseline estimation Transitions between the different patterns become clearer after 32-34 weeks of gestation, consequent to fetal nervous system maturation.
Tachysystole (excessive uterine contractions): This represents an excessive frequency of contractions and is defined as the occurrence of more than five contractions in 10 minutes, in two successive 10 -minute periods, or averaged over a 30 -minute period.

\section*{Action in suspected fetal hypoxial acidosis}
- When fetal hypoxia/acidosis is anticipated or suspected i.e. suspicious and pathological CTG tracings, action is required to avoid adverse neonatal outcome.
- Good clinical judgement is required to diagnose the underlying cause for a suspicious or pathological CTG, to judge the reversibility of the conditions with which it is associated, and to determine the timing of delivery, with the objective of avoiding prolonged fetal hypoxia/acidosis, as well as unnecessary obstetric intervention.
- This does not necessarily mean an immediate caesarean delivery or instrumental vaginal delivery. The underlying cause for the appearance of the pattern can frequently be identified and the situation reversed, with subsequent recovery of adequate fetal oxygenation and the return to a normal tracing.
- Excessive uterine activity is the most frequent cause of fetal hypoxia/acidosis and it can be detected by documenting tachysystole in the CTG tracing and/or palpating the uterine fundus.
- It can usually be reversed by reducing or stopping oxytocin infusion, removing administered prostaglandins if possible, and/or starting acute tocolysis with beta-adrenergic agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline, ritodrine), atosiban, or nitroglycerine. During the second stage of labor, maternal pushing efforts can also contribute to fetal hypoxia/acidosis and the mother can be asked to stop pushing until the situation is reversed.
- Aortocaval compression can occur in the supine position and lead to reduced placental perfusion. Excessive uterine activity may also be associated with the supine position, possibly due to the stimulation of the sacral plexus by the uterine weight. In these cases, turning the mother to her left side is frequently followed by normalization of the CTG pattern.
- Transient cord compression is another common cause of CTG changes (variable decelerations), and these can sometimes be reverted by changing the maternal position or by performing amnioinfusion.
- Sudden maternal hypotension can also occur during labor, usually after epidural or spinal analgesia, and it is usually reversible by rapid fluid administration and/or an intravenous ephedrine bolus. Other less frequent complications affecting the maternal respiration, maternal circulation, placenta, umbilical cord, or the fetal circulation can also result in fetal hypoxia/acidosis, and their management is beyond the scope of this document.
- Oxygen administration to the mother is widely used with the objective of improving fetal oxygenation and consequently normalizing CTG patterns, but there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials that this intervention, when performed in isolation, is effective when maternal oxygenation is adequate. Intravenous fluids are also commonly used for the purpose of improving CTG patterns, but again there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials to suggest that this intervention is effective in normotensive women.
- Additional methods may be used to evaluate fetal oxygenation. When a suspicious or worsening CTG pattern is identified, the underlying cause should be addressed before a pathological tracing develops. If the situation does not revert and the pattern continues to deteriorate, consideration needs to be given for further evaluation or rapid delivery if a pathological pattern ensues.
- During the second stage of labor, due to the additional effect of maternal pushing, hypoxia/acidosis may develop more rapidly. Therefore, urgent action should be undertaken to relieve the situation, including discontinuation of maternal pushing, and if there is no improvement, delivery should be expedited.

\section*{Definition}

Augmentation of labour is the process of stimulating the uterus to increase the frequency, duration and intensity of contractions after the onset of spontaneous labour

\section*{Causes}

Common underlying causes include inefficient uterine contractions, abnormal fetal presentation or position, inadequate bony pelvis or soft tissue abnormalities of the mother.

\section*{Indications}
- Augmentation of labour has commonly been used to treat delayed labour when uterine contractions are assessed to be insufficiently strong or inappropriately coordinated to dilate the Cervix
- Augmentation of labour should be performed only when there is a clear medical indication and the expected benefits outweigh the potential harms.
- Retained second twin

\section*{Contraindications}
- Cephalopelvic disproportion. (This principle is relevant for all women but is even more crucial for multiparous women).
- Previous uterine rupture
- Previous Cesarean scar
- Non reassuring fetal status in early labour
- Meconium-stained liquor

\section*{Management}

\section*{Diagnosis}

Can be made by proper history taking and physical examination and monitoring of labour by proper use of partograph

\section*{Treatment/ Augmentation process}

The traditional methods of labour augmentation have been with the use of intravenous oxytocin infusion and artificial rupture of the membranes (amniotomy)

Oxytocin augmentation is recommended in women with ineffective contractions. Oxytocin Augmentation shortens birth outcomes but eventual reduction in instrumental delivery is not documented

\section*{Administration of oxytocin}

IV 5 IU in 500 mls of $\mathrm{N} /$ saline starting at 10 drops $/ \mathrm{min}$ (Primigravida) and titrating by 10 drops $/ \mathrm{min}$ up to a max of $60 \mathrm{drops} / \mathrm{min}$. For Multiparous, start at IV 2.5 IU at $10 \mathrm{drops} / \mathrm{min}$ up to the max of 60drops /min

The fetus should be monitored continuously with CTG when the labour is accelerated with oxytocin

Duration, Strength and frequency of contractions should be continuously recorded on the partograph

\section*{Guiding principles}

The principles are not by themselves specific recommendations but are expected to guide endusers in the process of adapting and implementing the guideline in a range of contexts and settings.
- Application of the recommendations should be based on consideration of the general condition of the woman and her baby, her wishes and preferences, and respect for her dignity and autonomy
- Women undergoing augmentation of labour, particularly with oxytocin, should not be left unattended.
- As the evidence for these recommendations was largely informed by studies conducted among women with pregnancies in cephalic presentation and unscarred uterus, they should not be applied to women with abnormal fetal presentation (including breech) or scarred uterus.
- Augmentation of labour should be performed with caution as the procedure carries the risk of uterine hyperstimulation, with the potential consequences of fetal distress and uterine rupture.
- Wherever augmentation of labour is performed, facilities should be available to closely and regularly monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contraction pattern.
- Augmentation of labour should be carried out in facilities where there is capacity to manage its potential outcomes, including adverse effects and failure to achieve vaginal birth.

\section*{INDUCTION OF LABOUR}

\section*{Introduction}

In Kenya, there is paucity of data but induction of labour is not uncommon and is performed due to various reasons i.e. post-datism, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction among others.

\section*{Recommendations before and during induction of labour}
- Outpatient induction of labour is not recommended ${ }^{1}$
- Foetal surveillance with a non-stress test is recommended.
- Intermittent maternal and foetal heart rate monitoring should be done every hour initially.
- Continuous electronic/more frequent intermittent foetal heart rate monitoring should be started in active labour
- Progress of labour is monitored using partograph/ WHO Labour guide.
- Close watch is kept for temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, foetal heart pattern, vaginal bleeding, uterine hyperstimulation, uterine rupture and scar dehiscence in women with previous caesarean delivery.

\section*{Recommendations at the level of the health system}
- Adequate skill mix staff
- Importance of screening and history taking
- Ascertain gestation where applicable before induction
- Correct use of Partograph/WHO Labour guide
- Ensure availability of all supplies and equipment before induction
- Close Monitoring of client during induction
- Administration of Correct dosages of drugs
- Emergency preparedness in case of failed induction

\section*{Maternal request for induction of labour}

Maternal request with no associated indication should be discouraged as an unnecessary intervention

\section*{Definition}

Induction of labor is done after viability at gestational ages of 28 weeks and above. It's the process of artificially stimulating the uterus to start labour. This is commonly performed when the risks of continuing the pregnancy are perceived to outweigh the risks of shortening the duration of the pregnancy.

\section*{General principles for induction of labour (WHO 2018)}
- The indication and process of induction of labour should be discussed with the patient; have in place a robust health system that can be able to provide comprehensive obstetric care; perform emergency caesarean section or handle complications.
- Induction of labour should be done after obtaining an informed written consent from the patient.
- Maternal and fetal monitoring should be done and the progress of labour should be documented on a partograph/WHO Labour guide
- Induction of labor should be performed only when there is a clear medical indication for it and the expected benefits outweigh its potential harms.
- When inducing labor, consideration must be given to the actual condition, wishes and preferences of each woman, with emphasis being placed on cervical status, the specific method of induction of labor and associated conditions such as parity and rupture of membranes.
- Induction of labor should be performed with caution since the procedure carries the risk of uterine hyperstimulation and rupture and fetal distress.
- Wherever induction of labor is carried out, facilities should be available for assessing maternal and fetal well-being.
- Women receiving oxytocin, misoprostol or other prostaglandins should never be left unattended.
- Failed induction of labor does not necessarily indicate caesarean section.
- Wherever possible, induction of labor should be carried out in facilities where caesarean section can be performed

\section*{Indications}

\section*{Maternal}
- Hypertensive disorders with pregnancy:
- Severe pre-eclampsia.
- Imminent eclampsia.
- Eclampsia.
- Essential hypertension
- Chronic nephritis
- Antepartum haemorrhage:
- Placenta praevia type I\&IIA
- Accidental haemorrhage
- Diabetes mellitus:
- To avoid intrauterine foetal death and dystocia due to macrosomia
- Chorioamnionitis
- Term rupture of membranes with positive culture of maternal group B Streptococcus (GBS)

\section*{Foetal}
- Post-term pregnancy confirmed gestation of $4 \mathrm{I}+$ weeks $^{2}$.
- Intrauterine growth restriction.
- Intrauterine foetal death.
- Rh-isoimmunization.
- Gross congenital anomalies

\section*{Risk factors}
- Premature delivery
- Chorioamnitis
- Non reassuring fetal status

\section*{Management}

\section*{Assessment}

Note: Total score: 13; Favourable Score: 6-13; Unfavourable Score:I-5
- Add I point for: Pre-eclampsia; Each previous vaginal delivery
- Subtract I point for: Postdate pregnancy; Nulliparity; PPROM

\section*{Prerequisites and pre induction assessment}
- Informed written consent
- Review of maternal history and profile
- Evaluation for indications and rule out any contraindications
- Reliable estimation of gestational age, presentation and fetal weight.
- Maternal pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and findings on abdominal palpation must be recorded.
- Evaluation of baseline fetal heart rate pattern by auscultation/electronic fetal monitoring.
- Maternal pelvis assessment and clinical evaluation for possible cephalopelvic or feto-pelvic disproportion including foetal macrosomia ${ }^{3}$.
- Assessment of cervical status using Modified Bishop scoring system to predict the likelihood of success and select appropriate method of induction of labor.
- Indication for induction and gestational age along with Modified Bishop Score should be documented at the time; the decision for induction of labor is made ${ }^{4}$

\section*{Methods of induction:}

\section*{Conservative method}

\section*{Consists of:}
- Stripping of the membranes: by introducing the index or the middle finger into the cervical canal to separate the membranes from the lower uterine segment all around as much as possible. This stimulates natural prostaglandin production.

In most of the cases with favourable Bishop score labour is commenced within 24 hours.
- Sweeping of membranes
- It solely improves the rate of entering spontaneous labour.
- It is suitable for non-urgent indications for term pregnancy termination because interval between sweeping membranes and initiation of labour can be longer than other methods of cervical ripening
- It can be done simultaneously at the time of assessing the cervix after informing the patient.
- It can be repeated if labour does not start spontaneously.
- Mechanical method

Extra-amniotic insertion of foley catheter and inflated to $30-40 \mathrm{mls}$ of normal saline and with sustained traction. The cervix will progressively dilate to $3-4 \mathrm{~cm}$, followed by amniotomy and putting up oxytocin.

It is contraindicated in placenta previa and should be avoided in women with ruptured membranes and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

\section*{Amniotomy}

\section*{Mode of action:}
- Release of prostaglandins.
- Bringing the presenting part closer to the lower uterine segment so the uterine activity will be reflexly encouraged.

\section*{Methods:}
- Forewater (low) amniotomy: Stripping of the membranes is done first, then the forewater is ruptured by amnihook, toothed forceps or Kocher's forceps.
- Hind water (high) amniotomy: The Drew-Smythe catheter is introduced between the membranes and uterine wall to a point above the presenting part.
- Oxytocin should be commenced immediately after amniotomy.
- The majority of deliveries tend to occur within 12 hours.
- Pharmacological modalities
- Oxytocin

Mode of action: It depolarises cell membrane potential and alters permeability to sodium. The maximal sensitivity to oxytocin is achieved by $34-36$ weeks' gestation.

\section*{Method of administration:}

5 units of syntocinon/Oxytocin in 500 ml of normal saline and start the IV drip by 10 drops/min to be increased by $10 \mathrm{drops} / \mathrm{min}$ every 15 min . up to a maximum of $60 \mathrm{drops} / \mathrm{min}$ or until 3 moderate contractions / 10 minutes achieved

The oxytocin drip is continued throughout the second, third and fourth stage of labour to guard against postpartum haemorrhage.

\section*{Failed induction of labour → caesarean section.}

\section*{Prostaglandins}

They induce ripening of the cervix and uterine contractions.

\section*{In living foetus:}
- Dinoprostone intracervical gel ( 3 g gel $/ 0.5 \mathrm{mg}$ dinoprostone) or Prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2} 3 \mathrm{mg}$ tablet is placed in the cervix but not beyond the cervical internal os. The application can be repeated after 6-8hours, not to exceed 3 doses in 24 hours.
- Dinoprostone vaginal pessary 10 mg is placed in the posterior fornix of the vagina for 24 hour

\section*{In dead foetus:}
- Extra-amniotic and intra-amniotic prostaglandin F2a.

\section*{Misoprostol ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}

Misoprostol, a prostaglandin El analog with a mechanism of action that stimulates uterine contractility and cervical ripening. This is a heat stable tablet at room temperature and cheap making it accessible in LMIC.
- Oral misoprostol ( $200 \mu \mathrm{~g}$, 2-hourly) is recommended for induction of labour ${ }^{6}$
- Vaginal low-dose misoprostol ( $25 \mu \mathrm{~g}$, 6-hourly) is recommended for induction of labour.
- Misoprostol is not recommended for women with previous caesarean section. ${ }^{7}$

\section*{Contraindications to Induction of Labour by Cervical Ripening}

Any contraindication for vaginal birth including but not limited to:
- Placenta Previa- type 2B,3\&4, vasa Previa, or a cord presentation
- Abnormal foetal lie or presentation (e.g., a transverse lie or footling breech)
- Prior classical Caesarean section or inverted "T" uterine incision
- Significant previous uterine surgery (i.e., full thickness myometrial incision)
- Active genital herpes simplex virus
- Pelvic structural deformities
- Invasive cervical carcinoma
- Previous uterine rupture
- Estimated weeks of gestation of less than 35 weeks
- Known hypersensitivity to dinoprostone or its constituents
- Abnormal foetal heart rate
- Regular contractions

\section*{Pain relief}
- Women should be informed of the availability of pain relief options.
- Women should be provided pain relief appropriate for them after counselling. This can range from simple analgesics to epidural analgesia.
- Women should be encouraged to use breathing and relaxation techniques in labour.
- There is no need to wait for labour analgesia arbitrarily till the cervical dilation has reached $4-5 \mathrm{~cm} .^{8,9}$
- If given early in labour; it does not affect the progress of labour.
- Pethidine and opioid analgesia can be used for short term pain relief, preferably in early labour ${ }^{10}$

\section*{Complications of induction of labour}
- Failed induction
- Uterine hyperstimulation
- Non reassuring fetal status
- Rupture of uterus

\section*{Failed induction}

\section*{Reassessment of maternal and fetal status}

The following are options for subsequent management:
- Another attempt to induce labour with a different method can be considered after discussion with the patient but it depends on indication of the induction of labor and expedite of delivery
- OR Caesarean delivery

\section*{Outcomes}

\section*{Maternal outcomes}
- Caesarean section: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that induction between 37-42 weeks of gestation probably slightly reduces the caesarean section rate compared with expectant management
- Instrumental vaginal birth: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that induction probably makes little or no difference to the number of women with an operative vaginal birth (forceps or ventouse)
- Postpartum haemorrhage: Low-certainty evidence suggests that induction may make little or no difference to the number of women with postpartum haemorrhage

\section*{Infant outcomes}
- Serious neonatal morbidity: Low-certainty evidence suggests induction may make little or no difference to neonatal trauma
- Moderate-certainty evidence suggests induction probably slightly reduces the number of neonates with meconium aspiration syndrome
- Perinatal death: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that induction between $37-42$ weeks of gestation probably slightly reduces the number of perinatal deaths.
- Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in the number of neonatal deaths (Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that induction probably slightly reduces the number of neonates with poor outcomes
- Admission to neonatal intensive care unit: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that induction probably makes little or no difference to the number of neonates admitted to intensive care

\section*{VACUUM EXTRACTION}

\section*{Definition}

It is traction of the foetal head by a created negative pressure through a cup applied to the head.

\section*{Description}

Vacuum extractor is composed of:
- A specially designed cup with a diameter of $3,4,5$ or 6 cm .
- A rubber tube attaching the cup to a glass bottle with a screw in between to release the negative pressure.
- A manometer fitted in the mouth of the glass bottle to declare the negative pressure.
- Another rubber tube connecting the bottle to a suction piece which may be manual or electronic creating a negative pressure that should not exceed -0.8 kg per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

\section*{Types}

The main difference between vacuum extractors lies in the cup.

\section*{Malmstrom cup}

A metal cup to its centre attached a metal chain passed through the rubber tube. The other end of the chain is attached to a handle for traction.

\section*{Bird's cup}

The suction rubber tube is attached to the periphery of the cup while the handle of traction is attached by a separate short metal chain to the centre of the cup.

\section*{Soft cup}

It is a bell-shaped 6.5 cm diameter soft cup which is made of a firm but supple silastic material.
Advantage: It produces symmetric, less cosmetically alarming caput succedaneum and less scalp abrasions.

Disadvantage: It slips more than the metal cup but with less scalp injuries.

\section*{Recommendations'}
- The need for assisted vaginal birth can be reduced by: dedicated and continuous support during labour (I-A), oxytocin augmentation of inadequate labour (I-A), delayed pushing in women with an epidural (I-A), increased time pushing in nulliparous women with an epidural (I-B), as well as optimization of fetal head position through manual rotation (I-A).
- Encouraging safe and effective assisted vaginal birth by experienced and skilled care providers may be a useful strategy to reduce the rate of primary Caesarean delivery (II-2B).
- Safe and effective assisted vaginal birth requires expertise in the chosen method, comprehensive assessment of the clinical situation alongside clear communication with the patient, support people, and health care personnel (III-B).
- Practitioners performing assisted vaginal birth should have the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to assess the clinical situation, use the selected instrument, and manage complications that may arise from assisted vaginal birth (II-2B).
- Obstetrical trainees should receive comprehensive training in assisted vaginal birth and be deemed competent prior to independent practice (III-B).
- When assisted vaginal birth is deemed to have a higher risk of not being successful, it should be considered a trial of assisted vaginal birth and be conducted in a location where immediate recourse to Caesarean delivery is available (III-B).
- The physician should determine the instrument most suitable to the clinical circumstances and their level of skill. Vacuum and forceps are associated with different short- and long-term benefits and risks. Unsuccessful delivery is more likely with vacuum than forceps (I-A).
- Planned sequential use of instruments is not recommended as it may be associated with an increased risk of perinatal trauma. If an attempted vacuum is unsuccessful, the physician should consider the risks of proceeding to an attempted forceps delivery versus Caesarean section (II-2B).
- Restrictive use of mediolateral episiotomy is supported in assisted vaginal birth (II-2B).
- A debrief should be done with the patient and support people immediately following an attempted or successful assisted vaginal birth. If this is not possible, ideally this should be done prior to hospital discharge and include the indication for assisted vaginal birth, management of any complications, and the prognosis for future deliveries (III-B).
- In a subsequent pregnancy, patients should be encouraged to consider spontaneous vaginal birth. However, care planning should be individualized and patient preference respected (II3B).
- Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for women undergoing operative vaginal birth. (Very low - quality evidence, conditional recommendation ${ }^{2}$ )

\section*{Indications}
- To shorten the duration of second stage e.g. maternal distress in second stage, cardiac disease and CCF
- Non reassuring fetal status in second stage
- During the Ist stage: The small cup 3 or 4 cm may be used in a soft, stretchable cervix of not less than 7 cm dilatation.
- During caesarean section: It may be used to extract the foetal head through the uterine incision.
N.B. Vacuum is not an instrument for rotation of the head but it rotates spontaneously when meets the pelvic floor. Trial to rotate the head with the cup will cause it to slip.

\section*{Contraindications}
- Moderate or severe cephalopelvic disproportion.
- Other presentations than vertex.
- Premature infants.
- Intact membranes.

\section*{Procedure}
- Lithotomy position.
- Antiseptic measures for the vagina, vulva and perineum.
- Vaginal examination to check pelvic capacity, cervical dilatation, presentation, position, station and degree of flexion of the head and that the membranes are ruptured.
- Application of the cup: The largest cup that can easily passed is introduced sideways into the vagina by pressing it backwards against the perineum. It is then applied as near as possible to the posterior fontanelle over the mid sagittal line with its edge 3 cm from the anterior fontanelle. This position will promote flexion of the head and brings the smallest diameters of the fetal skull into the maternal passages. Be sure that there are no cervical or vaginal tissues nor the umbilical cord or a limb in complex presentation is included in the cup.
- Creating the negative pressure: holding the cup in place, the negative pressure is gradually increased by $0.2 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ every I minute until $-0.8 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ is attained. This creates an artificial caput within the cup.
- Traction: on the handle is made perpendicular to the cup and intermittently during uterine contractions, the direction of pull is changing as the head descends through the birth canal.
- Release of the cup: when the head is delivered the vacuum is reduced as slowly as it was created using the screw as this diminishes the risk of scalp damage.

\section*{Bird's safety rules for vacuum extraction:}
- The head must be completely or partially delivered with no more than 3 pulls.
- The head should begin to move with the first pull.
- The cup must not be applied more than thrice
- Application of the cup must not exceed 20 minutes.

NB: Failed vacuum delivery conduct emergency caesarean section

\section*{Advantages of Vacuum over Forceps}
- Anaesthesia is not required so it is preferred in cardiac and pulmonary patient.
- The ventouse is not occupying a space beside the head as forceps.
- Less compression force ( $0.77 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ) compared to forceps ( $1.3 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ) so injuries to the head is less common.
- Less genital tract lacerations.
- Can be applied before full cervical dilatation.
- It can be applied on non-engaged head.

\section*{Complications}

\section*{Fetal:}
- Cephalohaematoma.
- Scalp lacerations.
- Rarely, intracranial haemorrhage.

\section*{Maternal:}
- Vaginal and cervical lacerations.
- Annular detachment of the cervix, cervical incompetence and may be future prolapse if used with incompletely dilated cervix.

\section*{CAESAREAN SECTION}

\section*{Introduction}

A caesarean section (CS) is the process through which a fetus is delivered through an abdominal and uterine incision. ${ }^{5}$

Caesarean sections have become increasingly common over the past three decades. This has resulted in a major public health concern and cause worldwide debates due to potential maternal and perinatal risks associated with this increase, inequity in access and cost issues. ${ }^{9}$ When caesarean sections are undertaken for medical reasons and interventions, the incidences of maternal and neonatal mortality can effectively be reduced. ${ }^{\underline{7}}$

The incidence of caesarean sections is represented as a rate-Caesarean section rate- which is defined as the number of cesarean deliveries over the total number of live births, and is usually expressed as a percentage. ${ }^{5}$ The Caesarean section rate (CS rate) is between $10-15 \%$. When the levels go below 5\%, it indicates inadequate availability and/or access to emergency obstetric care. However, when the levels go beyond $15 \%$, it is thought that caesarean sections are being overused (for non-emergency reasons). ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

Since 1985, the international health care community has considered the ideal rate of caesarean sections to be between $10-15 \%$. Studies done indicate that caesarean section rates rising towards $10 \%$ conferred benefits in terms of reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality, however, rates beyond $10 \%$ had no additional benefit. ${ }^{\frac{10}{}}$

\section*{Epidemiology}

The current estimate of the global caesarean section rate is at $18.6 \%$, ranging from $6.0 \%$ to $27.2 \%$ in the least and more developed regions, respectively. The lowest rates of CS are found in Africa $(7.3 \%)$ and more specifically in Western Africa (3\%). The highest rates of CS are found in Latin American and the Caribbean ( $40.5 \%$ ) and South America is the sub region with the highest average CS rates in the world $(42.9 \%) .^{1}$

In Kenya, according to KDHS 2014, The caesarean section rates stood at 9\%, a finding that was replicated in 'The Increasing Trend in Caesarean Section Rates: Global, Regional and National Estimates: 1990-2014'. ${ }^{1,3}$

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the caesarean section rates are disproportionately high with Sub-Saharan Africa having the highest mortality rates. The rates are higher in countries with low rates of caesarean sections. It has also been noted that in LMICs, caesarean sections done during the second stage of labor (in emergency settings) had higher incidences of maternal and perinatal mortality. Staff capabilities in terms of cadre and medical specialty had no bearing on the outcome of the procedure. ${ }^{16}$

\section*{Recommendations}

\section*{A. INTERVENTIONS TARGETED AT WOMEN}

Recommendation 1. Health education for women is an essential component of antenatal care. The following educational interventions and support programmes are recommended to reduce caesarean births only with targeted monitoring and evaluation.

\section*{(Context-specijic recommendation, Low-certainty evidence)}
- Childbirth training workshops (content includes sessions about childbirth fear and pain, pharmacological pain-relief techniques and their effects, non-pharmacological pain-relief methods, advantages and disadvantages of caesarean sections and vaginal delivery, indications and contraindications of caesarean sections, among others).
- Nurse-led applied relaxation training programme (content includes group discussion of anxiety and stress-related issues in pregnancy and purpose of applied relaxation, deep breathing techniques, among other relaxation techniques).
- Psychosocial couple-based prevention programme (content includes emotional self-management, conflict management, problem solving, communication and mutual support strategies that foster positive joint parenting of an infant). "Couple" in this recommendation includes couples, people in a primary relationship or other close people.
- Psychoeducation (for women with fear of pain; comprising information about fear and anxiety, fear of childbirth, normalization of individual reactions, stages of labour, hospital routines, birth process, and pain relief [led by a therapist and midwife], among other topics).

When considering the educational interventions and support programmes, no specific format (e.g. pamphlet, videos, role play education) is recommended as more effective.
(Low- to moderate-certainty evidence)

\section*{B. INTERVENTIONS TARGETED AT HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS}

Recommendation 2.1. Implementation of evidence-based clinical practice quidelines combined with structured, mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication is recommended to reduce caesarean births in settings with adequate resources and senior clinicians able to provide mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication.
(Context-specific recommendation, High-certainty evidence)

Recommendation 2.2. Implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, caesarean section audits and timely feedback to health-care professionals are recommended to reduce caesarean births.
(Recommended, High-certainty evidence)

\section*{C. INTERVENTIONS TARGETED AT HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS, FACILITIES OR SYSTEMS}

Recommendation 3.1. For the sole purpose of reducing caesarean section rates, collaborative midwiery-obstetrician model of care (j.e. a model of stalfing based on care provided primarily by midwives, with 24 -hour back-up from ancostetrician who provides in-house labour and delivery coverage without other competing clinical duties) is recommended only in the context of rigorous research. This model of care primarily addresses intrapartum capsarean sections.
(Context-specific recommendation, Low-certainty evidence)

Recommendation 3.2. For the sole purpose of reducing unnecessary caesarean sections, financial strategies (i.e. insurance reforms equalizing physician fees for vaginal births and caesarean sections) for health-care professionals or health-care organizations are recommended only in the context of figorous research.
(Context-specific recommendation, Very low-certainty evidence)

\section*{Robson Classification ${ }^{\underline{9}}$}

This system was proposed by WHO in 2015 in order to provide a classification system to monitor and compare CS rates at facility level in a standardized, reliable, consistent and action-oriented manner.

This was arrived at after it was noted that monitoring of CS rates between different settings over periods of time was difficult to interpret and compare due to: differences in hospital factors and infrastructure, differences in the characteristics of the obstetric population served and differences in clinical management protocols.

WHO expects that this classification will help healthcare facilities to:
- Identify and analyze the groups of women which contribute most and least to overall caesarean section rates
- Compare practice in these groups of women with other units who have more desirable results and consider changes in practice
- Assess the effectiveness of strategies or interventions targeted at optimizing the use of caesarean section
- Assess the quality of care and of clinical management practices by analyzing outcomes by groups of women
- Assess the quality of the data collected and raise staff awareness about the importance of this data, its interpretation and use.

The Robson system classifies all women admitted for delivery (not women who've only had a caesarean section) into one of 10 groups based on: number of previous pregnancies, previous uterine scars, current gestation type (singleton vs multiple gestation), gestational age, presentation and lie of the baby (cephalic, breech, transverse) and onset of labor.

\section*{Groups of the Robson Classification}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 51: 10 groups of the Robson classification}
\end{figure}

Note: Groups 2, 4, and 5 have sub classifications to them and they include:
Group 2: Nulliparous women with a single cephalic pregnancy, $\geq 37$ weeks gestation who had labour induced or were delivered by CS before labour

2A: Labour induced
2B: Pre-labour CS
Group 4: Multiparous women without a previous CS, with a single cephalic pregnancy, $\geq 37$ weeks gestation who had labour induced or were delivered by CS before labour

4A: Labour induced
4B: Pre-labour CS
Group 5: All multiparous women with at least one previous CS, with a single cephalic pregnancy, $\geq 37$ weeks gestation
5.1: With one previous CS
5.2: With two or more previous CS

\section*{Classification of urgency of caesarean section and indications ${ }^{\underline{5}}$}

Traditionally, Caesarean sections were termed as either emergency or elective. This can be further classified based on the gestational age and the onset of labor as follows:
- Class I-Emergency caesarean section: immediate threat to the life of the woman or the fetus due to complications such as; Placental abruptio and uterine rupture.
- Class 2- Urgent caesarean section: No immediate risk to the life of the woman or baby but delivery should happen as soon as possible i.e., 3 previous caesarean section scars, meconiumstained liquor
- Class 3-Non- scheduled: Delivery is needed but can fit in with delivery suite workload and allow for fasting/steroid administration and some degree of planning, i.e., preterm IUGR, pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia.
- Class 4- Scheduled: Also referred to as elective. No urgency whatsoever, and procedure planned to suit woman, staff, delivery suite, etc.

\section*{Indications for caesarean sections ${ }^{4,5}$}

Indications for cesarean delivery vary depending on the clinical situation, resources available for patient care, and individual physician management techniques. The decision to perform an abdominal delivery remains a joint judgment between the physician and patient after carefully weighing the pros and cons of a cesarean delivery versus continued labor and/or operative or spontaneous vaginal delivery.

Indications for cesarean delivery can be divided into indications that are of benefit to the mother, the fetus, or both. The indications can either be absolute (where a caesarean section is indicated
beyond reasonable doubt) or Relative (where considerations for vaginal delivery may be made especially in facilities with the required professionals to handle any challenges)

\section*{Absolute indications}
- Absolute disproportion: Small maternal pelvis, making vaginal birth impossible
- Chorioamnionitis (amniotic infection syndrome): Infection of the placenta and possibly of the fetus, requiring immediate delivery
- Maternal pelvic deformity: Anatomical malformation, making vaginal birth impossible
- Eclampsia and HELLP syndrome: Life-threatening complications of pregnancy, usually leading to cesarean delivery
- Fetal asphyxia or fetal acidosis: Life-threatening situations for the fetus that can lead to fetal hypoxia
- Umbilical cord prolapse: Prolapse of the umbilical cord between the head of the fetus and the vaginal opening, which can lead to fetal asphyxia
- Placenta praevia: Anomalous placental position, impeding vaginal delivery
- Abnormal lie and presentation: Anomaly of fetal position that makes vaginal delivery impossible
- Uterine rupture: Acute situation threatening the life of both mother and fetus, requiring immediate delivery by cesarean section
- More than I previous caesarean section scar

\section*{Relative indications}
- Pathological cardiotocography (CTG): May provide indication of acute hypoxia or fetal asphyxia. If fetal acidosis occurs, the birth should be completed either as an instrumental delivery (suction and/or forceps) or by cesarean section
- Failure to progress in labor (prolonged labor, secondary arrest): Delayed delivery or cessation of labor can result in an adverse outcome for the fetus or newborn
- Previous cesarean section: It is widely assumed that having had one cesarean section makes it impossible to have a vaginal delivery in subsequent pregnancies. However, the VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Caesarean delivery) criteria should be applied in instances of one previous scar and judgment based on this

\section*{Criteria for (VBAC) Vaginal Birth after Caesarean Delivery ${ }^{\underline{13}}$}
(I) One previous low-transverse cesarean delivery
(2) Clinically adequate pelvis
(3) No other uterine scars or previous rupture
(4) Availability of skilled personnel available throughout active labor capable of monitoring labor and performing an emergency cesarean delivery. Delivery to be conducted in a comprehensive obstetric neonatal unit and with capability to offer emergency obstetric and neonatal services

\section*{VBAC Scoring System}

This is a model used to predict the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery following a prior cesarean section. This prediction is done when patients are admitted for delivery or labor. The VBAC scoring system is also described as a tool used to identify patients at low, medium and high risk for vaginal delivery after caesarean section (VBAC).

Several scoring systems and tools have been used to predict a successful TOLAC.The commonest scoring system is that of Flamm and Geiger. ${ }^{19}$ The Flamm model has been associated with reasonable predictability for VBAC as well as consistent identification of women at risk for failed trial of labour. The Flamm score has been shown to have a sensitivity of $72 \%$ and specificity of $76 \%$ for prediction of successful VBAC.

Adopted from Flamm BL, Geiger AM. Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: an admission scoring system. Obstet Gynecol 1997; 90:909

The Flamm and Geiger scoring system includes the following criteria;
- age of patient
- history of previous vaginal delivery
- indication of previous caesarean section
- cervical dilatation
- cervical effacement at time of admission

The higher the Flamm and Geiger VBAC score, the higher the probability of a vaginal delivery following a prior cesarean section.

Flamm et al VBAC scoring model interpretation: Example - adopted from aafp Point-ofcare guides "Predicting the Likelihood of Successful Vaginal Birth after Cesarean Delivery" October 152007

\section*{Example}
"A 25-year-old, non-Hispanic, white woman with a body mass index (BMI) of $25 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ is in labor. Her cervix is 3 cm dilated and about 30 to 40 percent effaced. She has had one previous pregnancy, which resulted in cesarean delivery because of failure to progress. She wonders how likely it is that a trial of labor will be successful.

Answer: Using the Flamm rule, the patient receives two points for age and one for cervical effacement. The total score of 3 gives her a $60 \%$ probability of vaginal delivery."

\section*{Caesarean section technique}

Evaluation: Involves history taking and thorough clinical examination with evaluation of the indications (absolute and relative) as to why a caesarean section is indicated. ${ }^{5}$

Consent taking: The person performing the procedure is responsible for checking that written informed consent has been given. ${ }^{\underline{\text { }}}$

Pre-op evaluation: involves having the necessary laboratory investigations done i.e. full haemogram, grouping and cross matching, renal function tests, blood clotting tests

Having an anesthetist review and women who are likely to develop anesthesia related complications should be clearly noted. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$

\section*{Adherence to the WHO Surgical Checklist ${ }^{17}$}

\section*{Patient preparation}
- Administration of prophylactic antibiotics at CS before skin incision ${ }^{6}$
- Placing the patient in the left lateral tilt position using either a hip wedge or an operative table with lateral tilt capability will help minimize uterine compression of the inferior vena cava. ${ }^{5}$
- Insertion of a Foley catheter should be placed to allow the bladder to drain during the operation keeping the operative field clear and allowing urinary output to be evaluated intraoperatively. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$
- Abdominal preparation: involves shaving of the abdominal area and doing the social wash and aseptic cleaning of the surgical site ${ }^{5}$
- Draping of the patient

\section*{Surgical principles ${ }^{\underline{\mathbf{5}}}$}

The surgery should be carried out with adequate but not excessive access. Gentle handling and respect of tissues and meticulous attention to hemostasis are essential and important factors in all aspects of surgery.

Anatomical knowledge should be thorough in order to avoid unplanned damage, especially when pathology is encountered.

\section*{Skin incision ${ }^{\underline{\mathbf{5}}}$}

An adequate skin incision for sufficient access (about 12 cm ) should be made in one sweeping motion using the belly of the scalpel. A number of skin incisions have been used in abdominal deliveries: Two lower abdominal- transverse (Pfannenstiel and Joel-Cohen) and one midline vertical.

Transverse incisions fall along the lines of expression of the anterior abdominal wall and therefore should create less pronounced scarring and risk of dehiscence. Transverse incisions have also been associated with less postoperative pain. Midline vertical incisions are generally more hemostatic and require less dissection; therefore, less time from incision to birth

\section*{Pfannenstiel incision}

It is the most common type of skin incision used in caesarean sections.
The Pfannenstiel incision is made transversely in the maternal abdomen approximately $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the symphysis pubis and is curvilinear, with the lateral apices of the incision smiling up toward the anterior superior iliac spines.

In the moderately obese patient, a variation of the Pfannenstiel incision is performed a few centimeters higher than the true Pfannenstiel to avoid placing the incision in the fold created by the abdominal pannus and thereby decreasing the rate of wound complications.

\section*{Joel-Cohen incision}

The Joel-Cohen incision is performed in a transverse manner above the location of a Pfannenstiel incision and is linear, not curvilinear.

\section*{Midline vertical incisions}

Historically, the midline vertical skin incision was the preferred incision for cesarean section because of the speed and ease of entry into the peritoneal cavity with minimal dissection required. They however remain useful in situations where access high on the uterus is needed.

The incision is performed vertically from just below the umbilicus and extended to just above the symphysis pubis and can easily be extended around the umbilicus if exposure of the upper abdomen is required. When making a midline vertical incision, it is important to remember that the linea nigra may not represent the true midline.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 52: The various skin incisions used when performing a caesarean section}
\end{figure}

\section*{Adopted from GLOWM 5}

A: Pfannenstiel incision should be made in a curvilinear fashion approximately $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the pubic symphysis.
B. Joel-Cohen incision should be made in a linear fashion approximately $2-3 \mathrm{~cm}$ above the traditional placement of the Pfannenstiel incision.
C. Midline vertical incision should be made in the midline and extend from just below the umbilicus to just above the symphysis pubis and may be continued around the umbilicus if more exposure is necessary

\section*{Exposure and access to the uterus ${ }^{5}$}

There are three standard uterine incisions that can be performed for delivery of the fetus: low transverse, low vertical, and classical.

The specific type of uterine incision should be determined by the primary surgeon at the time of the operation based on gestational age and lie of the fetus and any uterine anomalies. One of the important factors to be assessed before incising the uterus is the width of the lower segment (the distance between the broad ligaments). This should be assessed in relation to the size of the baby to decide whether a transverse or longitudinal incision is most appropriate. In either case, the peritoneum needs to be reflected inferiorly before the uterine incision is made

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-338.jpg?height=1534&width=1678&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=239}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 53: The various uterine incision used when performing a caesarean section}
\end{figure}

\section*{Adopted from GLOWM 5}
- Low-transverse uterine incision should be made through the thin, non-contractile portion of the lower uterine segment in a curvilinear fashion. Also pictured is a low-vertical incision, which is made through the non-contractile lower uterine segment in a vertical fashion.
- J-extension of the low-transverse incision. When additional exposure to the uterine cavity is required to deliver the fetus, the low-transverse incision can be extended laterally and cephalic to increase the length of the incision without endangering the uterine arteries.
- T-extension in the midline.
- The classical uterine incision is made through the contractile portion of the myometrium above the bladder reflection.

\section*{Cephalic presentation ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}

Delivery is performed by the surgeons placing their dominant hand into the lower uterine cavity and elevating the fetal head into the uterine incision. If the fetus is not in an occipito-transverse position, rotating the head into this position will allow the fetal neck to flex laterally around the upper portion of the incised myometrium and deliver into the wound with the aid of fundal pressure. Each shoulder should be gently delivered in turn followed by the trunk of the baby.

If the head is high and delivery is difficult, the Wrigley's forceps or Kiwi ventouse cup can be applied to gently guide out the baby's head.

When the fetal head is impacted in the maternal pelvis, such as in deep transverse arrest or cesarean at full dilatation, there are a number of options to assist with delivery of the fetal head. The surgeon can place a hand in the lower uterine segment in the standard fashion to cup the head and wait until the uterus relaxes before trying to disengage it. Trying to disimpact the head whilst the uterus is contracting is unlikely to work, it will risk extension of the uterine angles, will promote continued uterine tone, and may cause fetal trauma. If waiting does not help, the anesthetists can relax the uterus using a tocolytic such as terbutaline or glyceryl trinitrate GTN.

If this does not work, an assistant can place a sterile, gloved hand into the vagina from the introitus and disengage the fetal head from below but again this should not be performed while the uterus is contracting.

\section*{Breech presentation ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}

In breech cesarean, if the legs are extended the operator's right hand should be cupped around the bottom and the breech delivered by lateral flexion while the assistant exerts fundal pressure. Alternatively, a foot (recognized by the heel) can be held and the legs delivered first. In either situation the fetal back should be kept anterior, and completion of the delivery is again achieved by fundal pressure with minimal traction: as in the vaginal breech delivery, the shoulders should be delivered with gentle rotation, and a modified Maurcieu Smellie Veit technique can then be used to facilitate delivery of the head.

If the baby is transverse, a foot should be identified and the baby delivered as breech. In this circumstance, leaving the membranes intact for as long as possible will facilitate the internal rotation of the baby.

\section*{Delivery of the placenta}

Attention is now turned to the delivery of the placenta. Spontaneous delivery of the placenta, when assisted with uterine massage, 10 IU of intravenous oxytocin and gentle traction on the umbilical cord. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$

Once the placenta has been delivered, the uterine cavity should be checked to ensure it is empty ${ }^{5}$
Offer women prophylactic antibiotics at CS to reduce the risk of postoperative infections. Choose antibiotics effective against endometritis, urinary tract and wound infections, which occur in about $8 \%$ of women who have had a CS. ${ }^{6}$

\section*{Closing of the uterus}

Closing the uterus after cesarean section is best performed with a double layer technique to reduce incidences of uterine rupture as in single closure. ${ }^{5,6}$

The suture material should be of a short-term absorbable (such as polyglycolic acid or polyglactin) as the uterus involutes postnatally and sutures loosen, to avoid loops of thread being present in the pelvis for any longer than necessary. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$

Both uterine angles should be identified, sutured and tied securely.
For two-layer closure the first layer includes the deep myometrial edge with minimal decidua. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 54: The two-layer closure of the uterine lower segment cesarean incision}
\end{figure}

\section*{Adopted from GLOWM ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}

\section*{Closing}

Closure of the peritoneum: Neither the visceral nor the parietal peritoneum should be sutured at CS because this reduces operating time and the need for postoperative analgesia, and not associated with untoward maternal outcome ${ }^{6}$

Closure of the abdominal wall: In the rare circumstances that a midline abdominal incision is used at CS, mass closure with slowly absorbable continuous sutures should be used because this results in fewer incisional hernias and less dehiscence than layered closure. ${ }^{\underline{6}}$

Closure of subcutaneous tissue: Routine closure of the subcutaneous tissue space should not be used, unless the woman has more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat, because it does not reduce the incidence of wound infection ${ }^{5,6}$

Closure of skin: The skin should then be closed with a subcuticular stitch. Subcuticular stitches have been associated with less immediate postoperative pain and are more cosmetically appealing at 6 weeks when compared to the stapling device. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Post-operative care:}
- In the first hour after an uncomplicated cesarean section, the patient should be monitored closely in a recovery area where urine output, pulse, blood pressure, respirations, and any evidence of bleeding can be closely observed ${ }^{5}$
- Rooming in should be initiated once the patient is stable and the patient may then be transferred to the post-partum ward ${ }^{5}$
- Early mobilization should be encouraged
- The wound should be cared for in the standard manner, with occlusive dressings removed on the first postoperative day and the wound examined daily during the hospitalization for evidence of infection or hematoma. ${ }^{\underline{5}}$
- The patient may be discharged when she is able to care for herself and her newborn. Many patients are ready to leave the hospital by postoperative day 2 or $3 .^{\underline{5}}$
- Discharge instructions should include patient education concerning expectations on activity level, lochia, breastfeeding or milk suppression, contraception, and newborn care, and the plans for suture removal. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Complications from Caesarean sections}

\section*{Intraoperative complications ${ }^{\mathbf{4}, \mathbf{5}}$}
- Organ injury i.e., urinary tract injuries, Gastro-intestinal tract injuries
- Anesthesia related morbidity and mortality
- Post-partum haemorrhage due to adherent placenta

\section*{Post-operative complications ${ }^{\mathbf{4}, \mathbf{5}}$}
- Wound site infections
- Endomyometritis
- Increased risk of thromboembolic disease i.e. deep venous thrombosis
- Incomplete scar healing
- Uterine scar rupture
- Adhesion formation

\section*{Risk for subsequent pregnancies ${ }^{\mathbf{4}} \boldsymbol{,} \mathbf{5}$}
- Operative delivery
- Disorders of placentation i.e. placenta previa, adherent placenta
- Preterm deliveries
- Reduced fertility

\section*{Peri-mortem Caesarean Delivery}
- A perimortem caesarean delivery is defined as a caesarean section performed during imminent cardiac arrest or active cardiac arrest, with the ultimate goal to successfully resuscitate the mother and improve fetal survivability. It is also referred to as resuscitative hysterotomy. ${ }^{\underline{11}}$
- The possible etiology of cardiac arrest in pregnancy includes: anesthetic complications, haemorrhage, cardiovascular diseases, drugs, emboli, fever and hypertension. ${ }^{\underline{14}}$
- Physiological changes in pregnancy and the effects of the gravid uterus, have been shown to have an effect on maternal systemic circulation. This has made perimortem caesarean delivery an option in instances where the maternal status does not improve albeit adequate resuscitation. ${ }^{\underline{14}}$
- During resuscitation, it has been noted that with the term gravid woman lying on her back, chest compressions were ineffective due to aortocaval obstruction. Paradoxically, after perimortem delivery, it has been found that resuscitation attempts are more feasible with increased rates of maternal revival. $\underline{11}, \underline{12}, \underline{14}$
- A perimortem caesarean delivery or rather the decision to conduct a perimortem caesarean delivery should be made within the first four minutes of failed resuscitation to avoid end organ damage secondary to hypoperfusion thereby ensuring possible maternal and neonatal survival. However, studies have shown chances of neonatal survival even after 15 minutes of failed resuscitation attempts. ${ }^{\underline{11}, \underline{12}, \underline{14}}$

\section*{Caesarean hysterectomy}
- Caesarean hysterectomy refers to the removal of the uterus after conducting a caesarean delivery. Caesarean hysterectomy can be classified into three categories: Emergent, Indicative non-emergent and Elective cases. ${ }^{15}$
- Emergent cases: This describes a scenario in which a caesarean section has been carried out, then certain complications emerge intraoperatively that necessitate a hysterectomy. These complications include: adherent placenta and post-partum haemorrhage that does not respond to initial treatment modalities. ${ }^{15}$
- Indicative non-emergent cases: This describes a case where, a woman is known to have a certain condition and a hysterectomy is indicated as the best treatment modality after delivery of the fetus. These include: Cervical cancer, uterine fibroids and adnexal disease. ${ }^{15}$
- Elective cases: these are instances in which a woman makes the conscious decision to have the uterus removed after delivery. This is mostly done as a form of permanent contraception (Sterilization). ${ }^{15}$

\section*{Surgical technique ${ }^{15}$}

A caesarean hysterectomy encompasses two separate procedures in one:
- Caesarean section delivery
- Hysterectomy
- The fetus is delivered through the same recommended caesarean section technique with removal of the placenta (if feasible).
- In instances where an adherent placenta was suspected preoperatively, then it is recommended that the incisions made are away from the placenta to avoid excessive bleeding.
- The uterus is then brought out through the abdominal incision.
- The hysterectomy technique is similar to that performed in a routine hysterectomy. However, physiologic changes in the maternal pelvis that accompany pregnancy result in various challenges during the procedure. Therefore, the increased vasculature of the uterus (size and tortuosity) is of concern.
- Clamping and division of the round ligaments
- Opening of the uterovesical fold (using monopolar diathermy) and reflection of the bladder from the lower uterine segment
- Lateral incision of the broad ligament (this is done parallel to the infundibulo-pelvic ligament)
- Dissection of the loose areolar tissue encountered to enable visualization of the retroperitoneal space and the ureter throughout its course. Note that the loose areolar tissue is more pronounced due to pregnancy.
- Clamping and ligation of the tubal and ovarian ligament.
- Free dissection and displacement of the bladder below the operative field. The challenges encountered may be presence of adhesive bands which may necessitate sharp dissection.
- Clamping of the uterine vessels so as to diminish the uterine blood supply. Most surgeries are done with an aim to conserve the ovaries (unless infundibulo-pelvic ligament hematomas occur). This is done by placing the clamps close to the uterus.
- Based on the hemostatic stability of the patient/or reason that necessitated the caesarean hysterectomy, the surgeon decides between performing a total or subtotal hysterectomy. The subtotal hysterectomy is preferred in unstable patients since the operative time is substantially shortened.
- Amputation of the uterus and approximation of the cervical stump in an anterior-to-posterior fashion using interrupted figure-of-eight ligatures.
- Further dissection is done with an aim to identify the junction between the cervix and the vagina. The cervix is then amputated and the vaginal vault is then secured.
- If bladder injury is suspected, then the integrity of the bladder is tested through use of opaque solutions with the surgical field inspected for any spills. If injury is confirmed, then repair should be done and integrity confirmed again before closure. Postoperative antibiotic coverage and Foley catheter drainage of the bladder should then be continued for 7-10 days.

\section*{Complications from cesarean hysterectomy}

\section*{Intraoperative complications ${ }^{\boldsymbol{1} \mathbf{5}}$}
- Haemorrhage
- Urological injury i.e. to the bladder, ureters
- Fistula formation
- Maternal mortality

\section*{Post-operative complications ${ }^{\mathbf{1 5}}$}
- Post-operative infections (wound infection, urinary tract infections, vaginal vault infections)
- Intestinal obstruction due to paralytic ileus
- Venous thromboembolism
- Early menopause
- Increased risk of post-operative death

\section*{Reducing unnecessary C/S using non - clinical interventions ${ }^{\mathbf{1 7}}$}

This incorporates the views, fears and beliefs of both women and health professionals about caesarean sections. It also considers the complex dynamics and limitations of health systems and organizations and relationships between women, health professionals and organization of health care services.
- Labour and child birth education
- Clinical guidelines and second opinion
- Clinical guidelines audit and feedback
- Collaborative midwifery - obstetrician model of service delivery

\section*{FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD BIRTH}

\section*{Introduction}

FGM is practised for a variety of complex reasons and socio- culturally is believed that it is beneficial for the girl. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and interferes with the natural function of girls and women's bodies with no health benefit but detrimental reproductive health consequences. These risks increasing with the severity of the procedure. FGM is a human rights violation and a form of child abuse, breaching the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is a severe form of violence against women and girls. In Kenya this harmful practice is illegal and includes the medicalization of the same.

\section*{Epidemiology}

FGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15 . More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is concentrated. The practice is also encountered in Europe and North America mostly in immigrant communities from countries where the prevalence is high.

In Kenya the prevalence of Female genital mutilation in women aged $15-49$ is $21 \%^{\prime}$. The region with the highest prevalence is the North-Eastern $-42.6 \%$.

\section*{Recommendation}
- Advocating for all women for early antenatal bookings, counselling them about outcomes, complications of $\mathrm{FGM}^{3}$
- If the woman has arrived in the ward in $2^{\text {nd }}$ stage of labour, explain to her the need to increase the opening by performing an episiotomy- ${ }^{8}$
- Use of a Partograph to detect poor progress of labour ${ }^{4}$
- Post-partum, check for tears on the vulva and inside birth canal and if there is bleeding or tears in the birth canal take appropriate action immediately

\section*{Definition}

Female genital mutilation, also known as 'female genital cutting', 'female genital mutilation/cutting' or 'cutting', refers to 'all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons'

\section*{Aetiopathogenesis}

The practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many settings, health care providers perform FGM due to the erroneous belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized ${ }^{5}$. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures.

\section*{FGM classification ${ }^{\mathbf{5}}$}

Female genital mutilation is classified into 4 major types.
Type I: Often referred to as clitoridectomy, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).

Type II: Often referred to as excision, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).

Type III: Often referred to as infibulation, this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).

Type IV: This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area.

De-infibulation refers to the practice of cutting open the sealed vaginal opening in a woman who has been infibulated, which is often necessary for improving health and well-being as well as to allow intercourse or to facilitate childbirth

\end{figure}

\section*{Risk Factors}

Procedures are mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and adolescence, and occasionally on adult women. Globally, more than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk for FGM annually (UNICEF 2013).
- Where FGM is a social convention (social norm), the social pressure to conform to what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community, are strong motivations to perpetuate the practice. In some communities, FGM is almost universally performed and unquestioned.
- FGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage.
- FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered acceptable sexual behavior. It aims to ensure premarital virginity and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist extramarital sexual acts. When a vaginal opening is covered or narrowed (type 3), the fear of the pain of opening it, and the fear that this will be found out, is expected to further discourage extramarital sexual intercourse among women with this type of FGM.
- Where it is believed that being cut increases marriageability, FGM is more likely to be carried out.
- FGM is associated with cultural ideals of femininity and modesty, which include the notion that girls are clean and beautiful after removal of body parts that are considered unclean, unfeminine or male.
- Though no religious scripts prescribe the practice, practitioners often believe the practice has religious support.
- Religious leaders take varying positions with regard to FGM: some promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination.
- Local structures of power and authority, such as community leaders, religious leaders, circumcisers, and even some medical personnel can contribute to upholding the practice.
- In most societies, where FGM is practiced, it is considered a cultural tradition, which is often used as an argument for its continuation.
- In some societies, recent adoption of the practice is linked to copying the traditions of neighboring groups. Sometimes it has started as part of a wider religious or traditional revival movement.

\section*{Prevention}
- Change traditions with support of older generation
- Educate girls on the rights to decide what happens to their body
- Speak out (Advocacy) on the reality and risk of FGM
- Spread understanding that religion does not demand FGM
- Tackle the secrecy that allows cutting to continue
- Keep pushing for FGM to be banned- The family, community and government to support ending FGM by enforcing FGM law Act 2011
- Enforce laws on eradication of Medicalisation of FGM

\section*{Outcome of FGM}

\section*{Immediate complications can include:}
- Severe pain
- Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage)
- Genital tissue swelling
- Fever
- Infections e.g., tetanus
- Urinary problems
- Wound healing problems
- Injury to surrounding genital tissue
- Shock
- Death

\section*{Long-term consequences can include:}
- Urinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);
- Vaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);
- Menstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);
- Scar tissue and keloid;
- Impaired sexual function (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);
- Increased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) And new-born deaths;
- Need for later surgeries: for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (type 3) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation). Sometimes genital tissue is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing both immediate and long-term risks;
- Psychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.);

\section*{Management of childbirth in a woman with FGM}

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Detailed history taking
- Physical examination -inspection of external genitalia and classification of the type of FGM

\section*{Antenatal booking visits:}
- Ask all women about FGM
- Women who have undergone Type I, II and III FGM must be examined at their first antenatal attendance to assess the degree of damage.
- Type I, II, and III FGM can produce severe vulval and vaginal scarring, which may cause obstruction during assessment and delivery
- Record the appearance of the vulva on the clients ANC card -Can help avoid unnecessary future examination

\section*{Management during labor}
- IF FGM has caused a tight introitus there is a need to increase the vaginal opening by performing an episiotomy
- Women with type I, tend to be able to deliver vaginally without episiotomy unless there is extensive scarring causing inelasticity of the perineum
- Women with type III: must be opened up during the second stage of labor when the presenting part is pressing on the vulva
- EPISIOTOMY usually performed during the second stage of labor however can be performed earlier
- If a woman presents with type III C/S is more appropriate than deinfibulation and vaginal delivery;
- Explain the need for operation and seek her consent to perform it
- Or refer her to a CEMONC

\section*{Postpartum management}
- Check for retained products make sure uterus is well contracted
- Check the bladder -empty if necessary, or administer uterotonics drugs
- Check for tears on the vulva and inside the birth canal
- if there is bleeding or tears take appropriate action immediately
- provide counselling to woman about outcome /complications/future management

Remember women with FGM are at risk of:
- PPH
- Urinary retention
- Secondary bleeding due to retained products
- Infection
- Tissue injury
- VVF
- Neonatal asphyxia

\section*{MALPRESENTATIONS AND MALPOSITIONS}

\section*{BREECH PRESENTATION}

\section*{Introduction}

It accounts for $3.5 \%$ of term singleton deliveries and about $25 \%$ of cases before 30 weeks of gestation as most cases undergo spontaneous cephalic version up to term. It is more common in preterm deliveries. It is associated with uterine and congenital abnormalities, has a significant recurrence risk and is more common in nulliparous women. Term babies presenting by the breech have worse outcomes than cephalic ones, irrespective of the mode of delivery. Breech delivery carries a perinatal mortality risk of 2.0 per 1000 compared to a perinatal mortality risk of 0.5 per 1000 for caesarean section and 1.0 per 1000 cephalic vaginal birth.

In breech presentation, labour and birth carry increased risk of morbidity and mortality compared to cephalic presentation. Caesarean delivery is often recommended as a safer method of birth for breech presentation, but carries risk for the mother both immediately and in future pregnancies.

While vaginal birth could be safely completed, patients need to be carefully selected for their suitability, thoroughly counselled and delivered in appropriate facilities where skilled personnel are available.

External Cephalic Version (ECV), a procedure to turn the foetus from a breech to a cephalic presentation, can reduce the incidence of breech presentation in labour and should be offered to some mothers late in the pregnancy.

\section*{Recommendations for breech presentation '}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline RECOMMENDATION & LEVEL OF EVIDENCE \\
\hline Women with a breech presentation at term should be offered external cephalic version (ECV) unless there is an absolute contraindication. They should be advised on the risks and benefits of ECV and the implications for mode of delivery & A \\
\hline Women who have a breech presentation at term following an unsuccessful or declined offer of ECV should be counselled on the risks and benefits of planned vaginal breech delivery versus planned caesarean section. & A \\
\hline Women should be informed that planned caesarean section leads to a small reduction in perinatal mortality compared with planned vaginal breech delivery. Any decision to perform a caesarean section needs to be balanced against the potential adverse consequences that may result from this. & A \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Women should be informed that the reduced risk is due to three factors: the avoidance of stillbirth after 39 weeks of gestation, the avoidance of intrapartum risks and the risks of vaginal breech birth, and that only the last is unique to a breech baby

Women should be informed that when planning delivery for a breech baby, the risk of perinatal mortality is approximately $0.5 / 1000$ with caesarean section after $39^{+0}$ weeks of gestation; and approximately $2.0 / 1000$ with planned vaginal breech birth. This compares to approximately $1.0 / 1000$ with planned cephalic birth.
Selection of appropriate pregnancies and skilled intrapartum care may allow planned vaginal breech birth to be nearly as safe as planned vaginal cephalic birth

Women should be informed that planned vaginal breech birth increases the risk of low Apgar scores and serious short-term complications, but has not been shown to increase the risk of long-term morbidity

Clinicians should counsel women in an unbiased way that ensures a proper understanding of the absolute as well as relative risks of their different options

What information should women having breech births be given about their own immediate and future health?
Women should be informed that planned caesarean section for breech presentation at term carries a small increase in immediate complications for the mother compared with planned vaginal birth.
Women should be informed that maternal complications are least with successful vaginal birth; planned caesarean section carries a higher risk, but the risk is highest with emergency caesarean section which is needed in approximately $40 \%$ of women planning a vaginal breech birth.

Antenatal assessment

Following the diagnosis of persistent breech presentation, women should be assessed for risk factors for a poorer outcome in planned vaginal breech birth. If any risk factor is identified, women should be counselled that planned vaginal birth is likely to be associated with increased perinatal risk and that delivery by caesarean section is recommended.

Intrapartum assessment and management of women presenting unplanned with breech presentation in labour Where a woman presents with an unplanned vaginal breech labour, management should depend on the stage of labour, whether factors associated with increased complications are found, availability of appropriate clinical expertise and informed consent.

Women should be informed that induction of labour is not usually recommended. Augmentation of slow progress with oxytocin should only be considered if the contraction frequency is low in the presence of epidural analgesia.

Birth in a hospital with facilities for immediate caesarean section should be recommended with planned vaginal breech birth, but birth in an operating theatre is not routinely recommended

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline RECOMMENDATION & LEVEL OF EVIDENCE \\
\hline Women should be informed that routine caesarean section for breech presentation in spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended. The mode of delivery should be individualised based on the stage of labour, type of breech presentation, foetal wellbeing and availability of an operator skilled in vaginal breech delivery. & C \\
\hline Women should be informed that the evidence is limited, but that planned caesarean section for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech is recommended & C \\
\hline Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births. Adherence to the guidelines is recommended to reduce the risk of intrapartum complications & C \\

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}

Skilled and experience of birth attendant
The presence of a skilled birth attendant is essential for safe vaginal breech birth.

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}

Units with limited access to experienced personnel should inform women that vaginal breech birth is likely to be associated with greater risk and offer antenatal referral to a unit where skill levels and experience are greater. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}

Intrapartum assessment and management of women presenting unplanned with breech presentation in labour

Where a woman presents with an unplanned vaginal breech labour, management should depend on the stage of labour, whether factors associated with increased complications are found, availability of appropriate clinical expertise and informed consent. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}

Women near or in active second stage of labour should not be routinely offered caesarean section. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}

Where time and circumstances permit, the position of the foetal neck and legs, and the foetal weight should be estimated using ultrasound, and the woman counselled as with planned vaginal breech birth. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}

All maternity units must be able to provide skilled supervision for vaginal breech birth where a woman is admitted in advanced labour and protocols for this eventuality should be developed. [New 20I7]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}

What is appropriate intrapartum management of the term breech?
Are induction and augmentation appropriate?
Women should be informed that induction of labour is not usually recommended. Augmentation of slow progress with oxytocin should only be considered if the contraction frequency is low in the presence of epidural analgesia. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: D}

What is the role of epidural analgesia?

Women should be informed that the effect of epidural analgesia on the success of vaginal breech birth is unclear, but that it is likely to increase the risk of intervention. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}

What foetal monitoring should be recommended?
Women should be informed that while evidence is lacking, continuous electronic foetal monitoring may lead to improved neonatal outcomes. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: D}

Where should vaginal breech birth take place?

How should a first twin in breech presentation be delivered?
- Women should be informed that the evidence is limited, but that planned caesarean section for a twin pregnancy where the presenting twin is breech is recommended. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}
- Routine emergency caesarean section for a breech first twin in spontaneous labour, however, is not recommended. The mode of delivery should be individualised based on cervical dilatation, station of the presenting part, type of breech presentation, foetal wellbeing and availability of an operator skilled in vaginal breech delivery. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}

How should a second twin in breech presentation be delivered?
- Routine caesarean section for breech presentation of the second twin is not recommended in either term or preterm deliveries.

\section*{Grade of recommendation: B}

What organisational and governance arrangements should be in place to support a routine vaginal breech delivery service?
- Simulation equipment should be used to rehearse the skills that are needed during vaginal breech birth by all doctors and midwives.

\section*{Grade of recommendation: ✓}
- Guidance for the case selection and management of vaginal breech birth should be developed in each department by the healthcare professionals who supervise such births. Adherence to the guidelines is recommended to reduce the risk of intrapartum complications. [New 2017]

\section*{Grade of recommendation: C}
- Departments should consider developing a checklist to ensure comprehensive counselling of the woman regarding planned mode of delivery for babies presenting by the breech. [New 2017]

\section*{Definition}

Breech Presentation is defined as a longitudinal lie in which the buttocks are the presenting part with or without the lower limbs.

\section*{Aetiology}

In general, the foetus is adapted to the pyriform shape of the uterus with the larger buttock in the fundus and smaller head in the lower uterine segment. Any factor that interferes with this adaptation, allows free mobility or prevents spontaneous version, can be considered a cause for breech presentation as:
- Prematurity: due to
- relatively small foetal size,
- relatively excess amniotic fluid, and
- More globular shape of the uterus.
- Multiple pregnancy: one or both will present by the breech to adapt with the relatively small room.
- Poly-and oligohydramnios.
- Hydrocephalus.
- Intrauterine foetal death.
- Bicornuate and septate uterus.
- Uterine and pelvic tumours.
- Placenta praevia.

\section*{Types}

\section*{Complete breech:}
- The feet present beside the buttocks as both knees and hips are flexed.
- More common in multipara.

\section*{Incomplete breech:}

\section*{Frank breech:}
- Accounts for approximately $85 \%$ of all breech babies
I. It is breech with extended legs where the knees are extended while the hips are flexed.
2. More common in primigravida.
- Footling presentation:
I. The hip and knee joints are extended on one or both sides.
2. More common in preterm singleton breeches.
- Knee presentation:
I. The hip is partially extended and the knee is flexed on one or both sides.

\section*{Positions}
- Left sacro-anterior.
- Right sacro-anterior.
- Right sacro-posterior.
- Left sacro-posterior.
- Left and right sacro- transverse (lateral).
- Direct sacro-anterior and posterior.

Sacro-anterior positions are more common than sacro-posterior as in the first the concavity of the foetal front fits into the convexity of the maternal spines.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Second or subsequent pregnancies.
- History of premature labor and birth.
- Previous history of breech presentation
- Maternal obesity
- Smoking
- Multiple gestation
- Premature labour
- Poly/oligohydramnios
- Uterine abnormalities, such as fibroids or abnormally shaped uterus.
- Placenta Previa
- Short umbilical cord

\section*{Prevention of Breech presentation}
- Provision of ECV after 36 weeks of gestation.

\section*{Technique of External version}
- Woman lying on her back, legs half bent, bladder empty.
- Perform when the uterus is relaxed.
- First, push back the breech or shoulder, which is often down in the pelvis (vertical movement), then attempt rotation slowly, and always in the direction of foetal flexion: Thus bringing either the head or the breech to the pelvic inlet by the shortest possible route.
- Monitor the fetal heart rate after each attempt, and stop if the rate slows. In most cases, foetal heart rate abnormalities improve within 30 minutes.
- External version should be followed by 24 hours of bed rest and monitoring.
- Prevention of primary caesarean sections

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{During pregnancy}
- Inspection:
- A transverse groove may be seen above the umbilicus in sacro-anterior which corresponds to the neck.
- If the patient is thin, the head may be seen as a localised bulge in one hypochondrium.
- Palpation:
- Fundal grip: the head is felt as a smooth, hard, round ballottable mass which is often tender.
- Umbilical grip: the back is identified and a depression corresponds to the neck may be felt.
- First pelvic grip: the breech is felt as a smooth, soft mass continuous with the back. Trial to do ballottement to the breech shows that the movement is transmitted to the whole trunk.
- Auscultation:
- FHS is heard above the level of the umbilicus. However, in frank breech it may be heard at or below the level of the umbilicus.
- Ultrasonography: It is used for the following:
- To confirm the diagnosis.
- To detect the type of breech.
- To detect gestational age and foetal weight: Different measures can be taken to determine the foetal weight as the biparietal diameter with chest or abdominal circumference using a special equation.
- To exclude hyperextension of the head.
- To exclude congenital anomalies.
- Diagnosis of unsuspected twins.

\section*{During Labour}

In addition to the previous findings, vaginal examination reveals;
- The 3 bony landmarks of breech namely 2 ischial tuberosities and tip of the sacrum.
- The feet are felt beside the buttocks in complete breech.
- Fresh meconium may be found on the examining fingers.
- Male genitalia may be felt.

\section*{Mechanism of Labour}
- Delivery of the buttocks
- The engagement diameter is the bitrochanteric diameter 10 cm which enters the pelvis in one of the oblique diameters.
- The anterior buttock meets the pelvic floor first so it rotates $1 / 8$ circle anteriorly.
- The anterior buttock hinges below the symphysis and the posterior buttock is delivered first by lateral flexion of the spines followed by the anterior buttock.
- External rotation occurs so that the sacrum comes anteriorly.
- Delivery of the shoulders
- The shoulders enter the same oblique diameter with the bisacromial diameter 12 cm (between the acromial processes of the scapulae).
- The anterior shoulder meets the pelvic floor first, rotates I/8 circle anteriorly, hinges under the symphysis, then the posterior shoulder is delivered first followed by the anterior shoulder.
- Delivery of the after-coming head
- The head enters the pelvis in the opposite oblique diameter.
- The occiput rotates $1 / 8$ circle anteriorly, in case of sacro- anterior position and $3 / 8$ circle anteriorly in case of sacro- posterior position.
- Rarely, the occiput rotates posteriorly and this should be prevented by the obstetrician.
N.B.

The head is delivered by movement of flexion in:
- Direct occipito-posterior (face to pubis).
- Face mento-anterior.
- The after coming head in breech presentation.

The head is delivered by extension in normal labour only i.e. occipito - anterior positions.

\section*{Interventions in breech presentation}

\section*{External Cephalic Version}

It regains its importance after increased rate of caesarean sections nowadays.
Timing: this should be conducted at 36 weeks and in facilities able to provide comprehensive obstetric care.

Version is not done earlier because:
- Spontaneous version is liable to occur.
- Return to breech presentation is liable to occur.
- If labour occurs the foetus will have a lesser chance for survival.

Version is difficult after 37th weeks due to:
- Larger foetal size.
- Relatively less liquor.
- More irritability of the uterus.

The aim:
- To detect cephalo-pelvic disproportion.
- Cephalic delivery is safer for the mother and foetus.

Success rate: 50-70\%.

\section*{Causes of failure:}
- Large sized foetus.
- Oligo- or polyhydramnios.
- Short umbilical cord.
- Uterine anomalies as bicornuate or septate uterus.
- Irritable uterus. Tocolytic drugs may be started 15 minutes before the procedure to overcome this.
- Obesity.
- Rigid abdominal wall.
- Frank breech because the legs act as a splint.

\section*{Contraindications:}
- Contracted pelvis.
- Multiple pregnancy.
- Hydrocephalus.
- Antepartum haemorrhage.
- Uterine scar.
- Hypertension as the placenta is more susceptible to separation.
- Elderly primigravida.
- Ruptured membranes.
- Anaesthesia during version is contraindicated as pain is a safeguard against rough manipulations.

\section*{Complications:}
- Accidental haemorrhage due to separation of the placenta.
- Rupture of membranes.
- Preterm labour.
- Foetal distress.
- Cord presentation or prolapse.
- Entangling of the cord around the foetus.
- Isoimmunisation in Rh-negative mothers due to foetal-maternal transfusion.

\section*{Caesarean Section}

\section*{Indications:}
- Large foetus i.e., $>3.75 \mathrm{~kg}$ estimated by ultrasound.
- Preterm foetus but estimated weight is still more than 1.25 kg .
- Footling or complete breech: as the presenting irregular part is not well fitting with the lower uterine segment leading to;
- Less reflex stimulation of uterine contractions.
- Susceptibility to cord prolapse.
- Early bearing down as the foot passes through partially dilated cervix and reaches the perineum.
- Hyperextended head: diagnosed by ultrasound or X-ray.
- Contracted pelvis: of any degree.
- Uterine dysfunction.
- Complicated pregnancy with:
- Hypertension.
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Placenta praevia.
- Pre - labour rupture of membranes for $\geq 12$ hours.
- Post-term.
- Intrauterine growth retardation.
- Placental insufficiency.
- Primigravidas: breech in primigravida equals caesarean section in opinion of most obstetricians as the maternal passages were not tested for delivery before.

\section*{Vaginal Delivery}

\section*{Prerequisites:}
- Frank breech.
- Estimated foetal weight not more than 3.75 kg .
- Gestational age: 36-42 weeks.
- Flexed head.
- Adequate pelvis.
- Normal progress of labour by using the partograph
- Uncomplicated pregnancy.
- Multiparas.
- An experienced obstetrician.
- In case of intrauterine foetal death.
N.B.

During vaginal delivery, premature foetuses are more susceptible to:
- Hypoxia,
- Trauma, and
- Retained after-coming head as the partially dilated cervix allows the passage of the body but the less compressible relatively larger head will be retained.

However, caesarean section should only be done if the premature foetus has a reasonable chance of post - natal survival.

\section*{Management of Vaginal Breech Delivery}
- First stage: In early labour prepare for caesaren section
- Second stage: The foetus may be delivered by one of the following methods:

\section*{Spontaneous breech delivery:}

This rarely occurs in multipara with adequate pelvis, strong uterine contractions and small sized baby. The baby is delivered spontaneously without any assistance but perineal lacerations may occur.

\section*{Assisted breech delivery:}

This is the method of delivery in majority of cases.
The assistance is indicated for delivery of the shoulders and after-coming head and the infant is allowed to be delivered up to the umbilicus spontaneously.
- Delivery of the buttocks:
- The golden rule is to "Keep your hands off".
- The patient is asked to bear down during uterine contractions and relax in between until the perineum is distended by the buttocks.
- An episiotomy is done especially in primigravida to avoid much lateral flexion of the spines, perineal lacerations and intracranial haemorrhage due to sudden compression and decompression of the after - coming head.
- The legs are hooked out but without traction.
- When the umbilicus appears, a loop of the cord is hooked to prevent traction or compression of the cord and detect its pulsation.
- The foetus is covered with warm towel to prevent premature stimulation of respiration.
- Delivery of the shoulders:
- Gentle steady downward traction is applied to the foetal pelvic girdle during uterine contractions with gradual rotation of the foetus to bring the shoulders in the antero-posterior diameter of the pelvis.
- When the anterior scapula appears below the symphysis, both arms are delivered by hooking the index finger at the elbow and sweep the forearm across the chest of the foetus
- The back is rotated anteriorly.
- Kristeller manoeuvre: gentle fundal pressure is done during uterine contractions to guide the head into the pelvis and maintain its flexion.
- Delivery of the after-coming head:

It is delivered by one of the following methods:

\section*{Jaw flexion- shoulder traction (Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit) method:}
- Two fingers of the left hand, (as originally described) or better on the malar eminencies (the maxillae) to avoid dislocation of the jaw.
- The index and ring finger of the right hand are placed on each shoulder while the middle finger is pressing against the occiput to promote flexion and act as a splint for the neck, preventing hyperextension and hence cervical spine injury.
- Traction is commenced downwards and backwards till the nape of the foetus appears, the body is lifted towards the mother's abdomen.

\section*{Burns - Marshall's method:}

The foetus is left hanging so that its weight exerts gentle downwards and backwards traction. When the nape appears, grasp the feet and lift the body towards the mother's abdomen.

\section*{Forceps:}
- Piper's forceps is more suitable than the ordinary forceps as it has a perineal but not pelvic curve and has longer shanks. It is applied from the ventral aspect of the foetus.
- Traction is applied downwards and backwards till the nape appears, then downwards and forwards to deliver the head by flexion.
- Forceps delivery has the following advantages:
- It promotes flexion of the head.
- Traction is applied on the head and not on the neck.
- It prevents sudden compression and decompression of the head.
- It protects the head from compression by pelvic bones or rigid perineum.

\section*{Breech extraction:}

\section*{Indications:}
- Maternal or foetal distress.
- Prolonged second stage.
- To shorten the second stage in maternal respiratory and heart diseases.
- Prolapsed pulsating cord with fully dilated cervix.

\section*{Technique: Like assisted breech delivery except that: -}
- It is done under general anaesthesia.
- Both legs are bringing down.
- Traction on the legs is done helped by fundal pressure to deliver the breech and the trunk.
- The after - coming head is delivered by jaw flexion - shoulder traction or forceps.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Groin traction:}

\section*{Living foetus:}
- Traction is done by the index or the index and middle fingers put in the anterior groin in a downward and backward direction.
- The traction is done towards the trunk to avoid dislocation of the femur.
- Traction is done during uterine contractions and aided by fundal pressure.
- When the posterior buttock appears traction is done by the 2 index fingers in both groins in a downward and forward direction.

\section*{Dead foetus:}

Groin traction is done by breech hook.
- Bringing down a leg (Pinard's method):
- Under general anaesthesia.
- Press by 2 fingers in the popliteal fossa of the anterior leg to flex it then grasp the ankle and bring it down. This will prevent the anterior buttock from over-riding the symphysis pubis.
- If the posterior leg was brought down first it must be rotated anteriorly with the trunk, then bring the other leg which is now becomes posterior.
N.B: The foot has the following features differentiating it from the hand:
- Presence of the heel.
- Absence of the mobile thumb.
- The toes are shorter than the fingers.

\section*{Arrest of the shoulders}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Causes & Management \\
\hline Extension of the arms: due to traction on the breech before full dilatation of the cervix. & \begin{tabular}{l}

\hline Nuchal position of the arm: The forearm is displaced behind the neck due to rotation of the trunk in a wrong direction. & Rotation of the foetal trunk in the direction of the fingertips of the displaced arm. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Classical method:}
- Under epidural or general anaesthesia.
- As there is more space posteriorly, bring down the posterior arm first by using 2 fingers pressing against the cubital fossa and sweep the arm in front of the foetal body to avoid fracture humerus.
- The anterior arm is then brought down by the same manoeuvre. If this is difficult rotate the body 180 degrees to make the anterior arm posterior and bring it down.

\section*{Lövset method:}
- Under epidural or general anaesthesia.
- Gentle downward and backward traction is applied to the foetus by grasping its pelvis till the inferior angle of the anterior scapula appears, the foetal trunk is rotated 180 o to bring the posterior shoulder anteriorly emerging beneath the symphysis pubis. So the arm can be brought down.
- The trunk is again rotated 180 o in the opposite direction to bring the other shoulder anteriorly emerging beneath the symphysis so the second arm can be brought down.
- The back should be kept always anterior during rotation.

\section*{Arrest of the after - coming head}

\section*{Prague manoeuvre:}
- When the occiput rotates posteriorly and the head extends, the chin hangs above the symphysis pubis.
- Foetus is grasped from its feet and flexed towards the mother's abdomen, while the other hand is doing simultaneous traction on the shoulders to deliver the head by flexion.

\section*{Complications of Breech Delivery}

\section*{Maternal:}
- Prolonged labour with maternal distress.
- Obstructed labour with its sequelae may occur as in impacted breech with extended legs.
- Laceration especially perineal.
- Postpartum haemorrhage due to prolonged labour and lacerations.
- Puerperal sepsis.
- Foetal:

\section*{Foetal mortality:}
- Is about $4 \%$ in multipara and $8 \%$ in primigravida which may be due to:
- Intracranial haemorrhage: is the commonest cause of death due to sudden compression and decompression of the head as there is no gradual moulding of the head.

This can be avoided by:
- Forceps delivery of the after -coming head.
- Episiotomy.
- Slow delivery of the head.
- Vitamin K to the mother early in labour.
- Fracture dislocation of the cervical spines prevented by avoiding lifting the body towards the mother's abdomen until the nape appears below the symphysis.
- Asphyxia due to:
- Cord prolapse or compression by the head.
- Premature stimulation of respiration leading to inhalation of mucus, liquor or blood. This can be avoided by covering the body of the foetus with warm towels during delivery.
- Rupture of an abdominal organ: from rough manipulations avoided by grasping the foetus from its hips only.
- Non-fatal injuries:
- Fracture femur, humerus or clavicle.
- Dislocation of joints or lower jaw.
- Injury to the external genitalia.
- Brachial plexus injury.
- Lacerations to the sternomastoid muscles

\section*{TRANSVERSE LIE}

\section*{Introduction}

A transverse lie constitutes an absolute foeto-pelvic disproportion, and vaginal delivery is impossible. This is an obstetric emergency, because labour is obstructed and there is a risk of uterine rupture and foetal distress.

\section*{Definition}

Transverse lie refers to a foetal presentation in which the foetal longitudinal axis lies perpendicular to the long axis of the uterus. It can occur in either of two configurations:
- The curvature of the foetal spine is oriented upward (also called "back up" or dorsosuperior), and the foetal small parts and umbilical cord present at the cervix.
- The curvature of the foetal spine is oriented downward (also called "back down" or dorsoinferior), and the foetal shoulder presents at the cervix.

\section*{Possible causes}
- Grand multiparity
- Uterine malformation
- Twin pregnancy
- Prematurity
- Placenta praevia
- Foeto-pelvic disproportion
- Pendulous abdomen
- Polyhydramnios
- Pelvic inlet contracture and / or foetal macrosomia
- Uterine abnormalities (e.g. bicornuate uterus or uterine fibroids)
- Foetal anomaly (e.g. tumours of the neck or sacrum, hydrocephaly, abdominal distension)
- Poorly formed lower segment
- Wrong dates (i.e. more premature than appears)

\section*{Associated risk factors}
- Cord presentation or prolapse if membranes rupture or at the onset of labour
- foetal hypoxia if left unattended in labour
- Shoulder presentation and transverse lie in labour
- Uterine rupture

\section*{Diagnosis}

This diagnosis should be made before labour begins, at the final prenatal visit before the birth.
The uterus is very wide: the transverse axis is virtually equivalent to the longitudinal axis; fundal height is less than 30 cm near term

\section*{On examination:}
- Head in one side, breech in the other.
- Vaginal examination reveals a nearly empty true pelvis or a shoulder with-sometimes-an arm prolapsing from the vagina.

\section*{Interventions}

At the end of pregnancy
- External version 4 to 6 weeks before delivery, in a CEmONC facility. If this fails, delivery should be carried out by caesarian section, either planned or at the beginning of labor.

\section*{Twin pregnancy}
- External version is contraindicated. If the first twin is in a transverse lie (unusual): schedule a caesarian section. If the second twin is in a transverse lie: there is no strict indication for caesarian section, but plan delivery in a CEmONC facility so that it can be performed if necessary. Deliver the first twin and then depending on the evidence of the operator, perform external and/or internal version of the second twin.

\section*{During labour, in a CEmONC facility}
- The fetus is alive and the membranes intact:

Gentle external version, between 2 contractions, as early as possible, then proceed as with a normal delivery. If this fails, then caesarian section should be performed
- The foetus is alive and the membranes ruptured

\section*{Complete dilation:}
- Multipara with relaxed uterus and mobile fetus, and an experienced operator: internal version and total breech extraction.
- Primipara, or tight uterus, or immobile foetus, or engaged arm, or scarred uterus or insufficiently-experienced operator: caesarean section.

\section*{Incomplete dilation:}

Perform caesarian section. Caesarian section can be difficult due to uterine retraction. Vertical hysterotomy is preferable. To do the extraction, get hold of a foot in the fundus (equivalent to a total breech extraction but by caesarian section)

\section*{The foetus is dead}
- Embryotomy for transverse lie.

\section*{During labour, in remote settings where surgery is not available}

\section*{The foetus is alive and the membranes intact}
- Try to refer the patient to a CEmONC facility. Otherwise: attempt external version as early as possible. If this fails, wait for complete dilation. In order to perform version under the proper conditions, perform general or spinal anesthesia, depending on what is possible
- Perform an external version combined with an internal version, perhaps using various positions (Trendelenburg or knee-chest).

\section*{External version}

A procedure to convert a transverse lie into a longitudinal (cephalic or breech) presentation, or a breech presentation into a cephalic presentation.

\section*{Conditions for external version}
- Pregnancy near term (37 weeks LMP)
- Prior to labour, or at the very start of labour
- Relaxed uterus
- No obstacle to vaginal delivery
- Membranes intact

External version is very rarely associated with complications. Complications have, however, been reported (placental abruption, rupture of a scarred uterus and foeto-maternal haemorrhage). Therefore, this manoeuvre should only be attempted in a CEmONC facility.

\section*{Contra-indications of external version.}

\section*{Absolute}
- Placenta Previa
- Twin pregnancy (for the first twin)

\section*{Relative}
- Fetal distress
- Severe intrauterine growth restriction
- Prematurity
- Scarred uterus
- HIV infection

Note: in case of transverse lie when referral is not possible, in the interest of the mother external version may be attempted to permit vaginal delivery, without taking into account relative contraindications.

\section*{Technique of External version}
- Woman lying on her back, legs half bent, bladder empty.
- Perform when the uterus is relaxed.
- First, push back the breech or shoulder, which is often down in the pelvis (vertical movement), then attempt rotation slowly, and always in the direction of foetal flexion: Thus bringing either the head or the breech to the pelvic inlet by the shortest possible route.
- Monitor the fetal heart rate after each attempt, and stop if the rate slows. In most cases, foetal heart rate abnormalities improve within 30 minutes.
- External version should be followed by 24 hours of bed rest and monitoring.

\section*{Internal Version}

Manual intrauterine procedure to convert one presentation to another, usually a transverse lie into a breech

\section*{Indications and conditions for Internal version}
- Shoulder presentation during labour, at complete dilation with a relaxed uterus. This manoeuvre should be performed with extreme caution (risk of uterine rupture).
- Delivery of a second twin in cephalic presentation or transverse lie: version to bring the foetus into the breech position and allow a total breech extraction.
- Conditions necessary in all cases: normal pelvis, presenting part not engaged, bladder empty.
- Grasping one or both feet is best done through membranes that have been left intact.

\section*{Technique of Internal Version}
- Strict asepsis: swab perineum with $10 \%$ polyvidone iodine, wear sterile gloves.
- Perform anesthesia if possible.
- Insert the hand and determine the position of the fetus: with the fingers in the form of a cone, go through the vaginal opening and the cervix toward the fundus; hold the fundus in place with the other hand on the abdomen.
- Grasp one foot or if possible both feet, firmly, without haste but not too slowly, since a prolonged maneuver might cause the uterus to contract. It is better not to rupture the membranes immediately because the uterine retraction and lack of amniotic fluid will make it difficult to grasp and move the fetus. The membranes will spontaneously rupture when pulling the foot or will be artificially ruptured once the foot is down.
- Pull the foot/feet gently to the vaginal opening.
- The delivery then continues as a breech delivery, ending with a total extraction if a twin, or normally, if not.
- Manually explore the uterus after delivery of the placenta (to look for uterine rupture), and administer routinely antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin or ampicillin slow IV: 2 g as a single dose)
- For patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin (urticaria, respiratory problems or oedema): clindamycin IV, 900 mg as a single dose.

\section*{Transverse lie and shoulder presentation}

The foetus is alive and the membranes ruptured
REFER the patient to a CEmONC facility. Otherwise:
- Complete dilation:
- put the woman into the knee chest position.
- Between contractions, push the fetus back and try to engage his head.
- Vacuum extraction and sympysiotomy at the lightest difficulty.
- Incomplete dilation:
- Trendelenburg position and watchful waiting until complete dilation.

\section*{The foetus is dead}
- REFER the patient, even if referral takes some time. Otherwise, embrotomy for transverse lie
- Can perform caesarean section

\section*{UNSTABLE LIE OF THE FOETUS}

\section*{Introduction}

Unstable lie refers to the frequenly changing of fetal lie and presentation in late pregnancy beyond 37 weeks and impacts on labour and delivery process. At earlier gestations the fetus due to prematurity can alter their lie and presentation.

\section*{Contributing factors}
- High parity
- Pendulous abdomen
- Placenta praevia
- Polyhydramnios
- Pelvic inlet contracture and / or fetal macrosomia
- Uterine abnormalities (e.g. bicornuate uterus or uterine fibroids).
- Foetal anomaly (e.g. tumours of the neck or sacrum, hydrocephaly, abdominal distension)
- Distended maternal urinary bladder > Poorly formed lower segment
- Wrong dates (i.e. more premature than appears)
- Undiagnosed twins

\section*{Management}

Diagnosis: Usually made when a varying foetal lie is found on repeated clinical examination in the last month of pregnancy.

\section*{General principles}
- $85 \%$ of foetal lies will become longitudinal before rupture of the membranes or labour I
- Abdominal palpation to assess for polyhydramnios
- Pelvic examination as indicated (assess pelvic size and shape)
- Ultrasound to exclude mechanical cause
- Inform woman of need for prompt admission to hospital if membranes rupture or when labour starts
- Hospital admission from 37 weeks onwards is recommended
- Immediate clinical assistance if membranes rupture or signs of labour
- May attempt external version to cephalic presentation in early labour with access to facilities for immediate delivery if indicated
- If cephalic presentation is maintained (spontaneously or otherwise) manage as normal

\section*{Intrapartum management}

If SROM occurs, perform vaginal examination to exclude the presence of a cord or malpresentation.

\section*{Vaginal and pelvic assessment}
- Establish presentation
- Exclude cord presentation
- Assess if polyhydramnios
- Assess cervical dilatation

\section*{If the lie is longitudinal:}
- Normal labour management.

\section*{If the lie is not longitudinal:}
- Consider external version to correct the lie.

CAUTION must be done in a health facility equipped to provide comprehensive Obstetric and neonatal care and under skilled health personnel.
- A stabilising ARM should be done with caution
- Bladder distention can cause a changing foetal lie; encourage the woman to void before performing any procedures.

\section*{If the lie is not longitudinal and cannot be corrected:}
- Emergency Caesarean section

\section*{Complications}
- Cord presentation or prolapse if membranes rupture or at the onset of labour
- Foetal hypoxia if left unattended in labour
- Shoulder presentation and transverse lie in labour
- Uterine rupture Diagnosis

\section*{OCCIPITO- POSTERIOR POSITION}

\section*{Introduction}

Definition: It is a vertex presentation with foetal back directed posteriorly.
The incidence is $10 \%$ at onset of labour. Right occipito-posterior (ROP) is more common than left occipito-posterior (LOP) because:
- The left oblique diameter is reduced by the presence of sigmoid colon.
- The right oblique diameter is slightly longer than the left one.
- Dextro-rotation of the uterus favours occipito-posterior in right occipito-posterior position.

\section*{Aetiology}
- The shape of the pelvis: anthropoid and android pelvises are the most common cause of occipito-posterior due to narrow fore-pelvis.
- Maternal kyphosis: The convexity of the foetal back fits with the concavity of the lumbar kyphosis.
- Anterior insertion of the placenta

Other causes of malpresentation such as:
- Placenta praevia,
- Pelvic tumours,
- Pendulous abdomen,
- Polyhydramnios,
- Multiple pregnancy.

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{During pregnancy}

\section*{Inspection:}
- The abdomen looks flattened below the umbilicus due to absence of round contour of the foetal back.
- A groove may be seen below the umbilicus corresponding to the neck.
- Foetal movement may be detected near the middle line.

\section*{Palpation:}
- Fundal grip:
- The breech is felt as a soft, bulky, irregular non-ballotable mass.
- Umbilical grip:
- The back felt with difficulty in the flank away from the middle line.
- The anterior shoulder is at least 3 inches from the middle line.
- The limbs are easily felt near, or on both sides, of the middle line.
- First pelvic grip:
- The head is usually not engaged due to deflexion.
- The head is felt smaller and escapes easily from the palpating fingers as they catch the bitemporal diameter instead of the biparietal diameter in occipito-anterior.
- Second pelvic grip:
- The head is usually deflexed.

\section*{Auscultation:}
- FHS are heard in the flank away from the middle line.
- In major degree of deflexion, the FHS may be heard in middle line.

\section*{During labour}

In addition to the previous findings vaginal examination reveals:
- The direction of the occiput.
- The degree of deflexion.

\section*{Mechanism of Labour}

A certain degree of deflexion is present due to:
- Opposition of the two convexities of the foetal and maternal spines prevents flexion and promotes deflexion.
- The longer biparietal diameter $(9.5 \mathrm{~cm})$ enters the narrow sacro-cotyloid diameter $(9 \mathrm{~cm})$ while the shorter bitemporal diameter $(8 \mathrm{~cm})$ enters the longer oblique diameter $(12 \mathrm{~cm})$.

As a result of deflexion, the occipito-frontal diameter 11.5 cm enters the pelvis leading to delayed engagement.

Taking in consideration the rule that the part of the foetus that meets the pelvic floor first will rotate anteriorly, the degree of deflexion determines the mechanism of labour as follow:

\section*{Normal mechanism (90\%)}

Deflexion is corrected and complete flexion occurs. The occiput meets the pelvic floor first, long anterior rotation $3 / 8$ circle occurs bringing the occiput anteriorly and the foetus is delivered normally.

\section*{Abnormal mechanism (10\%)}
- Deep transverse arrest ( $1 \%$ ):

In mild deflexion, the occiput rotates $1 / 8$ circle anteriorly and the head is arrested in the transverse diameter.
- Persistent occipito-posterior (3\%):

In moderate deflexion, the occiput and sinciput meet the pelvic floor simultaneously, no internal rotation and the head persists in the oblique diameter.
- Direct occipito-posterior (face to pubis) (6\%):

In marked deflexion, the sinciput meets the pelvic floor first, rotates I/8 circle anteriorly and the occiput becomes direct posterior.

In deep transverse arrest and persistent occipito-posterior no further progress occurs and labour is obstructed as the head cannot be delivered spontaneously.

In direct occipito-posterior, the head can be delivered by flexion supposing that the uterine contractions are strong and there is no contracted pelvis. However, perineal lacerations are more liable to occur as:
- The vulva is distended by the large occipito-frontal diameter 11.5 cm ,
- The perineum is overstretched by the large occiput.

\section*{Factors favour long anterior rotation}
- Well flexed head
- Good uterine contractions.
- Roomy pelvis.
- Good pelvic floor.
- No premature rupture of membranes.

\section*{Causes of failure of long anterior rotation}
- Deflexed head.
- Uterine inertia.
- Contracted pelvis: rotation of the head cannot easily occur in android pelvis due to projection of the ischial spines and convergence of the side walls.
- Lax or rigid pelvic floor.
- Premature rupture of membranes or its rupture early in labour.

\section*{Management of Labour}

\section*{First stage}
- Exclude contracted pelvis.
- Exclude presentation or prolapse of the cord.
- Inertia and prolonged labour are expected so oxytocin may be indicated unless there is contraindication.
- Contractions are sustained, irregular and accompanied by marked backache which needs analgesia as pethidine or epidural analgesia.
- Avoid premature rupture of membranes by: -
- Bed rest,
- No straining,
- Avoiding high enema,
- Minimizing vaginal examinations.
- The other management and observations as in normal labour.

\section*{Second stage}
- Wait for $\mathbf{6 0 - 9 0}$ minutes.
- During this period:
- Observe the mother and foetus carefully.
- Combat inertia by oxytocin unless it is contraindicated.
- Contraindications of oxytocin:
- Disproportion.
- Incoordinate uterine action.
- Uterine scar e.g. previous C.S, hysterotomy, myomectomy, metroplasty or previous perforation.
- Grand multipara.
- Foetal distress.
- One of the following will occur:

Long internal rotation $\mathbf{3} / \mathbf{8}$ circle: occurs in about $\mathbf{9 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ of cases and delivery is completed as in normal labour.

\section*{Direct occipito-posterior (face to pubis):}
- Occurs in about $6 \%$ of cases.
- The head can be delivered spontaneously or by aid of outlet forceps.
- Episiotomy is done to avoid perineal laceration.

\section*{Deep transverse arrest ( $1 \%$ ) and persistent occipito-posterior (3\%):}

The labour is obstructed and one of the following should be done:

\section*{Vacuum extraction (ventouse):}

Proper application as near as possible to the occiput will promote flexion of the head.
Traction will guide the head into the pelvis till it meets the pelvic floor where it will rotate.
- Manual rotation and extraction by forceps:
- Under general anaesthesia the following steps are done:
- Disimpaction: the head is grasped bitemporally and pushed slightly upwards.
- Flexion of the head.
- Rotation of the occiput anteriorly by the right hand vaginally aided by:
- Rotation of the anterior shoulder abdominally towards the middle line by the left hand or an assistant.
- Fix the head abdominally by an assistant, apply forceps and extract it.
- Caesarean section:

\section*{It is indicated in:}
- Failure of the above methods.

\section*{Other indications for CS are:}
- Contracted pelvis
- Placenta Praevia
- Prolapsed pulsating cord before full cervical dilatation, and
- Elderly primigravida.
- Craniotomy: If the foetus is dead.

\section*{Prognosis}

Increase in maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality occur with malposition and malpresentation. Such deliveries are widely associated with increased risk of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS), ' sometimes leading to long-term maternal sequelae including incontinence of flatus and/or faeces, and there are also concerns surrounding the mode of delivery in future pregnancies. Following a third or fourth degree tear women require follow-up with individualised discussion of future mode of delivery. Where women are experiencing symptoms attributed to the injury, elective CS is advised. Asymptomatic women are supported in opting for vaginal birth. It is widely known that OASIS risk is reduced by rotating and delivering the foetal head into the OA position. ${ }^{2}$

NB. Non progressive $2^{\text {nd }}$ Stage is considered if delivery will not have occurred within 30 minutes

\section*{SHOULDER DYSTOCIA}

\section*{Introduction}

The overall incidence of shoulder dystocia varies based on fetal weight, occurring in 0.6 to 1.4 percent of all infants with a birth weight of $2,500 \mathrm{~g}$ to $4,000 \mathrm{~g}$, increasing to a rate of 5 to 9 percent among fetuses weighing 4,000 to $4,500 \mathrm{~g}$ born to mothers without diabetes. However, most cases occur in fetuses of normal birth weight and are not anticipated, limiting the clinical usefulness of risk-factor identification. Shoulder dystocia occurs with equal frequency in primigravid and multigravid women ${ }^{7}$.

\section*{Definition}

Shoulder dystocia is the failure of the shoulders to spontaneously deliver following delivery of the baby's head due to impaction of the shoulders behind the symphysis pubis'.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 60: Shoulder dystocia}
\end{figure}

\section*{Antenatal period}
- Previous shoulder dystocia.
- Diabetes mellitus
- Maternal obesity BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2 \mathrm{~d}$.
- Abnormal pelvic anatomy
- Short stature of the mother.
- Fetal abnormalities
- Fetal macrosomia in current pregnancy.
- Previous large baby
- Induction of labour

\section*{Intra-partum}
- Prolonged first stage of labour
- Prolonged second stage of labour, especially in the multiparous woman
- Assisted vaginal delivery (forceps/vacuum)
- Oxytocin augmentation of labour
- Secondary arrest of contractions/labour

\section*{Management}

\section*{Diagnosis of shoulder dystocia}

\section*{Shoulder dystocia may be recognized:}
- When there is difficulty with delivery of the face and chin
- When the chin may retract and depress the perineum which is known as the 'turtle-neck sign’
- If the anterior shoulder of the baby fails to deliver with normal routine traction.
- Failure of restitution of the head

\section*{Action}
- Call for help:
- Emergency team called,
- communication with the patient of the situation; ask for her and companion cooperation
- Anticipatory actions
- Provide anticipatory guidance to the woman about techniques to stop pushing until the maneuvers to relieve the obstruction are carried out
- Ensure resuscitation personnel is aware of possible complicated delivery
- Check that resuscitation equipment is ready and operational; have ready, a step stool or chair for (suprapubic) maneuver
- Communicate plans with other nurses, obstetrician \& neonatologist.
- Observe and support labour progress closely
- Promote frequent bladder emptying and position changes
- Identify delayed progress of dilatation and descent in labour
- Conduct delivery maneuvers

\section*{Interventions to effect delivery once a diagnosis of shoulder dystocia is made}
I. ALARMER mnemonic is a standard approach when a shoulder dystocia is diagnosed ${ }^{2}$. It stands for:

Ask for help. This involves requesting the help of an obstetrician, a peadiatrician for subsequent resuscitation of the newborn and anaesthesia in case if surgical intervention.

Leg hyper flexion (McRobert's maneuver)
Anterior shoulder disimpaction (apply suprapubic pressure)
Rubin maneuver
Manual delivery of posterior arm

\section*{Episiotomy}

Roll over on all fours (Gaskin maneuver)
2. HELPERR Mnemonic. This is a clinical tool that offers a structured framework for coping with shoulder dystocia.

These maneuvers are designed to do one of three things:
- Increase the functional size of the bony pelvis through flattening of the lumbar lordosis and cephalad rotation of the symphysis pubis (i.e. the McRobert's manoueuvre)
- Decrease the bisacromial diameter (i.e. the breadth of the shoulders) of the fetus through application of suprapubic pressure (i.e. internal pressure on the posterior aspect of the impacted shoulder)
- Change the relationship of the bisacromial diameter within the bony pelvis through internal rotation maneuvers.

\section*{H - Call for help.}

There is need to have a multi-disciplinary team and anticipate for neonatal resuscitation and surgical intervention

\section*{E - Evaluate for episiotomy.}

Episiotomy should be considered throughout the management of shoulder dystocia but is necessary only to make more room if rotation maneuvers are required. Shoulder dystocia is a bony impaction, so episiotomy alone will not release the shoulder. Because most cases of shoulder dystocia can be relieved with the McRobert's maneuver and suprapubic pressure, many women can be spared this surgical incision.

\section*{L - Legs (the McRobert's maneuver)}

This procedure involves flexing and abducting the maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs up onto the maternal abdomen. This in effect straightens the lumbosacral lordosis, Increases AP diameter of pelvis, Flexes the fetal spine and as a result Reduces $>40 \%$ of shoulder dystocia. Nurses and family members present at the delivery can provide assistance for this maneuver.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{McRobert's Maneuver
*Note: Often resolved by this maneuver alone (SOGC, 2007), with a reported success rate of $90 \%$ (RCOG, 2005)}
\end{figure}

\section*{P - Suprapubic pressure}

The hand of an assistant should be placed suprapubically over the fetal anterior shoulder, applying pressure in a cardiopulmonary resuscitation style with a downward and lateral motion on the posterior aspect of the fetal shoulder. The aim is to adduct the anterior shoulder. This maneuver should be attempted while continuing downward traction. Initially this is continuous, but may involve a rocking motion
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-399.jpg?height=1131&width=920&top_left_y=571&top_left_x=591)

\section*{E - Enter maneuvers (internal rotation)}

These maneuvers attempt to manipulate the fetus to rotate the anterior shoulder into an oblique plane and under the maternal symphysis.

Rubin Manoueuvre (Vaginal approach) - Effects rotation of the posterior shoulder
- This maneuver involves applying pressure to the most accessible part of the fetal shoulder (i.e. either the anterior or posterior shoulder) to effect shoulder adduction.
- Ask the woman not to push while you push the shoulders from behind the scapula toward the face of the baby; this will rotate the shoulders into oblique diameter
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-400.jpg?height=755&width=1160&top_left_y=191&top_left_x=448)

\section*{If this fails,}

Wood's screw maneuver may be applied.
- Rotates the posterior shoulder by $\mathbf{1 8 0}$ degrees anteriorly in a screw like maneuver - where pressure is applied to anterior aspect of posterior shoulder to disimpact it. (Curved arrow shows rotation.)
- Success of this maneuver allows easy delivery of that shoulder once it is past the symphysis pubis.
- In practice, the anterior shoulder disimpaction maneuver and Wood's maneuver may be done simultaneously and repetitively to achieve disimpaction of the anterior shoulder
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-400.jpg?height=860&width=1243&top_left_y=1693&top_left_x=414)

\section*{When this fails,}

\section*{Reverse woodscrew maneuver may be applied}
- In this instance the posterior shoulder is approached from behind and rotated in the opposite direction from Rubin or woodscrew maneuvers. These maneuvers can be difficult to perform when the anterior shoulder is wedged beneath the symphysis.
- At times, it is necessary to push the fetus up into the pelvis slightly to accomplish the maneuvers.
- McRobert's maneuver should continue throughout this process.

\section*{R- Remove the posterior arm.}

Removing the posterior arm from the birth canal also shortens the bisacromial diameter, allowing the fetus to drop into the sacral hollow, freeing the impaction. The elbow then should be flexed and the forearm delivered in a sweeping motion over the fetal anterior chest wall. Grasping and pulling directly on the fetal arm may fracture the humerus.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-401.jpg?height=975&width=1337&top_left_y=1110&top_left_x=368)

\section*{Episiotomy}

Anticipate that episiotomy is only considered if there is not enough room for hand manoeuvres as shoulder dystocia is not a soft tissue problem

\section*{R - Roll the patient on all fours}

The patient rolls from her existing position to the all-fours position. This usually increases the pelvic diameters. Often, the shoulder will dislodge during the act of turning, so that this movement alone may be sufficient to dislodge the impaction. In addition, once the position change is completed, gravitational forces may aid in the disimpaction of the fetal shoulders.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-402.jpg?height=735&width=1134&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=434)

Manoeuvres of Last Resort for Shoulder Dystocia (Salvage maneuvers) *Adapted from ALSO 2016

\section*{Deliberate clavicle fracture}

Direct upward pressure on the mid-portion of the fetal clavicle; reduces the shoulder-toshoulder distance.

\section*{Zavanelli maneuver}

Cephalic replacement followed by cesarean delivery; involves rotating the fetal head into a direct occiput anterior position, then flexing and pushing the vertex back into the birth canal, while holding continuous upward pressure until cesarean delivery is accomplished.

Tocolysis may be a helpful adjunct to this procedure, although it has not been proved to enhance success over cases in which it was not used.

An operating team, anesthesiologist, and physicians capable of performing a cesarean delivery must be present, and this maneuver should never be attempted if a nuchal cord previously has been clamped and cut.

\section*{Use of General anesthesia}

Musculoskeletal or uterine relaxation with halothane or another general anesthetic may bring about enough uterine relaxation to affect delivery. Oral or intravenous nitroglycerin may be used as an alternative to general anesthesia.

\section*{Abdominal surgery with hysterotomy}

General anesthesia is induced and cesarean incision performed, after which the surgeon rotates the infant trans-abdominally through the hysterotomy incision, allowing the shoulders to rotate, much like a Woods corkscrew maneuver. Vaginal extraction is then accomplished by another physician.

Note:
I. Be prepared to perform neonatal resuscitation following delivery of the baby
2. Assess the newborn for complications
3. Assess the woman for complications
4. Provide comfort and support to the woman and her support person(s)

\section*{MATERNAL SHOCK}

\section*{Definition}

Shock refers to a state of compromised tissue perfusion that results in cellular hypoxia and is defined as a syndrome initiated by acute hypoperfusion, leading to tissue hypoxia and vital organ dysfunction ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Types of shock ${ }^{1}$}

Shock results from four potential, and not necessarily exclusive, pathophysiological mechanisms:
- Hypovolemia (from internal or external fluid loss),
- Cardiogenic factors (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, peri-partum cardiomyopathy, end-stage cardiomyopathy, advanced valvular heart disease, myocarditis, or cardiac arrhythmias),
- Obstruction (e.g., pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, cardiac tamponade, or tension pneumothorax),
- Distributive factors (e.g., severe sepsis or anaphylaxis from the release of inflammatory mediators)

\section*{Triage (MEOWS Chart)}

Regular observation of all vital signs (including temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate) should be recorded on a Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS)

MEOWS chart has proved to be a useful bedside screening tool for prediction of obstetric morbidity and should be used routinely in every obstetric unit. Strict monitoring and documentation of all the vital parameters should be fundamental part of any patient's assessment to pick up acute illness at very early stage and to make a difference in eventual outcome ${ }^{14}$

Crash carts are mobile units containing essential medications and equipment for resuscitation of patients in emergency situations. ${ }^{25}$ Crash carts are recommended at any facility/ unit dealing with patients who have the potential for sudden deterioration in the course of management ${ }^{25}$; of which obstetrics unit qualifies.

Equipment and medications are placed in drawers in the crash cart based on how urgent they should be used in emergency setups

Defribrillator should be placed on the top shelf of the cart
First drawer: Essential resuscitation medications are usually kept in the first/top drawer of the emergency cart. These medications are usually provided in ways that are easy to measure and administer to the patient in quick time. ${ }^{25}$

Second drawer: This drawer contains the necessary intravenous fluids for hemodynamic support. Also contained in this drawer, are equipment necessary for intubation. ${ }^{25}$

Third drawer: This compartment contains equipment necessary for intravenous line insertion, phlebotomy and sample collection ${ }^{25}$. These include:
- Intravenous catheters of different gauge sizes
- Arterial lines
- Needles of different gauge sizes
- Vacutainers of different colors (tops) depending on the investigations required.

Fourth drawer/ procedure drawer: prepackaged kits available for various urgent and emergency procedures are kept in this drawer ${ }^{25}$.

\section*{HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK}

Hypovolemic shock occurs when circulating blood volume is significantly decreased to result in inadequate or uneven tissue oxygenation. ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Causes of major obstetric hemorrhage ${ }^{\underline{2}} \underline{\underline{3}}$}

\section*{Antepartum/Intrapartum}
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Placental abruption,
- Uterine rupture

\caption{Figure 65: Classification of maternal hemorrhage according to the shock index}
\end{table}

Note: Women with low HB are already hemodynamically compromised therefore any bleeding could lead to poor outcomes.

\section*{Management of hypovolemic shock}
- Rule out danger to self and patient
- Check for response by calling patient by name e.g hello Tara, are you ok?
- Call for help "we have unresponsive patient here please come and help
- Position the woman by turning her to the left lateral with legs higher than chest (remember in pregnant woman any shock is made worse by aorta-caval compression)
- Starts CPR as the team comes
- Assign the team tasks; one person for airway and breathing, another one circulation, another one to do vaginal examination
- Offer leadership to the team
- Performs head tilt and chin lift
- Places an oropharyngeal airway
- Keep mother warm
- Looks, listens and feels for breathing
- Feels for carotid pulse
- Starts chest compressions alternating with breaths, give 30 compressions followed by 2 slow breaths lasting a second each
- Look, listen and feels for breathing
- Establish an airway and give oxygen by mask or endotracheal tube to ensure optimal saturations of $>94 \%^{2}$
- IV access and send blood samples to lab
- check pulse
- check blood pressure
- Two or more intravenous ways are established for blood, fluids and drugs infusion which should be given by IV route in shocked patient.
- If the veins are difficult to find a venous cut down or intrafemoral cannulation is done.
- Restoration of blood volume by:
- Packed cell volume: cross-matched from the same group if not available group O-negative may be given as a life -saving.
- Crystalloid solutions: as ringer lactate, normal saline or glucose $5 \%$. They have a short half-life in the circulation and excess amount may cause pulmonary oedema.
- Colloid solutions: as dextran 40 or 70, plasma protein fraction or fresh frozen plasma.
- Autologous blood transfusion in ectopic management
- check uterus, inspect external genitalia and do digital vaginal exam
- Fix the urinary catheter to monitor input and output
- Monitor every 15 minutes for: Pulse, BP, Shortness of breath or puffiness
- Continue reassessing the mother, find cause and treat as per protocol
- IV antibiotics
- Detect the cause and arrest hemorrhage.
a. For PPH, manage according to cause using medical and surgical interventions e.g. uterotonics for uterine atony, repair of lacerations and tears from genital trauma and administration of appropriate blood products for coagulopathy
b. In the case of maternal collapse secondary to antepartum haemorrhage, the fetus and placenta should be delivered promptly to allow control of the haemorrhage.
c. In the case of massive placental abruption, caesarean section may occasionally be indicated even if the fetus is dead to allow rapid control of the haemorrhage. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

\section*{Goals of volume replacement}
- Restoration of adequate intravascular volume
- Establish hemodynamic stability and homeostasis
- Improve oxygen carrying capacity
- Improve tissue oxygen delivery
- Correct fluid deficits and dehydration
- Avoid fluid overload

\section*{Complications of hemorrhagic shock}
- Acute renal failure.
- Pituitary necrosis (Sheehan's syndrome).
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

\section*{ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK $\underline{\underline{2}}, \underline{\underline{7}}$}

Anaphylaxis is a rare event occurring during pregnancy. It is characterized by generalized hypersensitivity reaction, which is life-threatening and typically results in maternal hypotension and/or fetal morbidity as a consequence of intrapartum asphyxia. The prevalence of anaphylaxis has been reported to be $0.05 \%$ to $2 \%$.

Anaphylaxis is typically triggered by:
- Exposure to foods
- Exposure to insect venom
- natural rubber
- medications through an IgE-mediated mechanism

Anaphylaxis is likely when all of the following three criteria are met:
- Sudden onset and rapid progression of symptoms
- Life-threatening airway and/or breathing and/or circulation problems
- Skin and/or mucosal changes (flushing, urticaria, angioedema).

\section*{Symptoms}
- Respiratory and gastrointestinal (e.g., dyspnea, vomiting, abdominal pain),
- Skin and mucosal (e.g., urticaria, itchy rash)
- Cardiovascular and central nervous systems (e.g., hypotension, feeling faint, seizures).

\section*{Management of anaphylactic shock}

Management of anaphylaxis in pregnancy is similar to that in non-pregnant women. The recommendations for management of acute anaphylactic episodes include
- Immediate cessation of the triggering factors
- Airway and blood pressure support, prevention of hypoxia with $100 \%$ oxygen
- Aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline
- Use of medications, such as epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.

However, several aspects involving the management of life-threatening onset during pregnancy are still disputed. Epinephrine is usually recommended in non-pregnant patients as a vasopressor. The dosage of epinephrine has been standardized ( $0.01 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of $1: 1000,1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ solution) and administered intramuscularly in the mid-outer thigh.

Although epinephrine improves maternal hypotension, it may induce uterine vasoconstriction, resulting in hypoxic damage to the fetus as well as ventricular arrhythmias, hypertensive crises, and pulmonary edema.

\section*{CARDIOGENIC SHOCK ${ }^{\underline{8}}$}

Cardiogenic shock in pregnancy is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from an inadequate circulation of blood due to primary failure of the ventricles of the heart to function effectively.

\section*{Major causes}
- Valvular heart disease
- Peri-partum cardiomyopathy
- Arrhythmias
- Amniotic embolism
- Myocardial infarction

The multidisciplinary team approach, search for underlying cause, intensive cardiac monitoring and care-planned delivery of fetus reduce both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

\end{figure}
'Chest compressions in pregnancy:
- Use a firm backboard
- Place patient supine
- Place hands in center of chest (as in nonpregnant patient)
- Compress at a rate of at least $100 / \mathrm{min}$
- Compress at a depth of at least 2 inches ( 5 cm )
- Perishock pause <10 seconds
- Allow complete chest recoil after each compression
- Minimize interruptions
- Perform continuous manual LUD
† Appropriate airway management for pregnancy;
- Open airway by using head tilt-chin lit maneuver (ff not a trauma victim)
- Administer $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ at $215 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$
- When available, perform bag-mask ventilation
- Seal mask, ensure no leak around mask; 2-handed technique preferred
- Deliver each rescue breath over 1 second
- Give 2 breaths for every 30 compressions
- Give a sulficient tidal volume to produce visible chest rise or fog within face mask.
If not seen, reopen airway and improve seal. Consider using oral airway.
- Avoid excessive ventilation

\section*{SEPTIC SHOCK}

Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical syndrome caused by decreased tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, as a result of severe infection and sepsis. ${ }^{9,15}$

\section*{Common causes of septic shock}
- Septic abortion
- Chorioamnionitis
- Postpartum endometritis
- Pyelonephritis
- Pelvic abscess
- Puerperal sepsis
- Respiratory tract infections etc.

\section*{Clinical features}
- Chills
- Fever
- Hypotension
- Mental confusion
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Severe septic shock
- Cool clammy skin
- Bradycardia
- Cyanosis

\section*{Management of septic shock 6,9, II}

It consists of two major phases:

\section*{Restoration of circulatory function and oxygenation}
- Volume replacement: Blood transfusion, if not available crystalloids and colloids can be used. The CVP measurement is critical to guard against circulatory overload.
- Corticosteroids such as:
- Hydrocortisone Igm IV every 6 hours or,
- Dexamethasone 20 mg initially followed by $200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day by IV infusion.
- $\beta$-adrenergic stimulants: isoprenaline cause arteriolar dilatation, increase heart rate and stroke volume improving tissue perfusion. Blood volume must be normal prior to its administration.
- Supplemental oxygen: if respiratory function is impaired.
- Aminophylline: improves respiratory function by alleviating bronchospasm.
- Eradication of infection

\section*{a. Antibiotic therapy:}
- Blood cultures, urine cultures and swabs for culture and sensitivity are taken before use of antibiotics.
- Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy is started immediately or within an hour of suspicion of sepsis:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Antibiotic & Acts upon & Dose \\
\hline Regimen I & Co-amoxiclav or Cephalosporins & Aerobic gram+ organisms and gram- cocci. & IV 1.2 gm BD or IV Ceftriaxone Igm BD or IV Cefuroxime 500 mg BD \\
\hline & Gentamycin & Aerobic gram- bacilli. & IV 80 mgevery 8 hours. (not to be given in the solutions). \\
\hline & Metronidazole & Anaerobic. & IV 500 mg every 8 hours. \\
\hline Regimen 2 & Clindamycin & Aerobic gram + organisms + gram- cocci + anaerobic organisms. & IV 600 mg every 6 hours. \\
\hline & Gentamycin & Aerobic gram- bacilli. & IV 80 mg every 8 hours. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
b. Surgical treatment: indicated when there is retained infected tissues as in septic abortion. It should be removed as soon as antibiotic therapy and resuscitative measures have been started by: Suction evacuation,
- Digital evacuation, or
- Hysterectomy in advanced infection with a gangrenous (clostridium welchii) or traumatized uterus.

\section*{OBSTRUCTIVE SHOCK}

Obstructive shock is a condition caused by the obstruction of the great vessels or the heart itself. Although the symptoms resemble those of cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock needs to be clearly distinguished from the latter because it is treated quite differently.

\section*{Causes}

The "4 H's and 4 T's" rule of reversible causes of cardio-circulatory arrest involve three obstructive causes:
- Pericardial tamponade
- Tension pneumothorax
- Massive pulmonary thromboembolism.

\section*{Clinical manifestations}
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Oliguria
- Altered consciousness.
- Hypotension may be quite modest initially and this can lead to underestimation of the clinical situation

\section*{AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM}

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is one of the most serious complications of pregnancy in which it is postulated that amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris gets into the maternal pulmonary circulation leading to cardiovascular collapse. ${ }^{19}$

The incidence of AFE is estimated to occur between 1 in 8000 and 1 in 80,000 deliveries. The true incidence is not clear as a result of inaccurate diagnosis and inconsistent reporting of nonfatal cases. ${ }^{19}$ The condition typically occurs during labor, soon after vaginal or caesarean delivery, or during second-trimester dilation and evacuation procedures. Previous studies revealed mortality rates as high as $61-86 \%$, but recent estimates suggest a case fatality of $13-26 \%$.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Multiparity.
- Intense contractions during labor.
- Older maternal age.
- Abdominal trauma.
- Early separation of the placenta from the uterus wall.
- Cesarean section.
- Induction of labor.
- Eclampsia.
- Tears in the uterus or cervix.
- Multiple pregnancy.
- Placenta previa.
- Labour with intact membrane

\section*{Fetal factors:}
- Fetal distress.
- Fetal death.

\section*{Clinical manifestations ${ }^{\underline{21}}$}

Common presenting signs and symptoms may include:
- Sudden anxiety
- Agitation
- Dyspnea
- Hypotension
- Cyanosis
- Cardiopulmonary arrest
- Coagulopathy
- Seizures

\section*{Diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism $\underline{20}$}

Amniotic fluid embolism diagnosis criteria

\section*{UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) 2010}

No other clear cause: acute cardiovascular collapse with one or more of the following signs:
- Acute fetal compromise
- Cardiac arrest
- Cardiac arrhythmia
- Coagulopathy
- Hypotension
- Maternal hemorrhage*
- Premonitory symptoms, (e.g. restlessness, anxiety, agitation)
- Seizures
- (Sudden onset) shortness of breath

\section*{Investigations}
- Initial diagnostic evaluation should include continuous pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements to determine the degree of hypoxemia.
- ABG levels: Expect changes consistent with hypoxia/hypoxemia.
- Decreased pH
- Decreased $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$
- Increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ levels
- Serial complete blood counts and coagulation studies should be sent to follow trends and detect early coagulopathy.
- CBC with platelets.
- PT is prolonged because clotting factors are used up. Values are institution specific, but intervention is indicated when the PT is 1.5 times the control value.
I. APTT may be within reference range or shortened.
2. Blood type and screen in anticipation of the requirement for a transfusion.
- Chest radiograph postero-anterior and lateral findings are usually nonspecific. The chief radiographic abnormalities in AFE are diffuse bilateral heterogeneous and homogeneous areas of increased opacity, which are indistinguishable from acute pulmonary edema.
- A 12-lead electrocardiogram may show tachycardia, ST-segment and T-wave changes, and findings consistent with right ventricle strain.
- Lung scan may demonstrate some areas of reduced radioactivity in the lung field.
- Increased serum tryptase, urinary histamine concentrations and significantly lower complement concentrations suggest an anaphylactic process.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM}

The key factors in the management of AFE are
- Early recognition,
- Prompt resuscitation,
- Delivery of the fetus.

\section*{Resuscitation:}
- Oxygenation and Control of the airway with tracheal intubation and administration of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$.
- Fluid resuscitation is imperative to counteract hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
- Correcting coagulopathy - Blood and blood products, including fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets and cryoprecipitate, must be available and administered early in the resuscitation phase of AFE. If platelets are $<20,000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$, or if bleeding occurs and platelets are 20,000 $50,000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$, transfuse platelets at $1-3 \mathrm{U} / 10 \mathrm{~kg} /$ day .

Vasopressors and inotropic support are generally needed to varying degrees in AFE. Central venous access should be established for vasopressor infusion and monitoring. Choice of vasopressor drug depends on the clinical scenario:
- Epinephrine may be the first-line agent of choice as it is used in other anaphylactic reactions, in addition to the $\alpha$-adrenergic vasoconstrictor effects.
- Phenylephrine, a pure $\alpha-\mathrm{I}$ agonist, is often an excellent choice early in the treatment of AFE because at that time point systemic vasodilation is the most prominent circulatory abnormality.
- Inotropic support like dopamine or noradrenaline may be ideal agents because of the additional $\beta$-adrenergic effects, which improve cardiac function.

Hysterectomy may be required in patients with persistent uterine hemorrhage to control blood loss.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 70: Management of amniotic fluid embolism 19}
\end{figure}

Coagulopathy may have immediate or delayed onset following cardiovascular collapse. Activate massive transfusion protocols where available.
Aggressive treatment of uterine atony. Search for anatomic etiologies of bleeding such as pelvic lacerations.
Hysterectomy may be required in patients with persistent uterine hemorrhage to control blood loss.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS OF LABOR PROLONGED LABOUR}

\section*{Introduction}

Prolonged labour is often defined as onset of regular, rhythmical painful contractions accompanied by cervical dilation where labour is longer than 24 hours. This definition however has limitations, and therefore it is more useful in terms of management to refer to prolonged stage of labour, i.e. "prolonged latent phase of labour" or "prolonged active phase of labour". Latent phase being the onset of regular painful contractions with cervical dilation up to 4 cm , and should not be longer than 8 hours.

Prolonged active phase: is regular painful contractions with cervical dilation of more than 4 cm should not last longer than 12 hours without full assessment in a facility able to offer management and treatment of complications.

\section*{Recommendation}
- Correct use and interpretation of Partograph during labour
- Prompt decision making
- Education to mothers to seek prompt skilled delivery

\section*{Causes}

Causes of prolonged labour It is usual to describe this as due to the three "Ps":
Power: poor or uncoordinated uterine action
Passenger: fetal head too large or position abnormal -, malpresentation, malposition, fetal anomalies e.g., hydrocephalus

Passage: pelvis abnormal, or tumour or obstruction in pelvis or birth canal.

\section*{Management}

\section*{Diagnosis}

Findings from history and physical examination or as interpreted from the Partograph that is correctly charted will guide in the diagnosis of prolonged labour.
a) History

Key points to note:
- At what time did the contractions begin?
- How frequent are the contractions?
- When did the membranes (water) break?

\section*{b) Examination}
- Monitor maternal vital signs
- The frequency, duration and intensity of the contractions
- Determine the foetal position and identify any evidence of cephalopelvic disproportion and /or foetal malposition
- Evaluate foetal heart rate
- Determine whether the mother's bladder is full.
- Inspect the external genitalia to determine the presence of liquid and /or blood vaginal exam with sterile gloves every four hours (or at a different frequency when indicated.
c) Investigations
- Blood grouping and cross match two units
- Urine for albumin, sugar, acetone
- Cardiotocography for assessment of fetal well-being

\section*{Treatment}
a) Supportive
- Monitor maternal vital signs at the following intervals
- Temperature 2-4 hourly,
- Pulse $1 / 2$ hourly,
- Respirations 4 hourly
- Blood Pressure 4 hourly
- Monitor foetal heart rate $1 / 2$ hourly but in case of non-reassuring fetal status , I/4 hourly
- Measure maternal urine volume- should be $30 \mathrm{mls} /$ hour every $2-4$ hours
- Ensure that the bladder is emptied frequently to allow descent of the fetal head- Encourage the woman to empty the bladder frequently. If not able to pass urine, catheterization should be attempted.
- Start IV fluids-Normal saline or ringer's lactate if there is shock if no shock give ringers lactate continue during transfer or referral
- If signs of infection, give broad-spectrum antibiotics - IV Ceftriaxone or Crystapen
- Encourage change of position or ambulation
- Oxygen by mask if applicable
b) Definitive treatment

\section*{First stage}

Consider augmentation if malpresentation and obstruction have been ruled out and based on parity.

\section*{Second stage}
- Maternal expulsive efforts increase fetal risk by reducing the delivery of oxygen to the placenta. While spontaneous maternal "pushing" should be allowed, prolonged effort and holding the breath should not be encouraged. If malpresentation and obvious obstruction have been ruled out, labour should be augmented with oxytocin
- Consider Vacuum extraction if fetal head is less than 1/5 palpable per abdomen and the woman is fully dilated
- If fetal head is more than $2 / 5$ th palpable, deliver by Caesarean section

\section*{Third Stage}

Perform active management of the third stage of labour.
If no progress and unable to manage, consider referral to a comprehensive EOC facility.

\section*{Referral process}
- Explain the dangers of prolonged labour to the family
- Write a referral note and refer immediately to the hospital indicating the management offered
- A skilled health care provider must escort the woman and continue to monitor her condition.

\section*{OBSTRUCTED LABOUR}

\section*{Introduction}

Obstructed labour is the arrest of vaginal delivery of the foetus due to mechanical obstruction.
Obstructed labour means that, in spite of strong contractions of the uterus, the fetus cannot descend through the pelvis because there is an insurmountable barrier preventing its descent. Obstruction usually occurs at the pelvic brim, but occasionally it may occur in the cavity or at the outlet of the pelvis. Obstructed labour causes significant maternal morbidity in the short term notably infection and long term notably obstetric fistulas and stress incontinence. Globally obstructed labour accounts for $9 \%$ of all maternal deaths

\section*{Recommendations}
- Educate all mothers on importance of ANC attendance
- Proper History taking
- Correct use and interpretation of partograph for decision making
- Emergency preparedness
- Monitoring and interpretation of observations

\section*{Aetiology}

Cephalopelvic disproportion occurs when there is a misfit between the fetal head and the pelvis. This means it is difficult or impossible for the fetus to pass safely through the pelvis.

Cephalopelvic disproportion may be due to a small pelvis with a normal size head, or a normal pelvis with a large fetus, or a combination of a large baby and small pelvis. Cephalopelvic disproportion cannot usually be diagnosed before the 37th week of pregnancy because before then the head has not reached birth size.

Cephalopelvic disproportion may be:
Marginal: In these cases, the problem may be overcome during labour. Strong uterine contractions, relaxation of the pelvic joints and moulding of the fetal skull may enable the fetus to pass through the pelvis for vaginal delivery

Definite: This occurs because the pelvis is too small, is abnormal in shape, or because the fetus is abnormal or too large for the pelvis through which it has to pass. Operative delivery will be necessary.

\section*{Risk factors}

\section*{Maternal}
- Bony obstruction due to: contracted pelvis, tumours of pelvic bones
- Soft tissue obstruction due to:
- Uterus: impacted subserous pedunculated fibroid, constriction ring opposite the neck of the foetus.
- Cervix: cervical dystocia.
- Vagina: septa, stenosis, tumours.
- Ovaries: Impacted ovarian tumours.

\section*{Fetal}
- Malpresentation and malposition: e.g.
- Persistent occipito-posterior and deep transverse arrest,
- Persistent mento-posterior and transverse arrest of the face presentation
- Brow
- Shoulder
- Impacted frank breech
- Large sized foetus (macrosomia).
- Congenital anomalies: e.g.
- Hydrocephalus
- Foetal ascites
- Foetal tumours
- Locked and conjoined twins

\section*{Outcomes}
- There are differences in the behaviour of the uterus during obstructed labour, depending on whether the woman has delivered previously. The pattern in primigravid women typically is diminishing contractility with risk of infection and fistula may result from tissue acidosis.
- In developing countries, obstetric fistulae are commonly the result of prolonged obstructed labour following from pressure necrosis caused by impaction of the presenting part during difficult labour. In the infant, neglected obstructed labour may cause asphyxia leading to stillbirth, brain damage or neonatal death.
- In parous women, contractility may be maintained with the risk of uterine rupture'. When the membranes rupture and the amniotic fluid drains away, the fetus is forced into the lower segment of the uterus by contractions. If the contractions continue, the lower segment stretches, becomes dangerously thin and is likely to rupture. However, uterine exhaustion may occur before that point is reached, causing contractions to become weaker or cease altogether and making the occurrence of uterine rupture less likely.
- Rupture of the uterus may be complete or incomplete. If it is complete i.e. the uterus communicates directly with the peritoneal cavity, bleeding will occur within the peritoneum. If it is incomplete i.e. the rupture does not reach the visceral peritoneum, bleeding will occur behind the visceral peritoneum.
- Rupture of the uterus is more likely to occur in multipara (it is very rare in nullipara), especially if the uterus is already weakened by the scar of a previous caesarean section.

Others include:
- Maternal morbidity mainly due to infection
- Haemorrhage
- Obstetric fistula
- Skeletal and Neurologic complications

\section*{Fetal}
- Non reassuring foetal status
- Birth asphyxia
- Birth Injuries

\section*{Prevention}

Strategies to avert the problem of prolonged or obstructed labour include:
- Address malnutrition in the girl child undernutrition, obesity, DM - NCD3 and communicable diseases such as TB, Polio; Micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin D and exposure to sunlight and body height to fetal weight4
- Girl child empowerment strategies that accord her retention in education; eliminate sociocultural harmful practices such as early childbearing / teenage pregnancies; commence childbearing beyond adolescent-hood and provide socio-economic autonomy
- Correct use and interpretation of a Partograph during labour monitoring
- Prompt referral system
- Strengthen the health system: Access and coverage with comprehensive obstetric units; emergency preparedness; competent skilled birth attendance; facilities that can perform caesarean sections, vacuum delivery, symphysiotomy or provide robust referrals
- Encourage early recognition of prolonged labour and respond in a timely and appropriate manner

\section*{Management}

\section*{History}

Points to pick when taking a history include:
- prolonged labour
- frequent and strong uterine contractions
- rupture membranes

\section*{Examination}

Signs of maternal distress on general examination include:
- exhaustion
- high temperature $\left(38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$
- rapid pulse
- signs of dehydration: dry tongue and cracked lips

\section*{Abdominal examination}
- The uterus is hard and tender
- frequent strong uterine contractions with no relaxation in between (tetanic contractions)
- rising retraction ring (Bandl's ring) is seen and felt as an oblique groove across the abdomen
- foetal parts cannot be felt easily
- FHS are absent or show foetal distress due to interference with the utero-placental blood flow

\section*{Vaginal examination}
- Vulva is oedematous.
- Vagina is dry and hot
- Cervix is fully or partially dilated, oedematous and hanging
- The membranes are ruptured
- Presence of meconium stained, foul smelling liquor. Though based on the duration prior to presentation, liquor may be absent
- The presenting part: is high and not engaged or impacted in the pelvis. If it is the head it shows excessive moulding and large caput.

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Unsatisfactory progress that results in prolonged labour can be the earliest sign of obstructed labour.
- It is the clinical picture of obstructed labour with impending rupture uterus (excessive uterine contraction and retraction).

\section*{Differential diagnosis}
- Constriction ring
- Fundal myoma
- Full bladder

\section*{Prediction}
- Various predictive tools that include maternal height, shoe size, external and internal pelvimetry, safe, low-cost, easy-to-use 3D camera platform2 and ultrasound have been used to predict obstructed labour but are inconclusive.
- So far, the best predictor is the labour processes. Include the description of Normal Mechanisms of labour in relation to the type of pelvis. When curtailed i.e. flexion, internal rotation, extension. external rotation, restitution result in prolonged labour or obstructed labour.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Supportive management}
- Resuscitate the mother: rapid assessment of airway, breathing and circulation and manage as appropriate
- Rehydrate the patient: Aim is to maintain the normal plasma volume and to prevent or treat dehydration and ketosis. Put two wide bore needle or cannulas. If the woman in shock give intravenous fluids e.g. normal saline I litre in the first I 15 minutes or as quickly as possible. If the woman is mainly starved and exhausted, give I-2 litres or 10\% dextrose 6 hours
- Catheterize: insert an indwelling urinary catheter using aseptic technique and monitor urine output . An indwelling catheter also prevent obstetric fistula
- Give antibiotics:

If there are signs of infection, or membranes have been ruptured for 18 hours or more or the period of gestation is 37 weeks or less provide antibiotics as:
1. Ampicillin $2 g$ every 6 hours and
2. Gentamicin $5 \mathrm{mg} /$ body weight IV for every 24 hours
3. If the woman delivered by $\mathrm{c} / \mathrm{s}$ continue antibiotics and give Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours until the woman fever free for 48 hours

\section*{Definitive management}
- Delivery of the baby
- Caesarean section is the safest method even if the baby is dead as labour must be immediately terminated and any manipulations may lead to rupture uterus ${ }^{5}$.
- Cephalo- pelvic disproportion
- If cephalo- pelvic disproportion is confirmed, prior to onset of labour deliver by elective caesarean section. If the mother in established labour, then deliver by emergency caesarean section
- If the fetus dead- delivery by craniotomy. If not possible, deliver by caesarean section.
- Obstruction
- If the fetus is alive, the cervix is fully dilated and the head is at 0 station or below deliver by vacuum extraction
- If the fetus is alive and the cervix is not fully dilated or if the fetal head too high for vacuum extraction, referral or perform immediately emergency caesarean section

\section*{Referral process}
- Write referral note and refer immediately to a health facility with comprehensive Obstetric care
- Important to use the hotline communication to alert the facility of referral to of the patient being transferred
- Empathetic Communication with the patient and the relatives on the patient's condition and risks that necessitate the referral MUST be provided
- A skilled health provider MUST accompany the patient and monitor her condition
- First aid measures (supportive) must have been instituted and continued on her transit to the next health facility
- Maternal vital signs are monitored I/2/ hourly
- Fetal heart rate monitored $1 / 2$ hourly
- Ensure IV fluids $\mathrm{n} /$ saline or dextro- saline is continued during the transfer
- Commence parenteral antibiotics (Ampicillin 500 mg , Gentamicin 80 mg and Flagyl 500 mg stat) ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Complications}

\section*{Maternal:}
- Maternal distress and ketoacidosis.
- Rupture uterus.
- Necrotic vesico-vaginal fistula.
- Infections as chorioamnionitis and puerperal sepsis.
- Postpartum haemorrhage due to injuries or uterine atony.

\section*{Foetal:}
- Asphyxia.
- Intracranial haemorrhage from excessive moulding.
- Birth injuries.
- Infections.

\section*{RUPTURED UTERUS}

\section*{Introduction}
- Uterine rupture is an important complication occurring particularly during intra partum period and a major contributor of abnormal uterine bleeding contributing to maternal and new-born morbidity and mortality.
- Ruptured uterus is catastrophic and associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
- The health system must be robust to provide for emergency care and referral mechanisms to undertake caesarean section, laparotomy, hysterectomy, blood transfusion and accord a multidisciplinary approach to patients with this complication.'
- Most of the ruptured uterus in LMIC occur because of cephalo-pelvic disproportion and obstructed labour. Additionally, there is need to address the three delay model ${ }^{2}$ such as promoting health seeking behavior during antenatal period; emergency preparedness; discourage cultural practice of home delivery without skilled birth attendants or unplanned VBAC; provide better transport and referral systems; improve obstetric competences and health care management of women in labour.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Uterine rupture is rare occurring below $1 / 1000$. The prevalence of uterine rupture for previous Caesarean section is in the region of $1 \%$ in the developed countries, while in women without previous $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{S}$ is less than $1 / 10,000$. ${ }^{19}$

About $6 \%$ of babies do not survive their mothers' uterine ruptures. Only about $1 \%$ of mothers die due to complications. Prompt diagnosis of uterine rupture increases the chances of the mother and the baby's survival.

\section*{Recommendations}
- Capacity building - impacting relevant skills
- Timely referral services from lower level to higher level
- Functional operation theatre
- Availability of blood and blood products
- Promotion of pregnant mothers to attend ANC
- Discourage harmful practices

\section*{Definition}

Rupture of the uterus occurs when the integrity of the myometrium is breached. This can be complete with extrusion of the uterine content into the abdomen or extension into the bladder and broad ligament. In incomplete (partial) the uterus has dehiscence with the uterine content held within by the serosal layer.

\section*{Risk factors for uterine rupture}
- Previous uterine scar; C/S, myomectomy scar
- Prior uterine rupture
- Cephalo-pelvic disproportion
- Prolonged/obstructed labour
- Malpositions
- malpresentations
- Multi-parity
- Prior uterine manipulation: MVA, D\&C

\section*{Injudicious use of uterotonics for induction and augmentation of labour}

Uterine rupture is the most serious complication for women undergoing trial of labour (TOL) after prior caesarean delivery.

While rates of uterine rupture vary significantly according to a variety of clinically associated risk factors, the absolute risk for this complication ranges.

Previous vaginal delivery and prior successful vaginal birth after caesarean delivery confers the lowest risk of rupture on women attempting TOLAC.

In contrast, the risk increases with cephalopelvic disproportion, prolonged labour, obstructed labour, multiple prior caesareans, multiparity, a short inter-pregnancy interval, congenital uterine anomalies, single layer uterine closure, classic caesarean scar, prior preterm caesarean, foetal malpresentation or malposition, uterine instrumentation, intrauterine manipulations (fundal pressure, external podalic version, internal podalic version, breech extraction, shoulder dystocia, manual removal of adherent placenta). Others include labour induction, augmentation of labour, obesity; previous history of ruptured uterus and trans-mural scar from procedures like myomectomy

Counselling of mothers with the aforementioned risk factors must be provided with an individual birth plan having discussed the benefits and risks of VBAC or elective caesarean section. Further, inform the mothers they have a high-risk pregnancy and their need to deliver under skilled birth attendance optimizing their care if she opts for TOLAC to predict, diagnose and provide immediate interventions.

\section*{Prevention strategies}
- Preventive strategies for reduction of teenage pregnancies ${ }^{3,4}$
- One previous scar mother needs to make informed choice and plan for subsequent pregnancy
- Avoiding unnecessary caesarean section ${ }^{5}$
- Adherence to the 12 steps to Safe and Respectful Mother Baby-Family Maternity Care ${ }^{6}$
- Avoid injudicious use of Misoprostol and oxytocin in induction and augmentation of labour ${ }^{7}$
- Promotion of mothers to attend comprehensive prenatal contacts
- Promotion of skilled birth attendance ${ }^{8}$
- Competent skilled healthcare provider to predict, detect and treat parturient with uterine rupture
- Supportive health system and referral mechanism for comprehensive obstetric and emergency care
- Proper history taking
- Proper pelvic assessment for adequacy
- The only way to prevent uterine rupture is proper use of partograph and prompt interpretation and action.
- Misuse of uterotonics
- Timely referral
- Patient education on importance

\section*{Prediction}

Prediction modelling of individual risk for uterine rupture is not accurate for patients before admission or soon after admission with trial of labour with one previous scar. ${ }^{9}$ Sonographic evaluation of the lower uterine segment thickness provides a better risk assessment for uterine rupture following labour in previous caesarean section. However, evidence is variable in cut off due to lack of standardized technique in measurement of myometrial thickness. ${ }^{10,11,12}$

The most consistent early indicator of uterine rupture is the onset of a prolonged, persistent, and profound foetal bradycardia.

\section*{Pathogenesis}

Considerable weakening of the uterine wall leading to a tear

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-441.jpg?height=929&width=1620&top_left_y=1576&top_left_x=219}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 7I: Pathophysiology of uterine rupture}
\end{figure}

\section*{Types of uterine tears}

\section*{Rupture through cervix and vagina}
- If the uterus is torn through the cervix and vagina, mobilize the bladder at least 2 cm below the tear.
- If possible, place a suture $I$ cm below the upper end of the cervical tear and keep traction on the suture to bring the lower end of the tear into view as the repair continues.

\section*{Rupture laterally through uterine artery}
- If the rupture extends laterally to damage one or both uterine arteries, ligate the injured artery.
- Identify the arteries and ureter prior to ligating the uterine vessels.

\section*{Rupture with broad ligament hematoma}
- If the rupture has created a broad ligament hematoma, clamp, cut and tie off the round ligament.
- Open the anterior leaf of the broad ligament.
- Drain off the hematoma manually, if necessary.
- Inspect the area carefully for injury to the uterine artery or its branches. Ligate any bleeding vessels.

\section*{Management}

\section*{Clinical findings}

\section*{Complete uterine rupture}
- Severe abdominal pain
- Sign of hypovolemic shock
- Abdominal tenderness
- Foetal body under abdominal wall
- Absence of foetal heart
- Vaginal bleeding

\section*{Incomplete uterine}
- Mild symptoms and signs
- Haematoma in broad ligaments

\section*{Diagnosis}

This can be non -specific commonly seen with uterine dehiscence. With uterine rupture foetal non reassuring status often with bradycardia or demise; maternal sudden bleeding and excruciating lower abdominal pain, shock or demise also reported.

On physical examination uterine hypertonicity is followed by uterine quiescence or poor progress of labour, Bandl ring formation, tenderness in the lower uterine segment to extrusion of foetal parts and placenta into the abdomen felt just under the anterior abdominal wall. Upon vaginal assessment the foetal part is felt higher up and not next to the cervix and may also feel a breached lower uterine segment.

\section*{Differential Diagnosis}
- Placenta praevia
- Abruptio placentae
- Extra uterine pregnancy
- Ruptured spleen or liver
- Acute abdomen in pregnancy.

\section*{Intervention}

The timing of the uterine rupture to institution of definitive management is crucial. Definitive therapy for the foetus is delivery and must generally be accomplished with alacrity to avoid major foetal morbidity and mortality.

Studies show the foetus must be delivered in 10-37 minutes. ${ }^{13,14,15,16}$ Conversely, therapy for the mother can generally be supportive and resuscitative until surgical intervention can be undertaken to arrest the often-life-threatening uterine haemorrhage.

\section*{Management principles for uterine rupture}
- Immediate stabilization of the mother
- Delivery of the foetus through caeserian section
- Urgent mobilization of the resources: such as personnel, emergency services, blood, immediate theatre access
- After the foetus is delivered, assessment intra-operatively of the uterine rupture make note of:
- Type of uterine rupture
- Extent of uterine rupture
- Degree of haemorrhage
- General condition of the mother
- Mother's desire for future childbearing

\section*{Repairing the uterine tear}
- Repair the tear with a continuous locking stitch of chromic catgut number 0 (or polyglycolic) suture. If bleeding is not controlled or if the rupture is through a previous classical or vertical incision, place a second layer of suture.
- Ensure that the ureter is identified and exposed to avoid including it in a stitch.
- If the woman has requested tubal ligation, perform the procedure at this time.
- If the rupture is too extensive for repair, proceed with hysterectomy.
- Control bleeding by clamping with long artery forceps and ligating. If the bleeding points are deep, use figure-of-eight sutures.
- Place an abdominal drain.
- Ensure that there is no bleeding. Remove clots using a sponge.
- In all cases, check for injury to the bladder. If a bladder injury is identified, repair the injury (see below).
- Close the fascia with continuous chromic catgut number 0 (or polyglycolic) suture.

Uterine repair can be considered in the following circumstance:
- Desire for future childbearing
- Low transverse uterine rupture
- No extension of the tear to the broad ligament, cervix, or paracolpos
- Easily controllable uterine haemorrhage
- Good general condition
- No clinical or laboratory evidence of an evolving coagulopathy

Hysterectomy should be considered the treatment of choice when intractable uterine bleeding occurs or when the uterine rupture sites are multiple, longitudinal, or low lying.

Consequences to the foetus include: foetal hypoxia/ anoxia, foetal acidosis; increased admission int NICU and early neonatal death.

Maternal consequences include: severe maternal haemorrhage; maternal hypovolemic shock; bladder injury; need for hysterectomy; admission in critical care unit and maternal death.

The following are elements that provide prognostic attributes ${ }^{17}$ :
- Debrief of patients that underwent primary caesarean section in the immediate postpartum period (its indication, type of incision, birthing experience) and planning the for the next pregnancy and its mode of delivery whether VBAC or elective caesarean section
- Screening of patients attending antenatal care -risk status for birth planning, emergency preparedness, referral and counselling provided at each antenatal visit
- The benefits and risks associated with risk status such as cephalo-pelvic disproportion or TOLAC for those with one previous scar discussed in the antenatal contacts scheduled.
- Discussion of delivery options during prenatal care and decision made with the patients by 36 weeks of gestation
- Effective communication to have skilled birth attendance and offered respectful maternity care
- Use of the partograph during labour for monitoring, decision making and appropriate interventions when dysfunctional labour or symptoms and signs of uterine rupture are detected
- High index of suspicion and emergency laparotomy with uterine rupture

\section*{Counselling for Future Pregnancies}
- If tubal ligation was not performed at the time of laparotomy, explain the increased risk of rupture with subsequent pregnancies, and discuss the option of permanent contraception.
- If the defect is confined to the lower segment the risk of rupture in a subsequent pregnancy is similar to that of someone with a previous caesarean section.
- If there are extensive tears involving the upper segment, future pregnancy may be contraindicated.
- Women with a history of uterine rupture should have a planned elective caesarean section (37 to 38 weeks' gestation) in their next pregnancy.

\section*{OBSTETRIC FISTULA}

\section*{Introduction}

Obstetric fistula (OF) is a devastating yet often neglected injury that occurs as a result of prolonged obstructed labour. Women who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant urine/stool/fecal incontinence, shame, social segregation and health problems.

\section*{Epidemiology}

The World Health Organization has estimated that I-2 million women are affected with at least 50,000 to 100,000 cases of obstetric fistula occurring every year, and that over two million women with obstetric fistula in developing countries remain untreated ${ }^{1}$. The prevalence of obstetric fistula is approximately 1.6 per 1000 women of reproductive age in sub-Saharan Africa and 1.2 per 1000 in South Asia ${ }^{2}$. It is estimated that $1 \%$ of women in Kenya are affected by OF.

OF is a chronic condition that disrupts women's lives, because of its associated stigma and isolation. Fistula illness often introduces a crisis in women's life begetting feelings of shame and serious disruption to their social, psychological, physical and economic lives, in addition to dealing with moral, hygiene and social relationship challenges, and even early mortality.

Increasingly, these fistulas are getting more complex. There are few surgeons trained with an ever-increasing backlog of cases to be addressed and the need to have a multidisciplinary approach to provide life restoring treatment ${ }^{3}$.

Currently, women are able to access surgery and other services for Vesicovaginal and Rectovaginal fistulae (VVF/RVF) through Fistula camps held in national referral hospitals and dedicated fistula centres generating a significant pool of women who have undergone surgery and are ready to regain normal lives.

In the Campaign to End Fistula which started in 2002 politicians, health care providers, policy makers and communities need to address towards eliminating this problem, use resources on national scales, and face the reality that obstetric fistula is an issue of basic human rights ${ }^{4}$.

\section*{Recommendation}

For women in the postoperative period after the surgical repair of a simple obstetric urinary fistula (simple" fistula being defined as a mid-anterior vaginal wall fistula with minimal scarring and with a diameter of 3 cm or less.), short duration of bladder catheterization ( 7 to 10 days) is recommended as an alternative to longer duration of catheterization

\section*{Definition}

Obstetric fistula is an abnormal opening or hole between a woman's genital tract and her urinary tract and/or rectum that is caused by prolonged obstructed labour.

Obstetric labour injury complex is a broad range of injuries a patient with obstetric fistula suffers including: - vesical-vaginal fistula, recto-vaginal fistula, ureteric fistulae, renal damage, vaginal stenosis, damage to the cervix, nerve damage, bone damage-pubic bone osteitis, urine dermatitis, depression, divorce/separation, amenorrhoea, infertility, malnutrition, poor reproductive outcomes and bladder stones.

\section*{Causes of obstetric fistula}
- Prolonged and Obstructed labour is the main cause of Obstetric fistula
- Other causes: -
- Destructive delivery
- Instrumental vaginal delivery
- Caesarean delivery with or without hysterectomy
- Harmful Traditional practices e.g. when defibulation is necessary before surgery due to previous FGM
- Symphysiotomy

\section*{Causes of non-obstetric fistula}
- Traumatic
- Coitus
- Sexual violence (forceful intercourse or introduction of objects into the vagina)
- FGM
- Accidental trauma e.g., falling on a stick
- Infection- granulomatous infection, TB, HIV
- Malignancy (especially advanced cervical cancer)
- latrogenic (during Gynaecological surgery)
- Radiotherapy

\section*{Pathogenesis of Obstetric Fistula}

The most common cause of obstetric fistula is prolonged obstructed labour
When labour is obstructed, there is prolonged pressure on the anterior vaginal wall and underlying bladder neck or urethra as the tissues are compressed between the foetal head and posterior aspect of the symphysis pubis reducing the blood supply and leading to ischaemic necrosis of the soft tissue.

After delivery of the (usually stillborn) baby, the necrotic tissue sloughs off, allowing a direct communication of the genital tract (Uterus, cervix, vagina) with the urinary tract (ureters, urinary
bladder, urethra) and/ or GIT (usually the rectum or anus, anal sphincter). The sloughing process takes place over a few days to weeks.

The various positions of ischaemic injury ${ }^{10}$

The ischaemic process also involves other pelvic tissues resulting in a spectrum of injuries in addition to obstetric fistula usually referred to as the obstructed labour injury complex ${ }^{9}$.

\section*{The obstructed labour injury complex ${ }^{9}$}
- Bladder. Apart from vesicovaginal fistula, tissue loss from necrosis reduces bladder volume complicating repair with minimal tissue to work with, or leading to reduced bladder compliance thereafter.
- Urethra. A fibrotic or shortened urethra may be the reason for urine incontinence even after closure of the bladder fistula.
- Ureters. Substantial damage to the bladder neck may also affect the ureteral orifices. Damage to the ureters may also be the reason for residual incontinence if a uretero-vaginal fistula is
missed at the time of the repair. Protection of the ureters is mandatory during fistula repair but instruments, such as stents, may not be available in some settings in developing countries.
- Kidneys are affected secondarily in a fistula patient. Ascending infection, hydronephrosis due to distal obstruction- stricture, stones- may lead to renal failure
- Cervical injury may lead to cervical incompetence due to cervical shortening, and haematometra due to severe cervical stenosis as a result of fibrosis
- Spontaneous symphysiolysis
- Dyspareunia due to vaginal scarring and stenosis
- Amenorrhoea- can be due to severe malnutrition and anaemia, hypothalamic dysfunction, pan-hypopituitarism, intrauterine scarring and psychological stress. These factors may lead to secondary infertility
- Musculoskeletal damage- includes damage to fibres of levator ani and contractures due to foot drop
- Neurologic damage: compression damage to the lumbo-sacral plexus. Prolonged squatting during second stage that is obstructed may also compress the peroneal nerve leading to common peroneal nerve palsy. Commonly, the patient may end up with foot drop and loss of sensation on the dorsum and lateral aspects of the foot.
- Dermatologic injury- Urine dermatitis where urine phosphates and nitrates/nitrites cause skin irritation. Chronic excoriation of the skin of the vulvar may occur due to skin dermatitis.
- Stones in the bladder or vagina- Women with OF often restrict water and fluid intake to reduce urine flow, and may insert clothes in the vagina. Both practices promote stone formation.
- Socio-economic consequences- Ostracization by husbands, families and the community, Depression, anger, and disappointment, interfered with their ability to work and earn money

The factors and processes leading to obstetric fistula summarized in the obstetric fistula pathway below:

\section*{Classification of Obstetric fistula}

\section*{Waaldijk Classification}
- Type $\mathbf{I}$ - Fistulae $\geq 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the EUO and therefore not involving the closing mechanism
- Type II - Fistulae that involve the closing mechanism ( $<5 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the EUO)
I. A - Without (sub)total urethra involvement
a. Without a circumferential defect
b. With a circumferential defect
2. B - With (sub)total urethra involvement (i.e. with a urethral remnant of less than 1.5 cm )
a. Without a circumferential defect
b. With a circumferential defect
- Type III - Ureter and other exceptional fistulas.

\section*{Risk factors}

\section*{Underlying social causes}

OF is more common among women from underprivileged poor settings where women are mostly dependants both economically and, in the decision-making process. In these regions, forced adolescent and teen marriages, low education levels for girls, male control of money, and the need for women in obstructed labour to get the permission of their husband or mother-inlaw to seek care are common.

These women are prone to OF due to the resultant delays in accessing quality emergency obstetric care in a timely manner. The 3 delays that contribute towards bad obstetric outcomes including obstructed labour were best described by Thaddeus and Maine (7).

The first delay: The decision to seek care may be delayed by the socio-economic and cultural factors in a woman's environment. Some of the socio-cultural factors contributing to obstructed labour and obstetric fistula include: -
- Poverty.
- Early marriage and early child birth.
- Too early marriage, inadequate family planning and short inter-delivery interval.
- Low status of women.
- Harmful traditional practices such as female genital cutting.

The second delay: Delayed arrival at the health facility may be influenced by poor road conditions, transportation or communication. Insecurity may deter a woman from going to the facility at night and waiting until morning, or the facilities may simply just be too far, which is not uncommon.

The third delay: Once a woman arrives at the facility, she may not access adequate care, due to a lack of staff or unfriendly staff, supplies, or electricity. Insufficiently skilled staff may mean that the woman may not get the care that is needed or when provided, results in complications

These delays are synergistic and may trigger a vicious cycle. For example, if a woman reaches the facility, workers with poor attitude may quarrel why she came late, or embarrass her if she is too young. Where maternity care is not free, extra costs for caesarean section or costs of fistula repair may push the family further into poverty. Eventually, the woman may be discouraged to seek care from the facility next time she is in labour

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 75: The three-delay model ${ }^{(9)}$}
\end{figure}
- Inequitable access to comprehensive emergency obstetric services particularly in conflict regions

\section*{Diagnosis}

A Diagnosis of OF is made by comprehensive history and physical examination including dye tests, complemented by examination under anaesthesia and imaging where necessary.

\section*{History ${ }^{9,10,11}$}
- Age, parity.
- History of any ritual genital cutting or circumcision.
- Menstrual history following her most recent pregnancy.
- Past obstetric history -Number and ages of living children, and year of delivery and death for those who were stillborn or who died later.
- Place of delivery/who cared for and assisted her during her last pregnancy and delivery.
- Duration of labour and how it was managed- was there any cutting done?
- Whether the baby was a vertex, breech or transverse/abnormal lie (if known).
- Mode of delivery (caesarean, forceps, ventouse or spontaneous vaginal) and if episiotomy, symphysiotomy or destructive surgery was required.
- Outcome for the baby (living/stillbirth/early or late neonatal death, birth weight, sex, if living how are the milestones).
- Symptoms of urinary and/or faecal or flatus incontinence -constant leakage of urine, 24 hours per day, no matter what activity she might be engaged in. Onset of this incontinence must have occurred directly after labour and delivery, and for how long have these been present
- At what point after delivery were these symptoms first noticed.
- Any faecal and /or flatus incontinence? How long has it been present? When, after delivery, was it noted?
- What, if any, problems have there been with mobility in general and walking in particular
- Past medical history including any illness, surgery and/or allergies.
- Any attempted management or surgical repair since leakage started, where, by whom, how many times?
- Who has been giving care until now and who is able to give care should surgery be required?
- Marital status and social history, including any problems which have arisen as a consequence of fistula.
- Mental status examination, as obstetric fistula bears psychological and emotional consequences to victims. Depression, suicidal thoughts or even posttraumatic stress disorder have been associated with obstetric fistula. These findings should be factored into the management plan of the patient, apart from surgical repair

\section*{Physical examination ${ }^{9,10,11}$}
- The patient with obstetric fistula should be assessed fully, with the scope of injury (obstructed labour complex) in mind.
- Assess the general condition, Vital signs, noting any indicators of possible malnutrition or anaemia, height/weight- BMI
- A gentle abdominal palpation should be performed - check for surgical scars, wound sepsis
- Assess the ability to walk unaided and the presence of any limb contractures or foot drop, check limb power and tone.
- Visual inspection of the vulval and perineal areas to look for; -
- Urinary/ammonia dermatitis
- Ulceration
- Concurrent infection of the skin or urine
- Faecal soiling
- Genital cutting of the vagina or perineum, either as a result of an episiotomy, the attempts of untrained attendants to assist in an obstructed labour or FGM/C
- A vaginal speculum (Sims) examination is done to confirm that the vaginal loss is urine draining through the anterior vaginal wall. The site and number of fistulas are documented
- The diameter, depth, mobility, and mucosa of the vagina must all be assessed.
- Concomitant prolapse and urethral hypermobility should be assessed. If visualization of the opening is impaired by localized erythema and oedema, passage of a Foley catheter into the bladder and identification of the balloon may help
- Gentle digital examination, if performed, should note:
- any concurrent pelvic pathology
- the presence or absence of the uterus
- the presence and severity of any vaginal scarring
- the location and number of fistulae
- the approximate size of each fistula
- any urethral involvement
- the presence of any recto-vaginal fistula, again noting location, size, scarring, anal sphincter involvement, any rectal stricture or circumferential defect
- Methylene blue dye test is used in cases that are not too obvious from a simple speculum examination or the other simple tests mentioned. The patient may also be asked to ambulate with a vaginal pack, which will be stained blue

If with methylene blue a VVF is still not identified but still suspected, the patient should be given oral phenazopyridine hydrochloride, which stains the urine orange. The vagina is then packed, and orange staining confirms a fistula. This will require several hours of waiting before examination. A positive phenazopyridine test result with a negative methylene blue test result strongly suggests a ureterovaginal fistula
- 3 swab test (Vaginal gauze test): Three separate sponge swabs are placed into the vagina one above the other. The bladder is then filled with a coloured agent such as methylene blue, and the swabs are removed after 10 minutes

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-457.jpg?height=680&width=1631&top_left_y=1339&top_left_x=214}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Results of 3 swab test (Vaginal gauze test)}
\end{figure}

Discolouration of topmost swab is caused by VVF

Uppermost swab wetting but not discolouration suggests ureterovaginal fistula

Discolouration of only the lower most swab suggests low urethral fistula or from back flow into introitus
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-458.jpg?height=1509&width=812&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=1030)
- Examination under anaesthesia may also be necessary to confirm the location, size, and accessibility of the fistula
- Site (in relation to the bladder neck and ureteral orifices), size and degree of scarring determine the complexity of obstetric fistula. In arriving at this conclusion, the following are ascertained: number of fistulous tracts, degree of scarring of the vagina and urethral sphincter.
- Other considerations include length of residual urethra (which determines the degree of urethral reconstruction to be performed and the patient's future continence), residual bladder capacity, and status of the ureters
- A vesico-cervical or vesico-uterine communication should be ruled out. When present, methylene blue dye is seen to drain through the cervix.
- The size and status of the vagina dictate the need for vaginal augmentation and/or reconstruction.
- To assess bladder mobility and sphincteric function, the bladder is filled with normal saline $50-\mathrm{mL}$ and the catheter is raised at the level of the symphysis pubis. In the absence of Valsalva manoeuvre, any rise in the water level suggests a bladder contraction, whereas leakage through the urethral meatus during a Valsalva manoeuvre suggests sphincter insufficiency.
- Examine other systems to rule out inter-current infections and comorbidities such as LRTIs, DVT, hypertension, cardiac disease.
- The completed comprehensive evaluation then determines the patient management approach.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Laboratory tests}
- Full haemogram - For assessment of any underlying comorbidities i.e. anaemia, infections and also as a pre-operative prerequisite test
- GXM- if anaemic and for transfusion if excessive bleeding occurs intra-operatively
- Coagulation profile
- Urinalysis for assessment of urinary tract infections
- UEC- For kidney function assessment
- Triple serology (HIV, Hepatitis B \&C) - If zero-reactive needs to be addressed to improve healing
- VDRL

\section*{Imaging tests}
- Cystoscopy can be useful to better understand the location of the tract in small fistula with retracted bladder and also to rule out bladder stone or malignancies.
- Kidneys ultrasonography is a quick and useful test to detect hydronephrosis secondary to ureteral involvement in fistula patients.
- Micturating cystourethrogram
- Intravenous urogram- For assessment of any dilated renal tracts as a consequence to the fistula
- CXR- to rule TB

\section*{Management}

\section*{Immediate care at diagnosis of VVF}
- Continuous bladder drainage with Foley's catheter for I month. 20-40\% of small fistulae may heal on catheterization alone
- Removal of loose slough and necrotic tissue in the vagina
- Correction of anaemia and nutrition by giving haematinics, high protein diet for better wound healing
- Skin care- frequent washes, zinc oxide
- High fluid intake $4-51 /$ day
- Early repair when tissues are healthy

\section*{Principles of surgical repair of $\mathrm{VVF}^{12}$}

OF repair should be done by a medical professional with specialist skills in OF in an appropriate facility usually levels 4-6 facilities. The overriding principle is that the first attempt at repair offers the best chance of success which is why emphasis is placed on determining the classification of the fistula in order to decide who should operate
- Adequate exposure to ensure surgical access e.g. by labial retraction, episiotomy
- Protection of the ureters by identification and catheterisation
- Mobilization of the vagina by ensuring adequate dissection to achieve tension free closure
- Dye test to ensure water tight closure and rule out another fistula
- Continuous bladder drainage postoperative

\section*{Basic principles of repair of RVF ${ }^{12}$}

The basic principles of repair of RVF Are similar to those given for VVF except:
- Care should be taken not to cause an inadvertent stricture of the rectum.
- Preoperative bowel preparation should be more thorough than for VVF alone. This can be achieved by the use of enemas.
- A temporary colostomy may be required for large, high or severely scarred RVF.
- A previous failed repair may also require a colostomy.
- RVF repair requires prophylactic antibiotic coverage to prevent intra-operative infection.
- Postoperative women who have had an RVF repair that has not required a colostomy, should remain on a fluids-only diet for the first two days and then a low-residual diet but with a high fluid intake for a few more days.

NB: Combined fistula Combined vesico- and recto-vaginal fistula should be repaired at the same time, usually commencing with the vesico-vaginal fistula

\section*{Postoperative care}

Skilled post-operative care is key in determining the success of obstetric fistula repair

\section*{The immediate postoperative period}
- Check vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and temperature) regularly
- Indwelling urinary catheter to promote continuous urine drainage and to allow tension-free healing of the surgical scar
- Monitor for excessive blood loss both vaginally and through the catheter.
- Intravenous fluids $4-5 \mathrm{I} /$ day should be given until fluids can be taken orally.
- The fluid balance should be regularly monitored, including both fluid input and output.
- Adequate analgesia.
- Mobilized as soon as possible if she has had a simple repair.

\section*{After 24 hours and during the following days:}
- Apply the 3D principle of Drinking, Dryness and Drainage
- The woman should be encouraged to maintain a high oral-fluid intake level 4 to 5 L of fluid to enable her to produce 2 to 3 litres of urine per 24 hours. (Drinking)
- Monitor for urine leakage/bleeding (Dryness)
- Maintain continuous drainage with a Foleys catheter size 16-18F (Drainage)
- For women in the postoperative period after the surgical repair of a simple obstetric urinary fistula, short duration of bladder catheterization ( 7 to 10 days) is recommended as an alternative to longer duration of catheterization ${ }^{2}$
- The vaginal pack, if used, should be removed within 24 to 72 hours depending on the Post Op instructions.

\section*{Discharge instructions}
- To abstain from sex for at least 6 months.
- All other future deliveries to be by elective caesarean section.
- Offer family planning and adequate birth spacing counselling

\section*{Bowel care}
- Ensure a Soft diet with plenty of roughage
- Prevent constipation and undue straining
- Drugs may be used to soften the stool
- Rectal suppositories should be avoided if the client had a recto-vaginal fistula repair

\section*{Ambulation}
- Pelvic floor exercise post OF repair
- Clients done simple repairs encourage to mobilize within a day of surgery.
- For complicated repairs or ureteric re-implantation delay mobilization as per patients comfort
- In limb contractures, foot drop, or nerve damage, clients get a specialized physiotherapy program
- Prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary complications.
- Deep-breathing exercises, coughing , Positioning
- Mobilization as soon as possible, preferably on the first postoperative day

\section*{Prognostic factors which will determine outcome of surgery}
- Size of the fistula
- Scarring
- Involvement of the closing mechanism
- Concurrent RVF
- Skill of surgeon
- Previous repair
- Medical disorders e.g. HIV, poorly controlled diabetes
- Health of the tissues around the fistula
- Circumferential defect or not
- Age of patient

\section*{Postoperative complications and their management ${ }^{12}$}
- Catheter blockage-unblock catheter or change
- Bleeding-vaginal packing, EUA and ligation of bleeding vessel
- Repair breakdown-immediate repair if within 5 days post-operative, catheterization for 1 month, repeat repair after 3 months
- Tied ureters-undo the repair
- Urinary retention- self catheterization
- Post repair stress incontinence-pelvic floor exercises, stress operations, urethral plugs
- Bladder stone- surgical extraction
- Vaginal stenosis-vaginoplasty
- Urethral stenosis- urethral dilatation
- Injured ureter-reimplantation

\section*{Long-term post-operative clinical problems may include ${ }^{12}$}
- Residual incontinence, either due to the breakdown of the repair or the persistence of vesicovaginal fistula, genuine urinary stress incontinence, detrusor over-activity or mixed incontinence- physiotherapy treatment strategies for urge and stress incontinence. Cases due to failed repair will require surgical intervention.
- Urethral or vaginal strictures.
- A genuinely failed repair.
- Dyspareunia.
- Haematometra
- Secondary amenorrhoea or infertility.
- Bladder stones.

\section*{POST ABORTION CARE}

\section*{Introduction}

Unsafe abortion is one of the big five contributors to maternal mortality with an estimated contribution of around $13 \%{ }^{4}$. A woman is more likely to die from unsafe abortion related complications in the African continent as compared to other regions. ${ }^{\underline{3}}$

According to Dragoman et al (10), severe maternal outcomes related to abortion are mostly encountered in women between the ages $20-34$. Increased mortality rates are seen in women who undertake abortion at gestational ages of > 14 weeks with no support systems. Hemorrhage is the most common cause of severe maternal outcomes; however, infection (alone and in combination with hemorrhage) is the most common cause of death.

In Kenya, unsafe abortion is a major social and public health problem ${ }^{17}$. A nationwide research showed that about half a million induced abortions-unsafe for the most part-occurred in the country in 2012, corresponding to an abortion ratio of 48 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age ${ }^{18}$. In Kenya, Abortion contributes to $13 \%$ of maternal mortality.

The strain put on the health care system in terms of cost cannot be understated since studies have shown the cost implications associated with management of unsafe abortion related complications both at the global level and on a study carried out in Kenya ${ }^{\underline{6}, 7}$

\section*{Definition}

Early pregnancy loss: is the loss of pregnancy whether spontaneous or by induction before viability outside the woman's womb.

Medically early pregnancy loss is interchangeably used with abortion
Abortion: The loss of a pregnancy, whether spontaneously or by induction, before viability outside the mother's womb

Abortion can be further classified as spontaneous or induced
Unsafe abortion-is defined as a procedure meant to terminate a pregnancy carried out by either person lacking the necessary skill or in an environment that does not conform to the minimal medical standards or both. $\underline{2}, \underline{11}$

\section*{Classification}

Threatened Abortion: Pregnancy related bloody vaginal discharge or frank bleeding during the first half of pregnancy without cervical dilatation. WHO, May 2019
- Inevitable abortion: The Cervix has dilated, but products of conception have not been expelled
- Complete abortion: Complete expulsion of all products of conception
- Incomplete abortion: Parts of the products of conception are retained in the uterus
- Missed abortion: Occurs when the embryo/foetus has died in the uterus but a miscarriage has not yet occurred
- Septic abortion: Abortion associated with infection of the products of conception and endometrial lining of the uterus leading to generalized infection

\section*{Risk factors for spontaneous abortion}

The majority of spontaneous abortions occur early in pregnancy with approximately $80 \%$ occurring in the first trimester. In many cases, there is no specific factor that causes a spontaneous abortion.

However, more than half of first trimester spontaneous abortions are due to abnormal embryological development.

Other possible factors include: febrile illnesses, systemic and genital infections such as syphilis, systemic tuberculosis, Chagas disease, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, toxoplasma gondii, listeria, brucella, maternal chronic disease, hormonal causes, environmental toxins, dietary causes, anatomic abnormalities, and pregnancy occurring while an IUD is in place.

\section*{Consequences of unsafe abortion $8.9 .10,11,12,13,14$}
- Loss of fertility- This can be as a result of complications that may necessitate hysterectomies, Asherman syndrome and Sheehan syndrome.
- Psychosocial disorders i.e. depression as a result of guilty feelings
- Disability
- Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
- Maternal mortality
- Excessive additional costs to the health system and community

\section*{Prevention of unsafe abortion ${ }^{7,15,16}$}

This is aimed at:
- Reducing the number of unintended pregnancies thereby preventing the etiological agent predisposing women to unsafe abortion
- Provision of post abortion care to avert maternal morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion complications
- Counseling and provision of contraception/ family planning services as integral to post abortion care
- Community engagement and networking
- Health facilities conducting of monitoring and evaluation of post abortion care services

\section*{Post Abortion Care}

PAC is an obstetric emergency and the patient should be stabilized.
Triage the patient and assess for shock and any emergency situation and manage

\section*{Initial assessment}
- The purpose of the initial assessment is to assess for immediate life-threatening complications i.e. shock, severe vaginal bleeding, infection/ sepsis or intra-abdominal injury.
- Inform patient/ client what you are going to do.
- Address these complications immediately if present.

\section*{Complete clinical assessment}
- History- Get the following information (from the woman or the accompanying person)
- Period of amenorrhea (LNMP) to establish the gestational age
- Bleeding- Duration, amount, color, presence of any clots
- Abdominal pain- Site, onset of pain, character of the pain, radiation of the pain (shoulder pain?), associated factors, timing (constant or intermittent), exacerbating, relieving factors, severity of the pain
- Fevers, Generalized body malaise
- Loss of consciousness
- Any attempts at interference/ termination of pregnancy
- Past obstetric history (any complications?)
- Drug / food allergies

\section*{General and physical examination ${ }^{8}$}
- Vital signs- Blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}$
- Note the general condition and nutritional status of the patient
- Thorough head to toe examination- Pallor, jaundice, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, check for any physical injuries
- Abdominal examination- Look for signs of peritonitis (silent/ still abdomen, rigidity, guarding), abdominal distension, abdominal masses, ascertain the area of tenderness, auscultate for bowel sounds
- Examine other body systems i.e. respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal.

\section*{Pelvic examination}
- Examine the external genitalia for any injuries
- Note if there is any foul smelling discharge
- Perform a speculum examination
- Remove any visible products of conception from the vaginal canal or cervical os
- Check for any vaginal or cervical lacerations
- Note the amount of bleeding and check whether the cervical os is open or closed
- Perform a bimanual pelvic examination- to estimate the size of the uterus, check for pelvic masses, check for pelvic pain (note the location, what exacerbates the pain- at rest, touch, pressure, cervical movement)
- Provide comprehensive counseling with post abortion care
- Investigations
- Laboratory investigations
- Full haemogram
- Blood grouping and cross-matching
- Coagulation screen
- Rh testing
- Triple serology (HIV, Hepatitis B\&C) and STI screening
- Blood culture in suspected septic shock
- Renal function tests- Urea, Electrolytes, Creatinine
- Blood Gas Analysis - for patients in shock
- Imaging

\section*{Methods of uterine evacuation}

First trimester uterine evacuation (<12 weeks): Provide Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA)

\section*{Steps for performing manual vacuum aspiration using MVA and Canulae ${ }^{\underline{\text { I7 }}}$}

\section*{Steps for Performing Manual Vacuum Aspiration}

\section*{Step one:}
- Prepare the patient
- Administer pain medication before the procedure to have maximum effect when the procedure begins
- Give prophylactic antibiotics to all women or therapeutic antibiotics if indicated
- Ask the woman to empty her bladder
- Conduct a bi manual exam to confirm uterine size and position
- Insert speculum and observe for signs of infection, bleeding
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-471.jpg?height=596&width=852&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=1004)

\section*{Step Two}
- Perform cervical antiseptic prep
- Use antiseptic soaked sponge to clean cervical os
- Start at os then spiral outward without retracing areas
- Repeat until os has been completely covered by antiseptic
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-471.jpg?height=515&width=655&top_left_y=1127&top_left_x=1142)

\section*{Step Three}
- Perform a para cervical block with 20 cc of $1 \%$ lidocaine or 10 cc of $2 \%$ lidocaine
- Inject small amount of lidocaine (I-2cc) in to the cervix at the tenaculum site ( 12 o'clock)
- Inject the remaining lidocaine in equal amounts at the cervical vaginal junction at 2,4,8 and 10 o'clock
- Always aspirate before injecting to prevent intravascular injection of lidocaine
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-471.jpg?height=501&width=844&top_left_y=1627&top_left_x=1013)

\section*{Step Four: Dilate Cervix}
- Observe no-touch technique when dilating the cervix and during aspiration.
- Instruments that enter the uterine cavity should not touch your gloved hands, the patient's skin, the woman's vaginal walls, or unsterile parts of the instrument tray before entering the cervix
- Use mechanical dilators or progressively larger cannulae to gently dilate the cervix to the right size.

\section*{Step Five: Insert Cannula}
- While applying traction to the tenaculum, insert cannula through the cervix, just past the os and into the uterine cavity
- Do not insert the cannula forcefully
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-472.jpg?height=507&width=817&top_left_y=205&top_left_x=1022)

Step Six: Prepare the Aspirator
- Position the plunger all the way inside the cylinder
- Have collar stop in place with tabs in the cylinder hole
- Push valve buttons down and forward until they lock (I)
- Pull plunger back until arms snap outward and catch on cylinder base (2)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-472.jpg?height=550&width=831&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1019)

\section*{Step Seven: Suction Uterine Contents}
- Attach the prepared aspirator to the cannula
- Release the vacuum by pressing both buttons
- Evacuate the contents of the uterus by gently and slowly rotating the cannula $180^{\circ}$ in each direction, using an in-and-out motion
- When the procedure is finished, depress the buttons and disconnect the cannula from the aspirator
- Alternatively, withdraw the cannula and aspirator without depressing the buttons
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-472.jpg?height=561&width=821&top_left_y=1310&top_left_x=1027)

Signs that indicate the uterus is empty:
- Red or pink foam without tissue is seen passing through the cannula
- A gritty sensation is felt as the cannula passes over the surface of the evacuated uterus
- The uterus contracts around or grips the cannula
- The patient complains of cramping or pain, indicating that the uterus is contracting
$\_\_\_\_$
Step Eight: Inspect Tissue
- Empty the contents of the aspirator into a container
- Strain material, float in water or vinegar and view with a light from beneath
- Inspect tissue for products of conception, complete evacuation and molar pregnancy
- If inspection is inconclusive, re-aspiration or other evaluation may be necessary
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-472.jpg?height=466&width=544&top_left_y=2124&top_left_x=1167)

Step Nine: Perform Any Concurrent Procedures
- When procedure is complete, proceed with contraception or other procedures, such as IUD insertion or cervical tear repair.

Step Ten: Immediately After the Procedure
- Reassure the woman that the procedure is finished
- Ensure she is escorted to the recovery area
- Immediately process or discard all instruments, according to local protocols

\section*{Medical methods of uterine evacuation}

\section*{Misoprostol Dosage for PAC by route of administration}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Gestation & Dosage & Route of administration & Timing & Efficacy \\
\hline Less than 12 weeks uterine size & 600 ug & Oral & Stat & 90-99\% \\
\hline & 400 ug & Sublingual & Place tablets under the tongue for 30 minutes then swallow the drug if any remaining & 95\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Second trimester uterine evacuation gestation 13-20 weeks}
- Conducted in hospital set up
- Client presenting in an outpatient facility resuscitate and refer to a well-equipped facility to offer comprehensive obstetric services

\section*{Surgical methods of uterine evacuation in second trimester}
- Admit the client and evacuation of products of conception removed in theatre under sedation or general anesthesia
- This procedure best conducted in comprehensive Obstetric care facilities with the available expertise

\section*{Post abortion contraception/ family planning}

This can be achieved through post abortion counselling and follow up and provision of means to regulate their fertility in a way that is appropriate, acceptable, averts sequelae of unplanned pregnancies and facilitates recovery post abortion.

Post abortion counselling should be as objective as possible and non - judgmental to avoid further emotional torture to the woman. Mechanisms for referral for other reproductive health services should be considered i.e., STI/HIV counselling and testing, abuse support services and psychological support services.

The need for contraception after abortion cannot be understated since in the absence of any complications, Ovulatory cycles continue as usual. Therefore, post abortion contraceptive use is highly recommended. This is based on the woman's preference and the medical eligibility criteria.

\section*{POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE}

\section*{Epidemiology}

Approximately $30 \%$ of maternal deaths worldwide are due to hemorrhage mostly in the immediate postpartum period. ${ }^{\text {I }}$, 19

The global prevalence of PPH is $6 \%$ and the highest burden is experienced in low-income countries. The magnitude of PPH in sub-Saharan Africa is high at $10.5 \% .^{7}$

Kenya has a Maternal Mortality Ratio of 362 per 100,000 live births as per KDHS 2014. Obstetric hemorrhage; the leading cause of maternal deaths, accounts for $39 \%(*)$ of maternal deaths ${ }^{27}$. PPH accounts for $75 \%$ of all obstetric haemorrhage ${ }^{27}$. Other causes of maternal death include hypertensive disorders, sepsis, obstructed labor, abortion and its complications as well as other indirect causes. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Definition}

Postpartum hemorrhage has been defined as blood loss in excess of 500 ml in a vaginal birth and in excess of 1000 ml in a cesarean delivery. For clinical purposes, any blood loss that has the potential to produce hemodynamic instability should be considered PPH. Clinical estimates of blood loss are often inaccurate. ${ }^{1}$ There may be more one than definition of PPH.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Aspect & Definition \\
\hline Blood Volume Loss & \begin{tabular}{l}
- After vaginal birth: 500 ml or more ${ }^{\underline{2}}$ \\
- After Caesarian Section: 1000 ml or more ${ }^{1}$ \\
- Severe: 1000 ml or more ${ }^{4}$ \\
- Very severe: 2500 ml or more ${ }^{4}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Hemodynamic Compromise & \begin{tabular}{l}
Due to frequent underestimation of blood loss, PPH may first be detected through hemodynamic compromise manifesting as increasing tachycardia and hypotension ${ }^{3}$ \\
A healthy pregnant woman will only show mild signs of shock after a blood loss of 1000 ml . Conversely, compromise may occur earlier in women with gestational hypertension with proteinuria, anemia and dehydration, cardiac disease. ${ }^{3}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline ICD-11 & \begin{tabular}{l}
Hemorrhage after delivery of the fetus and including sub-classifications of: \\
- $3^{\text {rd }}$ stage: hemorrhage due to retained, trapped or adherent placenta \\
- Other immediate: hemorrhage following delivery of the placenta, postpartum hemorrhage (atony-related)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

}
- Delayed and secondary: that associated with retained portions of placenta and membranes
- Reproductive tract injuries.
- Postpartum coagulation defects: post-partum afibrinogenemia and fibrinolysis

PPH Care bundles includes preparedness, recognition, response and review of the patient following its management.

\section*{Classification}
- Primary postpartum hemorrhage: Primary (immediate) PPH occurs within the first 24 hours after delivery. Approximately $70 \%$ of immediate PPH cases are due to uterine atony. Atony of the uterus is defined as the failure of the uterus to contract adequately after delivery 1, $\underline{2}$
- Secondary postpartum hemorrhage: Secondary (late) PPH occurs between 24 hours after delivery of the infant and up to 6weeks postpartum. Most late PPH is due to retained products of conception, infection, or both. ${ }^{1,2}$

\section*{Etiology}

It may be helpful to think of the causes of PPH in terms of the 4 "T" s. More than one cause may however be present e.g., tone and tissue ${ }^{4,1,14}$
- Tone (70\%): uterine atony
- Trauma ( $20 \%$ ): uterine, cervical, or vaginal injury, uterine inversion
- Tissue ( $10 \%$ ): retained placenta (cotyledon or succenturiate lobe) or clots
- Thrombopathy (<1\%): pre-existing or acquired coagulopathy

\section*{Risk Factors}

Many women who have PPH have no identifiable risk factors ${ }^{\underline{4}}$
- Ante-Natal: maternal age above 35 years, parity $>3$, prior uterine surgery, previous PPH, uterine fibroids, pre-eclampsia, anemia, gestational diabetes, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios and antepartum hemorrhage
- Intrapartum: Induction of labor, prolonged $2{ }^{\text {nd }}$ stage, prolonged $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ stage, retained placenta, instrumental vaginal birth, macrosomia, uterine rupture, general anesthesia, genital tract injuries, infection after PROM or temperature above 38 degrees Celsius

\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Diagnosis}

Apart from the quantity of blood loss, clinical signs, and the shock index in particular are critical in obtaining a more accurate diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage ${ }^{10},{ }^{13}$. The shock index is obtained by dividing the heart rate with the systolic blood pressure ${ }^{13}$.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Haemodynamic status & Class I & Class II & Class III & Class IV \\
\hline Shock & No shock (compensatory) & Mild shock & Moderate shock & Severe shock \\
\hline Signs and Symptoms & Palpitations, dizziness, tachycardia & Weakness, sweating, tachycardia & Restlessness, pallor, oliguria & Collapse, air hunger, anuria \\
\hline Blood loss(mls) & 500-1000 & 1000-1500 & 1500-2000 & 2000-3000 \\
\hline Systolic Blood pressure & Normal & Slight decrease & Marked decrease & Profound decrease \\
\hline Sl at Admission & <0.6 & $\geq 0.6$ to <1 & $\geq 1$ to <I. 4 & $\geq 1.4$ \\
\hline Need of Blood products & Observe & Consider use of blood products & Prepare transfusion & Prepare massive transfusion \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Prevention of Postpartum Hemorrhage}

\section*{Correction of anemia in the antenatal period}

The WHO recommends daily iron and folic acid supplementation with 30 mg to 60 mg of elemental iron and $400 \mu \mathrm{~g}(0.4 \mathrm{mg})$ of folic acid. This should be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed or at preconception if previous problems with folic acid deficiency have been encountered.

\section*{Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor}

Available evidence supports routine use of active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) by all skilled birth attendants, regardless of where they practice; AMTSL reduces the incidence of PPH, the quantity of blood loss, and the need for blood transfusion, and thus should be included in any program of intervention aimed at reducing death from PPH ${ }^{1.20}$

The components of AMTSL include:
- Administration of oxytocin or another uterotonic drug within I minute after birth of the baby after ruling out multiple gestation
- Controlled cord traction
- Uterine massage after delivery of the placenta

NOTE: It is recommended that the women should be advised to pass urine before she reaches $2^{\text {nd }}$ stage[GMI][SS2][US3][US4][US5].

\section*{Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMSTL)}

\section*{Offer to every woman at every delivery}
- Palpate the uterus to rule out additional babies
- Give Uterotonic drug within 1 minute of childbirth

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

1
- Deliver placenta by controlled cord traction on the umbilical cord and counter pressure on the uterus

2
- Massage the uterus until firm and contracted, then every 15 minutes for 2 hours by provider or client herself

Examine placenta
Measure blood loss
Monitor blood loss and manage accordingly

\section*{Step I: How to use Uterotonic agents}
- Within 1 minute of delivery of the infant, palpate the abdomen to rule out the presence of an additional infant(s) and give oxytocin 10 IU intramuscularly (IM).
- For CS delivery I0IU of oxytocin is given IV over 1 to 2 minutes. Oxytocin is preferred as the first line over other uterotonic drugs because it is effective $2-3$ minutes after injection, has minimal adverse effects, and can be used in all women. $1.6,19,20$
- If oxytocin is not available or its quality cannot be assured, other uterotonics can be used, such as: Heat stable carbetocin $100 \mu \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{IM}$, ergometrine or methyl-ergometrine 0.2 mg IM ; syntometrine (a combination of oxytocin 5 IU and ergometrine 0.5 mg per ampoule IM)or misoprostol $600 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ orally. ${ }^{1}$

\section*{Choice of uterotonics for PPH prevention}
- In settings where multiple uterotonic options are available, oxytocin (IO IU, IM/IV) is the recommended uterotonic agent for the prevention of PPH for all births.
- In settings where oxytocin is unavailable (or its quality cannot be guaranteed sometimes due to poor storage), the use of other injectable uterotonics - carbetocin, or if appropriate ergometrine/ methylergometrine, or oxytocin and ergometrine fixed-dose combination or oral misoprostol is recommended for the prevention of PPH.

Do not give ergometrine, methyl-ergometrine, or syntometrine to women with heart disease, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, or high blood pressure.

\section*{Misoprostol in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage}

The usual components of management of the third stage of labor with misoprostol include: A single dose of $600 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ administered orally ${ }^{1}$

Administration of Misoprostol can be done at the local health facilities ${ }^{18}$

\section*{Step 2: How to do controlled cord traction ${ }^{1}$}
- Delay cord clamping until cord pulsations stop or approximately 2 minutes if the newborn is healthy, immediate cord clamping may be necessary if the newborn requires resuscitation
- Place the other hand just above the woman's pubic bone and stabilize the uterus by applying counter-pressure during controlled cord traction.
- Keep slight tension on the cord and await a strong uterine contraction ( $2-3$ minutes).
- With the strong uterine contraction, encourage the mother to push and very gently pull downward on the cord to deliver the placenta.
- Continue to apply counter-pressure to the uterus.
- If the placenta does not descend during 30-40 seconds of controlled cord traction, do not continue to pull on the cord. Gently hold the cord and wait until the uterus is well contracted again. With the next contraction, repeat controlled cord traction with counter-pressure.
- Never apply cord traction (gentle pull) without applying counter-traction (push) above the pubic bone on a well-contracted uterus.
- As the placenta delivers, hold the placenta in 2 hands and gently turn it until the membranes are twisted. Slowly pull to complete the delivery.
- Examination of the placenta and membranes to confirm its completeness. If a portion of the maternal surface is missing or there are torn membranes with vessels, suspect retained placenta fragments and take appropriate action.

\section*{Step 3: How to do uterine massage}

Not recommended in patients who have had prophylactic uterotonics administered.
- Immediately after expulsion of the placenta, massage the fundus of the uterus through the abdomen until the uterus is contracted.
- Palpate for a contracted uterus every 15 minutes and repeat uterine massage as needed during the first 2 hours. Ensure that the uterus does not become relaxed (soft) after you stop uterine massage.

\section*{$4{ }^{\text {th }}$ Stage Monitoring}

If risk factors for PPH are identified, monitor the woman for 1 to 2 hours after delivery then 4 hourly for 24 to 48 hours (REF: Postnatal care guidelines). Important to monitor using the MEOW Chart ${ }^{\underline{3}}$

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Observations & Frequency \\
\hline Temperature & 30 minutes \\
\hline Pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure & 15 minutes \\
\hline Oxygen saturation & Once or as clinically indicated \\
\hline Fundus/lochia & 15 to 30 minutes \\
\hline Urine output & Within the first 2 hours ( 30 mls / hour) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Management of Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage}

\section*{Preparedness}

Pre-requisite for effective management of PPH
- Triage MEOW charts
- Regular emergency drills in health facilities
- Multi-disciplinary team
- PPH KIT
- Blood and blood products
- Sterile elbow gloves for manual removal of placenta/ MVA kits
- Comprehensive obstetric units/ Referral from lower health facilities

\section*{Treatment of Primary Postpartum Hemorrhage}

Even with major advances in prevention of PPH, some women will still require treatment for excessive bleeding. Timely interventions and appropriate access, or referral and transfer to basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric care (EmONC) facilities for treatment are essential to saving the lives of women. ${ }^{1}$

All healthcare professionals should be trained on the PPH care bundles that include: readiness (preparedness), recognize, respond and review. They should refresh their knowledge and skills in emergency obstetrics on a regular basis through workshops that include didactics, practical exercises, simulations/drills and evaluations. Tracking through clinical audits and MPDSR providing for performance indicators on quality of care. ${ }^{1}$ Key to the effectiveness of treatment is early identification of hemorrhage and prompt initiation of treatment

RECOGNIZE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF PPH (4T's) which include: uterine atony, retained products of conception, tears, coagulopathy.

\section*{UTERINE ATONY}

\section*{Definition}

This refers to failure of the uterus to contract adequately. Any condition that interferes with uterine contractions will lead to an atonic uterus. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Predisposing Factors to Uterine Atony:}
- Retained placenta, placental fragments, tissue/membranes, blood clots
- Overdistention of the uterus due to multiple gestation, excess amniotic fluid or a large baby.
- High parity.
- Prolonged labor
- Induction or augmentation of labour
- Precipitous labour (labour lasting less than 3 hours)
- Full bladder
- Uterine fibroids in pregnancy

\section*{Management of Refractory Uterine Atony (Refractory PPH)}

\section*{Definition of Refractory PPH}

This refers to the bleeding that cannot be controlled even after institution of $1^{\text {st }}$ line treatment for PPH.

Note: Before proceeding to invasive surgical procedures, WHO recommends the use of additional uterotonics, a second dose of tranexamic acid and use of intra uterine balloon tamponade.
$1^{\text {st }}$ steps in the management of Refractory PPH
- Empty bladder and insert indwelling catheter for monitoring input- output chart
- Continuous patient monitoring with MEOW chart

\section*{Mechanism of UBT Free Flow System}

The free flow system is an open system that:
- Stops bleeding as soon as pressure on uterus wall is slightly higher than systolic BP
- Allows for the physiological process of contraction and retraction of myometrium
- Allows water to fill the balloon in less than one minute
- Adjusting the height of the bag controls pressure exerted on uterus wall
- Allows water to be expelled from the balloon back to the supply bag reducing the size of the balloon: Free Flow Mechanism (FFM)
- Allows pressure control that will prevent tissue necrosis if used together with brace/ compression sutures

\section*{Non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG)}

\section*{Definition}
- NASG is a compression suit that limits persistent PPH by reducing blood volume in the lower extremities and increasing the blood volume to vital organs for treatment of hypovolemic shock. It is lightweight washable, resusable and segmented to wrap over the lower limbs and abdominal region.

\section*{S-Shift to Operating Theatre or higher center:}
- If initial medical therapy fails within Golden Hour, shift to a center where multidisciplinary approach available "Death can occur within 2 hours of PPH"
- Two important life savior methods to transfer include:
- Aortic compression by Skilled Birth Attendant
- Non Pneumatic Anti Shock Garment
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-495.jpg?height=740&width=1631&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=214)

\section*{Management of refractory PPH}
A. Supportive management of:
i. Hypovolaemic shock
ii. Prevention of multiple organ failure
B. Definitive surgical interventions
- Haemostatic suture placement
- Devascularization of uterine artery, uteroovarian artery, internal iliac vessel (anterior division) OR
- Embolisation of the vessels
- Hysterectomy

\section*{Compression Sutures}

B-Lynch suture, Hayman suture, Pereira suture

\section*{Genital Tract Trauma}

Genital tract trauma i.e., Cervical or vaginal lacerations is an obstetric risk to women undergoing vaginal delivery. Bleeds from cervical or vaginal lacerations are venous in origin and may be the source of postpartum hemorrhage ${ }^{14}$.

Genital tract trauma may occur with other causes of PPH and therefore in the presence of a well contracted uterus, this possibility should be considered since it is the second commonest cause of primary postpartum hemorrhage ${ }^{3}$. Some of the causes of genital tract trauma during delivery include: Precipitous labor, assisted vaginal delivery, perineal tears particularly in Primigravida women.

The presentation may vary from patients with obvious tears, to poorly repaired episiotomies and vaginal hematomas therefore creating a paradoxical picture where clinical signs do not correlate to the amount of blood loss.

Perineal tears repair - provide adequate analgesia and effective communication. Ensure proper lighting is available.

\section*{Genital Tract Trauma Management and Care}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-497.jpg?height=1663&width=1608&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=217)
*Footnote: Tranexamic acid must be administered within 3 hours in management of PPH
Figure 78: Illustrating an approach to patient with PPH from Genital Tract Trauma.

\section*{Retained Tissue}

Retained placenta or placental fragments results in PPH due to ineffective uterine contraction therefore preventing closure of the exposed sinuses from other sites of placental attachment.

\section*{Predisposing factors to retained products}
- A full bladder which may hinder delivery of the placenta
- Cord avulsion
- Disorders of placentation which result in invasion of the placenta to the myometrial walls.
- Abnormal placenta eg extra lobe

The placenta may appear intact even though there may be remaining products of conception for example succenturiate lobe within the uterine cavity ${ }^{14}$. Therefore, thorough examination of the placenta is recommended after its delivery.

\section*{APPROACH TO A PATIENT CARE WITH RETAINED PRODUCTS AS A CAUSE OF PPH}

\caption{Figure 79: Approach to a patient with PPH due to tissue remnants as a cause of PPH.}
\end{figure}

Caution: Beware of iatrogenic perineal laceration induced by vigorous examination. Ensure gentle examination and lubrication of instruments.

\section*{Coagulopathy}
- Thrombopathies can occur both as a cause and a complication of massive obstetric hemorrhage with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) being the most fatal.
- Thrombopathy can occur as a result of: abruptio placentae, fetal death in utero, amniotic fluid embolism, existing/inherited coagulation profile disorders and other causes ${ }^{3,15}$.
- The clinical manifestations vary from massive hemorrhage with/without thrombotic complications to a clinical stable state.
- Thrombopathies may be detected through laboratory indices such as: Full haemogram with an interest in the platelet counts, International Normalized Ratio (INR), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Evaluation of fibrinogen degradation products i.e., D-dimers

\section*{Management of thrombopathies $\underline{15}$}
- Use blood products to help control hemorrhage
- Give fresh whole blood, if available, to replace clotting factors and red cells. If fresh whole blood is not available, choose one of the following based on availability
- Packed (or sedimented) red cells for red cell replacement
- Fresh frozen plasma for replacement of all clotting factors ( $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight)
- Cryoprecipitate to replace fibrinogen and factor VIII in case of disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Platelet concentrates (if bleeding continues and the platelet count is less than 20,000).

Note: If the cause is known, i.e., in placenta abruption and eclampsia, aim to treat the cause.

\section*{Complications of Postpartum Hemorrhage II}

\section*{Early/immediate}
- Anemia
- Blood transfusion and reactions.
- Dilutional coagulopathy
- Fatigue
- Myocardial ischemia
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome.

\section*{Late}
- Anterior pituitary ischemia with delay or failure of lactation (i.e., Sheehan syndrome or postpartum pituitary necrosis)
- Loss of fertility due to hysterectomy
- Death

\section*{MATERNAL SEPSIS}

\section*{Introduction}

Maternal sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during pregnancy, child birth, post abortion or post-partum (within 42 days) ${ }^{1,2,11}$

The new WHO definition of maternal sepsis aligns with the $3^{\text {rd }}$ international consensus on sepsis (2016) that lays emphasis on organ dysfunction therefore predicting in-hospital mortality ${ }^{1,2,11,12}$

Pregnancy-related infections includes genital tract infections; chorioamnionitis and endometritis, extra-genital infections such as pyelonephritis as well as other infections complicating pregnancy, delivery and the puerperium (HIV, malaria, STIs, fungal and viral infections) ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

Pregnancy and delivery predispose women to infectious complications due to immunological and physiological adaptations to pregnancy, blood loss and increased maternal activity during labor ${ }^{7}$ 11

Early recognition of sepsis is crucial. The "golden hour of sepsis" underscores the correlation between timely initiation of antibiotic treatment and outcome. Each hour delay in treatment decreases survival by $7.6 \%^{\underline{5}}$

The Global Maternal Sepsis Study (GLOSS) established that effective prevention, early diagnosis and timely management of maternal sepsis are essential factors in reducing the impact of the disease on maternal mortality. $\underline{ }^{2,11}$

Women who experience peri-partum infections are susceptible to long term complications which include: chronic pelvic pain, fallopian tube blockage and secondary infertility ${ }^{\underline{2}, \underline{6}, \underline{7}}$

The biggest challenge so far in management of maternal sepsis is the lack of standard criteria to identify women with maternal sepsis. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

\section*{Epidemiology}

Sepsis is a major cause of maternal morbidity \& mortality especially in low- and middle-income countries it ranks $3^{\text {rd }}$ among the leading direct causes of maternal mortality and accounts for $15 \%$ of deaths. ${ }^{1,3,6}$

Globally, maternal infections before and during childbirth are associated with I million new born deaths annually. ${ }^{3,12}$

Case fatality rate for maternal sepsis remains high between $4 \%$ and $50 \%$ reported in sub-Saharan Africa and south East Asia ${ }^{3}$

\section*{Risk factors for maternal sepsis}

Several factors have been associated with increased risk of maternal peri-partum infections and these include: ${ }^{\underline{3}, \underline{6}, 7}$
- Pre-existing maternal conditions such as malnutrition, diabetes, obesity and severe anemia
- Bacterial vaginosis
- Group B streptococcal infections
- Spontaneous or provider-initiated conditions during pregnancy, labor and child birth such as cervical cerclage, premature and prolonged rupture of membranes, multiple vaginal examinations, manual removal of the placenta and caesarian section

Caesarian section is the most important risk factor in the immediate post-partum period with a 5-20-fold risk compared to vaginal delivery ${ }^{3}$

Strategies to reduce maternal peri-partum infections, their short- and long-term sequelae are directed at preventive measures where such risk factors are present. Promotion of good infection control practices both in the hospital and at home is also paramount. ${ }^{3,11}$

\section*{Prevention of maternal sepsis and maternal deaths relating to sepsis $\underline{1,3,5,8}$}

The general principles that can be employed to reduce maternal sepsis can be broadly categorized into:
- Improving access to clean water and sanitation;
- Improving access to quality care during pregnancy and birth;
- Responsible and timely access to the right medicines;
- Proper infection prevention and control in hospitals and clinics.

With this in mind, the prevention strategies can further be sub classified into Pre, Intra and Postpartum.

\section*{Pre-partum prevention}
- Promoting Antenatal clinic visits based on the 2016 WHO ANC model to improve the continuum of care during pregnancy. Also, during these visits, women should be sensitized on the danger signs of sepsis i.e. Fever, Foul smelling vaginal discharge, Abdominal pains unrelated to labor so as to enable them to seek prompt medical interventions
- Routine vaccinations such as Tetanus toxoid
- Use of insecticide treated bed nets and Intermittent prevention therapy in malaria endemic zones
- Safe abortion care
- Prevention of anaemia

\section*{Intra-partum prevention}
- Delivery in areas where there are proper infection control methods. This may involve training of Traditional Birth Attendants on appropriate puerperal care
- Digital vaginal examination at intervals of four hours for routine assessment of active stage of labor in low risk women
- Intrapartum antibiotic administration to women with group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization for prevention of early neonatal GBS infection
- Antibiotic administration for women with preterm prelabour rupture of membranes
- Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing manual removal of the placenta
- Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for women with third or fourth degree perineal tears
- Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for women undergoing caesarian sections
- Prompt recognition and treatment of women with infections intrapartum to avoid the risk of maternal death relating to sepsis

\section*{Post-partum prevention}
- Advise women to be on the lookout for possible signs that may indicate puerperal sepsis.
- Prompt treatment of those presenting with signs of puerperal sepsis

\section*{Management}

\section*{Clinical presentation ${ }^{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{,} \mathbf{8}$}

This is based on the various predisposing factors and the time at which the patient presents from the onset of symptoms.

General symptoms include:
- Constant severe abdomino-pelvic pain
- Offensive vaginal discharge
- Fever or rigors
- Diaphoresis
- Nausea and vomiting
- Urinary symptoms i.e. dysuria
- Generalized maculopapular rash
- Conjunctival suffusion
- Productive cough

\section*{Clinical signs}
- Elevated body temperatures $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ low core body temperatures $<36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Abdominal-pelvic /uterine tenderness
- Decreased capillary refill with clammy or mottled skin
- Tachycardia (heart rate greater than 110 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ )
- Low blood pressure- systolic BP less than 90 mmHg
- Tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 24 beats/min)
- Low oxygen saturation (less than $90 \%$ at room temperature)
- Altered mental state (confusion, decreased alertness with low scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale score)
- Reduced urinary output ( $<0.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hour}$ )
- Fetal distress (fetal tachycardia, acidosis)

In severe infections, the following unusual scenarios may occur and these necessitate urgent interventions to avoid possible loss of life: ${ }^{6}$
- Septic shock
- Adult respiratory distress syndrome
- Hemolysis
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
- Increasing area of cellulitis and necrosis of tissue dependent on the site of infection

\section*{The National Early Warning System (NEWS² Score)¹3}

Developed to standardize the process of recording, scoring and responding to changes in routinely measured parameters in acutely ill patients.

Founded on the premise that early detection, timeliness and competency of the clinical response comprise a triad of determinants of clinical outcomes in people with acute illness.

It is based on a single aggregate scoring system in which a score is allocated to physiological measurements already recorded in routine practice namely: respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic BP, pulse rate, level of consciousness or new confusion, temperature.

NEWS ${ }^{2}$ is superior to QSOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) in detecting sepsis with organ dysfunction.

Sepsis should be considered in any patient with a NEWS score of $>/=5$ in the presence of a known infection or symptoms and signs of infection.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Chart 1: The NEWS scoring system}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Physiological parameter & 3 & 2 & 1 & Score 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline Respiration rate (per minute) & $\leq 8$ & & 9-11 & 12-20 & & 21-24 & $\geq 25$ \\
\hline $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ Scale 1 ( \% ) & $\leq 91$ & 92-93 & 94-95 & $\geq 96$ & & & \\
\hline $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ Scale 2 (\%) & $\leq 83$ & 84-85 & 86-87 & 88-92 $\geq 93$ on air & 93-94 on oxygen & 95-96 on oxygen & $\geq 97$ on oxygen \\
\hline Air or oxygen? & & Oxygen & & Air & & & \\
\hline Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) & $\leq 90$ & 91-100 & 101-110 & 111-219 & & & $\geq 220$ \\
\hline Pulse (per minute) & $\leq 40$ & & 41-50 & 51-90 & 91-110 & 111-130 & $\geq 131$ \\

\hline Temperature ("C) & $\leq 35.0$ & & 35.1-36.0 & 36.1-38.0 & 38.1-39.0 & $\geq 39.1$ & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Investigations ${ }^{6,10}$}

Investigations are directed at determining the etiology and risk stratification of sepsis as well as organization of care for women in the most appropriate clinical area.

Relevant first line investigations for suspected maternal sepsis include the following:
- Blood cultures are useful in isolating the causative agent(s). At least two sets of samples from different sites are cultured before commencing antibiotic treatment. The blood samples should be taken using aseptic techniques.
- Cultures from high vaginal swabs specimens
- Urine culture: mid-stream clean-catch sample
- Urinalysis
- Blood glucose: elevations in non-diabetic patients is a possible indicator of sepsis.
- Blood gas analysis is vital in the detection of acidosis and hypoxemia if progression to septic shock is suspected.
- C-reactive protein
- Full blood count with emphasis on white blood cell count.
- Liver function tests as the source of infection may be hepatic or peri-hepatic.
- Creatinine urea and electrolytes; creatinine is elevated in severe sepsis.
- Serum lactate levels; elevated levels in sepsis point to tissue hypo perfusion and thus increased risk of mortality
- Shielded chest radiograph if pulmonary infection is suspected.
- Pelvic ultrasound if there is a suspicion of retained products of conception or a pelvic abscess
- Fetal assessment using cardiotocography and/or fetal ultrasound

\section*{Treatment of maternal sepsis $\underline{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{6}, \underline{10}$}

Treatment should be commenced as soon as possible - ideally within the first hour ('golden hour') of sepsis being suspected ${ }^{\underline{6}}$.

Empiric treatment should include fluid resuscitation, correction of hypoxia and antimicrobials (antibiotics or antivirals as appropriate). Source control, consideration of the appropriate area of care as well as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis also need to be considered.

The major steps crucial in the management include:
- Fluid resuscitation
- Intravenous antibiotic administration
- Identify and treat the source of infection
- Consider transfer to specialized care
- Regular observations of all vital signs (including temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate) which should be recorded on a Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) chart.

\section*{Treatment of sepsis with an unknown source/ Chorioamnionitis}

\section*{Community-acquired sepsis}
- Cefuroxime 1.5g IV every 8 hours or IV Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin (for patients allergic to pennicillins )
- Gentamicin $4-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $1^{\text {st }}$ dose) ( 80 mg TDS)
- Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours

\section*{If allergic to penicillin}
- Clindamycin 600 mg IV every 8 hours PLUS
- Gentamicin $4-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (I ${ }^{\text {st }}$ dose) IV ( 80 mg TDS)
- Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours

\section*{Hospital-acquired sepsis (Do an antibiotic sensitivity test)}
- Piperacillin $4 \mathrm{~g}+$ tazobactam 0.5 g IV every 8 hours or Vancomycin $25-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (Loading dose) IV
- Cefuroxime 1.5g IV every 8 hours
- Gentamicin $4-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (I ${ }^{\text {st }}$ dose) IV ( 80 mg TDS)
- Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 12 hours

If allergic to penicillin
- Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 8 hours

If at risk of MRSA, add:
- Vancomycin $25-30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ (Loading dose) IV

If at risk of GAS, add:
- Clindamycin 600 mg IV every 8 hours
- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) I-2g/kg up to 2 doses (IVIG is recommended for severe invasive streptococcal or staphylococcal infection if other therapies have failed).

\section*{Treatment of postpartum sepsis/endometritis ${ }^{\underline{3}}$}
- Clindamycin 600 mg IV every 8 hours
- Gentamicin $4-7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ( $1^{\text {st }}$ dose) IV ( 80 mg TDS)

NB: Antibiotics should be continued until afebrile for 24 hours

\section*{Timing and mode of delivery in maternal sepsis (antepartum) ${ }^{\underline{6}}$}

The timing of delivery will be determined by:
- The presence of intrauterine infection
- The nature of the maternal sepsis and response to initial resuscitation efforts
- The gestation of the pregnancy and fetal status

In case of intrauterine infection, an immediate caeserean delivery is indicated.
If there is extra uterine infection, efforts to treat maternal sepsis and prolong gestation should be considered at gestations remote from term, although it is reasonable to consider delivery in term pregnancies as a means of improving maternal resuscitation.

Fetal wellbeing should be monitored during maternal sepsis with the most gestation-appropriate method.

\section*{Complications of maternal sepsis 2.12}

\section*{Maternal complications}
- Preterm labor and delivery
- Prolonged maternal hospital stay.
- Maternal complications with end organ damage i.e. pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, shock, septic emboli to other organs, myocardial ischemia, cerebral ischemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Admission to High Dependent or Intensive Care Units
- Maternal death

\section*{Long-term maternal complications}
- Chronic pelvic pain
- Secondary infertility

\section*{Neonatal complications}
- Pre-term birth
- Intrauterine growth restriction
- Prolonged neonatal hospital stay
- Neonatal admission to special care or ICU or transfer after birth
- Perinatal death (stillbirth, neonatal death)

\section*{MATERNAL NEAR MISS}

\section*{Introduction}

\section*{WHO maternal near miss approach}
- Maternal deaths are considered "the tip of the iceberg" of severe maternal morbidity represented by the maternal near miss. For every woman who dies therefore, many more will survive adverse sequelae during pregnancy, delivery or in the puerperium. Studying maternal near miss has been used as a proxy to measure quality of obstetric care ${ }^{\underline{2,6}}$
- Maternal morbidity may precede maternal deaths and therefore systematic identification and study of near miss cases provides further insight on the determinants of maternal mortality. ${ }^{6}$
- Examination of maternal near miss evaluates the quality of obstetric care and may contribute a great deal in reduction of maternal mortality. ${ }^{1,2,3,4,5,6}$
- The consistency and a set of near-miss indicators enables assessment of the quality of care provided to pregnant women. ${ }^{2}, \underline{3}, \underline{5}, \underline{6}$
- Signs of organ dysfunction that follow life-threatening conditions are used to identify maternal near misses so that the same classification of underlying causes is used for both maternal deaths and near misses. ${ }^{1,2,5,6}$
- The WHO introduced the maternal near miss tool in 2009 as a way to monitor and improve on the quality of obstetric care given to women. ${ }^{1,5,6}$
- The Maternal Near Miss tool comprises 3 groups of criteria with clinical, laboratory and management-based parameters which focus on presence of organ dysfunction. ${ }^{1,2}$

\section*{Definition}

A maternal death is defined as "the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes" ${ }^{\perp, 2}$

WHO defines a near miss as "a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, child birth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy" ${ }^{1,2,3,4,5,6}$

\section*{Adapted Sub-Saharan Africa MNM tool}

In the international Delphi study, existing tools were rated for applicability in Sub-Saharan Africa over a series of 3 rounds. ${ }^{1}$

Experts in maternal health from Sub-Saharan Africa rated importance of the existing WHO MNM parameters using Linkert scales and further suggested additional parameters which were adopted following acceptance by $70 \%$ of panel members. ${ }^{1}$

Of the WHO MNM parameters, all 11 clinical, 4 out of 8 laboratory and 4 out of 6 of the management- based parameters were accepted. ${ }^{\underline{2}}$

6 of the WHO MNM parameters were deemed not applicable in low resource settings and they include: $\mathrm{PaO}_{2} / \mathrm{FiO}_{2}<200 \mathrm{mmHg}$, Bilirubin $>100 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$ or $>6.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}, \mathrm{PH}<7 . \mathrm{I}$, Lactate $>5 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$, dialysis for Acute Renal Failure and use of vasoactive drugs. ${ }^{1}$

8 additional parameters were suggested for inclusion into an adapted Sub-Saharan Africa MNM too. These include: uterine rupture, sepsis/severe infection, eclampsia, laparotomy other than C/S, pulmonary edema, severe malaria, severe complications of abortions and severe preeclampsia with ICU admission ${ }^{1}$

\section*{BREAKING THE SAD NEWS OF MATERNAL AND PERINATAL DEATH}

\section*{Maternal death}

The death of a mother and or newborn has deep seated, long lasting sting for the relatives and health care providers. Pregnancy and childbirth is a normal physiological process usually uncomplicated and fills the community with joy at the arrival of the new born. However, despite continued medical advances and technology, child birth still poses serious morbidity or mortality that often occurs in an abrupt and dramatic manner. It is estimated that approximately $12-15 \%$ of births end in miscarriages with the affected mothers experiencing anxiety attacks and depressive episodes.

In 2015 there were 2.6 million stillbirths globally. Majority of these stillbirths occurred in developing countries with a greater occurrence in the intrapartum period.

The health care provider is thrown off guard with the responsibility of disclosing bad news to relatives, a process that they are frequently ill prepared for and yet requiring utmost professionalism and empathy.

Bad news in medicine for relatives has various grades which are subjective and dependent on: individual life experiences, personality, spiritual beliefs, philosophical standpoints, perceived social support and emotional hardiness.

There are three theoretical approaches that have been used in the delivery of sad and bad news:
- Bluntness: delivering the bad news without preamble
- Forecasting: preparing the recipient for bad news prior to delivery
- Stalling: is avoiding the bad news delivery.

Bluntness and forecasting have been shown to communicate the news in a direct way but language styles used differ from case to case. Timing is of essence in breaking bad news. The first phase of interaction with the recipient has a bearing on how they will react to the news. They may display horror, shock, anger, acceptance, disbelief or denial. The overall effect is based on how they perceive the health care Provider, the news, and ability to psychologically adjust.

The following is recommended in breaking abrupt bad news upon maternal or perinatal death:
- Identify the team leader;
- Assemble a disclosure team;
- Set a conducive private environment;
- Provide adequate time for disclosure;
- Check completion of patient record with review of the case and identify missing gaps;
- Identify the recipient of the news;
- Team self-introduction;
- Perform a quick emotional assessment of the recipient;
- Disclose the bad news narrating chronologically the events culminating to death using effective communication techniques;
- Perform an emotional re-assessment with validation of the recipient;
- Offer empathy and reassurance;
- Address concerns, questions, feelings and provide continuous support;
- Allow viewing or holding of the body if desired;
- Address logistic administrative aspects;
- Engage workmates, friends or relatives with debriefing and closure with documentation.

\section*{Principles of Bereavement Care}

Pregnancy losses at different stages of gestation have a psychological impact on the mother and family in extension. A lot of focus has been placed on the physical aspects of management of women who have had pregnancy losses leaving out the psychological aspects. This results in inadequate care with lots of unresolved issues for the affected patients.

The Sands Australian Principles of Bereavement Care have been developed to identify key actions and behaviors that can ensure that all bereaved mothers and families receive high quality care and support following the death of a baby ${ }^{4}$.

The principles of bereavement care ${ }^{4}$ :

\section*{Principle A: Individualised Bereavement Care}

Bereavement care should be individualised to recognise bereaved parents' personal, cultural or religious needs. To deliver tailored bereavement care, time needs to be spent with bereaved parents to gain an understanding of their wishes.

\section*{Principle B: Good Communication}

Communication with bereaved parents should be clear and honest. Consideration should be given to specific language to ensure it is empathic and sensitive. The term 'your baby (or babies)' should be used in all conversations (terms such as fetus, embryo, spontaneous abortion should be avoided). Trained interpreters and signers should be available for parents who need them.

\section*{Principle C: Shared Decision Making}

Parents should be provided with full information into any important decisions to be made regarding themselves or their baby (babies). Parents should be given adequate time and information to consider all options available to them.

\section*{Principle D: Recognition of Parenthood}

Recognition of parenthood and the role of memory making is vitally important and is thought to assist with the actualisation of grief and the slow transition of the parents' relationship with their
baby from one of presence to one of memory. One of the greatest regrets that bereaved parents report to Sands is the lack of memories of their baby.

\section*{Principle E: Acknowledging a Partner's and Family's Grief}

Recognition that a partner's and family's grief can be as profound as that of the mother and that their need for support should be considered and met. It should be clearly communicated to both the mother and her partner that support services are available to them individually and that it is helpful to talk to someone if they require support.

\section*{Principle F: Acknowledging Grief is Individual}

Recognition of the grief journey and that all bereaved parents will handle and react differently to grief. The intensity and duration of grief for each bereaved parent will be different. Recognition that it is common that even within the same family each parent may react and handle grief differently. Health professionals should make parents aware that different grief responses are normal and that there is no perfect way to grieve.

\section*{Principle G: Awareness of Burials, Cremations and Funerals}

All babies, no matter the gestation, should be treated with respect at all times. Options for burial, cremation, taking baby home, home funerals and conventional funerals should be discussed. Health professionals should be aware of burial, cremation and funeral options available in their local area.

\section*{Principle H: Ongoing Emotional and Practical Support}

Bereaved parents should be provided with information and referrals to both professional support and peer-to-peer support services. The concept of seeking support (professional or peer) should be normalised for the bereaved parents and encouraged. Bereaved parents who have accessed peer support services have reported that they feel their grief was heard, understood, and validated and have greater prospects of hope for the future.

\section*{Principle I: Health Professionals Trained in Bereavement Care}

All health professionals who interact with bereaved parents should aim to attend professional development opportunities on bereavement care.

\section*{Principle J: Health professionals with Access to Self-Care}

It is ok to not be ok after the death of a baby. All staff who care for bereaved parents before, during and after the death of a baby will be affected emotionally. Health professionals are in the 'helping' profession and when they cannot help this can bring up difficult emotions. Staff should have good access to information about effective self-care

\section*{MATERNAL \& PERINATAL DEATH SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE}

\section*{Introduction}

Maternal and Perinatal Deaths Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) constitutes a quality improvement approach to identify how many maternal deaths occur (Surveillance), what the underlying causes of death and associated factors are (Review), and how to implement actions to reduce the number of preventable stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths (Response)

Reviewing mothers and perinatal deaths contributes towards saving their lives from lessons learnt ${ }^{1}$ Further introduction of the maternal early obstetric warning signs; birth preparedness and complication readiness ${ }^{2}$; and skilled birth attendance ${ }^{3}$ can alleviate the calamity associated with death ${ }^{4}$. In 99\% of the world's maternal deaths, still births and neonatal deaths occur in LMIC and in over $80 \%$ these are preventable ${ }^{5,6}$. Currently in Kenya the maternal mortality ratio, perinatal mortality rate and the neonatal mortality rate are at 362/100,000 live births; 29/1000 live births and 22/1000 live births respectively ${ }^{7}$.

Kenya made maternal death notification mandatory in 2004 and the facility-based Maternal Death Review (MDR) was relaunched in 2009.The National Committee for Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) and National MPDSR Secretariat was established within the MOH in 2014. The National guidelines for Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) were launched in 2016 and the first Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) was published 2017.

There is urgent need to build national capacities for MPDSR and address the employment of tools that capture the maternal- neonate dyad and the underlying factors that culminated in death.

\section*{Rationale for MPDSR guidelines}

Need to align guidelines with revised WHO MDSR technical guidance by strengthening the response component. The guidelines should have
- A structured multi-sectoral response
- Adopt Zero-reporting principle
- The guidelines should incorporatae the new devolved structure of governance
- Align with SDGs

\section*{Purpose of MPDSR}

Is to take actions to eliminate preventable maternal and perinatal deaths
Efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and perinatal deaths include:
- Scaling up training of Emergency Obstetrics and New-born Care (EmONC) and MPDSR countrywide
- Eliminating user fees for maternity services through the Free Maternity Services Initiative (Linda Mama program) since 2013

\section*{Early pregnancy identification:}

Identification of early pregnancies is critical to full documentation of maternal mortality especially those related to abortion and ectopic pregnancies
- Linkage with Civil Registration \& Vital Statistics
- Link with the assistant chiefs who register deaths at the community level (verbal autopsy)
- ICD -II training needed and should include sensitization of community based MPDSR personnel.
- Instituting maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response mechanisms

Employing review of also near misses as a proxy indicator to evaluate the underlying drawbacks in the quality of care from medical, obstetric and perinatal pathophysiology and the health system in which services are provided.

\section*{Recommendations}

Approaches that are proposed for use in Kenya MPDSR guidelines include:
- Community-based maternal and perinatal death notification and reviews (verbal autopsy).
- Facility-based maternal and perinatal death notification and reviews.
- Confidential enquiries into maternal deaths (CEMD)
- National Annual MPDSR report
- Near miss reviews for improved quality of care ${ }^{8,9}$

\section*{The audit cycle}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-528.jpg?height=1275&width=1264&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=396)

There are various tools that have been utilized in the clinical audits namely KHIS aggregate, KHIS tracker ${ }^{10}$, MaMMA and the Perinatal problem identification Program 3 (PPIP3). Identifying the problem, collection of data, analyzing and generating evidence with its translation through recommendations provide the reflection and feedback towards reduction of morbidity and mortality. The implementation of the recommendations and subsequent evaluation and refinement providing the responsive action for quality improvement. Currently an integrated tool, the PPIP3 captures maternal and perinatal processes and final causes of demise ${ }^{11}$; failures in clinical and patient factors and outlines drawbacks in the health system. In addition, it incooperates the standardized global system of ICD 10 Codes for perinatal ${ }^{12}$ and maternal mortality ${ }^{13}$ with analytical permutations complementing MaMMAS and KHIS aggregate/tracker. This tool standardizes notification, entries, facilitates data analysis providing evidence for decision making, prioritization, allocation of resources, policy making and advocacy by both health stewards, policy makers and in communities ${ }^{14}$.

\section*{ICD 10 - MM}

Facilitates consistent reporting of the clinical conditions to:
- Identify conditions and codes which are unlikely causes of death but may have contributed to the death
- Indicate which causes of death are counted as direct or indirect maternal deaths. Ultimately standardization of the cause of death attribution will improve:
- Interprete of data on maternal mortality,
- Analyse on the causes of maternal death,
- Allocate resources and programmes intended to address maternal mortality.

\section*{ICD 10-PM}

It has distinct features as it:
- Captures the time of a perinatal death in relation to its occurrence in the antepartum (before the onset of labour), intrapartum (during labour but before delivery) or neonatal period (up to day 7 of postnatal life).
- Applies a multi-layered approach to the classification of cause of death, such that it reflects varying levels of available information depending on the setting. By using ICD-PM, mutually exclusive clinical conditions that lead to the identification of a single cause of perinatal death are determined and linked with an ICD code.
- Links the contributing maternal condition, if any, with perinatal death, reflecting that the condition of the mother at the time of the death is closely linked with perinatal death, given that a maternal condition is frequently found in the context of a perinatal death.

\section*{Guiding principles for MPDSR}
- No blame policy
- Focus on health systems not individuals
- MPDSR meeting is primarily an educational experience for all participants
- Zero-reporting principle is adopted
- Documentation of patient case notes is the main source of information for the MPDSR process
- Relatives are the chief source of information for verbal autopsy
- Death audit data are anonymised and CANNOT be used for disciplinary purposes
- The death reviews are incomplete without response to prevent avoidable factors in the future
- The response mechanism involves a multi-sectorial approach

\section*{Structure of MPDSR Committees}

In Kenya, a 5-tiered committee structure will be established:
- Community committee
- Facility committee
- Sub-county committee
- County committee
- National committee.

The core membership, leadership, roles and responsibilities of each committee is as outlined in the Kenya National MPDSR Guidelines, 2016.

\section*{Processes for reporting of MPDSR}
- All Maternal deaths (MDs) are notified within 24 hrs
- All Perinatal Deaths (PDs) are notified within 72 hours
- All Maternal and Perinatal Death Notification forms should be uploaded into the KHIS after notification
- All facilities to send data on number of Maternal Deaths together with the weekly IDSR data. This includes Zero Reports of no maternal death occurred in the week
- All Maternal deaths at community level are reviewed by community MPDSR committees within 30 days of death
- All Maternal deaths (MDs) \& Perinatal deaths (PDs) at facility level are reviewed by Facility MPDSR Committee within 7 days of death
- All completed MDR and Verbal Autopsy forms to be uploaded into KHIS after the Review
- All facilities should continue sending the monthly reports (MOH 711) which includes the total number of maternal deaths and number of maternal deaths reviewed
- All data is being aggregated and analysed at Sub county, County and National levels by MPDSR committees.
- Facility MPDSR committees shall meet monthly or more frequently if more MDs occur to discuss the MDs and PDs and near miss cases to improve quality of care

\section*{Methods of Community Deaths Review}

\section*{Verbal autopsy}

Verbal autopsy also called, community-based maternal death reviews, is a method of finding out the medical causes of death and ascertaining the personal, family or community factors that may have contributed to the death in women who died outside of a medical facility

\section*{Verbal autopsy audit cycle}

\section*{Social autopsy}

Social Autopsy (SA) is a unique innovation which is an effective dialogue between community and government frontline workers to identify bottlenecks in the family and community level for not seeking timely care ${ }^{15}$ and increase and facilitate response by the community. Social autopsy creates an enabling environment in the community to understand the social barriers and errors behind the deaths. The interaction within the community people during a social autopsy create platform to digging out their own mistake and eventually taking actions to avert future death ${ }^{16}$. This empowers communities to implement corrective actions.

\section*{Response Strategy}

Maternal and Perinatal death review needs to be connected to a response strategy. This involves ensuring that action points to prevent avoidable deaths are implemented at all levels:
- Community level
- Facility level
- Sub-county level
- County level
- National level

\section*{Guiding principles for response}
- Start with the avoidable factors;
- Use evidence-based approaches;
- Prioritize (based on health impact, feasibility, costs, resources, health system readiness);
- Establish a timeline (immediate, short, medium and long term);
- Decide how to monitor progress, effectiveness, impact;
- Integrate recommendations within annual health plans

\section*{Timing of response}
- Immediate response: No need to wait for aggregated data to begin implementing actions: e.g., at facility level: improve coverage \& quality of care for emergency services (24/7); at community level: transportation issues that should and can be addressed quickly.
- Periodic response: Findings from periodic reviews (e.g. quarterly) should result in more comprehensive approach to addressing key issues across multiple facilities or communities: e.g.:
- Staffing levels, knowledge, skills \& behavior
- Set up quality of care improvement process for health facilities.

\section*{Levels of Response}

Response is implemented in a cascade manner at the following levels:
- Community level
- Facility level
- Sub county level
- County level
- National level

\section*{Flow of MPDSR Information}

MDSR systems stress delivery of real-time, systematic and frequent monitoring of maternal mortality levels, trends and causes of maternal death in communities and facilities.

The flow of is as shown in the diagram below:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-533.jpg?height=1717&width=1634&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=211}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 81: Cascade of MPDSR information flow ${ }^{17}$}
\end{figure}

Maternal death surveillance and response (MDSR) requires identification and reporting pathways for maternal deaths, review of deaths, aggregation of data, interpretation of findings, and formulation and implementation of recommendations for action ${ }^{18}$

\section*{Monitoring and Evaluation of MPDSR System}

The purpose of the monitoring and evaluation framework is to monitor progress in the implementation and overall performance of the MPDSR system. The framework also assesses the relevance, effectiveness and impact of activities in the light of the objectives the surveillance and response system. Therefore, specific indicators are identified based on the WHO surveillance M\&E guidance to assess the structure, core and support functions, and quality of the MPDSR system.

These are illustrated as components of the M\&E framework in the figure below.

\section*{Structure of the System}

The structure of MPDSR system is defined by mandatory notification of maternal and perinatal deaths, the surveillance strategy for MPDSR, and networking and partnership as the elements for progress measurement using specific indicators listed under each element.

\section*{Core Functions of the System}

The indicators related to the core functions measure the process and outputs of the system. It includes elements such as death detection, death registration, death confirmation, reporting, data analysis and interpretation, epidemic preparedness, response and control, and feedback.

\section*{Support Functions of the System}

Support functions of the system facilitate implementation of the core functions and include standards and guidelines, training, supervision, communication, and resources as its elements.

\section*{Quality of the System}

The quality of the MPDSR system is defined by attributes such as completeness and timeliness of reporting of the system. M\&E Approach and Method: The system implements robust supervision, review meetings, and regular reporting and assessment of performance as standard M\&E approaches. In addition to data obtained through the routine surveillance/MPDSR reports, the system will use such techniques as key informant interviews and review of documents to gather information.

This M\&E framework uses a matrix of core and optional indicators categorized by level of their importance. These indicators are also categorized by type, e.g. input, process, output, outcome and impact. The matrix also provides definitions for the indicators, frequency of data collection, data sources and collection methods. Targets have been set for a set of core indicators to monitor key achievements over time.

ESSENTIAL NEWBORN CARE
}

\section*{CARE OF THE NORMAL NEWBORN}

\section*{Introduction}

Essential newborn care should begin immediately the newborn is born. This section will consider the immediate steps of care the newborn should receive following delivery. It will consider:
1. The steps in preparation to receive the newborn after birth
2. The methods used to keep new-borns warm and protect them from infection
3. The rapid assessment of new-borns at birth to determine if resuscitation is required
4. The steps of resuscitating a newborn
5. Cord care by application of $7.1 \%$ Chlorhexidine digluconate gel
6. The steps required to initiate breastfeeding
7. The administration of essential medications immediately after birth

\section*{Preparing to receive the newborn}

The delivery team must be prepared to:
- Keep the newborn protected from infection
- Keep the newborn warm in the delivery room and afterwards
- Resuscitate the newborn if required
- Initiate breastfeeding in the delivery room

The following steps are required to ensure that you are fully prepared to receive the newborn in the delivery room:
- Review the mother's antenatal history to look for potential risk factors for newborn problems
- Communicate any maternal risk factors that may affect the newborn to all members of the delivery team
- Disinfect all delivery, resuscitation or newborn care surfaces
- Warm the delivery room with a room heater
- Check that all resuscitation equipment is available, clean and functional
- Obtain sterile equipment for the delivery including cord clamps/ties
- Warm and dry all linen and towels to be used for receiving the newborn
- Prepare for strict hand hygiene and hand washing
- Prepare to examine the newborn
- Implement and document weekly newborn resuscitation drills

\section*{Infection prevention and control in the delivery room}

The following steps should be observed to prevent the newborn from infection in the delivery room and thereafter:
I. Clean and disinfect all delivery, resuscitation and newborn care surfaces in the delivery room before the delivery.
2. Ensure that floors of the delivery room or newborn care areas are cleaned with disinfectant twice daily and after every delivery
3. Wash your hands with soap and water before and after every delivery
4. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling any newborn, on entering into the newborn area and before and after performing any procedures on the newborn
5. Wash hands with soap and water between attending to newborns. Alcohol-based hand rub may be used if the hands are not visibly soiled. See the diagram below on how to make alcohol based hand rub.
6. Use sterile equipment for all deliveries, to cut and tie the cord
7. Use the following Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) while working in the Newborn care areas
8. Gloves
9. Special care gowns
10. Masks
II. Limit access to delivery rooms and newborn care areas to authorized staff and relatives
12. Discard waste into appropriate color-coded bins
13. Nurse newborns with infections in isolation rooms away from other newborns
14. Implement and document weekly hand hygiene drills

\section*{Keeping the newborn warm}

Newborn newborns should have their skin temperature maintained between the range of 36.5$37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The newborn must be protected from losing heat in the following ways:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-545.jpg?height=710&width=1418&top_left_y=1718&top_left_x=276}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 85: Ways newborns lose heat}
\end{figure}

The newborn should be kept warm with in the normal body temperature range in the following ways:
1. Warm the delivery room to a temperature of $25-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
2. Close all windows and ensure that the delivery room is free of draughts
3. Place the stable newborn on the abdomen of the mother for skin to skin contact
4. Dry the newborn completely after delivery, discard wet towels and cover the newborn with a warm dry towel
5. Assist the mother to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible within one hour of the delivery
6. Warm the newborn needing resuscitation with a radiant warmer during and after resuscitation.

\section*{Rapid assessment of the newborn}

Rapid assessment of the newborn should be performed during the first few seconds as the newborn is delivered and as the newborn is being dried and stimulated.

The rapid assessment determines whether the newborn requires resuscitation.

\section*{To perform this assessment, ask the following 4 questions}

Newborn resuscitation rapid assessment questions
- Is the newborn breathing adequately or crying (and not just gasping) (LOOK AT THE CHEST)
- Is the newborn's heart rate (HR) present? (FEEL THE UMBILICAL CORD)
- Is the newborn centrally pink i.e.no central cyanosis on observation of the tongue? (LOOK AT THE TONGUE)
- Is the infant active with vigorous movement and not floppy? (LOOK AT THE NEWBORN)

If all 4 questions can be answered YES - the newborn does not need resuscitation
If any of the 4 questions can be answered NO - then the newborn may need immediate resuscitation.

\section*{Receiving the newborn}

If the newborn does not need resuscitation following the rapid assessment, the following steps should be performed:
1. Receive the newborn with a dry warm towel
2. Place the newborn on the mother's abdomen for skin to skin contact (check about mother's hygiene)
3. Dry and stimulate the newborn vigorously.
4. Discard the wet towel
5. Cover both mother and newborn with a warm dry towel.
6. Delay cord clamping by I-3 minutes if the newborn continues to be vigorous and active with a strong cry while being dried and stimulated.
7. Clamp the cord at a distance of 2 cm and 5 cm from the newborn's abdomen
8. Cut the cord with a sterile instrument or blade
9. Apply Chlorhexidine digluconate $7.1 \%$ gel
10. Assist the mother to initiate breastfeeding for stable newborns

The following flow chart summarizes the steps of initial rapid assessment and receiving the newborn

Rapidly assess the newborn at birth!
Answer the following 4 questions
- Is the newborn breathing adequately or crying and not just gasping? - LOOK AT THE CHEST
- Is the newborn's Heart Rate (HR) present? - FEEL THE UMBILICAL CORD
- Is the newborn's tongue pink? (no central cyanosis) - OPEN THE MOUTH

Is the infant active with vigorous movements and not floppy?

\section*{LOOK AT THE NEWBORN}

\section*{ALL YES}

Place the newborn on the mother's chest for skin to skin contact, covered with a warm dry towel;

Dry and stimulate the newborn vigorously with a dry warm

Delay cord clamping by I-3 minutes

Clamp the cord 2 finger breaths and 5 finger breaths away from the newborn's abdomen

Cut the cord with a sterile instrument or blade

Apply Chlorhexidine digluconate 7.1\% gel

Assist the mother to initiate breastfeeding for stable newborns

\section*{ANY NO}

RESUSCITATION REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY

CLAMP THE CORD IMMEDIATELY AND TAKE THE NEWBORN FOR RESUSCITATION
- If the mother cannot keep the baby skin-to-skin because of complications, wrap the baby in a clean, dry, warm cloth and place in a cot. Cover with a blanket. Use a radiant warmer if room not warm or baby small.

\section*{Cord care}
7.1\% Chlorhexidine digluconate delivering 4\% Chlorhexidine is the recommended antiseptic until the cord drops off

\section*{Delayed Cord Cutting is associated with:}
- Less intraventricular haemorrhage (not for severe)
- Higher Blood Pressure
- Higher Blood volume- less need for transfusion
- Less Necrotizing enterocolitis.

\section*{Vitamin K}
- All babies born in hospital should receive Vitamin K soon after birth
- If born at home and admitted aged <14 days give Vitamin K unless already given
- 1 mg Vitamin K IM if weight $>1.5 \mathrm{~kg}, 0.5 \mathrm{mg}$ IM if weight $<1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$
- Apply Tetracycline eye ointment in the eyes of every newborn
- Cord care

\section*{Subsequently (first day)}
- Explain to the mother that keeping baby warm is important for the baby to remain healthy.
- Dress the baby or wrap in soft dry clean cloth or blanket. Cover the head with a cap.
- Keep the baby within easy reach of the mother (rooming-in)
- If the mother and baby must be separated, ensure baby is dressed or wrapped and covered with a blanket
- Monitor warmth every 4 hours by touching the baby's feet: if feet are cold use skin-to-skin contact, add extra blanket and reassess. (see section on re-warming of the newborn)
- Keep the room warm. If the room is not warm enough, always over the baby with a blanket and/or use skin-to-skin contact

\section*{At home}
- Explain to the mother that babies need one more layer of clothes than other children or adults
- Keep the room or part of the room warm, especially in a cold climate
- At night, let the baby sleep within easy reach to facilitate breastfeeding
- Do not put the baby on any cold or wet surface
- Do not bath the baby at birth. Wait at least 24 hours before bathing
- Do not swaddle (wrap too tightly). Swaddling makes them cold
- Do not leave the baby unattended
- Sun bathe the baby for an hour each day dressed only in a diaper.

\section*{Re-warming the baby skin-to-skin}
- Before re-warming, remove the baby's cold clothing
- Place the newborn skin-to-skin on the mother's chest dressed in a pre-warmed shirt open at the front, a nappy(diaper),hat and socks
- Cover the infant on the mother's chest with her clothes and an additional (pre-warmed) blanket
- Check the temperature every 15 minutes until normal
- Keep the baby with the mother until the baby's body temperature is in the normal range
- If the baby is small, encourage the mother to keep the baby in skin-to-skin contact for as long as possible, day and night
- Be sure the temperature of the room where the re-warming takes place is at least $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- If the baby's temperature is not $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or more after 2 hours of re-warming, re assess the baby
- If referral is needed, keep the baby in skin-to-skin position/contact with the mother or other person accompanying the baby

Application steps for Chlorhexidine gel to the newborn umbilical cord at time of delivery

\section*{FEEDING THE NEWBORN}

Breast milk is the best food and breastfeeding is recommended for ALL newborns irrespective of HIV status. Breastfeeding should be discussed during all antenatal contacts emphasizing on the triple key messages of early, exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding up to 2 years.

\section*{Benefits of breastfeeding}
- Breast milk (especially Colostrum) helps build the baby's immunity
- Breastfeeding nourishes the baby and helps to keep baby warm
- Promotes bonding between mother and baby
- It promotes baby's brain development
- Better weight gain
- Reduced incidence of hypoglycaemia
- Less dehydration
- Faster gastric emptying
- It helps in expulsion of the placenta faster and involution of uterus, thus reduces bleeding
- Prevents breast engorgement
- It is possible to feed almost all low birth weight babies on their mothers' milk
- Mother's milk is especially suited for her own baby and is affordable and accessible

Breastfeeding should be initiated within the first hour of birth. Early initiation of breastfeeding ensures the baby receives colostrum, provides energy and prevents most of the breastfeeding problems. Ensure that mother is in a comfortable position then;

Show the mother how to correctly position and attach for effective suckling.

\section*{3. Breastfeeding techniques-good positioning and attachment}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-551.jpg?height=1571&width=1492&top_left_y=371&top_left_x=305}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 87: Breastfeeding techniques- good positioning and attachment}
\end{figure}
- Importance and management of breastfeeding should be discussed with pregnant women and their families during antenatal period.
- Facilitate immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth.
- Support mothers to initiate and maintain breastfeeding and manage common difficulties
- Enable mothers and their infants to remain together and to practise rooming-in 24 hours a day.
- Support mothers to recognize and respond to their infants' cues for feeding

For mothers and babies who cannot breastfeed for one reason or the other, apply the AFASS criteria to determine alternative feeding methods. Breast milk is still the food given by alternative feeding methods except for limited cases

The following information should be discussed with the mother:
- The importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months irrespective of HIV status
- The need to avoid giving baby water or any other food or fluid in the first 6 months
- Mixed feeding is not recommended for all babies
- For Caesarean Section mothers, they should be assisted to put baby to breast as soon as they are awake
- Discuss how to maintain lactation if separated from their babies. Mothers who have to be away from baby for long stretches of time should be shown how to express breast milk and keep it in clean covered cups. Let the baby feed by cup. Expressed breast milk can remain for 8 hours at room temperature.

\section*{First and subsequent examination of the newborn}
- Examine the baby from head to toe at birth, before discharge and when necessary
- Examine the baby in a warm environment
- Allow the mother to be present during the examination
- If the baby has not been weighed yet, weigh the baby, take the length, and head circumference and record.
- While talking to the mother and before undressing the baby, observe the baby for:
- Colour
- Respiratory activity.
- Posture
- Movement
- Reaction to stimuli
- Obvious abnormalities
- As you proceed with the examination, explain the findings to the mother in simple terms and point out abnormalities.
- Wait until the entire examination is complete before beginning specific management of the baby's problems, treating the problems designated as priorities first
- Provide counselling and support services for mothers with babies with congenital anomalies.

\section*{Management of breast problems}

\section*{Prevention}
- Proper attachment and positioning of the baby during breastfeeding
- Frequent emptying of the breasts
- Not giving pre-lacteal feeds e.g. glucose, water or other types of milk
- Educate women on how to breastfeed during antenatal clinic, and how to manage simple breast problems

\section*{Sore or cracked nipples Diagnosis}
- Mother reports pain on breastfeeding
- Cracks maybe seen on nipples

\section*{Management}
- Counsel on personal hygiene and how to keep the nipples clean
- Express the milk from the affected breast to prevent engorgement
- Show mother how to position and attach baby
- Apply milk on the cracks and encourage exposure to air or sunshine if possible
- Continue breastfeeding from both breasts
- Check for oral thrush in baby

\section*{Breast Engorgement}

\section*{Definition}

Breast engorgement occurs when there is congestion as well as over accumulation of milk

\section*{Diagnosis}

The breasts feel hard with distended vessels. They are also warm and tender. The areola may look oedematous

\section*{Management}

Mother is breastfeeding:
- If the baby is not able to suckle encourage the woman to express the milk
- Encourage the mother to breastfeed more frequently, using both breasts at each feeding
- Show the mother how to hold and attach baby to breast
- Relief measures before breastfeeding may include:
- Applying warm/cold compresses to the breasts just before breastfeeding, or encourage the mother to take a warm shower
- Massage the mother's neck and back
- Have the woman express some milk manually prior to breastfeeding and wet the nipple area with breast milk to help the baby latch properly and easily
- Relief measures after feeding may include:
- Good support to the breast with a binder or brassier but avoid tight ones
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breast between feeding to reduce swelling and pain
- Give analgesics e.g., Paracetamol 1000 mg orally as needed
- Follow up 3days after initiating management to ensure response

\section*{Mother is not breastfeeding:}
- Support breasts with binder or brassiere to reduce swelling and pain
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breasts to reduce swelling and pain
- Express enough milk to relieve pain but avoid complete emptying as this will reduce milk production. Let her gradually reduce the volume expressed
- Give analgesic e.g. paracetamol 1000 mg orally when needed
- Review/Follow up 3 days after initiating treatment to ensure response
- Advise to seek medical care if breasts become painful, swollen and red, or if she feels ill or her temperature is $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Mastitis}

\section*{Definition}

Mastitis is defined as inflammation of the breast.

\section*{Management:}
- Treat with antibiotics e.g., Cloxacillin 500 mg every six hours for $5-10$ days
- Analgesics e.g., NSAID e.g. Ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hourly

\section*{Encourage the mother to:}
- Continue breastfeeding on the un affected side
- Support breast with brassiere
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breast between feeds to reduce swelling and pain
- Express the milk from the affected side several times a day and discard
- Follow up three days later to ensure response.

\section*{Breast Abscess}

\section*{Definition}

A breast abscess is a localized collection of pus in the breast.

\section*{Management}
- Treat with antibiotics as in mastitis
- Drain the abscess
- General anaesthesia e.g. Ketamine is usually required; you may also use local anaesthetic spray
- Make the incision radially extending from near the alveolar margin towards the periphery of the breast to avoid injury to the milk ducts
- Wearing sterile gloves and use a finger or tissue forceps to break up the pockets of pus After draining the pus loosely pack the cavity with gauze
- Remove the gauze pack after 24 hours and replace it with a small gauze pack
- If there is still pus in the cavity place a small gauze pack in the cavity and bring the edge out through the wound as a wick to facilitate drainage of any remaining pus

\section*{Encourage the mother to:}
- Discontinue breastfeeding when there is a collection of pus
- Support breast with a binder or brassiere
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breast between feeds to reduce swelling and pain
- Give analgesics e.g. Ibuprufen 400 mg orally 8 hourly for 5 days
- Follow up 3days after initiating management to ensure response
- Educate the mothers on the importance of emptying the breasts

\section*{RESUSCITATION OF THE NEWBORN}

\section*{Definition}

It is defined as a set of interventions at time of birth to support the establishment of breathing and circulation

For many babies, the need for resuscitation cannot be anticipated before delivery. Therefore be prepared for resuscitation at every delivery.

\section*{Preparation}

\section*{Neonatal resuscitation procedure}
1.

\section*{Newborn Resuscitation}
(for addition care of preterms see page 14)

\section*{Initial steps in stabilization}
- Dry \& stimulate (dispose wet towel)
- Cover with warm dry towel abdomen for SSC \&
- Crying or breathing (not laboured)
- Good muscle tone Initiate breastfeeding \& delayed cord cutting \& ENC
No to Any One
Immediate cord cutting \& transfer to a radiant warmer

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Position \& Check Airway - clear if required - and check Breathing}

\end{figure}

Then: Give 3 chest compressions
Give 3 compressions: 1 breath for 30 cycles in 1 minute.
Use 100\% oxygen as you start the chest compression

Regular breathing + HR more than 100/min give oxygen \& titrate against $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$ (90-95\%)
- IVF/EBM \& blood sugars 2hrs after birth,
- Keep warm maintain $36.5-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- ENC - Vit K, cord care, eye care

Reassess ABC
- Treat infections if indicated
- Family Centered Care

\section*{Temperature:}
- Dry the baby, remove wet clothing and wrap baby in dry warm clothes. At the same time observe the baby's breathing, colour and activity
- Place the baby on a firm warm surface or under a radiant heat warmer

\section*{The Golden Minute}

It refers to the first 60 seconds allocated to start initial stabilization and begin ventilation if required

Within I minute of birth, the baby should be breathing well or should be ventilated with a bag and mask
- Term gestation?
- Crying or breathing?
- Good muscle tone

I

The golden minute

NO to any of the following may require one or more (in order)
- Initial steps in stabilization
- Dry and stimulate,
- Keep warm and maintain normal temperature
- Position the airway, clear secretions only if copious and/ or obstructing the airway,)
- Ventilate and oxygenate (room air)

\section*{Airway positioning}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-563.jpg?height=649&width=729&top_left_y=488&top_left_x=262}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 3.5. CORRECT: "sniffing" position}
\end{figure}

Sniffing position- Positioned on the back (supine), with the head and neck slightly extended

\section*{Current Recommendation}
- Neonates should be placed in the 'sniffing position' to maintain airway patency.
- May need to be supported with a towel at the shoulders to maintain airway patency
- Studies showed that airway obstruction persisted with neutral position
- Sniffing position shown to be better at maintaining airway patency

A
G

\section*{Airway suctioning in newborns}

\section*{Current Recommendation}
- Routine suctioning is not recommended!!!
- Suctioning immediately following birth should be reserved for babies who have
- Obvious obstruction of the airway (e.g. with secretions)
- Only done when secretions seen in the mouth or nasopharynx and only suction what you see
- Nasopharyngeal suctioning can create bradycardia during resuscitation.

Patient end $\_\_\_\_$ A

\section*{Performing Suctioning}
- Talk to the mother (parents) about the procedure.
- Put the baby in a slightly extended position
- For manual suctioning using the penguin/bulb sucker;
1. Squeeze the sucker and introduce it into the mouth
2. Release the sucker while in the mouth to create negative pressure
3. Suck the secretions out and pour the secretions on a gauze

- Look at the chest
- Chest movement?
- Listen for breath sounds
- Noises of breathing?
- Feel for air on your cheek
- Air movement?

It is imperative to recognize which of the three scenarios below is occurring to the baby
- No breathing
- Gasping
- Normal breathing

\section*{Ventilating the Newborn:}
- If gasping or no breathing, recheck the newborn's position. The neck should be slightly extended
- Infant ventilation bag ( $200-300 \mathrm{ml}$ ), round face masks size 0 for preterm and I for term infant
- Place the mask on the newborn's face. It should cover the chin, mouth and nose;

\section*{Fitting the facemask:}

\section*{Ventilating with bag and mask}
- Place mask to cover chin, mouth and nose
- Form a seal
- Squeeze bag attached to them ask with two fingers or whole hand about 40 to 60 times per minute
- Watch chest for movement, do not over inflate, allow baby to breathe out. If chest is not rising refer to the six corrective ventilation steps below:

\section*{The 6 Corrective ventilation steps}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline & Actions \\
\hline M & Adjust Mask to assure good seal on the face \\
\hline R & Reposition airway by adjusting head to "sniffing position \\
\hline S & Suction mouth and nose of secretions, if present \\
\hline O & Open mouth slightly and move jaw forward \\
\hline P & Increase Pressure to achieve chest rise \\
\hline A & Consider Airway alternative (endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Start ventilation immediately using room air (bag and mask). If the baby does not improve then use oxygen

\section*{Circulation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-566.jpg?height=509&width=1568&top_left_y=1599&top_left_x=251)
- Count HR over $5-10$ seconds
- If estimated to be below $60 /$ min- provide chest compression
- Initiate chest compressions only if $2^{\text {nd }}$ rescuer available- ventilation should not be interrupted to provide compressions

Count the heart rate over 5 to 10 seconds at the umbilical cord or using the stethoscope

\section*{Chest compression}

Use two thumbs technique to compress the chest (I cm below the line connecting the nipples and the sternum) pushing down I/3 the depth of the chest.

Give 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths per minute ( 3 compressions for every breath).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-567.jpg?height=797&width=794&top_left_y=588&top_left_x=214)

\section*{Principles of Chest compressions}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-567.jpg?height=466&width=644&top_left_y=1576&top_left_x=285)
- Two thumb encircling technique
- Compression Rate 3:1
- Location: lower third of the sternum
- Achieve- $1 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of the anteroposterior diameter
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-567.jpg?height=535&width=595&top_left_y=2050&top_left_x=302)
- Minimize interruptions- reduces coronary artery perfusion
- Use $100 \%$ oxygen when starting chest compressions

If chest compression is done then use a cycle of I breath per 3 cardiac compression

\section*{The "DO NOTS" of neonatal resuscitation}
- Do not hold the baby upside down
- Do not slap the baby
- Do not perform routine suction of the upper airway
- Do not perform routine gastric aspiration
- Do not use sodium bicarbonate routinely
- Do not use Aminophylline

\section*{POSTNATAL CARE - If resuscitation is successful see section on Perinatal asphyxia}

What about meconium:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-568.jpg?height=329&width=321&top_left_y=1079&top_left_x=268)

Focus is on initial stabilization i.e. drying, stimulation, checking airway and initiation of ventilation if required
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-568.jpg?height=327&width=304&top_left_y=1444&top_left_x=265)

Routine oral and nasopharyngeal suctioning in babies born through meconium stained fluid not recommended
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-568.jpg?height=321&width=307&top_left_y=1813&top_left_x=262)

Routine tracheal suctioning in babies born through meconium stained fluid not recommended
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-570.jpg?height=1206&width=1620&top_left_y=194&top_left_x=217)

Oxygen during resuscitation:
- Immediate resuscitation with oxygen can cause harm.
- Use room air for initial resuscitation
- Use $100 \%$ oxygen at the start of chest compression
- Priority is ventilation - do not stop resuscitation to look for oxygen.
- Titrate to achieve correct saturations for healthy term babies and pre-terms ( $85 \%$ to $95 \% \mathrm{SPO}_{2}$ at 10 minutes)
- Heart rate measure of good ventilation

\section*{Use of drugs in neonatal resuscitation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-571.jpg?height=395&width=478&top_left_y=285&top_left_x=234)
- Most newborns improve without emergency medications.
- Before considering drugs, assess effectiveness of ventilation and compressions
- Drugs indicated if bradycardia persists despite:
- Optimal ventilation
- Effective chest compressions
- Endotracheal intubation

Naloxone, sodium bicarbonate, aminophylline hydrocortisone and 50\% dextrose not recommended
- Consider use of epinephrine $+/-$ use of volume expanders
- Consider blood transfusion if blood loss is established

Adrenaline $\mathrm{I}: 1000$, dilute to make $\mathrm{I}: 10,000$, by taking Iml of $\mathrm{I}: 1000$ adding 9 mls of water for injection to make 10 mls
- Dosage: Using the diluted strength, give $0.1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ intravenously
- Repeat dose upto 3 times at intervals of 5 minutes
- Volume expanders may be indicated

\section*{When to Stop Resuscitating}

Consider stopping if after 20-30minutes of effective resuscitation the baby:
- Has no spontaneous respiration or has an occasional gasp
- Pupils are dilated and fixed
- Heart rate is slow or absent
- Colour is not improving with bagging

Explain to the mother that the baby has died Refer to breaking the sad news of maternal and perinatal death in section I

\section*{BIRTH INJURIES}

\section*{Definition:}

This refers to an injury sustained by the baby during the birth process and includes injuries to:
- Skin and superficial tissues
- Muscle trauma
- Nerve trauma
- Fractures

\section*{Prevention}
I. Good ANC care
2. Anticipation of problem and early management or referral
3. Early recognition of injury and management

\section*{Examples of Birth Injuries}

\section*{I) Skin and superficial tissues}

Can be caused by vacuum extractor cups, forceps blades, and scalpel

\section*{Caput succedaneum}

This is an oedematous swelling under the scalp and above the periosteum which forms on the presenting part. It does not need treatment as is resolves spontaneously.

\section*{Cephalohaematoma}

This is an effusion of blood below the periosteum that covers the skull bones. It usually resolves after $2-3$ weeks. No treatment is necessary but the baby should be observed for jaundice and the mother reassured.

\section*{Unilateral cephalohaematoma}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-574.jpg?height=758&width=755&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=688)

\section*{Subconjunctival haemorrhages}

These are haemorrhages seen below the conjunctiva and above the sclera. There is no need for treatment except to reassure the mother.

Abrasions and swellings on presenting parts: (e.g. on face, genitalia etc).
Abrasions and lacerations should be kept clean and dry. If infected, antibiotics may be needed. Deep lacerations may require suturing.

\section*{2) Muscle}

The most commonly damaged is a neck muscle called sternomastoid.
It results in twisting of the neck to the affected side referred to as torticollis. It is managed by laying baby on the unaffected side and physiotherapy. It usually resolves after several weeks

\section*{3) Nerve trauma}

\section*{a. Facial nerve palsy;}

This results from damage to the facial nerve. The eyelid on the affected side remains open and the mouth is drawn to the normal side. This might cause some feeding difficulties.

\section*{Facial palsy}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-575.jpg?height=895&width=737&top_left_y=285&top_left_x=745)

\section*{Management}

Due to the feeding difficulty, help mother to attach well; and if this fails; give expressed breast milk

Damage to the brachial plexus leading to Erb's Palsy and Klumpke's palsy
This is usually caused by a difficult birth e.g.
- Breech delivery
- Large baby (more than 4 kg at birth)

Features include:
- No spontaneous arm movement on one side
- Arm and hand lying limply by baby's side

\section*{Erb's Palsy (arm paralysis)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-576.jpg?height=766&width=1118&top_left_y=291&top_left_x=462)

\section*{Management}

Handle the baby's shoulder (e.g. during dressing or when mother is breastfeeding) gently to prevent further injury and teach them other how to do so. If at rural health facility, refer to hospital.

For the first week, reduce pain by strapping the arm in place as described for a fractured humerus.

\section*{4) Fractures}

Fractures are rare and are usually caused by difficult birth. The most commonly affected bones are the clavicle, humerus, femur and those of the skull.

\section*{Features}
- Displacement of bone from its normal position
- Pain (crying) when a limb or shoulder is moved
- Lack of movement or asymmetrical movement of a limb
- Swelling over bone
- Crepitus

\section*{General management for fractures}
- Confirm the diagnosis with X-ray
- Handle the baby gently when moving or turning and teach them other how to do so.
- Avoid movement of the affected limb as much as possible
- Immobilize the limb to reduce pain when the baby is handled (see below for how to immobilize specific fractures)
- If the mother is able to care for the baby and there are no other problems requiring hospitalization, discharge the baby

\section*{Fractured humerus}
- Place a layer of cotton padding or gauze padding between the affected arm and the chest, from the axilla to the elbow
- Strap the upper arm to the chest using a gauze bandage
- Flex the elbow of the affected arm to 90 degrees and use a separate bandage to strap the forearm across the abdomen in this position
- Ensure that the umbilicus is not covered by the bandage
- Check the fingers twice daily for three days (the baby does not have to be admitted to the hospital if the mother is able to bring the baby back to the hospital each time):
- If the fingers become blue or swollen, remove the bandage and rewrap it more loosely;
- If the bandage is re-wrapped, observe the fingers for blueness or swelling for an additional three days

Have the mother return with the baby in 10 days to remove the gauze bandage

\section*{Splinting a fractured humerus}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-577.jpg?height=603&width=1124&top_left_y=1125&top_left_x=396)

\section*{Fractured clavicle}
- If moving the arm causes the baby to cry, strap the arm in place as described for a fractured humerus
- Have the mother return with the baby in five days to remove the gauze bandages

\section*{Fractured femur}
- Place the baby on her/his back and place a padded splint under the baby from the waist to below the knee of the affected leg
- Strap the splint to the baby by wrapping an elastic bandage around the waist and from the thigh to below the knee of the affected leg. Ensure that the umbilicus is not covered by the bandage
- Check the toes twice daily for three days (the baby does not have to be admitted to the hospital if the mother is able to bring the baby back to the hospital each time):
- If the toes become blue or swollen, remove the bandage and rewrap it more loosely
- If the bandage is rewrapped, observe the toes for blueness or swelling for an additional three days
- Have the mother return with the baby in 14 days to remove the splint

\section*{5) Head Injury}

This involves injury to bones of the skull and intracranial tissues. It is rare, but can occur during difficult deliveries

Features include:
- No sign of overlying cephalo-haematoma
- Intra-cranial haemorrhage
- Raised intracranial pressure
- CSF leakage
- Seizures

Diagnosis is by: X-ray and Ultrasound of the head

\section*{Management}
- Linear fractures usually need no treatment
- Depressed fractures may require surgery
- Antibiotic cover for those with
- CSF leakage
- Treat associated problems like haemorrhage

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF THE HIGHRISK NEWBORN (NEONATE)}

\section*{INFECTION PREVENTION CONTROL IN A NEWBORN UNIT}

\section*{General Principles of Infection Prevention and Control}
- It is the responsibility of all health care personnel in the NBU to minimise infection
- Routine care of babies from birth onwards
- Consider everybody (mother, baby, personnel) potentially infected
- Protective clothing, gloves and masks
- Aseptic technique
- Instruments \& equipment decontamination and cleaning
- Cleaning of the neonatal unit
- Waste disposal
- Isolation or cohorting
- Overcrowding - spaces between cots \& incubators
- Adequacy of personnel
- Adequate feeding
- Traffic control: reduce human traffic flow in the unit

\section*{People as sources of infection}
- Do not allow personnel with skin infections or lesions to come into direct contact with babies
- Individuals handling the baby should observe hand hygiene.

\section*{Hand washing}

Wash hands with soap and water, but if hands are visibly clean, disinfect them using an alcoholbased hand rub;

\section*{5 Moments for Hand Hygiene}

The 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene approach defines the key moments when health-care workers should perform hand hygiene.

This evidence-based, field-tested, user-centered approach is designed to be easy to learn, logical and applicable in a wide range of settings.

This approach recommends health-care workers to clean their hands
- Before touching a patient,
- Before clean/aseptic procedures,
- After body fluid exposure/risk,
- After touching a patient, and
- After touching patient surroundings.

- Instruct the mother and family members to wash their hands before and after handling the baby

\section*{Personal protective clothing}
- It is not necessary to wear gowns or masks when providing routine care for newborn babies

\section*{Housekeeping and waste disposal}
- Regular and thorough cleaning will decrease microorganisms on surfaces and help prevent infection
- Ensure availability of color-coded bins for waste segregation.
- Every newborn special care unit should have a housekeeping schedule:
- Post the cleaning schedule in a visible area
- Educate staff regarding cleaning, and delegate responsibility

If the baby is born at home, or in a place without facilities for care, the following should be instituted:
- Immediate drying and wrapping in warm clothing
- Keep baby skin to skin with the mother ("Kangaroo method"); he/she should be transferred using skin to skin method
- In the newborn unit use heated rooms or nurse in incubators if available preferably dressed

\section*{Care Practices to Prevent Hypothermia (Warm Chain):}

\section*{The 'warm chain'}
- Warm delivery room
- Immediate drying
- Skin-to-skin contact
- Breastfeeding
- Bathing and weighing postponed
- Appropriate clothing and bedding
- Mother and baby together
- Warm transportation(skin-to-skin)
- Warm resuscitation
- Training and awareness

\section*{Warm delivery room:}
- Keep birth place warm (atleast $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and avoid drafts.
- Warm the room before the baby is born
- Immediate drying: Immediately after birth, dry the baby with a warm towel. Most cooling happens in the first two minutes after birth.

\section*{Mother and baby together:}

Put the baby in skin-to-skin contact with the mother for at least 2 hours after birth. Cover both with a warm cloth. It is important that an infant stay warm throughout the newborn period. Keep the mother and baby to get her in a warm room
a) Breastfeeding: initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible, within one hour of birth. Then continue to feed on demand
b) Bathing postponed: Wait for at least 24 hours before bathing the baby.
c) Postpone weighing until mother and baby are ready to be moved out of the delivery room
d) Appropriate clothing and bedding:
- Dress the baby in light, loose, warm clothing, a baby need sat leastl-2 more layers than an adult in the same climate
- The number of layers depend on room warmth
- About $25 \%$ of the baby's heat loss can come from the head, so cover the baby's head with a hat or cloth
- Cover the baby with a light, warm cover or blanket

\section*{Warm transportation(skin-to-skin):}
- Keep the baby warm during transportation, if referred
- Put the baby skin-to-skin with them other or another adult(kangaroo) and cover both warmly
- The baby's temperature should be checked during the referral, if possible
- NB: Use of plastic bags/wraps recommended for preterm babies below 32 weeks if skin to skin is not possible

\section*{Training and awareness:}

Teach both health workers and families about the risks of low temperature/hypothermia and how to prevent it

\section*{KANGAROO MOTHER CARE}

\section*{Rationale}

Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is the care of a small baby who is continuously kept in skin-toskin contact with the mother. It provides the newborn low birth weight or preterm baby with the benefits of incubator care and is cheaper. It is the best way to keep a small baby warm and it also helps establish breastfeeding. KMC can be started in the hospital as soon as the baby's condition permits i.e. the baby does not require special treatment, such as oxygen or IV fluids. KMC, however, requires that the mother stays with the baby or spends most of the day at the hospital until baby is feeding and gaining weight well. Thereafter it can be continued at home with regular outpatient monitoring.

KMC can be continuous or intermittent

\section*{Continuous KMC:}
- Takes place when the baby is in the skin to skin position for a minimum of 20 hrs to as close to 24 hours every day (except for very short periods e.g. when the mother has to bath or use the toilet).

\section*{Intermittent KMC:}
- The baby is put on skin to skin contact for a few hours each day. Each session should last a minimum of 90 minutes to enable the baby to benefit from KMC.
- When the mother is not able to do KMC e.g. when taking a break for any reason, other family members such as father, grandmother, aunt and older siblings can do KMC.
- Mostly used for very small and sick babies and /or for mothers who do not want or are not yet ready or able to practice continuous KMC.

The key elements of KMC are listed below:
All elements are equally important and must be fully incorporated into the KMC practice.
- Position- early, continued and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the baby
- Nutrition - exclusive breastfeeding (ideally)
- Discharge with adequate support and follow up
- Supportive environment in the health care facility and at home

\section*{Benefits of KMC}

The practice of KMC confers benefits to the baby, mother and facility. Research and experience has shown that KMC is at least equivalent (if not superior) to incubator care in terms of safety, thermal protection, neurological development and beyond survival. These benefits are as shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-589.jpg?height=1054&width=1628&top_left_y=174&top_left_x=214)

\section*{Benefits to the mother}

\section*{Benefits to the facility}
- The mother's confidence in caring for her infant is boosted
- Improved bonding between mother and infant due to the physical closeness between them
- Mothers are empowered to play an active role in their infants care
- Mothers are enabled to become the primary care giver of their infants
- Breast feeding is promoted which has benefits for both mother and baby
- Reduces maternal depression
- Significant cost-savings as well as less dependence on incubators
- Additional nursing staff not required (compared to incubator care)
- Shorter hospital stay (early discharge)
- Improved morale \&quality of care
- Better survival and outcomes

\section*{Establishing KMC Services}

This section describes the establishment and organization of services which also include provision of suitable space, essential equipment and supplies for mothers and babies, staffing and capacity building of health providers.

\section*{Conducting a facility assessment}

It is important to conduct a facility assessment before setting up a KMC service. This is in order to determine the facility's capacity to provide the service and identify any gaps for resource mobilization.

\section*{Implementation}

Establish a multi-disciplinary KMC implementation team comprising of County and Sub-county Health Management teams, facility KMC providers (midwives, other nurses, medical officer, nutritionist, clinical officer, occupational therapist etc.) depending on service level. At higher levels include the Paediatrician, ENT, Opthalmologist.

There needs to be a coherent and effective integration of the KMC within pre-existing structures of the health system, education and training.

Kangaroo Mother Care as a clinical intervention can be carried out at home or at a health facility. Current evidence supports the initiation of KMC at a health facility level followed by continued KMC at home after discharge.

\section*{Setting}

The most common settings are:
- Health centers Primary health services
- Health centers conduct deliveries and they are designated to provide Basic Emergency
- Obstetric Care. If the facility provides inpatient services, Kangaroo Mother Care should be
- established at this level. However, Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies with complications or
- with weight below 1800 g should be transferred to a higher level of care.

\section*{County and Sub County hospitals}
- These facilities should have neonatal units. Kangaroo mother care services should be established in all County and Sub County Hospitals.

\section*{National Referral hospitals}

Low birth weight babies delivered or referred to these facilities should have access to
Kangaroo Mother Care services in addition to the highly specialized services that exist here such as neonatal intensive care

\section*{Staffing}

Kangaroo Mother Care does not require additional staff at the health facility and it is recommended that the existing staff should have adequate training in all aspects of KMC. The KMC ward should be managed as part of the Newborn Unit. The basic complement of staff should include nurses, clinicians, counsellors and nutritionists.

\section*{Capacity building requirements}

The skills and competencies of the staff providing KMC services should be updated through training, mentorship and supervision.

\section*{Facilities, equipment and supplies}

KMC does not require special facilities but simple arrangements can be made to make the mother's stay more comfortable to include the following:

Sufficient space that can accommodate enough beds, side cupboards and chairs according to the workload. The KMC policy guideline recommends that:
1. Level 6 hospitals should have a KMC ward with a minimum of 40 beds
2. Level 5 hospitals should have a KMC ward with a minimum of 20 beds
3. Level 4 hospitals should have a KMC ward with a minimum of 10 beds
4. A Health Centre should identify space for at least 2 beds.
- Essential facilities to go with the room include:
- Bathrooms and toilets
- A facility where they can wash clothing items
- Sinks with running water and soap for effective hand washing

Additional support could include:
- Access to Kitchenette for making refreshments
- A day room or yard for sunning themselves
- Where possible, a small room would be useful for individual work with mothers, discussion of private and confidential issues and for reassessing babies. Most hospitals have a counselling room within maternity and this can be used for this purpose.
- The beds should be comfortable (does not have to be adjustable) with enough pillows to maintain an upright or semi-recumbent position

Access to the KMC wards should be limited to health workers, mothers and their selected helpers. Rooms should have privacy and adequate warmth $\left(22-24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Curtains or screens can help to ensure privacy. Heaters should be available for periods when temperatures may fall below $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Facility for health education, promotion and entertainment.

The equipment and supplies required for KMC are:
Standard hospital beds with pillows to allow for reclining. An adjustable bed can be used if available.
- Bedside cabinets
- Heaters
- Chairs
- A low reading thermometer
- A wall thermometer
- NG tubes
- Measuring cups
- Feeding cups
- Graduated feeding cups
- Fridge to store expressed breast milk
- Neonatal scales with 10 g intervals should be used
- Basic resuscitation equipment to include a suction device and a bag-valve-mask device. The bag should be the 500 ml size and the mask should be of preterm ( 0 ) and term ( 1 ) sizes
- Oxygen should be available both in low and high flow forms. In our settings where concentrators are in wide use oxygen from cylinders should be available for high flow use e.g. during resuscitation. Piped oxygen caters for both situations
- Paediatric flowmeters, nasal prongs, masks and pulse oximeters
- Drugs for preventing and treating frequent problems of preterm newborn babies may be added according to the National guidelines
- Bilirubin blanket
- KMC wrappers/ carriers.

\section*{INITIATING AND MAINTAINING KANGAROO MOTHER}

\section*{CARE}

\section*{Who can do KMC?}

The mother or other family members such as father, grandmother, aunts and older siblings can do KMC.

\section*{Eligibility Criteria for Admission to KMC}

\section*{Admission criteria for the baby}

It is recommended that all babies less than 2500 g should be initiated on KMC as the mother is transferred from the labour ward to the post-natal ward.

\section*{I. Eligibility for admission into KMC by birth weight}
- All stable babies born below $\mathbf{2 5 0 0 g}$ should be started on KMC
- Stable babies between $\mathbf{2 0 0 0} \mathbf{g}$ and $\mathbf{2 5 0 0}$ g should be evaluated by a health worker, the mother counselled on KMC, the baby initiated and discharged on KMC
- All stable babies below 2000g should be admitted into a KMC unit and started on KMC
- Stable babies weighing between $\mathbf{1 8 0 0 g}$ and $\mathbf{2 0 0 0 g}$ can be started on KMC soon after birth
- Babies weighing between 1200g and 1799g should be stabilized then started on KMC as soon as possible
- Babies weighing less than $\mathbf{1 2 0 0 g}$ should be transferred immediately to a centre that can offer intensive neonatal care. It may take weeks before their condition allows the initiation of KMC. Depending on the facilities available for the transfer, KMC can be utilized to keep the baby warm during the transfer to the higher level facility.
- Other unstable babies (on oxygen, phototherapy, IV fluids) can get intermittent KMC.

\section*{2. Maternal criteria for admission into KMC}

The following points should be taken into consideration when counselling on KMC:
- Willingness: the mother must be willing to provide KMC
- Full-time availability to provide care: other family members can offer intermittent skin-to-skin contact
- General health: if the mother suffered complications during pregnancy or delivery or is otherwise ill, she should recover before initiating KMC
- Being close to the baby: she should either be able to stay in hospital until discharge or return when her baby is ready for KMC
- Supportive family: she will need support to deal with other responsibilities at home
- Supportive community: this is particularly important when there are social, economic or family constraints.

If the mother is a smoker, advise her on the importance of stopping smoking or refraining from it in the room where the baby is. Explain to her, the danger of passive smoking for her and other family members and the small infants.

\section*{Initiating KMC}
- Arrange with the mother a time that is convenient for her. Ask her to wear light, loose clothing that can accommodate the baby, open sin the front and is comfortable in the ambient temperature.
- Carefully describe the various aspects of this method to the mother: the position, feeding options, care in the institution and at home, what she can do for the baby attached to her body and what she should avoid.
- Explain the advantages and the implications of such care for her and her baby and always give the reasons behind a recommendation. Emphasize that skin-to-skin contact is essential for keeping the baby warm and protecting him from illness.
- Adopting KMC should be the result of an informed decision.

If room temperature is below $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ the baby should wear a sleeveless shirt open at the front, a napkin, a hat, and socks. Otherwise only a napkin is needed.
- Place the baby in an upright position directly against the mother's skin

Ensure that the baby's hips and elbows are flexed into a frog-like position and the baby's head and chest are on the mother's chest, with the head in a slightly extended position

Secure the baby onto the mother's chest with a clean "lesso" or soft cloth or any of the other recommended carrying pouches for KMC babies that are available. Make sure it is tied firmly enough to prevent the baby from sliding out if the mother stands, but not so tightly that it obstructs the baby's breathing or movement

Mother should sleep on her back in a semi-reclined position.

\caption{At home doing ordinary work}
\end{figure}

\section*{Sleeping and resting in KMC}

The mother will best sleep with the baby in kangaroo position in a reclined or semi-recumbent position, about 15 degrees from the horizontal plain. This can be achieved with an adjustable bed, if available, or with several pillows on an ordinary bed. It has been observed that this position may decrease the risk of apnoea for the baby.

\section*{KMC Nutrition}

\section*{I. Supporting breastfeeding}
- Breast milk is the best food for small babies
- Small babies may not have the skills or strength to feed at the breast initially
- Mothers attempting to breastfeed a small baby require extra support and encouragement
- Support the special needs of a small baby who is attempting breastfeeding with:
- Nipple stimulation prior to feeding
- Added attention to positioning and supporting head
- Early licking and practice at breast
- Manual expression of breast milk onto the nipple
- Awakening baby when changing to opposite breast
- Evaluate the baby's effectiveness at breastfeeding
- Wakes and shows feeding readiness cues
- Latches, sucks steadily with pauses, \& swallows audibly
- Feeds without gagging, choking, turning blue or pale.
- Mother reports breast softening
- A baby who is adequately fed
- Breastfeeds for at least $20-30$ minutes
- Sleeps comfortably between feedings every 2-3 hours
- Has 6-8 wet diapers a day
- Loses no more than $10 \%$ of birth weight
- If a baby cannot breastfeed effectively, support mother's breast milk production and use an alternative feeding method as needed
- Teach mother to express breast milk every 3 hours following guidelines for hand expression of breast milk below:

A mother should:
- Wash hands
- Prepare a clean container
- Gently massage breasts in a circular motion with her fingers
- Position thumb on the upper edge of the areola and the first two fingers on the underside of the breast behind the areola
- Press behind the nipple and areola between the finger and thumb
- Compress and release the breast with the fingers and the thumb a few times
- Press from all the sides to empty all segments
- If no milk is expressed, move thumb and fingers towards or further away from the nipple and try again
- Repeat compressing and releasing rhythmically
- Rotate the thumb and finger positions to remove milk from other parts of the breast
- Avoid squeezing the breast, pulling out the nipple and breast, and sliding the finger along the skin
- Some mothers find that pressing in towards the chest wall at the same time as compressing helps the milk to flow. Use the following rhythm: position, push, press; position, push, press
- Encourage time at breast during skin-to-skin care and reassess readiness to breastfeed daily
- Ensure mother has adequate nutrition, increased fluid intake and care for medical problems.

\section*{2. Alternative feeding of expressed breast milk.}
- Nasogastric Tube Feeding: this requires close attention to the baby. In some facilities, mothers may learn to administer feedings.
- Measure the amount to be fed into a container
- Confirm tube is secured and the mark on the tube is visible at the edge of the nose.
- Hold the baby semi-upright, preferably skin-to-skin
- Open the nasogastric tube and attach an empty syringe of the correct size (without plunger).
- Pinch off the tube and pour milk into syringe.
- Hold syringe 20 cm above the baby and release pinch to allow milk to flow into the stomach.
- If flow does not start
- Gently insert syringe plunger but do not push or
- Cover top of the syringe barrel with thumb and release
- Remove syringe and recap tube when finished.
- If baby spits up or chokes, slow the feed by lowering syringe and/or gently pinching tube
- Each feed should take about 10-15 minutes.
- When combining nasogastric tube feedings with cup or breastfeeding, adjust for the volume taken by cup or approximate intake at breast.
- Cup feeding:
- Cup feeding requires little energy
- Gives baby more control over milk intake

\section*{Indications}
- Pre-term infants who cannot breastfeed directly, due to lack of strength and co-ordination
- Babies whose mothers are unavailable, but wish to breastfeed
- Babies with problems latching, e.g. Cleft palate.

\section*{Tips on cup feeding.}
- Cup should not be overly full
- Cup is tilted so that the milk just touches the infant's lips
- Observable tongue activity should follow.
- Infants lap by protruding their tongue into milk to obtain small boluses - often held in mouth for some time before swallowing
- As infants mature -lapping is followed by sipping
- Tongue action is vital for successful breast feeding ability
- Extended tongue is essential for efficient stripping of milk ducts
- Infants need to be in upright position during feeds
- Head should be in a straight line with the rest of the body
- Head should not be tilted backwards or to the side as baby will be unable to swallow properly
- Aspiration may occur

\section*{When to discharge home:}

Allow the baby home when:
- Baby in good health
- Exclusively breastfeeding
- Gaining weight (at least $15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day )
- Baby's temperature is stable
- When the mother is comfortable and confident

\section*{Follow up}
- Twice weekly until 37 weeks post-menstrual age
- Weekly thereafter until baby is 2.5 kg
- Then as for the normal baby

\section*{INCUBATOR CARE}

Incubator is an apparatus used to maintain a neutral thermal environment for preterm/low birth weight and very sick babies. The incubator temperature should maintain the baby's skin temperature at $36.0-36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or axillary/core temperature $36.5-37.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Indications for use:}
- Care of preterm/low birth weight babies,
- Hypothermic neonate
- Sick neonates requiring close observation.
- To transport babies from one place to another. Isolation of newborn babies from infection, unfavorable external environment and stimulation.

\section*{Types}
- Transport incubators: used to shift the newborn from one area/place to another as needed. If not available other portable warm devices that use melted wax or other materials can be used.
- Closed type: most of these are double walled
- Radiant warmers: (a) Resuscitaire (for short term use) or (b) intensive care type

Any of these incubators can be:
- Air mode: manually operated to maintain a constants air temperature

\section*{OR}
- Skin servocontrol where the probe is attached to the baby's skin Servocontrol is an electronic feedback system which functions as a thermostat to maintain a constant temperature at the site of a thermistor probe by regulating the heat output of an incubator or radiant warmer

\section*{Ideal settings of incubator}

\section*{Procedure: Incubator}
- Warm the incubator according to baby's needs.
- Explain the needs of incubator care to the parents of neonate.
- Place baby in the incubator or on radiant warmer.
- Baby can be naked but preferably lightly covered.
- All procedures and care should be through the port holes
- Avoid opening the doors as much as possible.
- Record baby's and incubator temperature 3 hourly
- Adjust the incubation parameters according to baby's needs (see table)
- If baby is not maintaining normal body temperature adjust the incubator temperature accordingly and report to the doctor.
- Monitor malfunction. NO ALARM SHOULD BE IGNORED.

\section*{Procedure - Servocontrol: Incubator or radiant warmer}
- Place skin probe (see figure) secure firmly and protect the probe with a foil-backed shield
- Set baby's skin temperature at $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Read the skin temperature from the temperature gauge on the heater unit
- When the abdominal skin temperature reaches the chosen set point, check the axillary temperature.
- The probe must be in solid contact with the skin at all times
- Record incubator air temperatures at same time as infant skin and axillary temperatures
- NEVER PUT THE PROBE IN THE AXILLA, OR BACK OF BABY if baby is supine

\section*{Placement of temperature skin probe and leads}

\end{figure}

Skin probe placed on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and firmly secured.
Lead placement - 2 on upper chest near the clavicles, one on the lower left chest anterior axillary line.

If the baby cannot maintain body temperature:
- The environment is too cold or warm
- Baby is sick - usually sepsis
- The device is malfunctioning

\section*{WEANING BABIES OUT OF THE INCUBATOR}

While in incubator practice intermittent kangaroo care for all stable babies but preferably transfer to a kangaroo room babies that are stable, gaining weight and over 1500 g can be transferred to cot care

\section*{Room used for incubators}
- Room temperature is constantly kept at $24-26^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (A wall thermometer installed to measure this)
- All windows should be closed to avoid draft
- If possible, windows should be double walled to prevent heat loss to the outside

Cleaning and disinfection- (See section on infection control)

\section*{NEONATAL EMERGENCIES}

\section*{PERINATAL ASPHYXIA}

\section*{Definition}

A condition of prolonged impaired gas exchange usually during labour, but may also occur before or very rarely after delivery, leading to hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidemia and multisystem dysfunction in the baby. The immediate clinical manifestation at birth is the newborn's failure to initiate and sustain breathing

\section*{Broad Risk Factors}
- Poor maternal oxygenation and/or circulation Poor placental perfusion
- Impaired flow of blood in the umbilical cord

\section*{Etiology}
- Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of asphyxia.

\section*{Maternal factors}
- Chronic hypertension
- Pulmonary/cardiac disorder causing hypoxia
- Placental factors like abruption and Previa
- Prolonged labour
- Infection
- Umbilical cord accidents like cord prolapse

\section*{Fetal factors}
- Infection,
- Severe anaemia,
- Cardiac abnormalities
- Rarely Neonatal factors such as:
- Severe congenital heart disease, Severe septicemia with shock

\section*{Diagnosis}

\section*{Presence of three or more of the following}
- Persistent low Apgar score $\leq 3$ for over 10 minutes
- Need for resuscitation beyond 10 minutes
- Neurological manifestations: seizures or coma, hypotonia or hypertonia within 12 to 14 hours
- Multisystem organ dysfunction, mainly cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, pulmonary or renal system dysfunction
- Evidence of acidemia in cord or infant's arterial blood ( $\mathrm{pH}<7.0$ ) within one hour of birth
- Abnormal amplified EEG (aEEG) where available

Clinical Presentation of Asphyxia Largely relates to the multiple organs involved:
- Brain (HIE): Altered level of consciousness, Altered tone, Seizures, Coma, Poor temperature regulation.
- Kidneys: AKI with poor urine output
- Pulmonary: Respiratory distress due to meconium aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema or RDS
- Heart: Cardiac failure, Unstable blood pressure
- GI: Paralytic ileus with distension, Risk of NEC
- Hematologic: DIC, Thrombocytopenia
- Immunologic: Septicemic
- Metabolic: Hypoglycemia, Hypocalcaemia, Dilutionalhyponatremia, Hyperkalaemia, Acidemia
- Liver: Bleeding tendencies, Jaundice

\section*{Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)}

Manifestation of the asphyxial injury to the brain, characterized in the early neonatal period by altered level of consciousness, seizures within 12 hrs of birth or coma and altered tone.

\section*{Assessing the Degree of Brain Injury}

Modified Sarnat and Sarnat Scoring System allows for the degree of brain injury to be graded into Moderate or Severe encephalopathy. The Mild injury (Stage I) usually resolve rapidly with good outcome.

\section*{Modified Sarnat and Sarnat Scoring System}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Category & Moderate encephalopathy (Stage 2) & Severe encephalopathy (Stage 3) \\
\hline Level of consciousness & Lethargic & Stupor or coma \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table 50: Modified Sarnat and Sarnat Scoring System

\section*{Management}
- Perform a full clinical evaluation at least once a day with regards to all organ function. Monitor especially first 3 days \& continue till normal or stabilised
- Vital signs (3hrly)
- Blood glucose and maintain normal blood glucose levels urine output (daily)
- Electrolytes (daily)
- Urea creatinine (start on day 3)
- CNS function Thomson score (daily)\& convulsions (frequently)
- Gastrointestinal function ( 6 hrly)- gastric aspirates, passing stool and normal bowel sounds, signs of NEC Full blood count (as needed)
- CRP (as needed)
- Jaundice (daily)
- Coagulation screen (as needed) Arterial blood gas (as needed)
- Imaging
- Echocardiography for persistent pulmonary hypertension Bedside cranial ultrasound (CVS) is useful in assessing focal brain injury in the first week of life. Assessment should be directed at the basal ganglia injury, presence of hemorrhage in or echogenic parenchyma, size of the lateral ventricles and flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.

GENERAL SUPPORTIVE CARE: (See appropriate sections for details)
Thermo-neutral environment according to gestation \& birthweight.
Aim at maintaining the baby's temperature at $37 \pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The term with HIE need cooling to minimize brain injury.

\section*{Respiratory support}

Aim at maintaining arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures within the normal range. Continuously monitor oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas as the need arises. Administer oxygen plus mechanical ventilation as needed for:
- Respiratory distress with or without meconium aspiration
- Severe encephalopathy (Grade 3 HIE) need CPAP or mechanical ventilation
- Moderate encephalopathy (Grade 2)
- Aim at maintaining normal mean arterial pressure (MAP)
- Capillary refill time of less than 3 seconds may assist in estimating the adequacy of perfusion pressure, hypovolemia or shock
- Treat hypovolemia with infusion of $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ human albumin solution or blood
- Hypotension should be treated with infusion of dopamine at $5 \mathrm{mcg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ until normal MAP is attained
- Screen and treat persistent pulmonary hypertension

\section*{Fluid and Electrolyte management}

Administer according to needs \& renal function
Renal function

Restrict fluid input to $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg} /$ day until urine flow is established
Dialysis may be needed if AKI develops

\section*{Gastrointestinal function}
- Feeding
- Delay enteral feeding as guided by bowels sounds (usually $24-48 \mathrm{hrs}$ in grade 3 HIE). Use EBM as much as possible
- Give parenteral nutrition if not tolerating enteral feeds. Trophic feeds can be given if there are no signs of NEC

\section*{Blood glucose}

Maintain normal blood glucose levels preferably by enteral feeds or IV dextrose if needed

\section*{Haematology}

Administer Vitamin K ( I mg IM) on admission Maintain normal hemoglobin
Treat DIC with vitamin K Img daily for 7 days, platelet transfusion if bleeding

\section*{Sepsis}

Assume presence of sepsis until proven otherwise - treat

\section*{CNS function}
- Treat convulsions
- Therapeutic hypothermia as indicated
- Occupation therapy/physiotherapy: Refer \& Start therapy as soon as the baby has stabilized.

\section*{Enhancing Endogenous Protection (brain)}

This can be done by providing Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) to babies with moderate or severe asphyxia within six hours of birth.

\section*{Requirements for TH}
- Gestation $\geq 36$ weeks
- Apgar score of $\leq 3$ at 5 minutes and need for resuscitation beyond 10 minutes after birth
- Acidosis with cord arterial blood pH of $<7.0$ in the first hour of life (where available)
- Neurological signs - hypotonia, hypertonia, weak/absent suck, seizures, coma
- Age $\leq 6$ hours from birth
- Abnormal amplified EEG pattern (where available) Sarnat staging of moderate or severe asphyxia
- Ability to provide adequate supportive care and monitoring Absence of major congenital abnormalities

Modalities Used (Refer to the specific protocols on how to use each modality)
The modalities found to provide adequate TH, in order of increasing cost, are:
Phase Changing Material such as the MiraCradleCoolCap

\section*{Tecotherm}

\section*{Principles used in providing TH}
- Achieve rectal temperature of $33^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-34.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ within 3 to 4 hours Maintain rectal temperature steadily between $33^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $34.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 72 hours
- Rewarm the baby at a steady rate of $0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ per hour until a rectal temperature of $370.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is attained
- Monitor the baby closely until 80 hours
- Maintain adequate supportive care and close monitoring throughout the TH and continue intensive care after the TH

\section*{Monitoring Clinical Progression of Asphyxia}

\section*{Supportive care}

Involve an occupational therapist as soon as the baby stabilise for feeding and motor function
Counsel parents:
- Start early and involve them in care as much as possible.
- Teach them how to recognize a convulsion.
- As the baby recovers plan for discharge and long term follow up according to complications

\section*{Planning for discharge}
- Review ability to feed and advise accordingly
- Do a full neurological evaluation to plan for long term care
- Some may need to continue phenobarbitone

\section*{Prevention of asphyxia}
- All pregnant women should be encouraged to attend ante-natal care
- Educatepeopleatalllevelsontheimportanceofdeliveringunderthecareofskilledbirth attendants
- Equip all skilled birth attendants with adequate neonatal resuscitation skills
- Promote identification of women, with danger signs during pregnancy, labour and delivery

\section*{SEIZURES}

\section*{Definition}

Insult to the neonatal brain manifesting with sudden disordered motor and autonomic signs, which in the neonate is often subtle due to the brain immaturity and may consist of twitching, abnormal posturing, eye deviation or blinking, lip smacking, high pitched crying, irregular respiration or hear beat, apnoea.

\section*{Etiology}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Hypoxic Ischemic & Perinatal asphyxia \\
\hline Brain Injury & Cerebral infarction \\
\hline Intracranial hemorrhage & Intraventricular haemorrhage Parenchymal, subdural, subarachnoid hemorrhage \\
\hline CNS infections & Meningitis \& others \\
\hline Acute metabolic disorders & Hypoglycemia / Hypocalcaemia / Hyponatremia / Hypomagnesaemia \\
\hline Epilepsy syndrome & Pyridoxine (Vit $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) dependent/deficient seizures Severe neonatal epileptic encephalopathies \\
\hline Inborn Errors of Metabolism & Galactosaemia Amino-acidurias \\
\hline Drug withdrawal & Mainly drugs of abuse \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Diagnosis}

A high index of suspicion based on the history and being alert to any subtle repetitive movement, abnormal breathing or heartbeat. It may also be sudden unexplained brief repetitive drops in arterial oxygen saturation.

\section*{Investigations}
- Blood glucose
- Urea - Electrolytes
- Calcium, magnesium levels
- Full blood count, differential, platelets CRP
- Blood culture
- Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis
- Occasional ones: Cranial ultrasound, Brain scan, Metabolic screen, TORCHES screen and EEG

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Practice points}
- Treat the underlying cause!
- Polypharmacy should be avoided if possible

If there are more than three episodes of seizure per hour or a single episode lasting for more than 5 minutes or seizure associated with prolonged low oxygen saturation, the baby should be treated.

\section*{Supportive Care}

Monitor the frequency of convulsions and neurological status. Observe respiration.
Refer to the relevant sections for: Oxygen administration, Nutrition, Fluid and electrolyte maintenance, Environmental temperature (especially in asphyxia \& preterm)

\section*{Weaning off anticonvulsants}

If multiple drugs have been used phenobarbitone is the last one to be weaned off. Guided by neurological status and presence or absence of seizures. If neurologically normal stop all before discharge.

Plan for long term follow up depending on condition and associated problems.

\section*{ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY}

\section*{Definition}

Acute kidney injury is defined as rapid decline in kidney function resulting in abrupt increase in serum creatinine or an abrupt decrease in urine output. Creatinine rises to greater than $25 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ or $50 \%$ increase from previous lowest, or absolute creatinine $>100 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ or urine output of $>\mathrm{lml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.

Note: A large number of AKI in the newborn may be non-oliguric

- Dehydration due to poor breastfeeding Intestinal losses
- Bleeding from trauma
- Hypoxic Ischemic encephalopathy

\section*{Intrinsic renal causes:}
- Acute Tubular Necrosis
- Drugs usage like aminoglycosides, ibuprofen Sepsis
- Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy

\section*{Post renal causes:}
- Posterior urethral valves
- Spinal cord lesions causing neuropathic bladder

\section*{Clinical presentation}
- Urine output of less than $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ in most cases.
- Edema due to fluid overload failure to lose weight in the $1^{\text {st }}$ week or rapid weight gain.
- Hypertension.

\section*{Investigations}
- Urea/Electrolytes and creatinine: showing rise in creatinine, BUN and potassium.
- Urine microscopy: urine sediment showing intrinsic kidney injury, if there is features of proteinuria and hematuria
- Urine SG if high shows prerenal cause, if SG low shows intrinsic cause.
- Urine Fractional excretion of Sodium to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic renal failure.
- Abdominal ultrasound kidney, ureters, bladder (KUB) to rule out obstructive uropathy

\section*{Management}
- The main aim in managing AKI is to maintain homeostasis while awaiting improvement in renal function, either spontaneously or while the underlying cause is being treated.
- Maintain adequate renal perfusion
- Unless contraindicated due to fluid overload or cardiac failure a baby with clinical evidence of hypovolemia and oliguria administer intravenous fluid challenge $10 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ of crystalloid solution such as normal saline over 20 to 30 minutes. This can be repeated up to three times if the baby is still hypovolemic.
- Restoration of adequate urine flow and improvement in renal function with fluid resuscitation is consistent with pre-renal disease.
- If oliguria persists despite adequate correction of pre-renal factors, give:
- Intravenous furosemide $2-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ dose or infusion furosemide $0.1-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.
- If no response consider dialysis
- Prevent fluid overload
- Fluid volume should be restricted to insensible water loss(IWL) calculated at $400 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{m} 2$ per day or $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$, in addition to replacing urine, gastrointestinal and other losses. Use 5 or $10 \%$ dextrose for IWL and 5th normal saline for urine. Ensure adequate hydration.
- Do a daily weight
- Maintain normal electrolytes and acid-base status

\section*{Hyperkalemia: (See section on fluid \& electrolytes)}
- Sodium supplementation if there is renal salt wasting
- Correct severe metabolic acidosis where serum bicarbonate $<15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ or $\mathrm{pH}<7.2$ : (See
- Acid base balance)
- Hyperphosphatemia: restrict intake by using breastmilk and calcium-based phosphate binders. eg calcium carbonate
- Ensure adequate nutrition
- Dosage adjustment of medications
- Avoid further nephrotoxic insults

\section*{Oliguria}

\section*{Acute Renal Replacement Therapy}
(Refer baby to next level if not able to perform)

\section*{Indications}

\section*{Traditional indications:}
- Severe hyperkalaemia unresponsive to conservative therapy Uncontrolled acidosis that cannot be safely corrected because of sodium or volume overload
- Severe volume overload with uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary oedema or cardiac failure
- Progressive uraemia with deterioration in the general condition
- Hyper catabolic states with increase in blood urea by $>10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ per day

Early institution of dialysis in the critically ill baby with AKI in order to maintain homeostasis and create enough volume space so that the nutritional and therapeutic needs may be met, as severe fluid restriction results in:
- Inadequate nutrition
- Propensity to hypoglycemia
- Insufficient volume space for blood products
- Difficulty in drug delivery, such as inotopic support and antibiotic infusions

\section*{Acute Peritoneal dialysis}

This is the preferred form of renal replacement therapy in neonates due to ease of initiation and not needing very elaborate equipment and expertise as is required with haemodialysis.

Most hospitals can be able to initiate acute peritoneal dialysis and babies should be referred earlier to a centre which can if there is no capability.

\section*{Requirements for acute peritoneal dialysis}

Catheter: A peritoneal catheter should be placed into the abdomen either by a surgeon or by the clinician by Seldinger technique.

Catheters used include:

\section*{Acute PD catheters like Cook catheters FR 8 placed by Seldinger Technique}
- Tenckhoff Catheter (paediatric size) placed surgically
- Haemodialyis catheters or central lines placed intraperitoneal gives options for improvisation
- If none of the above found any catheter with multiple holes can be placed

Fluids: Peritoneal dialysis fluids used can be:
Commercially prepared PD fluids which come in strengths of $1.5 \%$, $2.5 \%$ and $4.25 \%$
If not available, you can use Hartman's Solution and 50\% dextrose (addingI5 ml of 50\% dextrose 500 ml of Hartman's solution gives $1.5 \%$ solution)

Process: the process of acute peritoneal dialysis involves inflow of the peritoneal dialysis fluid into the peritoneal cavity, dwelling in the cavity to allow exchange and then outflow into a drainage bag.

\section*{Prescription:}
- Fill volume: volume to be infused: start with $15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Inflow: usually about 10 minutes
- Dwell time: start with 30 minutes
- Outflow: time allowed to flow out: about 20 minutes
- It is important to monitor renal function daily during dialysis. Once the indication for dialysis is achieved dialysis should be stopped. It is important to seek expert advise during the process of dialysis.

Follow up: Arrange long term follow up for all babies

\section*{RESPIRATORY DISTRESS}

\section*{Definition}

Tachypnoea>60 breaths/min, grunting, chest retraction with or without cyanosis

\section*{Causes}

\section*{I. Pulmonary}
- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (surfactant deficiency) especially in preterm babies
- Pneumonia
- Aspiration syndromes (meconium, feeds)
- Pulmonary haemorrhage,

\section*{2. Airway}
- Laryngomalacia
- Choanal atresia
- Micrognathia

\section*{3. CNS}
- Seizures,
- Birth asphyxia,
- Intracranial haemorrhage

\section*{4. Metabolic}
- Hypoglycemia,
- Electrolyte derangements Temperature instability
- Congenital heart diseases especially those with cardiac failure

\section*{Management}

Take history \& do thorough examination to identify the cause of distress Assess the severity of the distress using the Silverman-Anderson score

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{For all babies}
- Chest X-ray
- Full blood count including a manual PBF CRP
- Blood gas analysis, Blood sugar
- Specific investigation according to suspected cause

\section*{Specific Treatment}
- Treat the underlying cause
- Start antibiotics
- Start IV fluids

\section*{Silverman Anderson Score and its interpretation}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Score & Upper chest retrac on & Lower chest retrac on & Xiphoid retrac on & Nasal flaring & Expiratory Grunt \\
\hline 0 & Synchronised & None & None & None & None \\
\hline 1 & Lag during inspira on & Just visible & Just visible & Minimal & Audible with Stethoscope \\
\hline 2 & See - Saw & Marked & Marked & Marked & Audible without Stwthoscope \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-620.jpg?height=986&width=1615&top_left_y=1307&top_left_x=219)

\section*{Interpretation}

Score I-3 = Mild respiratory distress - $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by nasal prongs

Score 4-6 $=$ Moderate respiratory distress - CPAP
Score $>6=$ Impending respiratory failure - mechanical ventilation
NB. This scoring has to be modified/interpreted with caution once the baby is on CPAP as the grunting and the nasal flaring are abolished.

\section*{Management}
- Mild breathing difficulty (Score I-3)
- Monitor for respiratory distress using the Silverman-Anderson score
- Monitor oxygen saturation.
- Give expressed breast milk by gastric tube as soon as possible When oxygen is no longer needed, allow the baby to begin breast feeding. If the baby cannot be breastfed, continue giving expressed breast milk by tube or cup

If the breathing difficulty worsens at any time during the observation period: treat for moderate breathing difficulty or severe.

Most babies with mild and transient respiratory distress do not need antibiotics.
But, if there are risk factors, start antibiotics after taking aseptic screen. Review after $48-72 \mathrm{hrs}$ : if respiratory distress has settled - STOP ANTIBIOTICS

Moderate to Severe breathing difficulty (Score 4-6)

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) (For maximum benefit start as soon as symptoms are identified)

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{SURFACTANT THERAPY}

As a general principle initially provide CPAP to all patients with RDS. Intubate and administer surfactant to those with persistent severe respiratory distress (defined as requiring a fraction of inspired oxygen $\left[\mathrm{FiO}_{2}\right]$ of 0.40 or higher to maintain oxygen saturation above $90 \%$ ) or who are apnoeic.

\section*{Indications}

Prophylactic surfactant therapy (within 2 hr . of birth)
- Gestation $<28$ weeks/birth weight $<1250 \mathrm{gm}$ Early rescue treatment (within 12 hrs of birth)
- All other babies with evidence of RDS who require CPAP or ventilation and needing $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}>0.4$

Other babies that can be considered for surfactant therapy (after senior discussion)
- Ventilated babies with meconium aspiration syndrome who require $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}>0.5$
- Term babies with pneumonia and stiff lungs
- Sepsis with hypoxic failure

\section*{Procedure}

\section*{Prepare}
- Sterile gloves
- End open hole tube size 5F (can use nasogastric tube)
- Prepare surfactant according to manufacturer's instruction
- Calculate dose of surfactant required
- Draw up required dose and warm to room temperature.
- Remaining surfactant should be placed back in the fridge to be used for next dose.

\section*{Intubate baby and:}
- Ensure correct endotracheal tube (ETT) position
- Check ETT length at lips/nose
- Listen for bilateral air entry and look for chest movement

\section*{Instillation}
- With baby supine, instill prescribed dose down tracheal tube in 2 to 4 boluses
- Wait for recovery of air entry/chest movement and oxygenation between boluses

\section*{Post-instillation care}
- Do not suction ETT for 8 hr .
- Adjust ventilator/oxygen settings in response to changes in chest movement, tidal volume and oxygen saturation
- Do a blood gas within 30 min

Additional information
- Non-intubated babies can be given surfactant while on CPAP
- Use the same dose \& size tube
- If needed 4 repeat doses of surfactant can be given at 12 hrly intervals within the $1^{\text {st }} 48 \mathrm{hrs}$

\section*{Complications}

\section*{Physiologic:}
- Apnoea
- Mucus plugs
- Barotrauma resulting from increase in lung compliance following surfactant replacement and failure to change ventilator settings accordingly

\section*{Procedural:}
- Plugging of ETT by surfactant
- Hemoglobin desaturation and increased need for supplemental oxygen
- Bradycardia due to hypoxia
- Tachycardia due to agitation with reflux of surfactant into the ETT
- Pharyngeal deposition of surfactant
- Administration of surfactant to only one lung
- Administration of suboptimal dose secondary to miscalculation

\section*{Additional care (for babies on CPAP)}
- Insert an orogastric tube for stomach decompression and feeding. (Leave the tube open to allow gas to escape)
- After taking a sepsis screen including blood culture start antibiotics.
- Initiate enteral feeding by day 2-3:
- Give expressed breast milk by orogastric tube.
- If baby not tolerating full feed give trophic feeds
- When oxygen is no longer needed, allow the baby to begin breastfeeding.
- If the baby cannot breastfeed, give expressed breast milk using a cup or tube

\section*{Observation \& Documentation:}

\section*{Baby}
- Hourly temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, $\mathrm{SpO}_{2}$
- Prongs - check patency every I-2 hrs

\section*{Weaning baby from CPAP}
- As the score reduces/baby improves gradually reduce $\mathrm{FlO}_{2}$ by $5 \%$.
- When $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}$ is $<30 \%$ discontinue CPAP to nasal prongs.
- Continue monitoring RDS Score to ensure baby does not require re-introduction of CPAP
- Continue monitoring $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturations till baby no longer needs $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

\section*{IMPENDING RESPIRATORY FAILURE}

\section*{Mechanical ventilation}

Indication for mechanical ventilation: Silverman-Anderson score $\geq 6$ OR some of the following clinical or laboratory findings

\section*{Clinical indication}
- Central cyanosis
- Intractable apnoea
- Decreased activity and movement

\section*{Laboratory criteria}
- $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}>8 \mathrm{kPa}(>60 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}<5.5 \mathrm{kPa}(<50 \mathrm{mmHg})$ or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of $<80 \%$ while on $100 \%$ oxygen
- $\mathrm{pH}<7.25$

\section*{Premedication for elective intubation}
- Pre-oxygenate for 3-5 minutes
- Morphine: $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV but can be IM or SC
- Midazolam can be used as alternative to morphine at a dose of $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$

\section*{Connecting Patient to the ventilator}
- Intubate and secure ET
- Position I-2cm above carina/T2 (Sizes of tubes \& length in see table)
- Give surfactant if indicated
- Initial ventilator setting
- RR 40-60/min to enable synchrony and ease of ventilation
- Initial PIP 14-18 $\mathrm{cmH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Start low and increase by 2 cm if needed
- PEEP $4-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ of water maximum of 8
- $\mathrm{FIO}_{2} 0.4$ increase by $5 \%$ every I min until oxygen saturation level is $90-95 \%$
- Ti 0.32-0.5 seconds. Ensure I:E ratio of I:2 unless otherwise indicated by blood gases (arterial)
- Vt $4-6 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$. Start low and increase as needed

\section*{ET TUBE SIZE \& LENGTH IN}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline Weight $(\mathrm{g})$ & ET tube diameter $(\mathrm{mm})$ & Length in oral route $(\mathrm{cm})$ \\
\hline$<1000$ & 2.5 & $5.5-6.5$ \\
\hline $1000-2000$ & 3.0 & $7.0-7.5$ \\
\hline $2000-3500$ & $3.0-3.5$ & $7.5-8.0$ \\
\hline 2500 & $3.5-4$ & $8.5-9.0$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Confirm position by X-ray as soon as possible: Position I-2cm above carina/T2

\section*{Monitoring Ventilation}
- Colour
- Capillary refill time (hydration status)
- Breath sounds
- Chest movement / tidal volume $4-6 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{Kg}$
- Transcutaneous monitors $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- Oxygen Saturations
- Arterial blood gas analysis

Minimise movement to avoid displacement of the tube
Sudden deterioration of an intubated baby (DOPES)
- Displacement of the tube
- Obstruction of ET tube
- Pneumothorax
- Equipment failure
- Stomach distension

Identify and rectify the problem urgently

\section*{Targets for ventilation}
- $\mathrm{pH}>7.25$
- $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2} 5-7.5 \mathrm{kPa}(40-50 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- $\mathrm{Pa} \mathrm{O}_{2} 6-10 \mathrm{kPa}(40-80 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- Saturations 90\%-95\%

Failure to respond to ventilator manipulation may be due to:
- Mechanical problems - check for leaks, blocked tube
- Metabolic disorders - glucose, uncorrected acid/base balance, electrolytes
- Blood pressure hypo or hypertension
- Low Hb
- Cardiac complications - PDA, persistent pulmonary hypertension
- Lung complications - oedema, haemorrhage, BPD
- Intracranial bleeds
- Sepsis
- Weaning from ventilation - one ventilator setting at a time

When stable for 24 hours:
- Start with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ decrease by $5-10 \%$ to levels $<40 \%$
- Then reduce PIP by $\mathrm{I}-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ to a level of $8-10 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
- Then reduce respiratory rate by $\mathrm{I}-5$ breaths $/ \mathrm{min}$ till rate is $15-20$ breaths $/ \mathrm{min}$
- Frequent BGAs (every 6 hours) Maintain $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ \& $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ \& saturations within targets for ventilation
- Extubate when above levels attained and the blood gas done $2-4$ hours later remains acceptable. Repeat a blood gas 4 hours after extubation (earlier if baby shows signs of deterioration).

\section*{Extubation}
- Preferably extubate onto CPAP
- $\mathrm{FIO}_{2}<40 \% 0_{2}$
- Stop feeds for 4 hours or empty stomach with NG tube
- No feed for 4 to 6 hours post extubation
- Load with caffeine citrate (or use aminophylline if caffeine is not available) to reduce apnoea at least 4 hours prior to extubation.
- After 2 failed trials of extubation give dexamethasone 48 hours before and 24 hours after $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ bd to reduce inflammation. Dexamethasone is also indicated for extubation of baby who has been intubated for $>5$ days to reduce risk of failure ( 3 doses given 8 hourly at $0.25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ and extubate immediately after last dose).

\section*{Additional Care}
- Maintain baby's $\mathrm{Hb} \geq 13 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{d} \mid$
- Chest Physiotherapy
- This is NEVER routine
- Keep baby's head steady during procedure (especially preterm babies)
- Watch out for hypoxia during procedure (keep an eye on $\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ saturation)
- Suctioning

CAUTION: Saline \& suction removes surfactant. Saline drowns the baby. Every time suction is done there is decrease in alveolar recruitment SO SUCTION ONLY IF:
1. There is evidence of secretions
2. Alteration of vital signs suggesting a blockage
3. Alteration in saturation
4. Watch out for hypoxia during procedure (keep an eye on $\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}$ saturation)

Feeding and fluid balance (Enteral feeding, fluids \&electrolytes, parenteral nutrition according to condition)
- Pass an orogastric/nasogastric tube
- As soon as baby is settled on ventilator initiate trophic feeds (preferably EBM) and gradually increase as tolerated

Do a full clinical examination at least once a day or at any time when the condition the changespaying attention to:
- Presence of pallor \& jaundice
- CNS function
- Hydration status
- Cardiac function
- Renal function
- GIT function
- Fluid \& electrolyte balance

\section*{Follow up}

Do an eye check at 6 weeks for all preterm <34 weeks. Borderline preterm infants who have hard a stormy neonatal period especially with sepsis, PDA, and prolonged oxygen need may also require evaluation for ROP.

\section*{OXYGEN THERAPY}

\section*{Preventing apnoea of prematurity}

\section*{All preterm <34 weeks gestation}
- Monitor Preterm babies by pulse oximetry to detect apnoea and bradycardia
- Give preferably caffeine citrate per oral $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose followed 12 to 24 hours later with $2.5-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily maintenance dose.
- When caffeine is not available use aminophylline $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ loading dose per rectal or IV then continue with $2.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / 2$ hourly maintenance IV or per rectal
- USE EARLY CPAP in preterm babies with repeated episodes apnoea
- Environmental temperature control
- Maintain nasal patency
- Maintain head and neck in neutral position

\section*{Treatment}
- Stimulation
- Bag and mask ventilation (if apnoea not responding tostimulation)
- Administer oxygen (by nasal prongs, CPAP or high flow oxygen) as needed.
- If no response may need ventilation
- Slow IV caffeine citrate loading dose. If caffeine not available, use IV or per rectal aminophylline (only in preterm)
- Correct the underlying disorder if known
- Monitoring after resuscitation
- Heart Rate
- Respiratory rate
- Oxygen saturation

Initially every 15 minutes for the first hour. If stable, monitor every 30 minutes during the second hour and as the baby improves continue with routine monitoring.

\section*{Feeding enteral}
- One attack - continue feeding.
- Repeated attacks stop feeds for 6 hrs . If stable resume feeds at reduced feed volume or give smaller volume I-2 hourly.
- If not tolerating enteral feeds give IV fluids for example in apnoea, bradycardcardia, and respiratory distress.
- Treatment care if known

\section*{Definitions}
- Acidaemia- An arterial pH below the normal range(less than 7.36).
- Alkalaemia- An arterial pH above the normal range(greater than 7.44).
- Acidosis: A process that tends to lower the extra cellular fluid pH due to a fall in the serum bicarbonate or an elevation in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ Thus:
- Respiratory acidosis: $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}>6 \mathrm{kPa}(>45 \mathrm{mmHg})$
- Metabolic acidosis: $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}<22 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Alkalosis: A process that tends to raise the extra cellular fluid pH due to either an elevation in the serum $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ concentration and/or a fall in $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$. Thus:
- Metabolic alkalosis: $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}>26 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Respiratory alkalosis: $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}<4.7(<35 \mathrm{mmHg})$

\section*{Causes}

\section*{Respiratory acidosis (hypoventilation) due to:}
- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
- Pneumonia with respiratory failure
- Central respiratory drive depression eg, drug induced

\section*{Respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) due to:}
- Over ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients
- Cardiac anomalies causing hyperventilation
- Drug induced increase in respiratory drive
- Metabolic acidosis - Altered tissue metabolism, gut disorders, and/or renal function divided into:
- Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis:
- Diarrhoea,
- Post surgery NEC,
- Hypokalaemia,
- Hypoalbuminaemia

\section*{Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis}
- Tissue hypoxia due to
- Hypovolaemia - shock
- Cardiac disease
- Severe anaemia
- Altered metabolism in sepsis, starvation

\section*{Metabolic alkalosis due to:}
- Loss of acid through vomiting in upper Gl obstruction (e.g. pyloric stenosis) or prolonged gastric suction
- Renal loss through drugs use (diuretics, digitalis, corticosteroids)

Simple acid-base disorder - The presence of one of the above disorders with the appropriate respiratory or renal compensation for that disorder.

Mixed acid-base disorder - The simultaneous presence of more than one acid-base disorder

\section*{Investigations}

Blood gas analysis (preferably arterial)
- Electrolytes: $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$(use for anion gap calculation)
- Haemoglobin
- Blood glucose

\section*{Steps in Diagnosis of Acid-Base disorders}

Step 1: Establish the primary acid-base disorder (investigation).
Step 2: Assess the degree of compensation as defined above for the individual disorders.
Step 3: Determine whether or not the anion gap is elevated.
Step 4: Establish the cause through careful history \& examination.

\section*{GLUCOSE DISORDERS}

\section*{HYPOGLYCAEMIA}

\section*{Definition}

Serum blood glucose $<2.6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
Serum glucose ranges in the first week of life, they dip in the first 24 hours. The normal range is 2.6 to $7.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{I}$. Blood level glucose (measured with reagent strips are approximately $0.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ lower than serum levers measured in the lab).

\section*{Clinical features}
- Asymptomatic: hypoglycaemia detected by screening infants at risk.
- Symptomatic: floppiness, lethargy, poor feeding, jitteriness, seizures, coma, apnoe

\section*{Risk factors}
1. Prematurity
2. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
3. Sick term neonate especially neonatal infections, Birth asphyxia
4. Infant of diabetic mother \& large for dates neonates, Septicaemia
5. Hypothermia
6. Hypoxic ishaemic encephalopathy

\section*{Prevention and Treatment}
- The best way to prevent and/or manage hypoglycaemia is by giving adequate enteral feeds
- To avoid rebound hypoglycaemia for all babies on IV dextrose reduce gradually as you increase enteral feeds

\end{figure}
- Refractory hypoglycaemia / Persistent severe hypoglycaemia
- Causes - hyperinsulinaemia:
- Idiopathic Asphyxia
- Beckwith-Weideman syndrome Nesiodioblastosis
- Affected babies require higher concentration of dextrose (see table - Glucose Intake). Look for the cause and treat accordingly

If hypoglycaemia is unresponsive to maximum glucose infusion rates, IV glucagon can be used in consultation with an endocrinologist.

\section*{HYPERGLYCAEMIA}

\end{tabular} \\
\hline & Identify and treat the cause \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{I. Glucose intake}
- Calculate total glucose intake by considering:
- Amount in IV fluid (see table) plus
- Enteral intake (breast milk \& formula: glucose $\mathbf{7 g} / \mathbf{1 0 0 m l}$ ) If baby on IV $\mathbf{1 0 \%}$ dextrose change to 5\% dextrose.
- Monitor blood glucose I-2hrly till stabilised then $6-8 \mathrm{hrly}$
- Initiate enteral feeds as soon as possible, if tolerated gradually reduce IV infusion
- At all times make sure glucose intake does not exceed daily requirement.
- If glucose persistently $>10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ for 24 hrs consider insulin infusion.

\section*{2. Insulin}
- Before infusion prime the tubing with insulin for 20 minutes. Purge out then start the baby's infusion
- Start by giving 0.05 units $/ \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$.
- Monitor blood sugar hourly till sugar level fall into normal range.
- Rate of fall should not exceed $3-4 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{hr}$ and do not let blood glucose fall below $6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ while on insulin

As the baby responds reduce insulin infusion by $0.01-0.02$ units $/ \mathrm{hr}$
Remember VLBW/ preterm infants are very sensitive to insulin
Formula for calculation of glucose infusion $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}=\frac{\% \text { dextrose } \times \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}}{144}$

\section*{Glucose intake}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Intake ml/kg/day & 5\% dextrose & 10 \% dextrose & 12.5 \%dextrose \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Note:}
- Feed increases $30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day help to reach full enteral volumes early
- As babies lose weight in the first 7-14 days calculate intake using birth weight until current weight exceeds birth weight.
(see below section on monitoring)

\section*{When to start \& increment}

This depends on birth weight and whether the baby is well or sick. For all babies: Aim to reach full enteral feed by 5-7 day. If not able to feed consider parenteral nutrition while offering trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeds).

\section*{Newborn $\geq 1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ :}

Feeding/ Fluid requirements

\section*{Well baby}
- Immediate milk feeding: If wt $1.5-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ begin with 7.5 mls , and if $>2 \mathrm{~kg} 10 \mathrm{mls}$. Increase by the same amount each feed until full daily volume reached

\section*{Sick baby}
- Day I - Sick baby start with 24 hrs IV $10 \% \mathrm{D}$
- From Day 2 start feeds: If wt $1.5-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ begin with 7.5 mls 3 hrly , and if $>2 \mathrm{~kg} 10 \mathrm{mls} 3 \mathrm{hrly}$. Increase feed by the same amount every day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume until IVF stopped

If too sick to tolerate the calculated enteral feed for the day, give trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeding) $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Drops of breastmilk into the mouth are better than nothing

\section*{Newborn < 1.5 kg :}

\section*{Feeding / Fluid requirements}

Day I - start IV 10\%D for 24 hrs , then give $2 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg}$ of EBM via NG tube every three hours to stimulate the gut, do not deduct this from the IV fluids

From Day 2 - start feeds with EBM at $30 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day, then increase 3 hourly feed volumes by $30 \mathrm{mls} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day and reduce IV fluids to keep within the total daily volume. IVF stopped when full 3 hourly feed volume achieved appropriate for weight and postnatal age in days

If too sick to tolerate the calculated enteral feeds for the day, give trophic feeds (minimal enteral feeding) $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. Drops of breastmilk into the mouth are better than nothing.

\section*{WHAT MILK?}

Human milk recommended basis of nutrition for the all babies irrespective of birth weight.

If breastmilk is not available or contraindicated use preterm/standard formula. Do not exceed $\mathbf{1 8 0 m l}$ /kg/day when using formula.

Fortification of breastmilk may be necessary for:
- Infants born weighing less than 1.5 KG and not growing Infants less than 2 kg with growth failure
- LBW infants on fluid restriction
- Start when baby is tolerating $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

If there is no fortifier available or fortifier is not tolerated - use hind milk. Larger volumes ( $>200 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day ) of EBM can also be used if the baby is able to tolerate it and is not on fluid restriction.

SUPPLEMENTS for all low birth weight
Multivitamins: start when tolerating $100 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day . Vitamin D dose in these should be $400 \mathrm{IU} /$ day Iron and folate: start 14 days after birth. Iron dose 2 mg elemental iron/kg/day
Note: these supplements should continue until baby is 12 months.

\section*{Methods of feeding}

Tube (nasogastric/orogastric): All $<1500 \mathrm{~g}$ or gestation < 32weeks; any other baby too sick to suck irrespective of birth weight.

Cup \& breast: babies in kangaroo care and any other baby $>1500$ gor $>32$ weeks gestation. In all babies initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible

\section*{Cup feeding - expressed breast milk}

Teach the mother how to feed the baby with a cup. Do not feed the baby yourself!
The mother should:
- Measure the quantity of milk in the cup
- Hold the baby sitting semi-upright on her lap
- Hold the cup of milk to the baby's lips:
- Rest cup lightly on lower lip
- Touch edge of cup to outer part of upper lip
- Tip cup so that milk just reaches the baby's lips
- Do not pour the milk into the baby's mouth
- When this is done correctly:
- Baby becomes alert, opens mouth and eyes, and starts to feed
- The baby will suck the milk, spilling some
- Small babies will start to take milk into their mouth using the tongue
- The baby will swallow the milk
- The baby finishes feeding when the mouth closes or when they not interested in taking more
- If the baby does not take the calculated amount:
- Feed more often or feed by tube
- Monitor baby's intake at every shift
- Teach the mother to measure the baby's intake over 24 hours, not just at each feed
- If mother does not express enough milk in the first few days, or if the mother cannot breastfeed at all explore to identify the cause or refer
- Feed the baby by cup if the mother is not available to do so
- The baby is cup feeding well if the required amount of milk is swallowed, spilling little, and weight gain is maintained

\section*{Signs that the baby is receiving adequate amount of milk}
- Baby is satisfied with the feed
- Weight loss is less than $10 \%$ in the first week of life Baby gains atleast $15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
- Baby passes urine as frequently as he/ she feeds
- Baby's stool is changing from dark to light brown or yellow by day 3

\section*{Weigh and assess weight gain}

Weigh on alternate days and note the weight gain. Continue until the baby is ready for discharge.

\section*{Scale maintenance:}
- Weighing requires precise and accurate scale ( 10 g increment)
- Calibrate it daily according to instructions
- Check it for accuracy according to instructions

Simple spring scales are not precise enough for daily/weekly weighing.

\section*{Monitoring and follow up care}
- Close monitoring of vital signs is imperative to detect any complications
- Do not use glucose or water as the first feed
- Use breast milk unless there is a specific contra-indication
- If the baby cannot suck, use expressed breastmilk(EBM) to feed the baby (show mothers how to express breastmilk)
- In absence of own mother's milk, a baby should be given donor human milk if available. (refer to national donor human milk guidelines for indications)
- Where breast milk is contra-indicated, use appropriate breast milk substitutes
- Supplement with multivitamins and ferrous sulphate drops. For vitamins start supplementation at 2 weeks after birth

\section*{Prevention of infection}
- Avoid overcrowding in the newborn unit
- Detect and treat infection early
- Isolate those who are infected

\section*{Tube feeding}

Insertion of Nasal or Oral Gastric Tube
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-644.jpg?height=629&width=1452&top_left_y=405&top_left_x=319)
- Wash hands
- Measure from the nose to the tragus down to about 2 cm below the xiphoid.
- Put an indelible mark to indicate the distance.
- Gently insert the tube while watching for retching and respiration.
- Confirm by either aspiration gastric content or auscultation as you push air into the stomach.
- Secure the tube close to the nostril or angle of the mouth leaving the mark visible.
- Teach the mother how to tube feed her baby-show her:
- The mark on the tube. She should make sure it is at the correct position before each feed.
- How to aspirate the stomach - and if any aspirate whether to return or discard (see enteral feeding guide)
- How to feed by gravity
- How to record on the feeding chart

Caution: Never force the tube. failure to go in maybe due to a congenital anatomical defect that must be investigated before feeding

Sizes of tubes
- Size 8 French Gauge tubes for infants $>3000 \mathrm{~g}$
- Size 6 French Gauge tubes for infants $\geq 1500 \mathrm{~g}$
- Size 5 French Gauge tubes for infants $<1500 \mathrm{~g}$

\section*{Monitoring feeds}

Daily: Record $\mathbf{2 4} \mathbf{h r}$ total intake and output
Do gastric aspirate 6 hourly for stable babies on tube feeding. Record volume and colour. (See table)

\section*{Feeding intolerance}
- A gastric aspirate is significant if it is $>50 \%$ of the volume of feeds over the preceding three hours. This may be an early sign of illness (sepsis), electrolyte disturbance or complication of therapy (eg CPAP) or medication.

\section*{Clinical assessment}
- Abdominal examination - Distension or tenderness, bowel sounds increased or absent
- Gastric aspirate - increasing volume, or change in colour to green (bilious) or red (blood)
- Stool output - change in the frequency of stool output and presence of blood in stools
- Others - Increased episodes of apnoea and bradycardia, diminished oxygen saturation and lethargy
- Vomiting - single episode or recurrent
- Medications - methylxanthines (aminophylline, caffeine)

NB: In all cases exclude presence of intestinal obstruction or NEC

\section*{Handling the aspirates}
- In all these circumstances
- Check position of feeding tube
- Decrease feed to last tolerated volume rather than stop (See guideline for NEC \& intestinal obstruction)
- Investigate to establish the cause
- Do not give Histamine-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors
- It is important to avoid withholding feeds for prolonged periods of time because lack of enteral feeding hastens the complications of parenteral nutrition and intestinal atrophy.

\section*{Colour of gastric aspirate \& management}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline APPEARANCE OF ASPIRATE & COLOUR & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{GUIDELINE} \\
\hline Milk or clear & □ & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Milky with specks of brown sediment & □ & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Milky with tinge of blood & & Return & Feed but reduce feed by equal volume \\
\hline Green & & Discard & \begin{tabular}{l}
Check position of tube. \\
Exclude NEC or intestinal obstruction.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Coffee ground & & Discard & Do not feed. Exclude NEC or bleeding disorder \\
\hline Frank blood & & Discard & Do not feed. Exclude NEC or bleeding disorder \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

If aspirated volume is larger than previous feed discard irrespective of colour and stop feeds \& investigate

\section*{Replacement of gastrointestinal losses}
- Whatever is discarded needs to be added to IV fluids to prevent dehydration.
- Measure losses every 6 hrs and replace in the next 6 hrs ml per ml using intravenous replacement fluid of Ringers lactate and if not available use $0.9 \%$ sodium chloride with 10 mmol potassium $/ 500 \mathrm{ml}$
- Abdominal distension
- Soft, non-tender bowel sounds present, normal colour passing stool- no consequence continue feeding persistent/ increasing, tender/ absent bowel sounds, not passing stool or blood in stool- investigate and treat accordingly. Do not feed.

\section*{APNOEA AND FEEDING}
- Investigate and treat the cause
- One attack - continue feeding.
- Repeated attacks stop feeds for 6 hrs . If stable resume feeds at reduced feed volume or give smaller volume I-2 hourly.
- If not tolerating enteral feeds give IV fluids

\section*{GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX}

Common in preterm infants - recurrent vomiting

\section*{Management}
- Put baby in left lying position after feeds
- Do not prop up
- Frequent Small volume feeds may help
- Do not give Histamine-2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Day 1 ( $\mathbf{1}^{\text {st }} \mathbf{2 4 h r s}$ ) & If very unstable start IV fluids at $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day . Pass a nasogastric tube and institute $3-6$ hourly gastric aspiration. Monitor urine output as this will influence the volume of feeds to be given. \\
\hline Day 2 (24-48hrs) & Check bowel sounds if present and no gastric aspirate start enteral feeds and increase as tolerated according to baby's birth weight. If not able to tolerate calculated enteral feed for the day give trophic feeds. \\
\hline Day 3 (>48hrs) & Most babies will be ready to tolerate full enteral feeds \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Babies on ventilators}

Pass a nasogastric tube as soon as stabilized on the ventilator and do $3-6$ hourly gastric aspiration. If no aspirate start trophic feeds preferably breastmilk. In all cases it recommended to introduce minimal enteral feeds within 24-48hrs. If tolerating trophic feeds start increasing according to daily needs until full enteral feeds. If not able to tolerate enteral feed consider parenteral nutrition

\section*{MONITORING ALL BABIES}

\section*{Daily}
- Assess hydration status Input /output

\section*{Growth}
- Weight - 3 times a week
- Head circumference and length weekly

\section*{Guide to weight changes in the first 14 postnatal days}

\section*{$\left.\right|^{\text {st }}$ week weight loss}

Term: I-2\% of birth weight per day, maximum 5-7\%. Regain birthweight by 7-10 days.

Preterm (LBW): weight loss $2-3 \%$ of birth weight per day, maximum $10-15 \%$. Regain birth weight by 10-14 days.

\section*{For all newborns:}
- First 7-14 days
- Excess weight loss is most likely due to inadequate intake leading to dehydration.
- No weight loss or weight gain during this period indicates fluid retention

Thereafter signs that baby is receiving an adequate amount of milk
- Baby is satisfied with the feed
- Weight loss is $<10 \%$ for term $\&<15 \%$ for preterm in the first week of life
- Weight gain term $20-30 \mathrm{~g} /$ day \& preterm $10-15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day Baby passing adequate amount of urine
- Baby's stool is changing from dark to light brown or yellow by day 3

Poor growth: Identify the cause \& manage accordingly

\section*{General instructions}

Intravenous fluid volume should not exceed $150-160 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ unless there are continuing losses
As babies lose weight in the first 7-14 days calculate intake using birth weight until current weight exceeds birth weight.

In many instances' IV fluids are combined with enteral feeds. As enteral feeds are tolerated the IV infusion is appropriately reduced.

If you give adequate fluids, there is no need to add additional fluids for baby on phototherapy

\section*{Fluid restrictions}

Congestive cardiac failure: Restrict to $100-120 / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{day}$. (See section on cardiac conditions)
Renal impairment: according to degree of renal impairment (urine output) \& increase when diuresis occurs (See section on AKI)

Babies with birth asphyxia Day I: start with $40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day . Monitor renal function (urine output) closely and modify input accordingly

\section*{Electrolytes per day}

Sodium: $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ (VLBW may need up to $4-6 \mathrm{mmol}$ );
Potassium: $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$;
Chloride: $2-3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$
Add to IV fluids from day 2 onwards

\section*{Calculation of infusate}

Determine the total volume needed for the day
Calculate electrolyte needs for the day \& subtract from total volume
Give the remainder as glucose (see section glucose guide)
If baby needs blood transfusion, count it as part of the total fluid intake. Do not give furosemide
Calculate drip rate: wt × volume $/ \mathrm{kg}=\mathrm{ml} /$ minute
$$60 \times 24 \mathrm{hrs}$$

Once you have the volume/minute calculate the number of drops per minute.
Use a microsoluset (infusion giving set) which gives $60 \mathrm{drops} / \mathrm{ml}$. or if available an infusion pump especially for very low or extremely low birth weight babies

\section*{Monitor the IV infusion very carefully:}
1. Drip rate and volume infused every hour and record using a fluid chart
2. Total intake 6hrly to prevent over or under infusion
3. Infusion site 3 hrly to detect extravasation or infection
4. Hydration status daily or more frequently if there are continuing losses
5. Monitor input/output \& replace losses appropriately
6. Weigh baby daily (best way of detecting over or under hydration)
7. Introduce milk feeding by nasogastric/orogastric tube or breastfeeding as soon as it is safe to do so (see enteral feeding)
8. Electrolytes daily until stabilised

\section*{Replacement of gastrointestinal losses}

Whatever is discarded needs to be added to IV fluids to prevent dehydration
Measure losses every 6 hrs and replace in the next 6 hrs ml per ml using intravenous replacement fluid of or Ringer's lactate.

\section*{PARENTERAL NUTRITION}

\section*{Indications}

Any baby when enteral feeds are contraindicated or not tolerating enteral feeds.
NOTE: To prevent severe nutritional deficits start as soon as possible in any situation where enteral feeding is likely to be delayed.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Recommendation}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline COMPONENT & RECOMMENDATION PER DAY \\
\hline Fluid & Day $\mathrm{I}: 60-80 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ increase by 30 ml to a maximum of $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day. \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Chloride: $\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{3} \mathrm{mmo} / \mathrm{kg}$}

Calcium: $\mathbf{1} . \mathbf{5}-\mathbf{2} . \mathbf{2 ~ m m o l} / \mathrm{kg}$; Phosphorus: $\mathbf{0 . 5}$ -

\section*{$1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$}

Aim to provide:
- Amino acids from day 1 Lipids by day 2
- Full nutritional requirements (Parenteral in addition to enteral)

\section*{Fluids used to calculate infusate}

Glucose: 1 g dextrose $=3.4 \mathrm{kcal}$. So $10 \%$ dextrose provides $0.34 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{ml}$. (see section on Glucose Disorders)
$10 \%$ lipid provides $0.9 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{ml}$
20\% lipid provides I . I kcal/kg (preferred for newborn)
Protein: paediatric amino acid formulations (10\% or 20\%solution)
Sodium: Normal saline provides $0.15 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml} ; 3 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ provides $0.5 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml}$
Potassium: $15 \%$ solution provides $2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{ml}$
Calcium: 10\% calcium gluconate
Phosphorus: as potassium phosphate
Paediatric parenteral multivitamins given to meet the recommended daily requirements. If minimal feeds are tolerated vitamins can be given through enteral route

\section*{Composition of infusate}

Calculate total fluid for 24 hrs , then calculate volumes of protein, lipids, and electrolytes (remember that some amino acid preparations contain electrolytes). Subtract this from the total fluid to get the volume of dextrose. Strength of dextrose is dictated by I) total volume, 2) energy needs, 3) baby's blood glucose levels. (See section on glucose disorders)

\section*{Calculate volume for each component as follows:}

Amount of component $=$ amount to be given $/ \mathrm{kg} \times$ body weight kg
Strength of solution/ml

\section*{EXAMPLE}

TOTAL FLUID: ML/KG/DAY × WT IN KG = $\_\_\_\_$ $\mathrm{ml} / 24 \mathrm{hrs}$

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{a. Amino acids:} & g/kg/day × wt in kg & & = $\_\_\_\_$ & \\
\hline & strength of solution & & & \\
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{b. Lipids (fats):} & g/kg/day × wt in kg & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$=$ $\_\_\_\_$} & \\
\hline & Strength of solution (0.1 if 10\% or 0.2 if 20\%) & & & \\

\hline SUB TOTAL & $\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{c}+\mathrm{d}+\mathrm{e}$ & & = $\_\_\_\_$ & \\
\hline Dextrose Volume: & TOTAL FLUID minus SUB TOTAL & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To provide a minimum of $4-6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}$ decide the strength of dextrose either 5\%, 10\% or more depending on baby's needs (See section on glucose guide)

Once you have the total volume calculate the flow rate for the lipids and the rest of the infusate.
NOTE: If baby needs blood transfusion count it as part of the total fluid volume

\section*{Vascular access}

Umbilical artery or vein catheter (Confirm position by X-ray before use): Use for not longer than 7 days

Short peripheral vein catheter: use for short period \& dextrose not more than $12.5 \%$
Central line catheter or peripherally inserted central venous catheter (Confirm position by X-ray before use): Can be used for longer than 7 days

Note: Lipids are not mixed with other infusates, i.e. given in a separate line

\section*{Enteral Feeds}

To prevent gut atrophy babies on parenteral nutrition should be given trophic (minimal enteral feeds) unless there is absolute contraindication e.g. NEC or gut atresia.

\section*{Weaning off parenteral nutrition}

When a baby is tolerating $30-50 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day of enteral feed start reducing the parenteral nutrition. Once the baby tolerates full enteral feeds PN can be stopped

\section*{Complications}

Catheter related:
i. Accidental displacement Occlusion
ii. Thrombosis \& thromboemblism
- Infections
- Metabolic
iii. Glucose - hyper or hypoglycaemia Cholestasis
iv. Hyperlipidaemia
v. Hyperammonaemia

\section*{Monitoring}

Monitor for above complications and act promptly on results Watch out for signs of infection both locally at entry site \& systemic.

When recognized:
- Do not feed baby, but have IV fluid maintenance
- Attempt to pass NG tube and suction gently
- Refer urgently

\section*{IMPERFORATE ANUS}

This is when there is no anal opening. Failure to pass meconium is noted It can be diagnosed by inspection and subsequent failure to insert a thermometer.

\section*{Management:}
- Provide emotional support and reassurance to the mother
- Establish an IV line, and give only IV fluid at maintenance volume according to the baby's age
- Ensure that the baby does not receive anything by mouth
- Insert a nasogastric tube and ensure free drainage
- Urgently refer the baby to a tertiary hospital or specialized centre for surgery

\section*{OMPHALOCOELE AND GASTROSCHISIS}

This is when the abdominal wall does not close fully and remains open.
In Omphalocele there is a thin layer covering the bowel and in gastroschisis there maybe exposed bowel.

\section*{General Management}
- Provide emotional support and reassurance to the mother
- Establish an IV line and give only IV fluid at maintenance volume according to the baby's age

\section*{Management of Omphalocele:}

The baby can be fed with breastmilk and needs to be reviewed by a surgeon.

\section*{Management}

If the defect is not covered by skin:
- Cover with warm sterile saline gauze to reduce fluid and heat loss and to give a degree of protection
- Keep gauze moist at all times, and ensure that the baby is kept warm

\section*{Management of Gastroschisis:}
- Establish an IV line and give only IV fluid at maintenance volume according to the baby's age.
- Insert a nasogastric tube, and ensure free drainage
- Refer the baby urgently to a tertiary hospital or specialized centre for surgery
- Note that the baby is susceptible to infections and antibiotic cover is required.

\section*{NON-LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS}

These include:
- Spina bifida
- Cleft lip and palate
- Talipes (equinovarus)
- Hydrocephaly

\section*{SPINA BIFIDA}

This occurs when there is a defect in the vertebral column

\section*{Management}

Provide emotional support and re assurance to parent
If the defect is not covered by skin:
- Cover with sterile gauze soaked in sterile normal saline
- Keep gauze moist at all times and ensure that the baby is kept warm
- If ruptured give Benzyl Penicillin 50,000 units/kg 12 hourly and Gentamicin $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ daily for 5 days
- Organize transfer, and refer the baby to a tertiary hospital or specialized centre for further evaluation or surgical care, if possible

\section*{CLEFT LIP AND PALATE}

There is a defect in the upper lip that may be accompanied by a defect in the palate.

\section*{Management}
- Provide emotional support and reassurance to parents
- Mother needs to be told that feeding is important to ensure adequate growth until surgery can be performed
- Show mother how to feed the baby with breastmilk
- Note that babies with minor clefts can breastfeed
- However, those with bilateral clefts must be fed by cup and spoon
- Take care to prevent aspiration
- Refer to surgeon for repair

This is a deformity of the foot where the ankle is turned downwards and the front part of foot is turned inwards.

\section*{Management}
- Apply plaster of Paris
- Revise every I-2weeks
- Refer if no response after 3 months

\section*{HYDROCEPHALY}

This occurs when there is an unusually large head arising from blockage in the free flow of CSF in the ventricular system.

\section*{Management}
- Monitor head circumference
- Refer early for surgical CSF drainage

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF COMMON GENETIC BIRTH DEFECTS}
- Provide emotional support and reassurance to the mother
- If the baby has Down syndrome or unusual facial features, advise the parents about the long-term prognosis, and refer the family to a specialized centre for developmental evaluation and follow-up
- Refer to paediatrician for further care
- If the mother is not going to breastfeed and the mother requests for a contraceptive method, provide family planning services

\section*{Counselling:}

\section*{In all cases of birth defects:}
- Counsel parents in all cases.
- Counsel both parents at the same time wherever possible
- Have the most qualified health worker talk to parents
- Ensure honesty, sensitivity and empathy by all staff
- Parents should be shown any obvious defect on the baby and told the implications
- Current and future management to be discussed
- Link with any community support groups should be made

\section*{BLEEDING DISORDERS}

\section*{Definition}

This is when a baby presents with unusual and uncontrolled bleeding.
There may be prolonged bleeding from:
- The umbilical cord
- The Gastrointestinal tract
- Into the skin

Others areas where bleeding may occur include:
- Intracranial haemorrhage
- Pulmonary

\section*{Predisposing factors}
- Prematurity
- Infections
- Birth trauma
- Asphyxia
- Vitamin K deficiency

\section*{Investigations}
- Take blood for full blood count including a PBF
- Group and cross-match blood
- Coagulation screen

\section*{Normal values}

Prothrombin time (PT) is $12-13$ seconds and platelet count is $150-450 \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{L}$ as in adult. Babies who are not given vitamin K at birth will have a slightly prolonged PT in the first week Activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) up to 3 wks $40-42 \mathrm{sec}$ in term \& up to 50 sec in preterm thereafter $28-39 \mathrm{sec}$ as in adult

\section*{Prevention}

All newborns should be given IM vitamin K Img at birth or soon after.
Prevent the predisposing factors
Interpretation of coagulation screen
Prolonged APPT alone: inherited individual factor deficiency
Prolonged PT alone/INR: vitamin K deficiency
Prolonged APPT \& PT: Liver disease
Prolonged APPT, PT \& low platelets (or prolonged PT \& low platelets): DIC

\section*{Management}
- Take history and examine baby, ensure warmth
- Investigate to identify causeTreat the cause immediately If from cord stump, retie or reclamplf cut press on bleeding site with sterile gauze
- Give vitamin $\mathrm{K} 1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ i.v even if the baby had already been given

\section*{Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)}

\section*{Indication for transfusion:}

Clinically significant bleeding due to coagulation defects in following conditions
- Severe liver disease
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Vitamin K deficiency bleeding

Dose: $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ over $2-4 \mathrm{hrs}$

Use ABO compatible with recipient's RBCs Treat the cause if treatable. Vitamin K deficiency bleeding: give IV vitamin K $\mathrm{I}-2 \mathrm{mg} / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ IM/IV.

\section*{Platelet transfusions}

Platelet count is the same for all ages
Thrombocytopenia is common in neonates with respiratory distress or sepsis.

\section*{Indication for transfusion}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Platelet & \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{BLEEDING} \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{count x/0 /L} \\
\hline & Yes & No \\

\hline & & Associated with coagulopathy \\
\hline & & Requires surgery \\
\hline 50-99 & Transfuse & Do not Transfuse \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Dose: Neonates: $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$
Patients with DIC/sepsis may require more.
Remember: Given platelets get destroyed very fast.

\section*{NEONATAL INFECTIONS}

\section*{Definition}

Infections occurring within the first 28 days of life. Neonatal infections may be contracted by transplacental (in utero), in birth canal during delivery (perinatal) or after birth (postnatal).

\section*{Categories}

Intrauterine (congenital) e.g. TORCHES - Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex Virus, Syphilis and HIV.

Perinatal - could by bacterial (sepsis), viral or fungal infection and atypical organism especially chlamydia trachomatis.

Postnatal - late onset sepsis, Nosocomial infections.

The presentation may be Early - within the 72 hours after birth or Late - presenting 72 hours after birth.

\section*{NEONATAL SEPSIS}

\section*{Definition}

Systemic bacterial infection occurring in infants less than 28days.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) $>18 \mathrm{hrs}$
- Maternal intrapartum fever (Temp 38 c)
- Suspected or confirmed chorioamnionitis (Foul smelling or purulent amniotic fluid.)
- Mother on treatment for perinatal sepsis.
- Low birth weight babies especially preterm babies with pre labour rupture of membranes.
- Severe birth asphyxia

\section*{Causitive agents}

Early sepsis - mainly caused by pathogens that colonize birth canal, -Group B streptococcus, and gram negative enteric bacteria.

Late onset infections community acquired are predominantly gram positive or gram-negative bacteria.

Nosocomial infections (forms part of Late onset neonatal sepsis)-A major cause of morbidity and mortality especially in NICU. Mainly caused by several microorganisms (bacteria \& fungi) circulation in the newborn unit. These are commonly resistant to many antibiotics.

Other important bacterial pathogens include atypical bacteria especially Chlamydia trachomatis.

\section*{Viral causes of neonatal infections}

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquired prenatally or through breastfeeding
Others viruses include, Cytomegalovirus (CMV, Herpes simplex (HSV) Rubella, Varicella (VZV), Hepatitis B, Zika.

The manifestation of neonatal septicaemia is subtle, vague and non -specific. The most common complaint concerning neonate's progress is 'failure to do well' or 'not looking right'

These signs and symptoms indicate the need for empiric antibiotics.

\section*{Systemic Signs}
- History of feeding difficulty
- History of convulsions
- Temperature $=37.50 \mathrm{C}$ or $<35.50 \mathrm{C}$
- Fast breathing / respiratory rate $=60 \mathrm{bpm}$
- Grunting
- Change in level of activity
- Severe chest indrawing

\section*{Localized Signs}
- Many or severe skin pustules
- Periumbilical Flaring (Redness)
- Umbilicus draining pus
- Bulging fontanelle
- Painful joints, joint swelling, reduced movement and irritability
- Severe Abdominal Distention

\section*{Other signs and symptoms include:}

Jaundice, Circulatory instability - prolonged capillary refill, severe pallor, bradycardia, coagulopathy, Feeds intolerance, Diarrhoea, Weight loss.

\section*{Signs for non-severe sepsis include:}

Pus from the eye or ear, Septic cord, Septic spots/ few pus- filled blisters.

\section*{NEONATAL MENINGITIS}

\section*{Definition}

Inflammation of the meninges due to infection. Common in late onset neonatal sepsis

\section*{Signs and symptoms}

Mainly similar to those of severely sick neonate. However, any ONE of the following signs may be an indicator of neonatal meningitis and hence require a MANDATORY Lumbar Puncture unless the procedure is contra indicated.
Change in level of activity Bulging fontanelle
History of convulsions Feeding difficulty.

\section*{Investigations}
- Complete blood count and differentials
- Elevated Immature neutrophils to total neutrophil ratio (I/T ratio) more than 0.16 in the first 24 hrs or $>0.2$ later.
- Random blood sugar.
- Culture and sensitivity of: Blood, Urine, Pus swab etc
- Lumbar puncture and CSF Analysis for suspected meningitis.
- C- Reactive Protein (CRP) Levels $>5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ is considered high. Increasing CRP levels over the next $6-8 \mathrm{hrs}$ is suggestive of sepsis. Therefore, repeat CRP levels should be done after 8hours.
- Procalcitonin levels. Levels $>2.4 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{ml}$. useful in late onset neonatal sepsis (after 7days)

\section*{Imaging}
- Chest radiography may be considered as in case of respiratory signs.
- Cranial CT scanning / MRI may be considered later to diagnose complications of neonatal meningitis.

\section*{Urea and Electrolytes}

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Supportive}
- Feeding - support breastfeeding where feasible (see section on feeding)
- IV fluids when feeding is not feasible, monitor input output charts
- Consider transfusion of blood or blood products where indicated.
- Oxygen therapy in case of respiratory compromise or as guided by pulse oximetry.
- Thermal regulation according to baby's weight and temperature.
- Consider early transfer for NICU for the critically ill neonates requiring cardiopulmonary support.

\section*{Definitive treatment and duration}

Antibiotic prophylaxis: Babies with risk factors (see above) -Benzyl penicillin and Gentamicin. Treatment should be given for 48 to 72 hours while awaiting investigations and may be stopped if the baby has remained entirely well during this period.

Severe sepsis or pneumonia: Penicillin and Gentamicin for 5-7 days depending on clinical response. If there is no response by $2-3$ days repeat CRP and blood count and change to a cephalosporin or as guided by sensitivity pattern.

Neonatal meningitis should be treated for 14 days if due to gram positive bacteria and 21 days for gram negative meningitis preferably with ceftriaxone.

\section*{NEONATAL JAUNDICE}

\section*{Definition}

It is the yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes as a result of raised bilirubin levels, occurring in the first 28days of life.

It may be classified as physiological or pathological jaundice.

\section*{Physiological Jaundice}
- This is a common problem in the newborn especially the pre-term baby
- Usually appears after 48 hours of birth and resolves in 7-10days or a little longer in the preterm baby
- Mainly occurs in the skin and eyes
- Baby looks and feeds well

\section*{Pathological Jaundice}

Refers to
- Jaundice which appears anytime within the first $24-48$ hours of life and later
- Lasts longer than 14 days in term babies and 21 days in the pre-term Jaundice with fever
- Deep jaundice usually involving palms and soles

\section*{Common causes}
- Physiological jaundice
- It is due to normal physiological breakdown of the large red blood cell mass.

\section*{Pathological Jaundice- may be caused by:}
- Rhesus incompatibility
- ABO incompatibility
- Neonatal infection
- Neonatal infections Intra-uterine infection
- Congenital hypothyroidism
- Liver diseases such as hepatitis and biliary atresia
- Asphyxia Birth injuries

\section*{Causes according to age of onset}

\hline & Disorders of bilirubin metabolism eg \\
\hline & Neonatal hepatitis \\
\hline & Biliary tract disorders (conjugated bilirubin) \\
\hline & Endocrine: Hypothyroidism (unconjugated bilirubin) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Management}
- Take history to determine the cause of jaundice for all babies
- History of previously affected siblings, and if so, what treatment e.g. phototherapy or blood exchange transfusion
- Colour of urine and stool
- Mother's blood group
- For RH negative mothers, ask if she has had abortions previously and whether she received Anti-D

\section*{On examination check on:}
- Yellowness of skin and mucus membranes
- Colour of urine and stools
- General behaviour and activity
- Signs of infection
- Ability to suck properly
- Check for pallor
- Monitor for signs of kernicterus and act promptly
- Monitor bilirubin levels

Assess for severity of jaundice (Kramer's staging) and signs of bilirubin encephalopathy (bilirubin induced neurological dysfunction [BIND])

\section*{Bilirubin levels (Kramer's staging)}
- Any jaundice $=90 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Head \& neck $=70-130 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Trunk, to elbows \& knees $=190-300 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$
- Hands \& feet $>300 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$

\end{table}

Scores $\boldsymbol{I}-\mathbf{3}=$ subtle signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy
Scores 4-6 $=$ moderate acute bilirubin encephalopathy reversible with urgent and prompt treatment (exchange transfusion)

Scores 7-9 $=$ advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy; urgent, prompt, and individualized intervention are recommended to prevent further brain damage. (exchange transfusion)

\section*{Investigation}

Basic investigations for early onset:
- Blood group - mother \& baby
- Bilirubin total \& direct
- Full blood count, IT ratio, peripheral blood film including reticulocyte count
- Septic screen if indicated
- If indicated: direct Coomb's test (Rh negative mother)
- Always measure serum bilirubin if age $<24$ hours and if clinically moderate or severe
- Any jaundice in a new born aged $<24$ hrs needs further investigation and treatment

\section*{Treatment}
- No treatment is necessary for most cases of physiological jaundice but encourage breastfeeding
- Keep baby warm
- Continue breastfeeding or give EBM
- Give antibiotics when indicated
- Phototherapy if:
- Jaundice on dayl
- Deep jaundice involving palms and sole of feet
- Prematurity and jaundice
- Jaundice due to haemolysis

If bilirubin measure unavailable start phototherapy:
- In a well-baby with jaundice easily visible on the sole of the foot
- In a preterm baby with ANY visible jaundice
- In a baby with easily visible jaundice and inability to feed or other signs of neurological impairment and consider immediate exchange transfusion

Stop phototherapy - when bilirubin 50 micromol/L lower than phototherapy threshold (see next page) for the baby's age on day of testing
- Exchange blood transfusion when indicated

Indications for immediate Exchange blood transfusion for jaundice appearing at birth
- Hb below $\mathrm{IIg} / 100 \mathrm{mls}$
- Bilirubin levels above $4 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{mls}(70 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$
- Signs of Congestive Cardiac failure

For preterms bilrubin level of above 120 within the first 12 hours of life and for term babies bilrubin levels above 200 mmols in the first 12 hours of life.

Refer early for jaundice in those aged $<24 \mathrm{hrs}$ and the facility cannot provide phototherapy and exchange transfusion

Phototherapy and supportive care - checklist
- Shield the eyes with eye patches - Remove periodically such as during feeds
- Keep the baby naked
- Place the baby close to the light source - 45 cm distance is often recommended but the more light power the baby receives the better the effect so closer distances are OK if the baby is not overheating especially if rapid effect is needed, use white cloth to reflect light back onto the baby making sure these do not cause overheating.
- Do not place anything on the phototherapy devices - lights and baby need tokeep cool so do not block air vents / flow or light. Also keep device clean - dust can carry bacteria and reduce light
- Promote frequent breast feeding. Unless dehydrated, supplements or intravenous fluids are unnecessary. Phototherapy use can be interrupted for feeds; allow maternal bonding.
- Periodically change position supine to prone - Expose the maximum surface area of baby to phototherapy; may reposition after each feed.
- Monitor temperature every 4 hrs and weight every 24 hrs .
- Periodic ( 12 to 24 hrs) plasma/serum bilirubin test. Visual testing for jaundice or transcutaneous bilirubin is unreliable.
- Make sure that each light source is working and emitting light. Fluorescent tube lights should be replaced if:
- More than 6 months in use (or usage time $>2000 \mathrm{hrs}$ )
- Tube ends have blackened
- Lights flicker
