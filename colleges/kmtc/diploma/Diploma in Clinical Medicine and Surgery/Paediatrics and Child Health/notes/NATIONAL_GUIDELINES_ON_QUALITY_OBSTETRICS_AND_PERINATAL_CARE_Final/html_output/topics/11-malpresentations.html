                        <p>It accounts for 3.5% of term singleton deliveries and about 25% of cases before 30 weeks of
                            gestation as most cases undergo spontaneous cephalic version up to term. It is more common
                            in preterm deliveries. In breech presentation, labour and birth carry increased risk of
                            morbidity and mortality compared to cephalic presentation. Caesarean delivery is often
                            recommended as a safer method of birth for breech presentation, but carries risk for the
                            mother both immediately and in future pregnancies.</p>
                        <p>External Cephalic Version (ECV), a procedure to turn the foetus from a breech to a cephalic
                            presentation, can reduce the incidence of breech presentation in labour and should be
                            offered to some mothers late in the pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3>Mechanism of Labour</h3>
                        <p>A certain degree of deflexion is present. Taking in consideration the rule that the part of
                            the foetus that meets the pelvic floor first will rotate anteriorly, the degree of deflexion
                            determines the mechanism of labour as follow:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Normal mechanism (90%):</strong> Deflexion is corrected, complete flexion
                                occurs. Long anterior rotation 3/8 circle occurs bringing the occiput anteriorly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abnormal mechanism (10%):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Deep transverse arrest (1%):</strong> In mild deflexion, the occiput
                                        rotates 1/8 circle anteriorly and the head is arrested in the transverse
                                        diameter.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Persistent occipito-posterior (3%):</strong> In moderate deflexion, no
                                        internal rotation and the head persists in the oblique diameter.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Direct occipito-posterior (face to pubis) (6%):</strong> In marked
                                        deflexion, the sinciput meets the pelvic floor first, rotates 1/8 circle
                                        anteriorly and the occiput becomes direct posterior.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Management of Labour</h3>
                        <p><strong>First stage:</strong> Exclude contracted pelvis/cord prolapse. Inertia and prolonged
                            labour are expected. Avoid premature rupture of membranes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Second stage:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Long internal rotation 3/8 circle: occurs in about 90% of cases and delivery is
                                completed as in normal labour.</li>
                            <li>Direct occipito-posterior (face to pubis): Occurs in about 6% of cases. The head can be
                                delivered spontaneously or by aid of outlet forceps. Episiotomy is done.</li>
                            <li>Deep transverse arrest (1%) and persistent occipito-posterior (3%): The labour is
                                obstructed. Options: Vacuum extraction, Manual rotation and extraction by forceps, or
                                Caesarean section.</li>
