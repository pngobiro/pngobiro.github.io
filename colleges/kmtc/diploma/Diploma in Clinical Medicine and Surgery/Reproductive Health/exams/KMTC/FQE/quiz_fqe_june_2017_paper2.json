    {

      "question": "Which of the following is NOT useful in the diagnosis of premature rupture of membranes?",

      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Leakage of fluid per vagina", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Positive fern test", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Demonstration of amniotic fluid on speculum examination", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Positive methylene blue test", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "While methylene blue can theoretically diagnose membrane rupture (by injection into the amniotic sac), it is invasive and generally not used for routine diagnosis. Standard non-invasive methods include observing leakage (pooling), the Fern test (crystallization pattern), and Nitrazine test (pH).",
      "hint": "Think about which test involves an invasive injection versus non-invasive observation."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Is a sign of infection", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Excessive lochia can be confused with PPH. Lochia Alba is white/yellow (not red). Lochia Rubra (red) lasts 3-4 days (not 10). Lochia is normal, but foul-smelling lochia is a sign of infection.",
      "hint": "Consider the volume of discharge and how it might be confused with abnormal bleeding."

        { "id": "d", "text": "There is fresh flow of blood per vagina", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Signs of placental separation include lengthening of the cord, the fundus rising (and becoming hard/globular), and a gush of blood. The cord does not shorten.",
      "hint": "What happens to the cord when the placenta detaches and drops into the lower segment?"

      ],
      "explanation": "The second stage of labor begins at full cervical dilatation (10 cm) and ends with the expulsion of the fetus.",
      "hint": "This stage ends with the delivery of the baby."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Fetal macrosomia", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Gestational diabetes typically causes fetal macrosomia (large baby) due to high glucose levels, leading to risks like shoulder dystocia and C-section. IUGR is typically associated with pre-existing diabetes with vascular complications, but in the context of 'Diabetes in pregnancy' (GDM), macrosomia is the hallmark.",
      "hint": "Does high sugar usually make the baby smaller or larger?"
    },

      ],
      "explanation": "Tests detecting Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) in serum or urine are immunological tests. Ultrasound is a biophysical/imaging method.",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Ergometrine can be used safely", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Augmentation uses Oxytocin via controlled IV infusion (titrated). IV bolus can cause uterine rupture. Cytotec is typically for induction/cervical ripening. Ergometrine causes titanic contractions and is used for PPH, not augmentation.",
      "hint": "The drug must be strictly controlled to match contraction strength."
