                        <h3>Neural tube defects</h3>
                        <p>The neural tube defects are the commonest of the major congenital abnormalities and include anencephaly, microcephaly, spina bifida with or without myelomeningocele, encephalocele, holoprosencephaly and hydranencephaly (Fig. 10.1). The incidence is approximately 1/200 and the chance of having an affected child after one previous abnormal child is 1/20. Infants with anencephaly or microcephaly do not usually survive. Many die during labour and the remainder within the first week of life. Infants with open neural tube defects often survive, particularly where it is possible to cover the lesion surgically with skin. However, the defect may result in paraplegia and bowel and bladder incontinence. The child often has normal intelligence and becomes aware of the problems posed for the parents. Closed lesions generally do not cause problems and may escape detection until after birth.</p>
                        <p>There is good evidence that pre- and periconceptual folic acid supplementation (400 μg/day) reduces the incidence of this condition. Once a woman is pregnant, the major effort is directed toward screening techniques that enable recognition of the abnormality and the offer of a termination of the pregnancy where there is a lethal abnormality.</p>
                        <p>Folic acid dietary supplementation is indicated both before and during pregnancy in those women who have experienced a pregnancy complicated by a neural tube defect.</p>

                        <h3>Congenital cardiac defects</h3>
                        <p>Some of these infants present with intrauterine growth retardation and oligohydramnios, but in many cases the diagnosis is recognised and diagnosed after delivery. With improvements in real-time ultrasound imaging, recognition of many cardiac defects has become possible; however, early recognition is essential if any action is to be taken. A four-chamber view of the fetal heart is shown in Figure 10.2.</p>
                        <p>The most common defects are ventricular and atrial septal defects, pulmonary and aortic stenosis, coarctation and transpositions, including the tetralogy of Fallot. These lesions can generally now be recognized on the fourchamber views recorded during detailed 18-week gestation scans.</p>

                        <h3>Defects of the abdominal wall</h3>
                        <p>Defects of the abdominal wall can be diagnosed by ultrasound imaging. They include gastroschisis and exomphalos (Fig. 10.3). In both cases, the bowel extrudes outside the abdominal cavity. The main differences between the two are that a gastroschisis is a defect that is separate from the umbilical cord (usually 2–3 cm below and to the right), does not have a peritoneal covering and is usually an isolated problem. In contrast, an exomphalos is essentially a large hernia of the umbilical cord with a peritoneal covering and an increased risk of an underlying chromosomal abnormality,</p>

                        <h3>Chromosomal abnormalities</h3>
                        <p>A considerable number of chromosomal abnormalities have been identified from the culture and karyotyping of fetal/placental cells in the amniotic fluid or from the chorionic plate. The chromosomal abnormalities include both structural and numerical abnormalities of the karyotype. The commonest abnormality is that associated with trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome.</p>

                        <h4>Down's syndrome</h4>
                        <p>Down's syndrome (DS) is characterized by the typical abnormal facial features (Fig 10.4), mental retardation of varying degrees of severity and congenital heart disease. The karyotype includes an additional chromosome on group 21 ('trisomy 21'; Fig 10.5). The incidence overall is 1.5/1000 births. However, the risk increases with advancing maternal age (see below). The underlying reason is thought to be an increased frequency of non-disjunction at meiosis.</p>
                        <p>About 6–8% of affected infants have the disease as a result of a translocation and the extra 21 chromosome carried on to another chromosome, usually in group 13–15. The mother or the father will usually show evidence of being a balanced translocation carrier.</p>

                        <h3>Screening</h3>
                        <p>Screening in this context is the process whereby women with a higher risk of fetal abnormality are identified in the general population. This screening is undertaken using identification of clinical risk factors, ultrasound (US) and biochemical testing of maternal serum. Clinical risk factors can be identified throughout pregnancy though the options for management are different depending on the gestational age. US and biochemical screening is offered to women in the first half of pregnancy. Ideally women should be offered a combined screening test (using US and biochemistry) for DS towards the end of the first trimester and a detailed US scan at about 20 weeks. The early scan also allows gestational age to be confirmed. If a woman presents too late for the first trimester DS screening, then she should be offered a biochemical screening test at about 16 weeks.</p>

                        <h4>Ultrasound</h4>
                        <p>Most pregnant women in the UK present for their first visit to a health professional in the first trimester. This means that they can be offered two early ultrasound (US) scans. The first scan, ideally between 11w+0 d and 13w+6 d, allows fetal viability and number to be confirmed, gestation to be confirmed by crown-rump length (CRL) (see Chapter 4) and, if the woman wishes screening for DS, she can have a measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) (Fig. 10.6) as part of the 'combined testing' programme (see next section).</p>

                        <h4>Biochemistry</h4>
                        <p>The accuracy of risk prediction of DS is greatly increased with the combined use of NT with biochemical markers. The 'combined screening test' that should be offered to all women comprises NT, plus assay of β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A. This should occur when the CRL measures from 45–84 mm (at approximately 11w+0 d to 13w+6 d). For each of these three parameters the likelihood of a DS fetus, given the background risk from the woman's age, is calculated against a database of over 200 000 pregnancies with known fetal DS status. The three likelihood ratios can be merged into a single risk to give the individual woman.</p>
                        <p>Where a woman presents in the second trimester, serum screening can be offered between 14 weeks+2 days and 20 weeks and 0 days using the quadruple test. The four chemicals measured are human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), α-fetoprotein (aFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE3) and inhibin-A. Again individual likelihood ratios for a DS fetus are calculated for each (given the background risk from the woman's age) and combined into a single risk estimate.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee is that a DS risk of greater than 1:150 indicates a 'high' risk and that further assessment in the form of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the first trimester or amniocentesis in the second trimester should be discussed with the woman and her partner. In practice, many prefer to present the risk estimate to the woman and allow her to make her own decision.</p>

                        <h4>Counselling in advance of US and biochemical testing</h4>
                        <p>Before a woman participates in any screening programme aimed at detecting fetal abnormalities it is imperative that she has appropriate pre-test counselling. This should cover the following:</p>

                        <h5>Options for pregnancy</h5>
                        <p>Once a fetal abnormality is diagnosed with a high chance of death or serious disability, after counselling, the parents may feel that they do not wish to continue with the pregnancy and opt for a termination. However, faced with the same facts other parents may decide to continue with the pregnancy. The decision is for the parents to make and no one else, hence the need for 'non-directive' counselling.</p>

                        <h5>Possible interventions</h5>
                        <p>With some fetal abnormalities a woman and her partner may be offered interventions aimed at improving or ameliorating the fetal condition. Examples include:</p>

                        <h3>Surveillance of fetal health in at-risk pregnancies</h3>
                        <p>On the basis of the clinical risk assessment screening (above) an individualized programme of fetal surveillance will be offered to 'at risk' women during their pregnancy. The most commonly used methods are discussed here.</p>

                        <h4>Doppler recordings of blood flow in the umbilical artery (UA)</h4>
                        <p>This investigation has been shown to significantly improve fetal outcome in high-risk pregnancies. Figure 10.10A shows a normal recording.</p>
                        <p>Figure 10.10B shows an example of 'absent end-diastolic flow' (AEDV). The commonest explanation is an increase in placental vascular resistance ('downstream' from the point of recording), which is typical of umbilical placental vascular disease (UPVD). The prognosis for the fetus with AEDV is worse with growth restriction, hypoxia and death all being commoner. However, the risk is not usually immediate and management options include continued close surveillance with biophysical testing until a viable gestational age is reached or the biophysical testing is abnormal. If this abnormality occurs at 34 weeks or beyond most would offer the woman elective preterm delivery rather than continuing the pregnancy and the possibility of fetal death.</p>
                        <p>Figure 10.10C shows an example of 'reversed diastolic flow'. This is an even more ominous feature and is associated with a much higher chance of imminent fetal death. Management will depend on gestational age. If the pregnancy is at 26 weeks or more then elective preterm delivery (with the attendant risks of prematurity) compared with continuing the pregnancy (and the high risk of fetal death) has to be discussed with the parents. If the pregnancy is less than 26 weeks the discussions are more difficult and the parents may opt for no intervention.</p>

Note: the left US image shows the UA with red and blue colours indicating blood flow. The right US image is the Doppler recording taken from that UA. The peak of the wave represents the peak of the systolic phase and the trough the diastolic phase of the fetal cardiac cycle respectively. In the normal fetoplacental circulation there is always forward flow even when the heart is not contracting because there is a low resistance to flow within the placental circulation. (B) Abnormal - absent end diastolic flow. Note: there is no forward flow during diastoly for most of the cardiac cycles. (C) Abnormal - reversed diastolic flow. Note: there is forward flow of blood in the UA during systoly but the direction of flow reverses in diastoly.</figcaption>

                        <h4>Fetal growth</h4>
                        <p>Fetal growth is best documented in pregnancy using serial US measurements of head (HC) and abdominal (AC) circumferences.</p>

                        <h5>Small fetuses</h5>
                        <p>Three patterns of suboptimal fetal growth are recognized. Once the AC is on or below the lowest centile, the fetus is termed 'small-for-dates'.</p>
                        <p>Figure 10.11A illustrates a constitutionally small fetus. Genetic factors contribute to this pattern. Typically the mother will be short and/or of Asian ethnicity. If multiparous, her previous baby(ies) may have been small. Whilst this fetus is not at such a high risk of complications as in the pathologically small fetus (see below), those risks are still greater compared to a normally grown fetus.</p>
                        <p>Figure 10.11B and C represent fetal growth patterns that are due to a pathological cause. They represent different points on the spectrum of fetal growth restriction. The asymmetrical type tends to occur later in pregnancy and is more commonly associated with conditions such as UPVD in the last trimester, whereas the symmetrical type tends to represent a pathological insult that operated from an early point in pregnancy, e.g. fetal abnormality, severe early onset pre-eclampsia. Both are associated with a higher risk of fetal death and hypoxia, preterm delivery and placental bleeding.</p>

                        <h4>Biophysical measurements</h4>
                        <p>The behaviour of a fetus is a useful indicator of his/her immediate wellbeing. With most fetal pathologies, these parameters are affected relatively late in the process. The five observations used in practice are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content"><strong>Fetal heart rate (FHR):</strong> this is recorded with a cardiotocograph (CTG) (as in labour). The maximum recording time is 40 minutes and in that time there should be at least 2 accelerations of the FHR by 15 beats/min or more and lasting for at least 15 seconds. The patterns of heart rate change are similar to those described in labour (see Chapter 11) with the difference that uterine activity is minimal and more emphasis is therefore placed on the interpretation of baseline heart rate. An example of a normal antenatal CTG is shown in Figure 10.13. This shows a baseline variability of more than 5 beats/min with accelerations and no decelerations. Figure 10.14 shows a normal baseline rate but reduced baseline variability.</span>

                        <p>The use of all five parameters in combination is called 'the biophysical profile' or 'score' (BPP or BPS). A normal response is for the fetus to exhibit at least 4 of these parameters in a period of up to 40 minutes (they may be seen in a much shorter period). The original BPS was recorded over 30 minutes but that did not take account of the possibility of normal fetal 'sleep' which can last up to 40 minutes and during which no movements, accelerations, or breathing may be seen, hence the change to an observation window of 40 minutes.</p>

Thus, if the BPS or CTG (acute measures of health) are abnormal and/or there is reversed end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery then delivery without delay is discussed with the parents. Where there is no abnormality in these parameters, then continued close monitoring could continue to 'gain' time in the pregnancy and allow the maternal administration of steroids.</span>

                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0; color: white;">
                                        <li>Fetal abnormality is found in: over 50% of conceptions; about 70% of miscarriages; 15% of deaths between 20 weeks and 1 year postnatal; 1–2% of births (major and minor anomalies); 8% of special needs register/disabled children.</li>
                                        <li>The overall UK incidence has fallen over the past 30y due to: Introduction of screening programmes in pregnancy; Greater success at diagnosis during pregnancy; Parents choosing pregnancy termination.</li>
                                        <li>The commonest four groups of defects are: Neural tube defects (3–7/1000 births); Congenital cardiac defects (6/1000 births); Down's syndrome (1.5/1000 births); Cleft lip/palate (1.5/1000 births).</li>
                                        <li>Screening for fetal abnormality can be undertaken: Clinically in early pregnancy (maternal age, drugs, history); Clinically in late pregnancy (uterine size, movements, lie); Using ultrasound (NT, anatomical survey); Biochemically.</li>
                                        <li>Balanced pre-test counselling is important. Options with an abnormal test include further assessment, specific interventions, termination, or continuation with surveillance.</li>

                                        <li>Surveillance in a high-risk pregnancy comprises tests depending on pathophysiology. The majority will have combined serial measurements of: Umbilical artery blood flow (Doppler); Fetal growth; Amniotic fluid volume; Biophysical parameters (heart rate, movements, tone, breathing).</li>
                                        <li>Interventions for non-specific risk: Elective delivery; Maternal administration of steroids.</li>
                                        <li>Interventions for specific risk (rare): Maternal anti-arrhythmic drugs; Fetal blood transfusion; Laser ablation for TTTS.</li>
