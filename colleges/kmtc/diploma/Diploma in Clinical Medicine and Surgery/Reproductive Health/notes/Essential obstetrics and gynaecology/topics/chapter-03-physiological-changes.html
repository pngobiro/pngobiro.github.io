                    <p>Many maternal adaptations to pregnancy, such as an increased heart rate and renal blood flow, are initiated in the luteal phase of every ovulatory cycle, and are thus proactive rather than reactive, simply being amplified during the first trimester should conception occur. This suggests very strongly that they are driven by progesterone. All physiological systems are affected to some degree and will also vary within a physiological range because of factors such as age, parity, multiple pregnancy, socioeconomic status and race.</p>
                    <p>From a teleological point of view, there are two main reasons for these changes:</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Pregnancy defies the laws of transplant immunology. The fetus is an allograft that, according to the laws that protect 'self' from 'non-self', 'should' be rejected by the mother. Furthermore, the mother continues to respond to and destroy other foreign antigens and confers passive immunity to the newborn while not rejecting the fetus. The uterus is not an immunologically privileged site, because other tissues implanted in the uterus are rejected.</p>
                            <p>Protection has to occur from the time of implantation when the endometrium decidualizes. The decidua contains all the common immunological cell types, e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages, but it also contains additional cell types, e.g. large granular lymphocytes. Only two types of fetoplacental tissue come into direct contact with maternal tissues: the villous and extravillous trophoblast (EVT), and there are effectively no systemic maternal T- or B-cell responses to trophoblast cells in humans. The villous trophoblast, which is bathed by maternal blood, seems to be immunologically inert and never expresses human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I or class II molecules. EVT, which is directly in contact with endometrial/decidual tissues, does not express the major T-cell ligands, HLA-A or HLA-B but does express the HLA class I trophoblast-specific HLA-G, which is strongly immunosuppressive, HLA-C and HLA-E.</p>
                            <p>The main type of decidual lymphocytes are the uterine natural killer (NK) cells, which differ from those in the systemic circulation. They express surface killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which bind to HLA-C and HLA-G on trophoblast. The KIRs are highly polymorphic, with two main classes: the KIR-A (nonactivating) and KIR-B (multiply activating). HLA-E and HLA-G are effectively monomorphic, but HLA-C is polymorphic, with two main groups: the HLA-C1 and the HLA-C2. Thus the very polymorphic KIR in maternal tissues and the polymorphic HLA-C in the fetus make up a potentially very variable receptor-ligand system. It has been shown that if the maternal KIR haplotype is AA, and the trophoblast expresses any HLA-C2, then the possibility of miscarriage or pre-eclampsia, both associated with shallow invasion, is significantly increased. However, even one KIR-B provides protection. HLA-C2 is highly inhibitory to trophoblast migration, and thus appears to need 'activating KIR' to overcome it.</p>
                            <p>A population of NK-derived, CD56<sup>+</sup> granulated lymphocytes is found in first trimester decidua. They release transforming growth factor-$\beta 2$, which also has immunosuppressive activity.</p>
                            <p>The fetus expresses paternal antigens and these can stimulate the production of maternal antibodies. Conversely, maternal antibodies are present in the fetus, confirming that the placenta is not an impermeable immunological barrier. Pregnancy may also induce blocking antibodies, but these do not appear to be vital to the continuation of pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>While the fetus needs to avoid attack, this carries a cost as the partly suppressed immune state in pregnancy makes both new infections, parasitic diseases, e.g. malaria, and reactivation of latent virus potentially more dangerous. Infections are involved in some $40 \%$ of premature deliveries. The placental and decidual cells express most toll-like receptors (TLRs), and when there is TLR-ligand activation, various cytokines and chemokines, such as the interleukins, are expressed.</p>
                            <p>The thymus shows some reversible involution during pregnancy, apparently caused by the progesterone-driven exodus of lymphocytes from the thymic cortex and the Th1:Th2 cytokine ratio shifts towards Th2. Conversely, the spleen enlarges during pregnancy possibly due to the accelerated production of erythrocytes and immunoglobulin-producing cells. The lymph nodes in the para-aortic chain draining the uterus may increase in size, although the germinal centres of these nodes may shrink with the shrinkage reversing after delivery.</p>

                            <p>The non-pregnant uterus weighs $\sim 40-100 \mathrm{~g}$, increasing during pregnancy to $300-400 \mathrm{~g}$ at 20 weeks and $800-$ 1000 g at term. Involution is rapid over the first 2 weeks after delivery, but slows thereafter and is not complete by 2 months. The uterus consists of bundles of smooth muscle cells separated by thin sheets of connective tissue composed of collagen, elastic fibres and fibroblasts. All hypertrophy during pregnancy. The muscle cells are arranged as an innermost longitudinal layer, a middle layer with bundles running in all directions and an outermost layer of both circular and longitudinal fibres partly continuous with the ligamentous supports of the uterus (Fig. 3.1). Myometrial growth is almost entirely due to muscle hypertrophy and elongation of the cells from $50 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in the non-pregnant state to $200-600 \mu \mathrm{m}$ at term, although some hyperplasia may occur during early pregnancy. The stimulus for myometrial growth and development is the effect of the growing conceptus and oestrogens and progesterone.</p>
                            <p>The uterus is functionally and morphologically divided into three sections: the cervix, the isthmus and the body of the uterus (corpus uteri).</p>

                            <p>The cervix is predominantly a fibrous organ with only $10 \%$ of uterine muscle cells in the substance of the cervix. Eighty percent of the total protein in the non-pregnant state consists of collagen, but by the end of pregnancy the concentration of collagen is reduced to one-third of the amount present in the non-pregnant state. The principal function of the cervix is to retain the conceptus (Fig. 3.2).</p>

                            <p>The isthmus of the uterus is the junctional zone between the cervix and the body of the uterus. It joins the muscle fibres of the corpus to the dense connective tissue of the cervix both functionally and structurally. By the 28th week of gestation, regular contractions produce some stretching and thinning of the isthmus, resulting in the early formation of the lower uterine segment.</p>
                            <p>The lower segment is fully formed during labour and is a thin, relatively inert part of the uterus. It contributes little to the expulsive efforts of the uterus and becomes in effect an extension of the birth canal. Because of its relative avascularity and quiescence in the puerperium, it is the site of choice for the incision for a caesarean delivery.</p>

                            <p>The final vessels delivering blood to the intervillous space (Fig. 3.3) are the 100-150 spiral arterioles. Two or three spiral arterioles arise from each radial artery and each placental cotyledon is provided with one or two. The remodelling of these spiral arteries is very important for successful pregnancy. Cytotrophoblast differentiates into villous or EVT. The latter can differentiate further into invasive EVT, which in turn is interstitial, migrating into the decidua and later differentiating into myometrial giant cells, or endovascular that invade the lumen of the spiral arteries. The intrauterine oxygen tension is very low in the first trimester, stimulating EVT invasion.</p>
                            <p>In the first 10 weeks of normal pregnancy, EVT invades the decidua and the walls of the spiral arterioles, destroying the smooth muscle in the wall of the vessels, which then become inert channels unresponsive to humoral and neurological control (Fig. 3.4). From 10-16 weeks, a further wave of invasion occurs, extending down the lumen of the decidual portion of the vessel; from 16-24 weeks this invasion extends to involve the myometrial portion of the spiral arterioles. The net effect of these changes is to turn the spiral arterioles into flaccid sinusoidal channels.</p>
                            <p>Failure of this process, particularly in the myometrial portion of the vessels, means that this portion of the vessels remains sensitive to vasoactive stimuli with a consequent reduction in blood flow. This is a feature of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction with or without pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <p>The uterus has both afferent and efferent nerve supplies, although it can function normally in a denervated state. The main sensory fibres from the cervix arise from S1 and S2, whereas those from the body of the uterus arise from the dorsal nerve routes on T11 and T12. There is an afferent pathway from the cervix to the hypothalamus so that stretching of the cervix and upper vagina stimulates the release of oxytocin (Ferguson's reflex). The cervical and uterine vessels are well supplied by adrenergic nerves, whereas cholinergic nerves are confined to the blood vessels of the cervix.</p>

                            <p>The continuation of successful pregnancy depends on the fact that the myometrium remains quiescent until the fetus is mature and capable of sustaining extrauterine life. Pregnant myometrium has a much greater compliance than non-pregnant myometrium in response to distension. Thus, although the uterus becomes distended by the growing conceptus, intrauterine pressure does not increase, although the uterus does maintain the capacity to develop maximal active tension. Progesterone maintains quiescence by increasing the resting membrane potential of the myometrial cells while at the same time impairing the conduction of electrical activity and limiting muscle activity to small clumps of cells. Progesterone antagonists such as mifepristone can induce labour from the first trimester, as can prostaglandin $\mathrm{F}_{2 \alpha}$, which is luteolytic. Other mechanisms include locally generated nitric oxide, probably acting through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) or voltage-gated potassium channels, while several relaxatory hormones such as prostacyclin $\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, prostaglandin $\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{2}\right)$ and calcitonin gene-related peptide, which act through the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ receptors, increase in pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3 id="development-myometrial-activity">The development of myometrial activity</h3>
                            <p>The myometrium functions as a syncytium so that contractions can pass through the gap junctions linking the cells and produce coordinated waves of contractions. Uterine activity occurs throughout pregnancy and is measurable as early as 7 weeks gestation, with frequent, low intensity contractions. As the second trimester proceeds, contractions increase in intensity but remain of relatively low frequency. In the third trimester they increase in both frequency and intensity, leading up to the first stage of labour. Contractions during pregnancy are usually painless and are felt as 'tightenings' (Braxton Hicks contractions) but may sometimes be sufficiently powerful to produce discomfort. They do not produce cervical dilatation, which occurs with the onset of labour.</p>
                            <p>In late gestation, the fetus continues to grow, but the uterus stops growing, so tension across the uterine wall increases. This stimulates expression of a variety of gene products such as oxytocin and prostaglandin $\mathrm{F}_{2 \alpha}$ receptors, sodium channels and the gap junction protein. Proinflammatory cytokine expression also increases. Once labour has begun, the contractions in the late first stage may reach pressures up to 100 mmHg and occur every $2-3$ minutes (Fig. 3.5). See Chapter 11 for a discussion of labour and delivery.</p>

                            <p>The vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which hypertrophies during pregnancy. The three layers of superficial, intermediate and basal cells change their relative proportions so that the intermediate cells predominate and can be seen in the cell population of normal vaginal secretions. The musculature in the vaginal wall also becomes hypertrophic. As in the cervix, the connective tissue collagen decreases, while water and glycosaminoglycans increase. The rich venous vascular network in the vaginal walls becomes engorged and gives rise to a slightly bluish appearance.</p>
                            <p>Epithelial cells generally multiply and enlarge and become filled with vacuoles rich in glycogen. High oestrogen levels stimulate glycogen synthesis and deposition and, as these epithelial cells are shed into the vagina, lactobacilli known as Döderlein's bacilli break down the glycogen to produce lactic acid. The vaginal pH falls in pregnancy to $3.5-4.0$ and this acid environment serves to keep the vagina clear of bacterial infection. Unfortunately, yeast infections may thrive in this environment and Candida infections are common in pregnancy.</p>

                            <h3 id="cardiac-position">Cardiac position and size</h3>
                            <p>As the uterus grows, the diaphragm is pushed upwards and the heart is correspondingly displaced: the apex of the heart is displaced upwards and left laterally, with a deviation of $\sim 15 \%$. Radiologically, the upper left cardiac border is straightened with increased prominence of the pulmonary conus. These changes result in an inverted T wave in lead III and a Q wave in leads III and aVF.</p>
                            <p>The heart enlarges by $70-80 \mathrm{~mL}$, some $12 \%$, between early and late pregnancy, due to a small increase in wall thickness but predominantly to increased venous filling. The increase in ventricular volume results in dilatation of the valve rings and hence an increase in regurgitant flow velocities. Myocardial contractility is increased during pregnancy, as indicated by shortening of the pre-ejection period, and this is associated with lengthening of the myocardial muscle fibres.</p>

                            <h3 id="cardiac-output">Cardiac output</h3>
                            <p>Non-invasive methods, such as echocardiography, are now available, allowing standardized sequential studies of cardiac output throughout pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>There is a small rise in heart rate during the luteal phase increasing to $10-15$ beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ by mid-pregnancy; this may be related to the progesterone-driven hyperventilation (see below). There is probably a fall in baroreflex sensitivity as pregnancy progresses and heart rate variability falls. Stroke volume rises a little later in the first trimester than heart rate, increasing from about 64 to 71 mL during pregnancy. Women who have an artificial pacemaker and thus a fixed heart rate compensate well in pregnancy on the basis of increased stroke volume alone.</p>
                            <p>These two factors push the cardiac output up. Most of the rise in cardiac output occurs in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, with an increase of 1.5 L from 4.5 to $6.0 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. The non-labouring change in cardiac output is $35-40 \%$ in a first pregnancy, and $\sim 50 \%$ in later pregnancies. Twin pregnancies are associated with a $15 \%$ greater increase throughout pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Cardiac output can rise by another third ($\sim 2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$) in labour. The cardiac output remains high for $\sim 24 \mathrm{~h}$ postpartum and then gradually declines to non-pregnant levels by $\sim 2$ weeks after delivery.</p>
                            <p>Table 3.1 summarizes the percentage changes in some cardiovascular variables during pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Pregnancy imposes a significant increase in cardiac output and is likely to precipitate heart failure in women with heart disease.</p>

                            <h3 id="total-peripheral-resistance">Total peripheral resistance</h3>
                            <p>Total peripheral resistance (TPR) is not measured directly, but is calculated from the mean arterial pressure divided by cardiac output. The total peripheral resistance has fallen by 6 weeks gestation, so afterload falls. This is 'perceived' as circulatory underfilling, which is thought to be one of the primary stimuli to the mother's circulatory adaptations. It activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and allows the necessary expansion of the plasma volume (PV; see below: Renal function). In a normotensive non-pregnant woman the TPR is around $1700 \mathrm{dyn} / \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}$; this falls to a nadir of $40-50 \%$ by midgestation, rising slowly thereafter towards term, reaching $1200-1300 \mathrm{dyn} / \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{cm}$ in late pregnancy. The fall in systemic TPR is partly associated with the expansion of the vascular space in the uteroplacental bed and the renal vasculature in particular; blood flow to the skin is also greatly increased in pregnancy as a result of vasodilatation.</p>
                            <p>The vasodilatation that causes the fall in TPR is not due to a withdrawal of sympathetic tone, but is hormonally driven by a major shift in the balance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator hormones, towards the latter. The vasodilators involved in early gestation include circulating $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ and locally synthesised nitric oxide, and later, atrial natriuretic peptide. There is also a loss of pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II (AngII), concentrations of which rise markedly (see: Endocrinology). The balance between vasodilatation and vasoconstriction in pregnancy is a critical determinant of blood pressure and lies at the heart of the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <h3 id="arterial-blood-pressure">Arterial blood pressure</h3>
                            <p>Blood pressure changes occur during the menstrual cycle. Systolic blood pressure increases during the luteal phase of the cycle and reaches its peak at the onset of menstruation, whereas diastolic pressure is $5 \%$ lower during the luteal phase than in the follicular phase of the cycle.</p>
                            <p>The fall in TPR during the first half of pregnancy causes a fall of some 10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure; $80 \%$ of this fall occurs in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. Thereafter, a small additional fall occurs until arterial pressure reaches its nadir by $16-24$ weeks gestation. It rises again after this, and may return to early pregnancy levels. The rate of rise is amplified in women who go on to develop pre-eclampsia.</p>
                            <p>Posture has a significant effect on blood pressure in pregnancy; pressure is lowest with the woman lying supine on her left side. The pressure falls during gestation in a similar way whether the pressure is recorded sitting, lying supine or in the left lateral supine position, but the levels are significantly different (Fig. 3.7). This means that mothers attending for antenatal visits must have their blood pressure recorded in the same position at each visit if the pressures are to be comparable. Special care must be taken to use an appropriate cuff size for the measurement of brachial pressures. This is especially important with the increasing incidence of obesity among young women. The gap between the fourth and fifth Korotkoff sounds widens in pregnancy, and the fifth Korotkoff sound may be difficult to define. Both these factors may cause discrepancies in the measurement of diastolic pressure in pregnancy. Although most published studies of blood pressure are based on the use of Korotkoff fourth sound, it is now recommended to use the fifth sound where it is clear and the fourth sound only where the point of disappearance is unclear. Automated sphygmomanometers are unsuitable for use in pregnancy when the blood pressure is raised, as in pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <p>Profound falls in blood pressure may occur in late pregnancy when the mother lies on her back. This phenomenon is described as the supine hypotension syndrome. It results from the restriction of venous return from the lower limbs due to compression of the inferior vena cava and hence a fall in stroke volume. It must be remembered that aortic compression also occurs and that this will result in conspicuous differences between brachial and femoral blood pressures in pregnancy. When a woman turns from a supine to a lateral position in late pregnancy, the blood pressure may fall by $15 \%$, although some of this fall is a measurement artefact caused by the raising of the right arm above the level of the heart.</p>
                            <p>There is progressive venodilatation and rises in venous distensibility and capacitance throughout a normal pregnancy. Central venous pressure and pressure in the upper arms remain constant in pregnancy, but the venous pressure in the lower circulation rises progressively on standing, sitting or lying supine because of pressure from the uterus and the fetal presenting part in late pregnancy. The pulmonary circulation can absorb high rates of flow without an increase in pressure so pressure in the right ventricle, and the pulmonary arteries and capillaries, does not change. Pulmonary resistance falls in early pregnancy, and does not change thereafter.</p>

                            <p>Blood volume is a measurement of plasma volume and red cell mass. The indices are under separate control mechanisms. Plasma volume changes are considered below (see: Renal function).</p>

                            <h3 id="erythrocytes">Erythrocytes</h3>
                            <p>There is a steady increase in red cell mass in pregnancy and the increase appears to be linear throughout pregnancy. Both cell number and cell size increase. The circulating red cell mass rises from around 1400 mL in non-pregnant women, to $\sim 1700 \mathrm{~mL}$ during pregnancy in women who do not take iron supplements. It rises more in women with multiple pregnancies, and substantially more with iron supplementation ($\sim 29 \%$ compared with 18%). Erythropoietin rises in pregnancy, more if iron supplementation is not taken ($55 \%$ compared with $25 \%$) but the changes in red cell mass antedate this; human placental lactogen may stimulate haematopoiesis.</p>
                            <p>Haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit and red cell count fall during pregnancy because the plasma volume rises proportionately more than the red cell mass ('physiological anaemia', see Table 9.1). However, in normal pregnancy the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration remains constant. Serum iron concentration falls but the absorption of iron from the gut rises and iron-binding capacity rises in a normal pregnancy, since there is increased synthesis of the $\beta 1$-globulin, transferrin. Maternal dietary iron requirements more than double. Plasma folate concentration halves by term, because of greater renal clearance, although red cell folate concentrations fall less. In the late 1990s, 20% of the female population aged 16-64 years in the UK was estimated to have serum ferritin levels below $15 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$, indicating low iron stores; no similar survey appears to have been undertaken since then. Pregnant adolescents seem to be at particular risk of iron deficiency. Even relatively mild maternal anaemia is associated with increased placental: birth weight ratios and decreased birth weight.</p>

                            <h3 id="white-cells">The white cells</h3>
                            <p>The total white cell count rises during pregnancy. This increase is mainly due to an increase in neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes that peaks at 30 weeks' gestation (Fig. 3.8). A further massive neutrophilia normally occurs during labour and immediately after delivery, with a fourfold increase in the number of polymorphs.</p>

                            <p>There is also an increase in the metabolic activity of granulocytes during pregnancy, which may result from the action of oestrogens. This can be seen in the normal menstrual cycle where the neutrophil count rises with the oestrogen peak in mid-cycle. Eosinophils, basophils and monocytes remain relatively constant during pregnancy, but there is a profound fall in eosinophils during labour and they are virtually absent at delivery. The lymphocyte count remains constant and the numbers of T and B cells do not alter, but lymphocyte function and cell-mediated immunity in particular are depressed, possibly by the increase in concentrations of glycoproteins coating the surface of the lymphocytes, reducing the response to stimuli. There is, however, no evidence of suppression of humoral immunity or the production of immunoglobulins.</p>

                            <p>Longitudinal studies show a significant fall in platelet count during pregnancy. The fall in platelet numbers may be a dilutional effect, but the substantial increase in platelet volume from $\sim 28$ weeks suggests that there is increased destruction of platelets in pregnancy with an increase in the number of larger and younger platelets in the circulation. Platelet reactivity is increased in the second and third trimesters and does not return to normal until $\sim 12$ weeks after delivery.</p>

                            <p>There are major changes in the coagulation system in pregnancy, with an increased tendency towards clotting (Box 3.1). In a situation where haemorrhage from the uterine vascular bed may be sudden, profuse and life-threatening, the increase in coagulability may play a life-saving role.</p>

Factors VII, VIII, VIII:C, X and IX (Christmas factor) all increase during pregnancy, whereas factors II and V tend to remain constant. Factor XI falls to $60-70 \%$ of the nonpregnant values and concentrations of factor XIII fall by $50 \%$.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate rises early in pregnancy, mainly due to the increase in fibrinogen. An estimated $5-10 \%$ of the total circulating fibrinogen is consumed during placental separation, and thromboembolism is one of the main causes of maternal death in the UK. On the other hand, there is a reduction in plasma fibrinolytic activity during pregnancy; the rapid return to non-pregnant levels of activity within 1 hour of delivery suggests that this inhibition is mediated through the placenta.</p>

Although there is upward pressure on the diaphragm in late pregnancy, the costal changes occur well before they could be attributed to pressure from the enlarging uterus. Nevertheless, breathing in pregnancy is more diaphragmatic than costal.</p>
                            <p>Vital capacity describes the maximum amount of gas that can be expired after maximum inspiration. Since residual volume decreases slightly in pregnancy (Fig. 3.10), vital capacity increases slightly. Vital capacity is related to body weight and is reduced by obesity. Inspiratory capacity measures tidal volume plus inspiratory reserve volume. It increases progressively during pregnancy by $\sim 300 \mathrm{~mL}$ while residual volume decreases by about 300 mL. This improves gas mixing. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second $\left(\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right)$ and peak expiratory flow remain constant in pregnancy and women with asthma do not appear to be affected by pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>Progesterone sensitizes the medulla oblongata to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and so stimulates some overbreathing in the luteal phase and pregnancy. Respiratory rate remains constant during pregnancy at $14-15$ breaths/min, whereas tidal volume increases from about 500 mL in the non-pregnant state to about 700 mL in late pregnancy. Thus there is $\sim 40 \%$ increase during pregnancy, so the minute ventilation (the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate) also increases by $40 \%$, from about 7.5 to $10.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.
Because of the increase in minute ventilation and the effect of progesterone increasing the level of carbonic anhydrase B in red cells, arterial $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ falls in pregnancy. At the same time, there is a fall in plasma bicarbonate concentration and the arterial pH therefore remains constant. Carbon dioxide production rises sharply during the third trimester, as fetal metabolism increases. The low maternal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ allows more efficient placental transfer of carbon dioxide from the fetus.
The increased alveolar ventilation results in a small $(\sim 5 \%)$ rise in maternal $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$. This increase is offset by the rightward shift of the maternal oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve caused by an increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in the erythrocytes. This facilitates oxygen unloading to the fetus, which has both a much lower $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and a marked leftwards shift of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, due to the lower sensitivity of fetal haemoglobin to 2,3-DPG.
There is an increase of $\sim 16 \%$ in oxygen consumption by term, due to increasing maternal and fetal demands. Since the increase in oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (see above) is $\sim 18 \%$, there is actually a fall in arterio-venous oxygen difference.</p>
                            <p>Overall, respiratory diseases and especially obstructive airway diseases have far fewer implications for the mother's health than cardiac disorders, with the exception of conditions such as severe kyphoscoliosis where the lung space is severely restricted.</p>
                            <p>Pregnancy does not generally impose any increased risk on women with respiratory disease.</p>

                            <p>Renal parenchymal volume increases by $70 \%$ by the third trimester and there is marked dilatation of the calyces, renal pelvis and ureters in most women. This, together with the expansion of vascular volume, results in increased renal size. The changes occur in the first trimester under the influence of progesterone rather than the effect of back-pressure. This is physiological. However, the ureteric dilatation ends at the pelvic brim, suggesting that there may be some effect from back pressure in later pregnancy. These changes are invariably more pronounced on the right side, suggesting an anatomical contribution. The ureters are not hypotonic or hypomotile and there is hypertrophy of the ureteral smooth muscle and hyperplasia of the connective tissue. Vesicoureteric reflux occurs sporadically and the combination of reflux and ureteric dilatation is associated with a high incidence of urinary stasis and urinary tract infection.</p>

                            <p>Both renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increase during an ovulatory menstrual cycle, and this increase is maintained should conception occur. Renal blood flow increases by $50-80 \%$ in the first trimester, is maintained at these levels during the second trimester, and falls by $\sim 15 \%$ thereafter (Fig. 3.11). Creatinine clearance is a useful indicator of GFR but gives values that are significantly less than those obtained by inulin clearance (gold standard). The 24-hour creatinine clearance has increased by $25 \% 4$ weeks after the last menstrual period and by $45 \%$ at 9 weeks. In the third trimester, there is some decrease towards non-pregnant values, but less than the fall in RBF. The filtration fraction thus falls in the first trimester, is stable in the second, and rises towards nonpregnant values towards term.</p>

                            <p>Water retention must occur to allow the increase in plasma volume. The osmotic threshold for drinking falls between weeks 4 and 6, which stimulates water intake and thus dilution of body fluids. There is a marked fall in plasma osmolality ($\sim 10 \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$). However, arginine vasopressin (AVP) continues to circulate at concentrations that allow water to be reabsorbed in the renal medullary collecting ducts until the $P_{\text {osm }}$ falls below the new osmotic thirst threshold, when a new steady state is established. Water retention is facilitated by the sodium retention of pregnancy (see below). Standing upright is significantly more antidiuretic than in non-pregnant subjects.</p>
                            <p>Plasma volume increases in pregnancy to a peak between 32 and 34 weeks, from a non-pregnant level of 2600 mL. The total increase is $\sim 50 \%$ in a first pregnancy and $60 \%$ in a second or subsequent pregnancy. The bigger the expansion is, the bigger, on average, the birth weight of the baby. The total extracellular fluid volume rises by about $16 \%$ by term, so the percentage rise in plasma volume is disproportionately large. Multiple pregnancies are associated with a significantly higher increase in plasma volume and pregnancies exhibiting impaired fetal growth are associated with a poor increase in plasma volume.</p>
                            <p>The marked increase in GFR, and the expansion of the plasma volume, mean that plasma concentrations of a variety of solutes, such as creatinine and urea, fall in normal pregnancy. This should be remembered when interpreting laboratory reports.</p>
                            <p>The filtered load of sodium increases by $5000-10000 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day because of the increase in the GFR. Tubular reabsorption increases in parallel with the GFR (see: Renin-angiotensin system, below), with the retention of $3-5 \mathrm{mmol}$ of sodium per day into the fetal and maternal stores. The total net sodium gain amounts to 950 mmol mainly stored in the maternal compartment. However, the plasma concentration of sodium falls slightly in pregnancy, because of the marked rise in plasma volume. A similar change occurs with potassium ions, with a net gain of approximately 350 mmol.</p>
                            <p>Renal tubular function also changes significantly during pregnancy. Uric acid is freely filtered through the glomerulus, but most is later reabsorbed. However, in pregnancy, uric acid filtration doubles, following the GFR, and there is a decrease in net tubular reabsorption, so serum uric acid concentrations fall by $25 \%$ to mid-pregnancy. The normal values in pregnancy range from $148-298 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$, with an upper limit of $\sim 330 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. In later gestation, the kidney excretes a progressively smaller proportion of the filtered uric acid, so some rise in serum uric acid concentration during the second half of pregnancy is normal. A similar pattern is seen in relation to urea, which is also partly reabsorbed in the nephron.</p>
                            <p>Glucose excretion increases during pregnancy and intermittent glycosuria is common in normal pregnancy, unrelated to blood glucose levels. Tubular reabsorption is probably less complete during pregnancy. The excretion of other sugars, such as lactose and fructose is also increased.</p>
                            <p>Glycosuria is a feature of normal pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The tubular reabsorption of calcium is enhanced, presumably under the influence of the increased concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Even so, urinary calcium excretion is two- to threefold higher in normal pregnancy than in the non-pregnant woman. Renal bicarbonate reabsorption and hydrogen ion excretion appear to be unaltered during pregnancy. Although pregnant women can acidify their urine, it is usually mildly alkaline.</p>
                            <p>Both total protein and albumin excretion rise during pregnancy, to at least 36 weeks. Thus in late pregnancy, an upper limit of normal of 200 mg total protein excretion/ 24 h collection is accepted. Using dipsticks to assess proteinuria in pregnancy gives highly variable data.</p>

Decreased motility also occurs in both the small and large bowel and the colonic absorption of water and sodium is increased, leading to a greater likelihood of constipation. Heartburn is common, and may be related to the displacement of the lower oesophageal sphincter through the diaphragm and its decreased response as the intra-abdominal pressure rises.

                            <p>Glucose is the major substrate for fetal growth and nutrition, so carbohydrate metabolism in pregnancy is very important for fetal development. Neither the absorption of glucose from the gut nor the half-life of insulin seem to change. However, by 6-12 weeks gestation, fasting plasma glucose concentrations have fallen to about $0.5-$ $1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ lower than non-pregnant values; fetal concentrations run $\sim 20 \%$ lower than this. The mother's plasma insulin concentrations rise. By the end of the first trimester the increase in blood glucose following a carbohydrate load is less than outside pregnancy (Fig. 3.12). Pregnant women develop insulin resistance, so any given glucose challenge will produce extra insulin, which does not reduce the blood glucose levels as quickly as the response in non-pregnant women. The insulin resistance is hormonally driven, possibly via human placental lactogen or cortisol. The management of the pregnant woman with diabetes is discussed in Chapter 9.</p>

During early pregnancy there is a normal plasma insulin response with a relative reduction in plasma glucose concentrations compared to the non-pregnant state. However, during late pregnancy, plasma glucose concentrations reach higher levels after a delay, despite a considerably enhanced plasma insulin response, a pattern that could be explained by relative resistance to insulin.

                            <p>As well as moving glucose into the cells, insulin reduces the circulating level of amino acids and free fatty acids (see below: Endocrinology).</p>

                            <h3 id="changes-in-plasma-proteins">Changes in plasma proteins</h3>
                            <p>The total protein concentration falls by about $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ during the first trimester from 7 to $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, even though there is increased nitrogen retention. This is partly due to the increased insulin concentrations, but also because of placental uptake and transfer of amino acids to the fetus for gluconeogenesis and protein synthesis. This fall is largely proportional to the fall in albumin concentration and is associated with a corresponding fall in colloid osmotic pressure. The fall is insufficient to affect drugcarrying capacity.</p>

                            <h3 id="amino-acids">Amino acids</h3>
                            <p>With the exception of alanine and glutamic acid, amino acid levels in maternal plasma decrease below nonpregnant values. There is active transport of amino acids to the fetus as building blocks for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis.</p>

                            <h3 id="lipids">Lipids</h3>
                            <p>The total serum lipid concentration rises from about 600 to 1000 mg per 100 mL. The greatest changes are the approximate threefold increases in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and a $50 \%$ increase in VLDL cholesterol by 36 weeks. Levels of free fatty acids are particularly unstable in pregnancy and may be affected by fasting, exertion, emotional stress and smoking. The levels are consistently raised above non-pregnant and early pregnancy values in late pregnancy. Birth weight and placental weight are directly related to maternal VLDL triglyceride levels at term.</p>
                            <p>The hyperlipidaemia of normal pregnancy is not atherogenic, although pregnancy can unmask pathological hyperlipidaemia. Mothers are usually protected from the potentially harmful effects of increasing lipid peroxidation in pregnancy by an increase in endogenous antioxidants, although this may be inadequate in pre-eclampsia. An adequate dietary intake of antioxidants such as vitamin A, the carotenoids and provitamin A carotenoids is also needed. Levels of fat-soluble vitamins rise in pregnancy whereas levels of water-soluble vitamins tend to fall.</p>
                            <p>Fat is deposited early in pregnancy. It is also used as a source of energy, mainly by the mother from mid to late pregnancy for her high metabolic demands and those of lactation, so that glucose is available for the growing fetus. Total fat accretion is $\sim 2-6 \mathrm{~kg}$, mainly laid down in the second trimester, and is regulated by the hormone leptin. It is deposited mainly over the back, the upper thighs, the buttocks and the abdominal wall.</p>

                            <p>Maternal total plasma calcium falls, because albumin concentration falls, but unbound ionized calcium is unchanged. Synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol increases, promoting enhanced gastrointestinal calcium absorption, which doubles by 24 weeks, after which it stabilizes.</p>

                            <p>Pregnancy is an anabolic state. The average weight gain over pregnancy in a woman of normal BMI is $\sim 12.5 \mathrm{~kg}$. Many women during the first trimester do not gain any weight because of reduced food intake associated with loss of appetite and morning sickness. However, in normal pregnancy, the average weight gain is $0.3 \mathrm{~kg} /$ week up to 18 weeks, $0.5 \mathrm{~kg} /$ week from 18 to 28 weeks and thereafter a slight reduction with a rate of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{~kg} /$ week until term (Fig. 3.13). The range of maternal weight gain in normal pregnancy may vary from near zero to twice the mean weight gain as a result of variation in the multiple contributory factors. The basal metabolic rate rises by $\sim 5 \%$ by the end of pregnancy in a woman of normal weight. Figure 3.14 summarizes the relative maternal and fetal contributions to weight gain at term.</p>

                            <p>Much of this weight increase in all systems arises from the retention of water; the mean total increase is $\sim 8.5 \mathrm{~L}$, which is the same in primigravid and multiparous women. The increased hydration of connective tissue results in laxity of the joints, particularly in the pelvic ligaments and the pubic symphysis. Tissues such as the uterus and breasts increase in size.</p>
                            <p>High weight gain is commonly associated with oedema and fluid retention. However, overall weight gain has a positive association with birth weight, although this may actually relate to the underlying rise in plasma volume. Although acute excessive weight gain may be associated with the development of pre-eclampsia, mild oedema is associated with a good fetal outcome.</p>
                            <p>Far more sinister is failure to gain weight, which may be associated with reduced amniotic fluid volume, small placental size, impaired fetal growth and an adverse outcome.</p>
                            <p>Acute excess weight gain indicates fluid retention. Poor weight gain is associated with fetal growth restriction.</p>
                            <p>No more protein is laid down than can be accounted for by fetal and placental growth and by the increase in size in specific target organs such as the uterus and the breasts.</p>
                            <p>Between $20 \%$ and $40 \%$ of pregnant women in Europe are gaining more weight than recommended. Surprisingly, the correlation between energy intake and maternal weight gain is poor and it is generally not advisable to attempt to promote weight loss in pregnancy, as it may result in a parallel restriction of essential nutrients which in turn may have undesirable effects on fetal growth and development.</p>

                            <h3 id="postpartum-weight">Postpartum weight</h3>
                            <p>Immediately following delivery, there is a weight loss of $\sim 6 \mathrm{~kg}$, which is accounted for by water and fluid loss and by the loss of the products of conception. Diuresis occurs during the early puerperium, removing the water retained during pregnancy. From $\sim$ day 3, body weight falls by $\sim 0.3 \mathrm{~kg} /$ day until day 10, stabilizing by week 10 at $\sim 2.3 \mathrm{~kg}$ above pre-pregnancy weight, or 0.7 kg in women who are continuing to lactate. By $6-18$ months after delivery, $1-2 \mathrm{~kg}$ of pregnancy-related weight gain will still be retained, but in about one-fifth of women 5 kg or more can be retained. Obese women usually put on less weight during pregnancy, but retain more postpartum.</p>
                            <p>Weight gain is about 0.9 kg less in multigravidae than in primigravidae. However, a 5-year follow-up of nearly 3000 women found that parous women gained 2.3 kg more than nulliparae during this time.</p>

                            <p>The areola contains sebaceous glands that hypertrophy during pregnancy (Montgomery's tubercles). The areola is richly supplied with sensory nerves which ensures that suckling sends impulses to the hypothalamus and thus stimulates the release of oxytocin from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland and the expulsion of milk.</p>

                            <p>High oestrogen concentrations, with growth hormone and glucocorticoids, stimulate ductal proliferation during pregnancy (Fig. 3.15). Alveolar growth is stimulated in the oestrogen-primed breast by progesterone and prolactin. Secretory activity is initiated during pregnancy and is promoted by prolactin and placental lactogen so that from 3 to 4 months onwards and for the first 30 hours after delivery, a thick, glossy, protein-rich fluid known as colostrum can be expressed from the breast. However, full lactation is inhibited during pregnancy by the high levels of oestrogen and progesterone that block the alveolar transcription of $\alpha$-lactalbumin.</p>

                            <p>Prolactin acts directly on alveolar cells to stimulate the synthesis of all milk components including casein, lactalbumin and fatty acids. The sudden reduction of progesterone and oestrogen levels following parturition allows prolactin to act in an uninhibited manner and its release is promoted by suckling, with the development of the full flow of milk by day 5 and a further gradual increase over the next 3 weeks. Some $500-1000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of milk are produced daily, and the mother needs about 500 kcal extra per day to maintain this; a further $250 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day are derived from the maternal fat stores. The administration of a dopamine agonist such as bromocriptine inhibits the release of prolactin and abolishes milk production.</p>
                            <p>Suckling also promotes the release of oxytocin from specialized neurones in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and this in turn results in the milk-ejection reflex as the oxytocin stimulates the myoepithelial cells to contract. The milk-ejection reflex can also be stimulated by the mother seeing the infant or hearing its cry or just thinking about feeding! It may also be inhibited by catecholamine release or by adverse emotional and environmental factors.</p>

                            <p>The characteristic feature of skin changes in pregnancy are the appearance of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-stimulated pigmentation on the face, known as chloasma, the areola of the nipples and the linea alba of the anterior abdominal wall, giving rise to the linea nigra. Stretch marks (striae gravidarum) predominantly occur in the lines of stress of the abdominal wall, but also occur on the lateral aspects of the thighs and breasts. Striae gravidarum result from the disruption of collagen fibres in the subcuticular zone and are related more to the increased production of adrenocortical hormones in pregnancy than to the stress and tension in the skin folds associated with the expansion of the abdominal cavity.</p>
                            <p>Skin blood flow increases markedly and flow-mediated dilatation is increased. These changes allow more efficient heat loss, especially in late pregnancy when the developing fetus, whose core temperature is $\sim 1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ higher than the mother's, contributes to increasing heat production.</p>

                            <p>Massive production of sex steroids by the placenta tends to dominate the endocrine picture but there are also significant changes in all the maternal endocrine organs during pregnancy. It is important to be aware of these changes so that they are not interpreted as indicating abnormal function.</p>

                            <h3 id="placental-hormones">Placental hormones</h3>
                            <p>Human chorionic gonadotrophin is the signal for pregnancy. The fetoplacental unit synthesizes very large amounts of oestrogen and progesterone, both being needed for uterine growth and quiescence, and for breast development. However, oestrogen also stimulate the synthesis of binding globulins for thyroxine and corticosteroids; cortisol-bindingglobulin (CBG) increases throughout pregnancy to reach twice non-pregnant levels, while thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) is doubled by the end of the first trimester and remains elevated throughout pregnancy. Oestrogens also stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, and angiogenesis. In turn, VEGF appears to interact with other placentally produced hormones and angiopoietin-2 in the development of the placental villous capillary bed. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ (PPAR $\gamma$ ) is expressed in human villous and extravillous cytotrophoblast and binds to, and is activated by, natural ligands such as eicosanoids, fatty acids and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.</p>

                            <h3 id="pituitary-gland">The pituitary gland</h3>
                            <h4>Anatomy</h4>
                            <p>The anterior and posterior pituitary glands have different embryological origins, the anterior pituitary arising from Rathke's pouch in the developing oral cavity, while the posterior pituitary is derived from a downgrowth of neural tissue that forms the floor of the third ventricle. A specialized vascular portal system connects the two parts. The pituitary gland enlarges during pregnancy by $\sim 30 \%$ in primigravid women and $50 \%$ in multiparous women. The weight increase is largely due to changes in the anterior lobe.</p>

                            <h4>Anterior pituitary</h4>
                            <p>The anterior pituitary produces three glycoproteins (luteinizing hormone, follicular-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone) and three polypeptide and peptide hormones (growth hormone, prolactin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)). The increased oestrogen levels stimulate the number and secretory activity of the lactotrophs. Prolactin release is controlled by prolactin inhibitory factors such as dopamine. There is a steady rise in prolactin synthesis and plasma concentration, with a surge at the time of delivery and a subsequent fall with the disappearance of placental oestrogens. Levels of prolactin remain raised above basal in women who continue to breast-feed.</p>
                            <p>Plasma levels of ACTH rise in pregnancy but remain within the normal range. Some of the increase may be the result of placental production. MSH, synthesized in the pituitary intermediate lobe, shares a precursor (pro-opio-melanocortin) with ACTH and also rises in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Gonadotrophin secretion is inhibited by the rising chorionic gonadotrophin, as is the secretion of growth hormone. Thyrotrophin levels remain constant in pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Posterior pituitary</h4>
                            <p>The posterior pituitary releases arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin. Plasma osmolality falls in early pregnancy, and clearance of AVP increases fourfold, because of a placentally produced leucine aminopeptidase (PLAP). However, AVP responds appropriately to over- and underhydration once the new baseline osmolality is reached (see above: Plasma volume).</p>
                            <p>Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions. Concentrations are low during gestation, again because of the high concentrations of PLAP. Oxytocin levels are not raised in labour but there is an upregulation of uterine oxytocin receptors, so there is enhanced sensitivity to oxytocin. This appears to be related to the oestrogen: progesterone ratio, as oestrogen upregulates binding sites and progesterone downregulates them. In addition, dilatation of the cervix stimulates the release of oxytocin, thus reinforcing uterine activity. Oxytocin also plays an important role in lactation as it is released following stimulation of the nipples. It then acts on the myoepithelial cells surrounding the breast alveoli, causing these cells to contract and eject milk.</p>

                            <h3 id="hypothalamus">Hypothalamus</h3>
                            <p>Corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates the release of ACTH. Both hypothalamus and placenta synthesise CRH. Plasma levels of CRH increase greatly in the third trimester, and may be one of the triggers for the onset of labour.</p>

                            <h3 id="thyroid">The thyroid</h3>
                            <p>The thyroid gland enlarges in up to $70 \%$ of pregnant women, the percentage varying depending on iodine intake. In normal pregnancy, there is increased urinary excretion of iodine and transfer of iodothyronines to the fetus. This in turn results in a fall of plasma inorganic iodide levels in the mother. At the same time, the thyroid gland triples its uptake of iodide from the blood, creating a relative iodine deficiency which is probably responsible for the compensatory follicular enlargement of the gland (Fig. 3.16).</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>As a result of the increase in TBG, total tri-iodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$ and thyroxine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$ levels increase in pregnancy, although free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ rise in early pregnancy and then fall to remain in the non-pregnant range. TSH may increase slightly but tends to remain within the normal range. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and TSH do not cross the placental barrier and there is therefore no direct relationship between maternal and fetal thyroid function. However, iodine and antithyroid drugs do cross the placenta, as does the long-acting thyroid stimulator (LATS). Hence, the fetus may be affected by the level of iodine intake and by the presence of autoimmune disease in the mother.</p>
                            <p>Calcitonin is another thyroid hormone. It rises during the first trimester, peaks in the second and falls thereafter, although the changes are not large. It may contribute to the regulation of 1,25-di-hydroxy vitamin D.</p>

                            <h3 id="parathyroids">The parathyroids</h3>
                            <p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D in the proximal convoluted tubule. There is a fall in intact PTH during pregnancy but a doubling of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Placentally derived PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is also present in the maternal circulation and affects calcium homeostasis by acting through the PTH receptor.</p>

                            <h3 id="renin-angiotensin-system">The renin-angiotensin system (RAS)</h3>
                            <p>The RAS is activated in the luteal phase, and is one of the first hormones to 'recognize' pregnancy. The increased GFR and high progesterone cause an increased sodium load at the macula densa, which stimulates renin release. At the same time, oestrogens stimulate angiotensinogen synthesis. The resultant increase in AngII stimulates aldosterone synthesis and release from the adrenal cortex, which counters the natriuretic effect of progesterone at the distal tubule and results in sodium retention and plasma volume expansion. The potential effect of the raised AngII on blood pressure is offset by a parallel, specific, reduction in vascular sensitivity to AngII. The decreased sensitivity to AngII in normal pregnancy is lost in pre-eclampsia, where sensitivity increases even before the onset of hypertension.</p>
                            <p>AngII acts through two directly opposing receptors, the AT1 and AT2 subtypes. AT1 receptors promote angiogenesis, hypertrophy and vasoconstriction and AT2 receptors promote apoptosis. AT2 expression dominates in the early placenta where the system may be involved in implantation and vascular remodelling.</p>

                            <h3 id="adrenal-gland">The adrenal gland</h3>
                            <p>The adrenal glands remain constant in size but exhibit changes in function.</p>
                            <p>The rising ACTH stimulates cortisol synthesis and plasma total cortisol concentrations rise from 3 months to term. Much of this cortisol is bound to CBG or to albumin; even so, mean free (active) cortisol concentrations do also increase during pregnancy, with the loss of diurnal variation. The normal placenta synthesizes a pregnancy-specific $11 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which inhibits transfer of maternal cortisol to the fetus; excess transfer is thought to inhibit fetal growth.</p>
                            <p>Plasma aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa rises progressively throughout pregnancy (see above: The renin-angiotensin system); there is also a substantial increase in the weak mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone that is apparent by 8 weeks gestation and may reflect production by the fetoplacental unit.</p>
                            <p>The oestrogen-induced increase in the production of sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) results in an increase in total testosterone levels.</p>
                            <p>Improved measurement techniques have shown that plasma catecholamine concentrations fall from the first to the third trimesters. There is some blunting of the rise in noradrenaline (reflecting mainly sympathetic nerve activity) seen on standing and isometric exercise in pregnancy, but the adrenaline response (predominantly adrenal) is unaltered. However, there are often massive increases in both adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations during labour as the result of stress and muscle activity.</p>
