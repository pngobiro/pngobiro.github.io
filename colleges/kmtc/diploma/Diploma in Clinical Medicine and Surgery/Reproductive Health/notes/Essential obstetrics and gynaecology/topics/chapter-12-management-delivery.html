                        <p>Normal vaginal delivery marks the end of the second stage of labour.</p>
                        <p>The second stage of labour is defined as the period from the time of complete cervical dilatation to the baby's birth. It is convenient to consider the second stage in two phases: the descent in the pelvis, i.e. the pelvic or 'passive' phase, and the perineal or 'active' phase of the second stage. During the descent phase the mother does not normally experience the sensation of bearing down and, from a management point of view, this phase may be regarded as an extension of the first stage of the labour. In the perineal phase the urge to bear down is present although this may be masked or diminished if epidural analgesia has been provided for the woman. Therefore, unless the head is visible with contractions, the dilatation of the cervix and the station of the presenting part should be confirmed by vaginal examination before encouraging the woman to bear down.</p>
                        <p>Provided there are no adverse clinical factors present, a normal duration of the second stage is commonly regarded as lasting up to 2 hours in the nulliparous woman and 1 hour in the multipara. If the woman has received epidural analgesia, these times are extended by 1 hour for each group respectively. Progress in the second stage is monitored by descent of the fetal head assessed by an abdominal and vaginal examination. The fetal head is considered to be engaged when, no more than one-fifth of the head is palpable abdominally and the bony part of the vertex has descended to the level of the ischial spines.</p>
                        <p>If the labour is normal, women may choose a variety of positions for delivery but the supine position should be discouraged because of the risk of supine hypotensive syndrome. Many women adopt a semi-reclining position which has the advantage of reducing the risk of supine hypotension and is a suitable position for assisted delivery or perineal repair should these procedures be required.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="callout-title">ABC Normal vaginal delivery</h3>
                        <p>Women should be guided by their own urge to push. Pushing effort should allow for an unhurried, gentle delivery of the fetal head and this can be achieved by combining short pushing spells with periods of panting, thus giving the vaginal and perineal tissues time to relax and stretch over the advancing head (Fig. 12.1). Several contractions may occur before the head crowns and is delivered. For the delivery of the head, either the 'hands on' technique – supporting the perineum and flexing the baby's head – or the 'hands poised' method – with the hands off the perineum but in readiness – can be used to facilitate spontaneous birth.</p>

                        <p>Episiotomy is not routinely required for spontaneous vaginal birth but may be indicated if the perineum begins to tear, if the perineal resistance prevents delivery of the head or if concern for the wellbeing of the fetus requires that the birth be expedited. Where an episiotomy is performed, the recommended technique is a mediolateral incision originating at the vaginal fourchette and directed usually to the mother's right side (Fig. 12.2).</p>

                        <p>With the next contraction, the head is gently pulled downwards along the longitudinal axis of the baby until the anterior shoulder is delivered under the sub-pubic arch and then the baby is pulled anteriorly to deliver the posterior shoulder and the remainder of the trunk.</p>
                        <p>The infant will normally cry immediately after birth but if breathing is delayed the nasopharynx should be aspirated and the baby's lungs inflated with oxygen using a face mask. If the onset of breathing is further delayed, intubation and ventilation may become necessary. The condition of the baby is assessed at 1 and 5 minutes using the Apgar scoring system (Table 12.1) and again at 10 minutes if the baby is depressed. If the baby is born in poor condition (Apgar score at 1 minute is 5 or less), the cord should be double-clamped for paired cord blood gas analysis.</p>

                        <h3>Management of the third stage</h3>
                        <p>Active management of the third stage of labour is recommended, which includes the administration of oxytocin (10 WU) intramuscularly to the mother, followed by late clamping (&gt;2 minutes) and cutting of the cord. When the signs of placental separation are seen, i.e. the lengthening of the cord, trickle of blood and the uterus becoming globular and hard due to contraction and extruding the placenta into the lower segment, the placenta is delivered by controlled cord traction, a method commonly referred to as the Brandt–Andrews technique (Fig. 12.3).</p>

                            REPAIR OF EPISIOTOMY OR PERINEAL INJURY
                        </h2>

                        <p>A careful examination of the mother's perineum should be made as soon as possible to identify the degree of perineal or genital tract trauma sustained during the birth. Perineal trauma caused either by episiotomy or tearing may be classified as first, second, third or fourth-degree tears. A first degree tear describes laceration to vaginal and perineal skin only. A second-degree tear involves the posterior vaginal wall and underlying perineal muscles but not the anal sphincter. Third-degree injury to the perineum is damage that involves the anal sphincter complex, and a fourth-degree laceration is injury to the perineum that includes the ano/rectal mucosa.</p>
                        <p>In the case of a first-degree perineal tear, there is no need for suturing if the skin edges are already apposed provided the wound is not bleeding. Episiotomies and seconddegree lacerations should be sutured to minimize bleeding and to expedite healing. Third and fourth-degree perineal lacerations should be repaired under epidural/spinal or general anaesthesia by an experienced surgeon in an operating theatre under good lighting conditions.</p>

                        <h3>ABC Episiotomy repair</h3>
                        <p>For episiotomy repair, the woman should be placed in the lithotomy position so that a good view of the extent of the wound can be obtained (Fig. 12.4). Repair should only be undertaken with effective analgesia in place using either local anaesthetic agent infiltration or epidural or spinal anaesthesia. Closure of the vaginal wound requires a clear view of the apex of the incision. It is recommended that an absorbable synthetic suture material be used for the repair using a continuous technique for the vaginal wall and muscle layer and a continuous subcuticular technique for the skin.</p>
                        <p>On completion of the procedure it is important to ensure that the vagina is not constricted and that it can admit two fingers easily. In addition, a rectal examination should be performed to confirm that none of the sutures has penetrated the rectal mucosa. If this occurs, the suture must be removed as it may otherwise result in the formation of a rectovaginal fistula.</p>

                        <p>Obstetric anal sphincter injuries are a complication of vaginal deliveries and lead to long-term sequelae: anal incontinence (up to 25%), perineal discomfort, dyspareunia (up to 10%) and rarely rectovaginal fistulas. A third degree tear is a partial or complete disruption of the external and internal sphincter; either or both of these may be involved. These tears are often subclassified as:</p>

                        <p>A number of risk factors have been identified, though their value in prediction or prevention of sphincter injury is limited (Box 12.1). It is important to examine a perineal injury carefully after delivery so as not to miss sphincter damage. This may increase the rate of sphincter damage, but it will help to reduce the rate of long-term morbidity.</p>

                        <h3>Repair and management of third and fourth degree tears</h3>
                        <p>An experienced obstetrician should be performing or supervizing the repair. Good exposure, lighting and anaesthesia are prerequisites. The procedure should be covered with broad spectrum antibiotics and an oral regime carried on for at least 5 days following the repair. There are two recognized forms of repair that include the end-to-end method and overlapping of the sphincter ends. Documentation describing the extent of the tear, the method of repair as well as the level of supervision is vital. Immediately after the repair, the women should be debriefed, referred for physiotherapy and stool softeners should be prescribed. At the 6 week postnatal appointment, women need to be specifically asked about control of faeces, flatus, bowel movements as well as urgency and sexual dysfunction. An elective caesarean section for subsequent deliveries should be offered to all women who have sustained a sphincter injury if they remain symptomatic. Early referral to a colorectal surgeon is advised if physiotherapy has not relieved her symptoms.</p>

                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>More than 95% of fetuses present with the vertex and are termed 'normal'. Those presenting with other parts of the body (breech, face, brow, shoulder, cord) to the lower segment and cervix are known as malpresentations. There may be a reason for malpresentation, although in most instances there is no identifiable cause. They also present with specific problems in labour and during delivery. In modern obstetrics the presentation needs to be diagnosed early in labour and appropriate management instituted to prevent maternal or fetal injury.</p>

                        <h3>Face presentation</h3>
                        <p>In face presentation the fetal head is hyperextended so that the part of the head between the chin and orbits, i.e. the eyes, nose and mouth, that can be felt with the examining finger is the presenting part. The incidence is about 1 in 500 deliveries. In most cases the cause is unknown, but is associated with high parity and fetal anomaly particularly anencephaly. In modern obstetric practice where most pregnant women have an ultrasound scan for fetal abnormalities it is rare to see such conditions as a cause of face presentation.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>Face presentation is rarely diagnosed antenatally, but is usually identified during labour by vaginal examination when the cervix is sufficiently dilated to allow palpation of the characteristic facial features. However, oedema may develop that may obscure these landmarks. If in doubt, ultrasound will confirm or exclude the diagnosis. The position of a face presentation is defined with the chin as the denominator and is therefore recorded as mentoanterior, mentotransverse and mentoposterior (Fig. 12.5).</p>

                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>If the position is mento-anterior progress can be followed normally with the expectation of spontaneous vaginal delivery. However, if progress is abnormally slow it is preferable to proceed to caesarean section. In cases of persistent mentoposterior positions, vaginal delivery is not possible without manual or forceps rotation. Because the risk associated with these manoeuvres to the mother and infant is considerable, most obstetricians will perform a caesarean delivery.</p>

                        <h3>Brow presentation</h3>
                        <p>A brow presentation is described when the attitude of the fetal head is midway between a flexed vertex and face presentation (Fig. 12.6) and is the most unfavourable of all cephalic presentations. The condition is rare and occurs in 1 in 1500 births. If the head becomes impacted as a brow the presenting diameter, the mentovertical diameter (13.5 cm), is incompatible with vaginal delivery.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnosis and management</h4>
                        <p>The diagnosis is almost always made in labour when the anterior fontanelle, supraorbital ridges and root of the nose are palpable. In the normally grown term fetus vaginal delivery is not possible as a brow because of the large presenting diameters. Therefore in the vast majority of cases with brow presentation caesarean section is the method of choice for delivery.</p>

                            MALPOSITION OF THE FETAL HEAD
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Position of the fetal head is defined as the relationship of the denominator to the fixed points of the maternal pelvis. The denominator of the head is the most definable prominence at the periphery of the presenting part. In 90% of cases, the vertex presents with the occiput in the anterior half of the pelvis in late labour and hence is defined as 'normal' or 'occipitoanterior' (OA) position. In about 10% of cases there may be malposition of the head, i.e. the occiput presents in the posterior half of the pelvis with the occiput facing the sacrum or one of the two sacroiliac joints – the occipitoposterior (OP) position, or the sagittal suture is directed along the transverse diameter of the pelvis – the occipitotransverse (OT) position. Malposition of the vertex is frequently associated with deflexion of the fetal head or varying degrees of asynclitism, i.e. one parietal bone, usually the anterior, being lower in the pelvis with the parietal eminences at different levels. Asynclitism is most pronounced in the OT position. Deflexion and asynclitism are associated with larger presenting diameters of the fetal head thereby making normal delivery more difficult.</p>

                        <h3>The occipitoposterior position</h3>
                        <p>Some 10–20% of all cephalic presentations are OP positions at the onset of labour either as a direct OP or, more commonly, as an oblique right or left OP position. During labour the head usually undertakes the long rotation through the transverse to the OA position but a few, about 5%, remain in the OP position. Where the OP position persists, progress of the labour may be arrested due to the deflexed attitude of the head that results in larger presenting diameters (11.5 cm × 9.5 cm) than are found with OA positions (9.5 cm × 9.5 cm). Prolonged and painful labour associated with backache are characteristic feature of a posterior fetal position (Fig. 12.7).</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Diagnosis and management</h4>
                        <p>The diagnosis is usually made or confirmed on vaginal examination during labour when the cervix is sufficiently dilated to allow palpation of the sagittal suture with the posterior fontanelle situated posteriorly in the pelvis. In many cases, labour will progress normally, the head rotating anteriorly and delivering spontaneously. Occasionally the head may rotate posteriorly and deliver in a persistent OP position.</p>
                        <p>Because of the deflexed head and the relatively large presenting diameters, delivery in the posterior position may result in over-distension of the perineum, resulting in third or fourth degree tears.</p>
                        <p>Adequate pain relief and fluid replacement should be provided for the mother and if progress of the labour is slower than average, the introduction of an oxytocin infusion should be considered provided there are no other contraindications to its use. If progress is judged to be slow or if there are other indications to expedite delivery, further management will depend on the station of the head, the dilatation of the cervix and the competence of the operator to perform rotational forceps or vacuum assisted delivery.</p>
                        <p>If the cervix is not completely dilated or the head is not engaged, caesarean section will be the only option for delivery of the baby. On the other hand, if the head is engaged the choice of method will be between caesarean section and forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery depending on the obstetric circumstances (station and position of the vertex and fetal condition) and the skill of the operator in performing rotational instrumental deliveries.</p>
                        <p>When performing caesarean section for OP position the head sometimes becomes impacted in the pelvis and may be difficult to dislodge. In such cases it may be advisable to disimpact the head vaginally before extracting it abdominally.</p>

                        <h3>Deep transverse arrest</h3>
                        <p>The head normally descends into the pelvis in the OT or OP position and then the occiput rotates anteriorly to emerge under the pubic arch. Occasionally this anterior rotation of the occiput fails to occur or, in an OP position, fails to rotate beyond the transverse diameter of the pelvis. Labour will then become arrested due to the large presenting diameters resulting from asynclitism of the head that characterizes a fetal OT position. This clinical situation is referred to as 'deep transverse arrest'.</p>

                        <h4>Diagnosis and management</h4>
                        <p>The diagnosis of deep transverse arrest is made during labour by vaginal examination when the second stage is prolonged and the cervix is fully dilated. As with OP arrest, the choice of method of delivery will be between caesarean section and instrumental delivery. However, provided the head is engaged in the pelvis and the station is at or below spines, it can usually be rotated to the anterior position, either manually or by rotational forceps or vacuum extraction (auto rotation with descent) and delivered vaginally.</p>
                        <p>There is no longer any place for 'heroic' procedures using excessive force to rotate and extract the head. Such procedures may result in fetal intracranial injury and laceration of major cerebral vessels. If the fetal head does not rotate and descend easily, the procedure should be abandoned and delivery completed by caesarean section.</p>

                        <p>With few exceptions, both instruments are used for similar indications but the technique with the forceps differs completely from that of vacuum extraction. The common indications for forceps or vacuum assisted delivery are:</p>

                        <p>Clinical factors that may influence the need for assisted vaginal delivery include the resistance of the pelvic floor and perineum, inefficient uterine contractions, poor maternal expulsive effort, malposition of the fetal head, cephalopelvic disproportion and epidural analgesia.</p>

                        <h3>Method of instrumental delivery</h3>
                        <p>It is customary to classify instrumental deliveries into three categories according to the station of the fetal head, i.e. outlet, low and midpelvic deliveries, and into two types according to position of the fetal head, i.e. non-rotational and rotational deliveries.</p>

                        <h4>Non-rotational instrumental delivery</h4>
                        <h5>Forceps</h5>
                        <p>Examples of the types of forceps used when no anterior rotation of the head is required are the Neville Barnes and Simpson's forceps (Fig. 12.8). Both of these forceps have cephalic and pelvic curves. The two blades of the forceps are designated according to the side of the pelvis to which they are applied. Thus the left blade is applied to the left side of the pelvis (Fig. 12.10A). There is a fixed lock between the blades (Fig. 12.10B). The two sides of the forceps should lock at the shank without difficulty. The sagittal suture should be perpendicular to the shank, the occiput 3–4 cm above the shank and only one finger space between the heel of the blade and the head on either side. Intermittent traction is applied coinciding with the uterine contractions and maternal bearing down efforts in the direction of the pelvic canal (Fig. 12.10C) until the occiput is on view and then the head is delivered by anterior extension (Fig. 12.10D).</p>

                        <h5>Vacuum delivery</h5>
                        <p>All vacuum extractors consist of a cup that is attached to the baby's head, a vacuum source that provides the means of attachment of the cup and a traction system or handle that allows the operator to assist the birth (Fig 12.9). As with forceps, there are two main design types of vacuum devices, the so-called 'anterior' cups for use in nonrotational OA extractions and the 'posterior' cups for use in rotational OP and OT deliveries. The cup is applied to the baby's head at a specific point on the vertex (the flexion point) (Fig 12.11A), and traction is directed along the axis of the pelvis (Fig 12. 11B) until the head descends to the perineum (Fig 12.11C). With crowning, traction is directed upwards and the head is delivered (Fig 12.11D).</p>

                        <h4>Rotational instrumental delivery</h4>
                        <p>If the position of the fetal head is OP or OT, forceps and vacuum extractors specifically designed for use in these positions must be used to achieve anterior rotation of the head.</p>
                        <p>For example, Kjelland's forceps (Fig. 12.8) has a sliding lock and minimal pelvic curve so that rotation of the fetal head with the forceps can be achieved without causing damage to the vagina by the blades. For rotational vacuum assisted delivery a 'posterior' cup (Fig. 12.9) will allow the operator to manoeuvre the cup towards and over the flexion point thereby facilitating auto-rotation of the head to the OA position at delivery.</p>

                        <h4>Trial of instrumental delivery</h4>
                        <p>Where some difficulty with a forceps or vacuum delivery is anticipated, e.g. if there is a suspicion of borderline disproportion, the procedure should be attempted in the operating room as a 'trial' of instrumental delivery with preparation made to proceed to caesarean section. If some descent is not evident with each traction, the procedure should be abandoned in favour of caesarean section. In this way significant trauma to the infant and mother should be avoided.</p>

                        <h3>Indications for caesarean section</h3>
                        <p>Although caesarean section rates show considerable variation from place to place there has been a consistent increase in this method of delivery over recent years to such an extent that in many developed countries rates of 25–30% or even higher are not unusual. Common indications for caesarean section are:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on the urgency of the clinical indication, caesarean sections have been classified into four categories based on time limits within which the operation should be performed. The most urgent, category 1 describes indications where there is immediate threat to the life of the woman or fetus; category 2 where maternal or fetal compromise is present but is not immediately life-threatening; category 3 where there is no maternal or fetal compromise but early delivery is required; and category 4 refers to elective planned caesarean section.</p>
                        <p>Women who have had one previous uncomplicated, lower segment caesarean section for a non-recurrent indication may attempt a vaginal delivery in a subsequent labour provided there are no other adverse clinical factors present. The major concern is risk of dehiscence of the uterine scar but this is low with a previous lower uterine segment incision. The figures quoted are 5/1000 with spontaneous labour, 8/1000 with the use of oxytocin infusion and 25/1000 with the use of prostaglandins. The risk is higher and may occur before the onset of labour where a classical (upper segment) caesarean section has been performed. Signs of impending or actual scar dehiscence include suprapubic pain and tenderness, fetal distress, maternal tachycardia, vaginal bleeding, and collapse. Thus, women attempting a vaginal birth after caesarean section should deliver in a hospital where there are appropriate facilities such as blood transfusion services and ready access to an operating theatre.</p>

                        <h3>Complications</h3>
                        <p>Although the risks of caesarean delivery for a woman have decreased significantly, as with all major surgical operations, there are immediate and late complications associated with this method of delivery. The main immediate complication is peri-operative haemorrhage which may occasionally result in shock. Rarely injury to the bladder or ureters may occur during the procedure. Late complications of caesarean section include infection of the wound or uterine cavity, secondary postpartum bleeding and, less commonly, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.</p>

                            SHOULDER DYSTOCIA

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Shoulder dystocia is a serious condition that occurs when the fetal head has delivered but the shoulders fail to deliver spontaneously or with the normal amount of downward traction. The head recoils against the mother's perineum to form the so-called 'turtle sign'. If delivery is delayed the baby may become asphyxiated and, unless care is exercised when assisting the birth, may suffer brachial plexus palsy or limb fractures from overvigorous manipulations. Shoulder dystocia is associated with the birth of macrosomic infants (>4500 g) especially if the mother has diabetes. Other predisposing factors are prolonged second stage of labour and assisted vaginal delivery.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately shoulder dystocia is unpredictable; only a minority of macrosomic infants will experience shoulder dystocia and the majority of cases will occur in normal labours with infants weighing less than 4000 g. For this reason all birth attendants should be skilled in the recognition and the specific steps in the management of this potentially serious emergency.</p>
                        <p>Normally, delivery of the anterior shoulder is achieved with gentle downward traction (Fig. 12.13) and then followed by upward traction to deliver the posterior shoulder (Fig. 12.14). If this is not successful, the recommended first line treatment for shoulder dystocia is McRobert's manoeuvre (Box 12.2). The woman is placed in the recumbent position with the hips slightly abducted and acutely flexed with the knees bent up towards the chest. At the same time an assistant applies directed suprapubic pressure to help dislodge the anterior shoulder and for it to be in the oblique diameter of the pelvic inlet. A generous episiotomy is also performed. McRobert's manoeuvre is successful in the majority of cases of shoulder dystocia. Other more complex manoeuvres are described such as rotation of the fetal shoulders to one or other oblique pelvic diameter, manual delivery of the posterior arm and Wood's 'screw' manoeuvre.</p>

                        <h4>Primary postpartum haemorrhage</h4>
                        <h5>Predisposing causes</h5>
                        <p>Haemorrhage may occur from any part of the genital tract for reasons listed below but arises most commonly from the placental site. Low implantation of the placenta appears to be associated with inadequate constriction of the uterine blood vessels at the placental implantation site.</p>
                        <p>Causes of primary haemorrhage are due to one of four 'Ts' – tone, tissue, trauma or thrombin – referring to clotting problems.</p>
                        <p>Uterine atony accounts for 75–90% of all causes of postpartum haemorrhage. Predisposing factors include:</p>

                        <p>Postpartum bleeding may be sudden and profound and may rapidly lead to cardiovascular collapse. Treatment is directed towards controlling the bleeding and replacing the blood and fluid loss (Fig. 12.16).</p>

                        <p>If the above measures fail, there are a number of surgical techniques that can be implemented including: bimanual compression of the uterus, uterine tamponade with balloon catheters, uterine compression sutures (B-Lynch suture), internal iliac and uterine artery ligation, major vessel embolization, or hysterectomy.</p>

                        <h4>Secondary postpartum haemorrhage</h4>
                        <h5>Causes and predisposing factors</h5>
                        <p>Causes of secondary postpartum haemorrhage includes: retained placental tissue, intrauterine infection, or rare causes, e.g. trophoblastic disease.</p>

                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Treatment will depend on whether the bleeding is mild and otherwise asymptomatic or heavy and associated with signs of possible sepsis. If the bleeding is slight, the uterus is not tender and there are no other signs of infection; observation is justified. However, if the bleeding is heavy and particularly if there are signs of infection, intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics (to cover aerobes and anaerobes) and uterine exploration under anaesthesia is indicated.</p>

                        <h4>Vaginal wall haematomas</h4>
                        <p>Profuse haemorrhage may sometimes occur from vaginal and perineal lacerations and bleeding from these sites should be controlled as soon as possible. Venous bleeding may be controlled by compression alone but arterial bleeding will require vessel ligation. Vaginal wall haematomas may occur in one of two sites (Fig. 12.17):</p>

                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content"><strong>Superficial:</strong> The bleeding occurs below the insertion of the levator ani and the haematoma will be seen to distend the perineum, causing the mother considerable pain. The haematoma must be drained and any visible bleeding vessels ligated although they are rarely identified. For this reason a drain should be inserted before the wound is re-sutured.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content"><strong>Deep:</strong> The bleeding occurs deep to the insertion of the levator ani muscle and is not visible externally. It is more common after instrumental delivery than after spontaneous birth and presents with symptoms of continuous pelvic pain, retention of urine and unexplained anaemia. It can usually be diagnosed by vaginal examination as a bulge into the upper part of the vaginal wall. Alternatively, ultrasound examination will confirm the diagnosis. The haematoma is evacuated by incision and a large drain is inserted into the cavity. The vagina should be firmly packed and an in-dwelling catheter inserted into the bladder. Antibiotic therapy should be administered and, if necessary, a blood transfusion is instituted.</span>

                        <h4>Uterine inversion</h4>
                        <p>This is a rare complication usually occurring during attempted delivery of the placenta, where the uterine fundus inverts and protrudes through the cervix. The condition is more likely to occur when the placenta is fundal and adherent. The symptoms are severe lower abdominal pain and maternal shock with haemorrhage. The management is to leave the placenta attached to the uterus, initiate fluid resuscitation and attempt to push the fundus back through the cervix manually or by the use of hydrostatic pressure. If this cannot be accomplished immediately it will be necessary to perform replacement under general anaesthesia in theatre with the use of uterine relaxants.</p>

                        <h4>Perineal wound breakdown</h4>
                        <p>Breakdown of episiotomy or perineal wound repairs may occur due to infection or haematoma in the wound. Small areas of breakdown can be treated by regular cleaning and antibiotics and left to granulate until healed. More extensive wound breakdowns should be treated by antibiotics and cleansing and debridement of sloughing tissues. When signs of active infection have subsided a secondary repair can then be performed. With third and fourth degree wound breakdown, bowel preparation should precede the secondary repair, which is best undertaken in the operation room by an experienced operator.</p>

                        <h4>Amniotic fluid embolism</h4>
                        <p>Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a potentially catastrophic and often fatal complication that usually occurs suddenly during labour and delivery. The clinical diagnosis is based on the sudden development of acute respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse in a patient in labour or who has recently delivered. Amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation and triggers a syndrome similar to that seen with anaphylaxis and septic shock. If the woman survives the initial event, she will almost certainly develop severe disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, effective resuscitation and treatment requires clinical specialist assistance in the fields of intensive care, anaesthesia and haematology. Although AFE is a rare condition, occurring in about 1/80 000 pregnancies, it has a disproportionately high maternal mortality rate.</p>
