                                AIMS AND PATTERNS OF ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The concept that the general wellbeing and reproductive performance of a woman might be improved by antenatal supervision is surprisingly recent, and was first introduced in Edinburgh in 1911. In many societies, antenatal care is not available or, for social or religious reasons, is not used when it is available. Unfortunately, it is often least available in those communities where the need is greatest and where antenatal disorders, particularly those linked to malnutrition or over nutrition, are most common.</p>
                            
                            <p>The basic aims of antenatal care are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">To ensure optimal health of the mother throughout pregnancy and in the puerperium.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content">To detect and treat disorders arising during pregnancy that relate to the welfare of both the mother and the fetus and to ensure that the pregnancy results in a healthy mother and a healthy infant.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The ways by which these objectives are achieved will vary according to the initial health and history of the mother and are a combination of screening tests, educational and emotional support and monitoring of fetal growth and maternal health throughout the pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The frequency of antenatal visits was first established by a group of providers of antenatal care in 1929. The protocol advised that antenatal visits should occur monthly from 8 weeks gestation until 28 weeks and then every 2 weeks until 36 weeks and thereafter weekly until the time of delivery. In modern antenatal care, the timing of visits, particularly in the first 28 weeks of pregnancy, is now more closely geared to attendance for screening tests. In uncomplicated pregnancy, a reduction in the number of visits has not been shown to adversely affect maternal or perinatal outcome, although maternal satisfaction may be reduced.</p>
                            <p>Antenatal care is provided through a variety of different mechanisms and may be provided by general practitioners, midwives and obstetricians, often in a pattern of shared care. Pregnancies that are considered to be high risk should receive a high proportion of their care by obstetricians or specialists in fetomaternal medicine. Risk stratification should be assessed at the earliest antenatal visits and care planned accordingly. Guidelines for consultation and referral, such as those produced by the Australian College of Midwives or by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), can be a useful tool to assess risk and determine the most suitable model of care. Pregnancy risk and the most suitable care provider may alter during the course of pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>Ideally, all women would present prior to conception to allow their health care professional to provide them with prepregnancy care and counselling. This role is often best provided by the woman's usual general practitioner. This appointment allows for an opportunity to undertake screening tests and provide advice regarding conception and early pregnancy care.</p>
                            <p>Essential components of preconceptual care include the assessment of the need for immunization for rubella, varicella and pertussis. If the history of past vaccination or infection is uncertain, serology may be required. If serology is negative or immunization is due, this can then be provided. As these vaccines are live attenuated viral vaccines, it is recommended that the woman use adequate contraception to defer conception for 28 days following administration. Administration of the influenza vaccine on a seasonal basis to women who are intending to be or who are pregnant is also recommended due to the increased incidence of serious morbidity associated with influenza infection in pregnancy. This visit is also an ideal opportunity to undertake routine cervical cytology (Papanicolou smear) if due.</p>
                            <p>Dietary and vitamin supplementation advice should also be given at this time. It is recommended that all women take a folic acid supplement ($400 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ daily) for at least one month prior to conception and the first three months of pregnancy as an effective means of reducing the incidence of neural tube defects. Certain risk groups may be recommended to take a higher dose (5 mg daily) such as those on anti-epileptic agents, obese women, diabetic women or women with a past history of neural tube defects. Iodine supplementation of $150 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ per day is also recommended in countries or regions where there is a dietary deficiency of iodine to aid in the development of the fetal brain. Some countries have overcome the problem by using iodized salts for cooking.</p>
                            <p>Maternal medical conditions, including medications, can be reviewed and optimized at this time. This provides an opportunity to discuss the impact of pregnancy on the medical condition as well as the impact of the medical condition on pregnancy. Medication may need to be altered or doses reduced where appropriate. Referral to specialist physician colleagues for treatment optimization may be appropriate.</p>
                            <p>Optimization of preconceptional health with advice on a nutritious diet and regular moderate exercise should also be provided at this time. Exploration and discussion around the use of licit and illicit substances should also be explored.</p>

Fresh air contains up to 0.5 ppm of carbon monoxide, but in cigarette smoke values as high as 60000 ppm may be detected. Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left in both fetal and maternal haemoglobin. Maternal carbon monoxide saturation may rise to $8 \%$ in the mother and $7 \%$ in the fetus, so that there is specific interference with oxygen transfer.</span>

                            <h3 id="alcohol-intake">Alcohol intake</h3>
                            <p>Excessive alcohol intake (in excess of eight standard drinks per day) is associated with a specific syndrome known as the fetal alcohol syndrome. Features in the infant include growth retardation, various structural defects and, in particular, facial defects, multiple joint anomalies and cardiac defects. However, these problems arise in women who consume 80 g of alcohol/day and who will almost inevitably have an unsatisfactory dietary intake as well. This is equivalent to an intake of 8 units/day, where 1 unit is equivalent to one glass of wine (200 mL) or half a pint of beer or lager. Increasingly, there is awareness of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, a range of neurodevelopmental and behavioural effects attributable to alcohol consumption in pregnancy in a dose-dependent manner. Research is not clear as to what level of alcohol consumption is safe in pregnancy, so a recommendation to abstain from any consumption is the safest choice. In reality, the responsibility lies with the woman to adopt a reasonable approach to her alcohol intake. There is no evidence that the occasional social glass of wine or beer has any detrimental effect.</p>

                            <h3 id="illicit-drug-use">Illicit drug use</h3>
                            <p>The common forms of drug abuse that occur during pregnancy are from heroin, amphetamines, cocaine and marijuana. All of these drugs have adverse effects on both the mother and the fetus, but many of the adverse effects are related to lifestyle and malnutrition.</p>
                            <p>Heroin addiction is associated with an increased incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal death and preterm labour. Furthermore, about $50 \%$ of infants exposed to heroin will suffer from neonatal withdrawal manifestations. The mother should be screened for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea and should be referred to a drug dependence unit for withdrawal of heroin and replacement with methadone or buprenorphine.</p>
                            <p>Amphetamine use has become an increasing problem over the past decade. Use in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, growth restriction, placental abruption, fetal death in utero and developmental anomalies. Referral to a drug dependency service for advice on cessation is recommended.</p>
                            <p>Cocaine usage may induce cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system damage in mothers as well as placental abruption, fetal growth restriction and preterm labour. Management of cocaine addiction is directed at withdrawing the drug.</p>
                            <p>Marijuana has no apparent adverse effect on pregnancy although the active ingredient of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to have teratogenic effects in animal studies. Consumption is usually associated with significant tobacco use, which has major detrimental effects as outlined above.</p>

                            <p>Maternal age is an important determinant of outcome in obstetric services, with increased risk being associated with both extremes of maternal age. In recent years the median age of women giving birth in developed countries has continued to rise, and currently sits at around 30 years. The reasons for this are complex and due to a number of social, economic, and educational factors. Rates of pregnancy in the over 35 age group continue to rise (currently $23 \%$ of all births) as does that of women over 40 ($4 \%$ of all births), however the number of mothers over 45 years remains low.</p>
                            <p>Access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has increased with a subsequent influence on median maternal age. Approximately $3.2 \%$ of babies born are conceptions assisted by ART in Australia and the UK. In addition, rates of multiple pregnancies continue to rise, currently around $1.6 \%$ of all mothers. This is largely due to the increases in ART and increasing maternal age. Rates of multiples in ART pregnancy are around $10 \%$ of all successful conceptions.</p>
                            <p>Rates of teenage pregnancy continue to decline and sit at around $4 \%$ of all births.</p>
                            <p>The absolute number of babies born to each woman continues to be low, with $75 \%$ of mothers giving birth to their first or second baby. The median age of first time mothers also continues to climb, and is currently around 28 years.</p>
                            <p>Women are active participants in antenatal care with over $98 \%$ having at least one antenatal visit and $92 \%$ having 5 or more visits. Preterm birth occurs in around $7.5 \%$ of all pregnancies, with most of these occurring in gestations greater than 32 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Around $75 \%$ of all women use analgesia in labour, most commonly nitrous oxide, followed by opioids, then regional techniques (predominantly epidural anaesthesia, around 30%). Rates in first time mothers of analgesic use are around $85 \%$. Rates of caesarean section as a proportion of births increase with increasing maternal age.</p>

                            <p>The details of antenatal history and routine clinical examinations are discussed in Chapter 6. However, certain observations should be stressed at the first visit and it is preferable that these observations should be made within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. The measurement of maternal height and weight is important and has value in prediction of pregnancy outcomes. Women with a low body mass index (BMI; less than 20, where BMI is estimated as weight $(\mathrm{kg})$ divided by height $\left(\mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ ) are at increased risk of fetal growth restriction and perinatal mortality. Women with a high BMI are increasingly recognized as being at increased antenatal and intrapartum risk, with the risks beginning to rise from a BMI of 30.</p>
                            <p>The initial measurement of blood pressure should be taken as soon as possible as this may provide evidence that, if there is hypertension, it is likely to have predated the pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>Beginning at the first visit, a number of screening tests are introduced. Some will be repeated later in the pregnancy. The omission of these tests will generally now be considered to be evidence of substandard practice so they have medicolegal importance as well as clinical relevance.</p>

                            <h3 id="haematological-investigations">Haematological investigations</h3>
                            <p>Anaemia is a common disorder in pregnancy and in most communities will be due to iron deficiency, either because of the depletion of iron stores or because of reduced iron intake. Over $90 \%$ of pathological anaemia in pregnancy is due to iron deficiency. However, it may also be macrocytic and due to folate or vitamin B12 deficiency or may be related to various parasitic infections.</p>
                            <p>Haemoglobin concentration and a full blood count should therefore be performed at the first visit and repeated at 28 and 34 weeks gestation. Women who have deficient iron intakes should be given oral supplements of iron from early in pregnancy. Screening for haemoglobinopathies should be routinely offered to those racial groups where conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease are common.</p>

                            <h3 id="blood-group">Blood group and antibodies</h3>
                            <p>Blood group should be determined in all pregnant women and screening for red cell antibodies should be undertaken early in pregnancy. In Rhesus (Rh) negative women, screening for Rh antibodies should be performed at the first visit (preferably in the first trimester) and then repeated at least at 28 weeks gestation. ABO antibodies may also cause problems in the fetus and newborn, but there is no method available to counter this problem.</p>

                            <h3 id="anti-d-immunoglobulin">The use of anti-D immunoglobulin</h3>
                            <p>Around 15% of Caucasian women will be Rh negative and be at risk of developing anti-D antibodies during or immediately following pregnancy. The formation of anti-D antibodies may pose a risk to the wellbeing and even survival of a subsequent fetus due to the preformed antibodies crossing the placenta and attacking the red blood cells of a Rh-positive fetus. The effects on the fetus and newborn can be devastating and include anaemia, hydrops, neonatal anaemia, jaundice, kernicterus or fetal death in utero. There is very strong evidence dating from the 1960s that postpartum administration of anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D Ig) can dramatically reduce the incidence of this complication.</p>
                            <p>Until the past few years, anti-D Ig was given only to women with a sensitizing event in pregnancy or postnatally to women delivered of a Rh-positive infant. Given within 72 hours of birth, this dose reduces the risk of Rh isoimmunization to around $1.5 \%$. Quantitation of the degree of fetomaternal haemorrhage and the need for further doses should be undertaken by flow cytometry (where available) or the Kleihauer-Betke test prior to administration of the first dose.</p>
                            <p>Sensitizing events include normal delivery, miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, invasive prenatal diagnosis, abdominal trauma, antepartum haemorrhage or external cephalic version.</p>
                            <p>Now that anti-D Ig is readily available, it has become standard practice to give anti-D Ig prophylaxis at 28 and 34 weeks gestation (Fig. 7.2). This will prevent maternal immunization by a Rh-positive fetus in all but $0.2 \%$ Rh-negative women, in whom the infusion of cells from the fetus overwhelms the dose of antibody administered. This is in addition to the above indications.</p>

                            <h4 id="rubella">Rubella</h4>
                            <p>All females are offered rubella vaccination between the ages of 11 and 14 years, often through a school-based vaccination programme. By the time they present for their first confinement, $22 \%$ of nulliparous women will still be found to be non-immune, as well as $1.2 \%$ of multiparous women. Around $50 \%$ of non-immune women will have been previously vaccinated. All seronegative women should be offered immunization in the immediate puerperium. Vaccination is performed with a live attenuated rubella virus vaccine and involves a single dose injected subcutaneously. Although there is no evidence to suggest any significant increase in abnormality rate in the babies in women who have conceived immediately before or following rubella vaccination, it is generally recommended that pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after vaccination. Non-immune women should be advised to avoid contact with infected individuals. Any clinically suspected infection should be investigated with paired sera, preferably with the original sample taken at the time of booking.</p>

                            <h4 id="syphilis">Syphilis</h4>
                            <p>Routine screening for syphilis is recommended practice. Despite the fact that the condition is now relatively rare, the condition is treatable and has major neonatal sequelae if left untreated. Various tests are available.</p>

                            <h5>Non-specific tests</h5>
                            <p>The Wasserman reaction is a complement-fixation test that was the first successful serological test described for use in clinical practice. The test is dependent on the presence of treponemal antibodies in the serum, which unite with a colloidal suspension of lipoids to produce visible flocculation. A similar flocculation test that is widely used is the venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL), which employs a cardiolipin antigen. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is commonly used as it is an inexpensive test and is used primarily for screening and for follow up to check if there is a response to treatment. The difficulty with these tests is that they may give a false-positive reaction in association with malaria or viral pneumonia, or in autoimmune conditions such as lupus erythematosus, haemolytic anaemias, Hashimoto's disease or rheumatoid arthritis. The VDRL test usually becomes negative within 6 months of treatment and therefore has an important role in treatment monitoring.</p>

                            <h5>Specific tests</h5>
                            <p>Where there is doubt about the diagnosis, specific tests should be employed. The Treponema pallidum immobilization (TPI) test is the most specific test available and is based on the fact that the serum from syphilitic patients contains an antibody that, in the presence of complement, immobilizes virulent treponemes. Positive tests are also found in patients with yaws and other treponemal diseases. Other tests include the fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA) test and the Treponema pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA) test.</p>

                            <h4 id="hepatitis">Hepatitis (see Chapter 9)</h4>
                            <p>There is a case for universal screening for hepatitis B and C in pregnancy. Passive and active vaccination for hepatitis $B$ is recommended for at-risk infants, and passive vaccination for all infants. Full vaccination protects infants from hepatitis B infection in $90 \%$ of cases.</p>

                            <h4 id="hiv">Human immunodeficiency virus</h4>
                            <p>The basis of tests for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the detection of HIV antibodies. The virus can be isolated and grown but this is a difficult procedure. As the virus has a predilection for the T-helper subset of lymphocytes, there is an altered T-helper/Tsuppressor ratio. However, all these tests can be normal, even in the presence of infection. The most important confounding variable is that HIV antibodies may be absent in the incubation phase.</p>
                            <p>Seropositive mothers always have seropositive babies due to transplacental transmission of antibodies, but this may not indicate active infection in the baby. However, up to $45 \%$ of babies will have contracted HIV if active management programmes are not used. As treatment is highly effective in reducing transmission rates to less than $2 \%$ there is a strong case for routine screening of all women. These strategies include caesarean section, avoidance of breastfeeding and antiretroviral therapy in both the antenatal and intrapartum period as well as for the newborn (see Chapter 9).</p>

                            <h4 id="group-b-strep">Group B Streptococcus</h4>
                            <p>Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterium that is a common commensal carried in the gastrointestinal tract. It can be cultured from the vagina in up to $25 \%$ of women in pregnancy and may also be a cause of urinary tract infection. During vaginal delivery there is a risk of transmission to the neonate. This risk is increased in preterm delivery and prolonged rupture of membranes. Neonatal infection occurs in 1–2 per 1000 births and can result in overwhelming sepsis associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Ninety percent of infections present within the first days of life, but late presentations at up to 3 months of age can occur.</p>
                            <p>The organism can be detected on vaginal and rectal swabs and the rate of vertical transmission reduced by the use of intrapartum antibiotic treatment with intravenous penicillin. Screening for GBS using a low vaginal swab taken between 34 and 36 weeks is recommended by many centres but is not universal practice.</p>

                            <h4 id="uti">Urinary tract infection</h4>
                            <p>Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria is of proven benefit. The presence of pathogenic organisms in excess of 10000 organisms $/ \mathrm{mL}$ indicates significant bacteriuria. As the incidence of ascending urinary tract infection, including acute pyelonephritis, is increased in pregnancy and is associated with increased pregnancy loss and preterm birth as well as maternal morbidity, early treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria reduces the incidence of such infections and thus improves maternal health.</p>

                            <h3 id="gestational-diabetes">Gestational diabetes</h3>
                            <p>Gestational diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of intrauterine fetal death as well as intrapartum and neonatal complications. Screening programmes follow one of two pathways:</p>

                            <p>Screening for trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome) has become routine in most antenatal services, but not in all countries. The logical consequence of such a programme is to offer invasive testing then termination of pregnancy where there is evidence of aneuploidy. Although the value of the test is reduced if termination is not an option, a positive result can help parents prepare for the birth of an affected infant. Screening is by the use of biochemical and ultrasound tests. It is important that women understand that these are screening tests and therefore have their limitations. They will not detect every case and high-risk results do not necessarily mean that the baby is affected. Despite the increased incidence of Down's syndrome in mothers over 35 years, screening on the basis of age alone will not detect most affected fetuses and it is recommended to offer screening to all women. The major modality for screening for Down's syndrome is the use of ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency, a measurement of fluid behind the fetal neck (see Chapter 10, Fig. 10.6). This is combined with maternal age and the results of biochemical tests to provide a risk for this fetus of trisomy 21, 13 and 18 (see Chapter 10).</p>

                            <p>Although the pattern of antenatal care will vary with circumstances and with the normality or otherwise of the pregnancy, a general pattern of visits will partly revolve around the demands of the screening procedures and the obstetric and medical history of the mother. The measurement of blood pressure is performed at all visits and the measurement of symphysis/fundal height should be recorded, even accepting that this observation has a limited capacity to detect fetal growth restriction. Serial ultrasound measurements would have a greater detection rate if performed at every visit, but this is not practicable or necessary for women who are not considered to be at high risk. A suggested regime for antenatal visits is listed in Table 7.2.</p>
                            <p>In general, where pregnancies have been accurately dated by early ultrasound so that the gestational age is certain, induction of labour after 41 weeks reduces the incidence of meconium staining, macrosomia and the risk of fetal and neonatal death. Although the meta-analysis suggests there is reduction of caesarean and instrumental deliveries with induction of labour, this has been challenged, as the methods used for induction in the conservative group in the largest study did not use prostaglandin for ripening or induction of labour.</p>

                            </h2>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>An important and integral part of antenatal care is the education of the mother and her partner about pregnancy, childbirth and the care of the infant. This process should start before pregnancy as part of school education and should continue throughout pregnancy and the puerperium. There are various ways by which this can be achieved but, commonly, the needs are met by regular antenatal classes during the course of the pregnancy. It is preferable that those staff who are involved in general antenatal care and delivery should be part of the team that delivers the woman so that the processes of care and education are seen as one entity.</p>

                            <h3 id="dietary-advice">Dietary advice</h3>
                            <p>There can be no doubt about the importance of diet in pregnancy. At one extreme, gross malnutrition is known to result in intrauterine growth retardation, anaemia, prematurity and fetal malformation. Lesser degrees of malnutrition may also be associated with an increased incidence of fetal malformations, particularly neural tube defects, and it is therefore important to provide guidance on diet and to ensure that a diet of appropriate quality and quantity is maintained throughout pregnancy and the puerperium.</p>
                            <p>Clearly, there will be substantial variation in the nature of the diet depending on racial group and actual physical size, but there are general principles that can be laid down as advice to meet the needs of the mother and of the developing fetus.</p>
                            <p>Advice should be given early in pregnancy regarding Listeria risk and advice given to avoid high-risk foods such as soft cheeses, delicatessen meats, salad bars and soft serve ice cream.</p>

                            <h4 id="energy-intake">Energy intake</h4>
                            <p>A total energy intake of $2000-2500 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day is necessary during the last two trimesters of pregnancy because of the demands of both maternal and fetal metabolism. This requirement may increase to 3000 kcal in the puerperium in lactating women.</p>

                            <h4 id="protein">Protein</h4>
                            <p>First-class protein is expensive in most countries, with some notable exceptions such as Argentina and Australia, and is therefore likely to be deficient in less developed nations. However, it is also likely to be deficient in the diet of those who choose to avoid meat and meat products. Animal protein is obtained from meat, poultry, fish, eggs and cheese. Vegetable protein occurs in nuts, lentils, beans and peas. An average of $60-80 \mathrm{~g}$ daily is desirable. Those women deriving their protein intake solely from vegetable sources are likely to need vitamin B12 supplementation.</p>

                            <h4 id="fats">Fats</h4>
                            <p>Fats provide an important component of a balanced diet. Essential fatty acids may play an important part in cellular growth and in preventing the development of hypertension during pregnancy. Fats are also an important source of energy and a source of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D and K.</p>
                            <p>Animal fats are found in meat, eggs and dairy products and contain a high percentage of saturated fats. Vegetable fats, on the other hand, are important because they contain unsaturated fats such as linoleic and linolenic acids.</p>

                            <h4 id="carbohydrates">Carbohydrates</h4>
                            <p>Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for both mother and fetus and are therefore an essential dietary component during pregnancy. However, excessive carbohydrate consumption can result in excessive weight gain and fat accumulation, so a balanced dietary intake of carbohydrate is an essential. In particular, it should be remembered that there is a close correlation between maternal and fetal blood glucose levels and that glucose is the major source of energy for the fetus.</p>

                            <h4 id="minerals-vitamins">Minerals and vitamins</h4>
                            <p>Other than folic acid and possibly iodine, routine supplementation with iron and vitamins should not be necessary during pregnancy. However, where there is evidence of dietary deficiency or in cases of multiple gestations, iron and vitamin supplements should be given from the first trimester onwards.</p>
                            <p>The requirements for iron, calcium, iodine and various trace elements such as magnesium and zinc are all increased in pregnancy. These elements are found in lean meat, various stone fruits, beans and peas, dairy produce and seafood.</p>
                            <p>Vitamins A and B are found in kidney, liver and dark green vegetables. Vitamin B2 is found in whole grain and cereals, and Vitamin B5 in fish, lean meat, poultry and nuts.</p>
                            <p>Ascorbic acid is essential for fetal growth and maternal health and is found in citrus fruits, brussels sprouts and broccoli. Vitamin D and folic acid are also important. Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is becoming increasingly common. In those women who cover themselves completely for religious reasons or for protection against skin cancers, there is a risk of vitamin D deficiency. Testing and supplementation as needed from early pregnancy is recommended. Folic acid deficiency is still relatively common and is associated with the development of megaloblastic anaemia in pregnancy. Green vegetables, nuts and yeast are all rich sources of folic acid and are available and inexpensive year round in supermarkets so there is no need for these deficiencies to arise.</p>
                            <p>Where deficiencies do arise, this is generally because of dietary choice rather than from economic pressures. This situation can be overcome by giving folic acid supplements. In some urban environs, folate deficiency tends to be part of a pattern of malnutrition and should be anticipated in early pregnancy so that supplements of iron and folic acid can be given.</p>
                            <p>A general protocol for diet in pregnancy is given in Table 7.3.</p>

                            <h3 id="exercise">Exercise in pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>Pregnant women should be encouraged to undertake reasonable activity during pregnancy. This will be limited with advancing gestation by the physical restrictions imposed by the changes in abdominal size and by the balance restrictions imposed on the mother, but during early pregnancy there is no need to limit sporting activities beyond the common sense limits of avoiding excessive exertion and fatigue. There may be exceptions to this situation in women with a history of previous pregnancy losses. Swimming is a useful form of exercise, particularly in late pregnancy, when the water tends to support the enlarged maternal abdomen.</p>

                            <h3 id="coitus">Coitus in pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>There are no contraindications to coitus in normal pregnancies at any stage of gestation other than the physical difficulties imposed by changes in abdominal size. It is, however, sensible to avoid coitus where there is evidence of threatened miscarriage or a previous history of recurrent miscarriage. Because of the risk of introducing infection, it is also advisable to avoid coitus where there is evidence of prelabour rupture of the membranes and also where there is a history of antepartum haemorrhage. Women with a known placenta praevia are also advised to avoid intercourse.</p>

                            <p>Breastfeeding should be encouraged in all women unless there are specific contraindications that would have adverse fetal or maternal consequences. Previous damage to the breasts or grossly inverted nipples may make breast feeding difficult. There are also medications that are concentrated in breast milk and may be hazardous for the infant, in which case breastfeeding is contraindicated. In some maternal infections, such as HIV, breastfeeding is contraindicated. However, these circumstances are uncommon and, in most conditions, the mother should be advised of the benefits to both her child and herself of breast milk.</p>
                            <p>In the antenatal period, good personal hygiene including breast care should be encouraged. Colostrum may leak from the nipples, particularly in the third trimester, especially in multiparous women. The breasts should be supported with an appropriate maternity brassière. Antenatal referral to a lactation consultant for women who have risk factors for potentially encountering difficulty with breastfeeding such as previous difficulty, or breast surgery, should be offered.</p>

                            <p>Pregnancy and childbirth form one part of the complexities of life for the women who present for antenatal care. Supportive and extensive discussion will enable healthcare practitioners to develop an understanding of the woman and the other aspects in her life, including social and cultural factors, which may have a profound impact on her pregnancy outcome. Different cultural beliefs and expectations, socioeconomic status and supports, competing life priorities and levels of education can all impact strongly on pregnancy outcome. Acknowledgement and respect of cultural diversity will assist in providing appropriate and timely antenatal and peripartum care to all women.</p>

                            <p>The use of prescription and over the counter medications, as well as complementary and alternative medications, is common. Some women will require ongoing treatment of pre-existing medical conditions, e.g. epilepsy or asthma. Some conditions may develop de-novo in pregnancies that require therapy, e.g. gestational diabetes, thromboembolism. Simple analgesics, antipyretics, antihistamines and anti-emetics are all commonly consumed. A discussion of the risks and benefits of individual medications is beyond the scope of this text. Extensive information is available in most drug formularies about the safety of categories of drugs in pregnancy and lactation. Reputable online resources such as <a href="http://www.motherisk.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.motherisk.org</a> are available around the clock and often helpful. The safest course before prescribing in pregnancy is to always check. Many medications have been shown to have no adverse outcomes when used in pregnancy or lactation.</p>
                            <p>In general, simple analgesia is best provided by paracetamol which remains a safe drug to consume in pregnancy. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally contraindicated due to fetal effects. Metoclopramide as a first line anti-emetic is safe to consume in pregnancy, including during embryogenesis in the first trimester.</p>
