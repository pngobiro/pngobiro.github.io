                        <p>The term 'gynaecology' describes the study of diseases of the female genital tract and reproductive system. There is a continuum between gynaecology and obstetrics so that the division is somewhat arbitrary. Complications of early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks) such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy are generally considered under the title of gynaecology.</p>

                        <p>When taking a history, start by introducing yourself and explaining who you are. Details of the patient's name, age and occupation should always be recorded at the beginning of a consultation. The age of the patient will influence the likely diagnosis for a number of presenting problems. Occupation may be relevant both to the level of understanding that can be assumed and the impact of different gynaecological problems on the patient's life. The history should be comprehensive, but not intrusive in a manner that is not relevant to the patient's problem. For example, whilst it is essential to obtain a detailed sexual history from a young woman presenting with a genital tract infection, it would be both irrelevant and distressing to ask the same questions of an 80-year-old widow with a prolapse. The history must, therefore, be geared to the presenting symptom.</p>

                                <p>Ten percent of patients presenting to gynaecological services have psychiatric morbidity, and there is a significant association between adverse life events, depression and gynaecological symptoms. Remember: the presenting symptom may not always be related to the main anxiety of the patient and that some time and patience may be required to uncover the various problems that bring the patient to seek medical advice.</p>
                            </div>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>The presenting complaint</h3>
                        <p>The patient should be asked to describe the nature of her problem, and a simple statement of the presenting symptoms should be made in the case notes. A great deal can be learnt by using the actual words employed by the patient. It is important to ascertain the timescale of the problem and, where appropriate, the circumstances surrounding the onset of symptoms and their relationship to the menstrual cycle. It is also important to discover the degree of disability experienced for any given symptom. In many situations reassurance that there is no serious underlying pathology will provide sufficient 'treatment' because the actual disability may be minimal.</p>
                        <p>More detailed questions will depend on the nature of the presenting complaint. Disorders of menstruation are the commonest reason for gynaecological referral and a full menstrual history should be taken from all women of reproductive age (see below). Another common presenting symptom is abdominal pain, and the history must include details of the time of onset, the distribution and radiation of the pain and the relationship to the periods.</p>
                        <p>If vaginal discharge is the presenting symptom the colour, odour and relationship to the periods should be noted. It may also be associated with vulval pruritus, particularly in the presence of specific infections. The presence of an abdominal mass may be noted by the patient or may be detected during the course of a routine examination. Symptoms may also result from pressure of the mass on adjacent pelvic organs, such as the bladder and bowel.</p>
                        <p>Vaginal and uterine prolapse are associated with symptoms of a mass protruding through the vaginal introitus or difficulties with micturition and defecation. Common urinary symptoms include frequency of micturition, pain or dysuria, incontinence and the passage of blood in the urine (haematuria).</p>
                        <p>Where appropriate, a sexual history should include reference to the coital frequency, the occurrence of pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) and functional details relating to libido, sexual satisfaction and sexual problems (see Chapter 19).</p>

                        <h3>Menstrual history</h3>
                        <p>The first question that should be asked in relation to the menstrual history is the date of the last menstrual period.</p>
                        <p>The time of onset of the first period, the menarche, commonly occurs at 12 years of age and can be considered to be abnormally delayed over 16 years or abnormally early at 9 years. The absence of menstruation in a girl with otherwise normal development by the age of 16 is known as primary amenorrhoea. The term should be distinguished from the pubarche, which is the onset of the first signs of sexual maturation. Characteristically, the development of breasts and nipple enlargement predates the onset of menstruation by approximately 2 years (see Chapter 16).</p>

                        <p>The length of the menstrual cycle is the time between the first day of one period and the first day of the following period. Whilst there is usually an interval of 28 days, the cycle length may vary between 21 and 42 days in normal women and may only be significant where there is a change in menstrual pattern. It is important to be sure that the patient does not describe the time between the last day of one period and the first day of the next period, as this may give a false impression of the frequency of menstruation.</p>
                        <p>Absence of menstruation for more than 6 months in a woman who has previously had periods is known as secondary amenorrhoea. Oligomenorrhoea is the occurrence of 5 or fewer menstrual periods over 12 months.</p>
                        <p>The amount and duration of the bleeding may change with age but may also provide a useful indication of a disease process. Normal menstruation lasts from 4 to 7 days, and normal blood loss varies between 30 and 80 mL. A change in pattern is often more noticeable and significant than the actual time and volume of loss. In practical terms, excessive menstrual loss is best assessed on the history of the number of pads or tampons used during a period and the presence or absence of clots.</p>
                        <p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is any bleeding disturbance that occurs between menstrual periods or is excessive or prolonged. Intermenstrual bleeding is any bleeding that occurs between clearly defined cyclical, regular menses. Postcoital bleeding is non-menstrual bleeding that occurs during or after sexual intercourse. The term heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is now used to describe any excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding irrespective of whether the cycle is regular (menorrhagia) or irregular (metorrhagia).</p>
                        <p>The cessation of periods at the end of menstrual life is known as the menopause and bleeding which occurs more than 12 months after this is described as postmenopausal bleeding. A history of irregular vaginal bleeding or blood loss that occurs after coitus or between periods should be noted.</p>

                        <h3>Previous gynaecological history</h3>
                        <p>A detailed history of any previous gynaecological problems and treatments must be recorded. It is also important, where possible, to obtain any records of previous gynaecological surgery. Many women are uncertain of the precise nature of their operations. The amount of detail needed about previous pregnancies will depend on the presenting problem. In most cases the number of previous pregnancies and their outcome (miscarriage, ectopic or delivery after 20 weeks) is all that is required.</p>
                        <p>For all women of reproductive age who are sexually active it is essential to ask about contraception. This is important not only to determine the possibility of pregnancy, but because the method of contraception used may itself be relevant to the presenting complaint, e.g. irregular bleeding may occur on the contraceptive pill or when an intrauterine device is present. For women over the age of 18 years in Australia or 25 years in the UK ask about the date and result of the last cervical smear.</p>

                        <h3>Previous medical history</h3>
                        <p>This description should take particular account of any history of chronic lung disease and disorders of the cardiovascular system, as these are highly relevant where any surgical procedure is likely to be necessary. A record of all current medications (including non-prescription and alternative treatments) and any known drug allergies should be made. If she is planning a pregnancy in the near future check if she is taking folic acid supplements.</p>

                        <h3>Family and social history</h3>
                        <p>A social history is important with all problems but is particularly relevant where the presenting difficulties relate to abortion or sterilization. For example, a 15-year-old female requesting a termination of pregnancy may be put under substantial pressure by her parents to have an abortion and yet may not really be happy about following this course of action. Ask about smoking, alcohol and other recreational drug use.</p>

                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A general examination should always be performed at the first consultation, including assessment of pulse, blood pressure and temperature. Careful note should be taken of any signs of anaemia. The distribution of facial and body hair is often important, as hirsutism may be a presenting symptom of various endocrine disorders. Body weight and height should also be recorded.</p>
                        <p>The intimate nature of gynaecological examination makes it especially important to ensure that every effort is made to ensure privacy and that the examination is not interrupted by phone calls, bleeps or messages about other patients. The examination should ideally take place in a separate area to the consultation. The patient should be allowed to undress in privacy and if necessary empty her bladder first. After undressing there should be no undue delay prior to examination. Before starting the examination explain what will be involved in vaginal examination and verbal consent should be obtained and documented. The woman should be informed that she can ask for the examination to be stopped at any stage. A chaperone should generally be present irrespective of the gender of the gynaecologist.</p>

                        <h3>Breast examination</h3>
                        <p>Breast examination should be performed if there are symptoms or at the first consultation in women over the age of 45 years. The presence of the secretion of milk at times not associated with pregnancy, known as galactorrhoea, may indicate abnormal endocrine status. Systematic palpation with the flat of the hand should be undertaken to exclude the presence of any lumps in the breast or axillae (Fig. 15.1).</p>

                        <h3>Examination of the abdomen</h3>
                        <p>Inspection of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass. The distribution of body hair should be noted, and the presence of scars, striae and hernias. Palpation of the abdomen should take account of any guarding and rebound tenderness. It is important to ask the patient to outline the site and radiation of any pain in the abdomen, and palpation for enlargement of the liver, spleen and kidneys should be carried out. If there is a mass, try to determine if it is fixed or mobile, smooth or regular, and if it arises from the pelvis (you should not be able to palpate the lower edge above the pubic bone). Check the hernial orifices and feel for any enlarged lymph nodes in the groin. Percussion of the abdomen may be used to outline the limits of a tumour, to detect the presence of a full bladder or to recognize the presence of tympanitic loops of bowel. Free fluid in the peritoneal cavity will be recognized by the presence of dullness to percussion in the flanks and resonance over the central abdomen (Fig. 15.2).</p>
                        <p>Auscultation of bowel sounds is indicated in patients with postoperative abdominal distension or acute abdominal pain where obstruction or an ileus is suspected.</p>

                        <p>Pelvic examination should not be considered an automatic and inevitable part of every gynaecological consultation. You should consider what information will be gained by the examination, whether this is a screening or diagnostic procedure and whether it is necessary at this time.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be examined resting supine with the knees drawn up and separated or in stirrups in the lithotomy position (Fig. 15.3). Gloves should be worn on both hands during vaginal and speculum examinations.</p>

                        <p>Parting the lips of the labia minora with the left hand, look at the external urethral meatus and inspect the vulva for any discharge, redness, ulceration and old scars. Speculum examination should be performed before digital examination to avoid any contamination with lubricant. A bivalve or Cusco's speculum is most commonly used, and enables a clear view of the cervix to be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Holding the lips of the labia minora open with the left hand, insert the speculum into the introitus with the widest part dimension of the instrument in the transverse position as the vagina is widest in this direction. When the speculum reaches the top of the vagina gently open the blades and visualize the cervix (Fig. 15.4). Make a note of the presence of any discharge or bleeding from the cervix and of any polyps or areas of ulceration. Remember that the appearance of the cervix is changed after childbirth with the external os more irregular and slit like.</p>
                        <p>The commonest finding is of a so-called erosion or ectropion. This is an area of cervical epithelium around the cervical os that appears a darker red colour than the smooth pink of the rest of the cervix. It is not an erosion at all, but normal columnar epithelium extending from the endocervical canal onto the ectocervix. If the clinical history suggests possible infection, take swabs from the vaginal fornices and cervical os and place in transport medium to look for Candida, Trichomonas and Neisseria and take a separate swab from the endocervix for Chlamydia.</p>
                        <p>Where vaginal wall prolapse is suspected, a Sims' speculum should be used, as it provides a clearer view of the vaginal walls. Where the Sims' speculum is used, it is preferable to examine the patient in the semiprone or Sims' position (Fig. 15.5).</p>

                            <h3>ABC Taking a cervical smear (Fig. 15.6)</h3>
                            <p>This should be done at least 3 months after pregnancy and not during menstruation. Explain the purpose of the test and warn the patient that she may notice some spotting afterwards.</p>
                            <p>Record the patient's name and hospital number on a suitable slide. After inserting a speculum as above wipe away any discharge or blood. Note the appearance of the cervix. A 360° sweep should be taken with a suitable spatula or brush pressed firmly against the cervix at the junction of the columnar epithelium of the endocervical canal and the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix and rotated in clockwise direction five times.</p>
                            <p>There are two methods by which cells are transferred onto a slide for staining and inspection by a cytologist or pathologist. In a conventional Pap smear the specimen is spread immediately on to a clear glass slide in a thin even layer. The slide is fixed with 95% alcohol alone or in combination with 3% glacial acetic acid. Fixation requires 30 minutes in solution. In liquid-based cytology (LBC) the sampling device is transferred into the preservative solution vial by pushing the broom into the bottom of the vial 10 times, forcing the bristles apart. The solution is then passed through a filter that traps the large squamous cells but allows smaller red cells, debris and bacteria to pass through. The squamous cells are then transferred to a slide. The sensitivity of both methods for the detection of abnormal cells is similar, although the rate of unsatisfactory smears is lower in LBC. LBC also allows for testing for human Papilloma virus and Chlamydia infection.</p>
                            <p>Finally, complete the cytology request form with details of previous smears, last period, contraception and results of previous smears.</p>

                            <h3>ABC Taking vaginal swabs</h3>
                            <p>The indications are for symptoms of vaginal discharge, irregular bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease. Swabs may also be taken to screen for sexually transmitted infection in asymptomatic women.</p>
                            <p>A high vaginal swab is taken as part of speculum examination by dipping the tip of a culture swab moistened in culture media in the posterior vaginal fornix and then placing the swab immediately back into a suitable culture medium. This is used mainly to identify organisms such a Candida or Trichomonas and in the assessment of bacterial vaginosis.</p>
                            <p>Endocervical swabs are taken by inserting the tip of the swab into the external cervical os and rotating two or three times. Using standard culture media as for the high vaginal swab this can be used to test for Neiserra Gonorrhoea. Testing for Chlamydia infection is also done by swabbing the endocervix. Instead of culturing the organism the presence of chlamydial DNA is tested using polymerase chain reaction by placing the swab in specialized collection fluid in a plastic vial.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Bimanual examination</h3>
                        <p>Bimanual examination is performed by introducing the middle finger of the examining hand into the vaginal introitus and applying pressure towards the rectum (Fig. 15.7). As the introitus opens, the index finger is introduced as well. The cervix is palpated and has the consistency of the cartilage of the tip of the nose. It must be remembered that the abdominal hand is used to compress the pelvic organs on to the examining vaginal hand. The size, shape, consistency and position of the uterus must be noted. The uterus is commonly pre-axial or anteverted, but will be postaxial or retroverted in some 10% of women. Provided the retroverted uterus is mobile, the position is rarely significant. It is important to feel in the pouch of Douglas for the presence of thickening or nodules, and then to palpate laterally in both fornices for the presence of any ovarian or tubal masses. An attempt should be made to differentiate between adnexal and uterine masses, although this is often not possible. For example, a pedunculated fibroid may mimic an ovarian tumour, whereas a solid ovarian tumour, if adherent to the uterus, may be impossible to distinguish from a uterine fibroid. The ovaries may be palpable in the normal pelvis if the patient is thin, but the Fallopian tubes are only palpable if they are significantly enlarged.</p>

                        <p>In a child or in a woman with an intact hymen, speculum and pelvic examination is usually not performed unless as part of an examination under anaesthesia. It should always be remembered that a rough or painful examination rarely produces any useful information and, in certain situations such as tubal ectopic pregnancy, may be dangerous. Throughout the examination remain alert to verbal and non-verbal indications of distress from the patient. Any request that the examination be discontinued should be respected (Box 15.1).</p>

                        <h3>Special circumstances</h3>
                        <p>Except in an emergency situation, pelvic examination should not be carried out for non-English-speaking patients without an interpreter. You should be aware of, and sensitive to, factors that may make the examination more difficult for the woman with particular cultural or religious expectations.</p>
                        <p>Women who experience difficulty with vaginal examination should be given every opportunity to facilitate disclosure of any underlying sexual or marital difficulties or traumas. However, it must not be assumed that all women who experience difficulty with pelvic examination have a background history of sexual abuse, domestic violence or sexual difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The basic principles of respect, privacy, explanation and consent that apply to the conduct of gynaecological examinations in general apply equally to the conduct of such examinations in women who have temporary or permanent learning disabilities or mental illness.</p>
                        <p>When examining anaesthetized patients, all staff should treat the woman with the same degree of sensitivity and respect as if she were awake.</p>
                        <p>Exceptional gentleness should be displayed in the examination of victims of alleged sexual assault. The woman should be given a choice about the gender of the doctor and be allowed to control the pace of, and her position for, the examination.</p>

                        <h3>Rectal examination</h3>
                        <p>Rectal examination may be indicated if there are symptoms such as change of bowel habit or rectal bleeding, which may suggest bowel disease. It is occasionally used as a means of assessing a pelvic mass and in conjunction with a vaginal examination can provide additional information about disease in the rectovaginal septum.</p>

                            <p>This is Ms Smith, a 29 year-old housewife who has been referred by her general practitioner to the clinic because of bleeding and a positive pregnancy test. Ms Smith has had three episodes of painless vaginal bleeding over the last 3 days. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago and prior to this she had a regular 28-day menstrual cycle. She has no previous gynaecological history of note and her last cervical smear was 2 years ago and was negative. This is a planned pregnancy and before conceiving she was using the combined oral contraceptive pill until 3 months ago. She has had two previous pregnancies with uncomplicated normal vaginal deliveries at term. She underwent an appendicectomy at the age of 14 and had no problems with the general anaesthetic at the time. She is currently taking folic acid and has no known allergies. She lives with her partner and two children. She does not smoke or drink.</p>
                            <p>In summary, Ms Smith is a 29-year-old lady with a history of painless vaginal bleeding at 7 weeks in her third pregnancy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Unless you are asked only to discuss one particular part of the examination always start by commenting on the patient's general condition including pulse and blood pressure. For abdominal examination, list the findings on inspection first followed by those on palpation and percussion (if there is abdominal distension or a mass). If there is a mass arising from the pelvis describe it in terms of a pregnant uterus, e.g. a mass reaching the umbilicus would be a 20 week size pelvic mass. If there are areas of tenderness specify whether they are associated with signs of peritonism (guarding and rebound). On pelvic examination, describe the findings on inspection of the vulva and then of the cervix (if a speculum examination was carried out). Describe the size, position and mobility of the uterus and any tenderness. Finally, say whether there were any palpable masses or tenderness in the adnexae.</p>

                            <h3>ABC Example of presentation of clinical findings</h3>
                            <p>On general examination Ms Smith looked well. She was not clinically anaemic and her body mass index was 31. Her blood pressure was 110/70 and her pulse 88 and regular. Examination of the chest and heart was unremarkable. On abdominal examination there was a scar in the right lower quadrant consistent with a previous appendicectomy. On palpation the abdomen was soft and non-tender with no palpable masses and no organomegaly. On pelvic examination the external genitalia were normal apart from an old scar on the perineum consistent with a previous tear or episiotomy. On speculum examination the cervix was closed and there was a small amount of free blood in the vagina. She had an 8-week sized, mobile, anteverted uterus and there were no palpable adnexal masses.</p>
