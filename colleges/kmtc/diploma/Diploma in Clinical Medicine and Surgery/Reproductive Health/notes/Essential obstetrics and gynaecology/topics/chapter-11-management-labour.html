                            <p>Labour or parturition is the process whereby the products of conception are expelled from the uterine cavity after the 24th week of gestation. About 93–94% deliver at term, i.e. between 37 to 42 weeks, while about 7–8% develop preterm labour and deliver preterm from 24 to 37 weeks. Preterm labour is defined as labour occurring before the commencement of the 37th week of gestation. Prior to 24 weeks this process results in a previable fetus and is termed miscarriage. Prolonged labour is defined as labour lasting in excess of 24 hours in a primigravida and 16 hours in a multigravida. Prolonged labour is associated with increased fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality.</p>

The cervix ripens by becoming softer, shorter and dilating, which takes a greater speed with onset of uterine contractions.</p>
                            <p>For purposes of clinical management, 'observed' labour is a continuum that is divided into three stages:</p>

The first stage is divided into an early latent phase when the cervix becomes effaced and shorter from 3 cm in length and dilates up to 3 cm, and an active phase when the cervix dilates from 3 cm to full dilatation or 10 cm.</span>

                            <p>It is often difficult to be certain of the exact time of onset of labour because contractions may be irregular and may start and stop with no cervical change, i.e. 'false labour'. The duration of labour for management purposes is based on the observed progress of the contractions and cervical changes along with the descent of the head. This concept may have to be judged based on the place of practice, as in some remote areas a mother may be brought in after a day of labour with no progress. Her general condition and findings of the maternal and fetal conditions should dictate management. In the rare cases of cervical stenosis that can occur after surgery to the cervix, normal contractions of labour may produce thinning of the cervix without cervical dilatation.</p>
                            <p>The clinical signs of the onset of labour are:</p>

                            <h3>The initiation of labour</h3>
                            <p>The onset of labour involves progesterone withdrawal and increases in oestrogen and prostaglandin action. The mechanisms that regulate these changes are unresolved but likely involve placental production of the peptide hormone corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH).</p>
                            <p>During pregnancy, painless irregular uterine activity is present. It is minimal in early pregnancy and greater with advancing gestation. There is a cascade of events regulated and controlled by the fetoplacental unit. At the end of gestation, there is gradual downregulation of those factors that keep the uterus and cervix quiescent and an upregulation of procontractile influences.</p>
                            <p>Placental development across gestation leads to an exponential increase in the number of syncytiotrophoblast nuclei in which transcription of the CRH gene occurs. This maturational process leads to an exponential increase in the levels of maternal and fetal plasma CRH. The CRH has direct actions on the placenta to increase oestrogen synthesis and reduce progesterone synthesis. In the fetus the CRH directly stimulates the fetal zone of the adrenal gland to produce dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) the precursor of placental oestrogen synthesis. CRH also stimulates the synthesis of prostaglandins by the membranes. The fall in progesterone and increase in oestrogens and prostaglandins leads to increases in connexin 43 that promotes connectivity of uterine myocytes and changes uterine myocyte electrical excitability, which in turn leads to increases in generalized uterine contractions:</p>

                            <p>The integrity of the cervix is essential to retain the products of conception. It contains myocytes and fibroblasts, and towards term becomes soft and stretchable due to an increase in leucocyte infiltration and a decrease in the amount of collagen with the increase in proteolytic enzyme activity. Increased production of hyaluronic acid reduces the affinity of fibronectin for collagen. The affinity of hyaluronic acid for water causes the cervix to become soft and stretchable, i.e. ripening of the cervix.</p>
                            <p>Reduced cervical resistance (i.e. release of the brakes in a car) and increasing frequency, duration and strength of uterine contractions (i.e. accelerator of the car) are needed for the progress of labour. The first stage of labour that starts from onset of painful uterine contractions to full dilatation is divided into a slow latent phase when the cervix becomes shorter, i.e. effaced and dilated to 3–4 cm (an average of 6–8 hours in nulliparae and 4–6 hours in a multiparae) and an active phase of labour when the cervix dilates at an average of 1 cm per hour from 3–4 cm to full cervical dilatation.</p>

                            <p>The uterus exhibits infrequent, low-intensity contractions throughout pregnancy. As full term approaches, uterine activity increases in frequency, duration and strength of contractions. By palpation or external tocography one can identify the frequency and duration of contractions, but intrauterine pressure catheters are needed to assess the strength of contractions. It is likely that labour is established if two contractions each lasting for >20 seconds are observed in 10 minutes. Normal resting tonus in labour starts at around 10–20 mmHg and increases slightly during the course of labour (Fig 11.1). Contractions increase in intensity with progress of labour which in some ways are characterized by the duration of contractions. WHO recommends contraction recording on the partograph based on the frequency and duration of contractions.</p>

                            <p>Progressive uterine contractions cause effacement and dilatation of the cervix as the result of shortening of myometrial fibres in the upper uterine segment and stretching and thinning of the lower uterine segment (Fig. 11.2). This process is known as retraction. The lower segment becomes elongated and thinned as labour progresses and the junction between the upper and lower segment rises in the abdomen. Where labour becomes obstructed, the junction of the upper and lower segments may become visible at the level of the umbilicus; this is known as a retraction ring (also known as Bandl's ring).</p>

                            <p>A pacemaker for the uterus has never been demonstrated by anatomical, pharmacological, electrical or physiological studies. The electrical contraction impulse starts in one or the other uterine fundal region and spreads downwards through the myometrium. Contractions are stronger and last longer in the fundus and upper segment than in the lower segment. This fundal dominance is essential for progressive effacement and dilatation of the cervix. As the uterus and the round ligaments contract, the axis of the uterus straightens and pulls the longitudinal axis of the fetus towards the anterior abdominal wall in line with the inlet of the true pelvis.</p>
                            <p>The realignment of the uterine axis promotes descent of the presenting part as the fetus is pushed directly downwards into the pelvic cavity (Fig. 11.3).</p>

                            <p>The shape and structure of the bony pelvis has already been described (see Chapter 6). The size and shape of the pelvis vary from woman to woman and not all women have a gynaecoid pelvis; some may have platypelloid, anthropoid or android pelvis thus influencing the outcome of labour. Softening of the sacroiliac ligaments and the pubic symphysis allow expansion of the pelvic cavity, and this feature along with the dynamic changes of the head diameter brought about by flexion, rotation and moulding facilitate normal progress and spontaneous vaginal delivery.</p>
                            <p>The soft tissues of the pelvis are more distensible than in the non-pregnant state. Substantial distension of the pelvic floor and vaginal orifice occurs during the descent and birth of the head. The distensible nature of the pelvic soft tissues, vagina and perineum help to reduce the risk of tearing of the perineum and vaginal walls during descent and birth of the head.</p>

                            <p>The pelvic inlet offers a larger lateral than an anteroposterior diameter. This promotes the head to normally engage in the pelvis in the transverse position. The passage of the head and trunk through the pelvis follows a well-defined pattern because the upper pelvic strait is transverse, the middle pelvic strait is circular and the outer pelvic strait is anteroposterior. The fetal head presents by the vertex in 95% of the cases and hence is called normal presentation. With the vertex presentation the head is well flexed in 90% of the cases and the head rotates to an occipitoanterior position and presents the shortest diameters, i.e. anteroposterior suboccipito bregmatic (9.5 cm) and lateral biparietal (9.5 cm) diameters, hence occipitoanterior position where the occiput is in the anterior half of the pelvis is called normal position. A deflexed or extended head presents as an occipitoposterior or transverse position and with further extension as a brow or face presentation. Labour with an occipitoposterior position is prolonged as a larger anteroposterior diameter of occipitobregmatic or occipitofrontal diameter (11.5 cm) presents to the pelvis. With the brow presentation, entry of the head into the pelvic brim is difficult as it presents the largest anteroposterior-mento vertical diameter (13.5 cm). The brow presentation can flex to a vertex or extend to a face presentation. If there is no progress the baby is best delivered by caesarean section in a term brow presentation.</p>
                            <p>The process of normal labour therefore involves the adaptation of the fetal head to the various segments and diameters of the maternal pelvis and the following processes occur (Fig. 11.4):</p>

                            <p>The third stage of labour starts with the completed expulsion of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta and membranes (Fig. 11.5).</p>
                            <p>Once the baby is delivered, the uterine muscle contracts, shearing off the placenta and pushing it into the lower segment and the vault of the vagina.</p>
                            <p>The classic signs of placental separation include trickling of bright blood, lengthening of the umbilical cord and elevation of the uterine fundus within the abdominal cavity. The uterine fundus becomes firm to hard and smaller and rounded instead of being broad and globular and sits on top of the placenta as it descends into the lower segment.</p>
                            <p>The duration of placental separation may be compressed by the use of oxytocic drugs administered at the delivery of the anterior shoulder.</p>
                            <p>As the placenta is expelled, it is accompanied by the fetal membranes, although the membranes often become torn and may require additional traction by using a sponge forceps to grasp them. Uterine exploration is rarely needed to complete their removal.</p>
                            <p>The whole process lasts between 5 and 10 minutes. If the placenta is not expelled within 30 minutes, a diagnosis of retained placenta is made and the third stage should be considered to be abnormal.</p>
                            <p>Most complications of labour and delivery such as postpartum haemorrhage, pelvic or perineal haematoma and any deterioration of the maternal or newborn condition takes place within the first few hours of delivery and hence in most settings the mother and baby are closely examined with periodic observations in the delivery unit for up to 2 hours before the mother and baby are sent to the postnatal ward. The observations are continued for 6 hours if the mother is to be discharged home from the delivery unit.</p>

                            <p>Contractions in labour are invariably associated with pain, particularly as they increase in strength, frequency and duration with progress of labour. The cause of pain is uncertain but it may be due to compression of nerve fibres in the cervical zone or to hypoxia of compressed muscle cells. Pain is felt in the lower abdomen and as lumbar backache when the intrauterine pressure exceeds 25 mmHg.</p>

                                THE MANAGEMENT OF NORMAL LABOUR

                            <p>The primary aim of intrapartum care is to deliver a healthy baby to a healthy mother. The preparation of the mother for the process of parturition begins well before the onset of labour. It is important for the mother and her partner to understand what actually happens during the various stages of labour. Strategies to deal with pain in labour, including mental preparation with controlled respiration, should be introduced during antenatal classes, as well as educating the mother about the regulation of expulsive efforts during the second stage of labour.</p>
                            <p>Antenatal classes should also include instructions about neonatal care and breastfeeding, although this is a process that requires reinforcement in the postdelivery period.</p>
                            <p>The mother should be advised to come into hospital, or to call the midwife in the event of a home birth, when contractions are at regular 10–15 minute intervals, when there is a show or if and when the membranes rupture. If the mother is in early labour, she should be encouraged to take a shower and to empty her bowels and bladder. Shaving of the pubic hair or abdomen is no longer considered necessary and is likely to cause abrasions with some bleeding that may become the nidus for bacterial proliferation and subsequent infection.</p>
                            <p>The home birth rate in the UK is about 2–3% but it is common practice to organize 'domino' (domiciliary in and out) deliveries, whereby the mother is discharged home 6 hours after delivery, provided that the delivery is uncomplicated.</p>

                            <h3>Observation: the use of the partogram</h3>
                            <p>The introduction of graphic records of progress of cervical dilatation and descent of the head was a major advance in the management of labour. It enables the early recognition of a labour that is non-progressive. The partogram (Fig. 11.6) is a single sheet of paper on which there is a graphic representation of progress in labour. On the same sheet other observations related to labour can be entered. There are sections to enter the frequency and duration of contractions, fetal heart rate (FHR), colour of liquor, caput and moulding, station or descent of the head, maternal heart rate, BP and temperature. The partogram should be started as soon as the mother is admitted to the delivery suite and this is recorded as zero time regardless of the time at which contractions started. However, the point of entry on to the partogram depends on a vaginal assessment at the time of admission to the delivery suite. The value of this type of record system is that it draws attention visually to any aberration from normal progress in labour.</p>
                            <p>The use of partograms at an applied level was first introduced in remote obstetric units in Africa, where recognition that progress in labour is becoming abnormal enables early transfer to specialist units before serious obstruction occurs.</p>
                            <p>This has led to a major reduction in maternal mortality due to avoidance of uterine rupture, sepsis and postpartum haemorrhage and reduction in severe morbidity of vesico or recto vaginal fistula. Earlier recognition of obstructed labours and immediate attention by caesarean delivery where indicated prevents such tragedies.</p>

                            <h4>Fetal condition</h4>
                            <p>The fetal heart rate is charted as beats/min and decelerations of heart rate that occur during contractions are recorded by an arrow down to the lowest heart rate recorded on the partogram. These records are an adjunct to the actual recording of auscultated FHR in the notes and/or electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) by continuous cardiotocography (CTG).</p>
                            <p>The time of rupture of the membranes and the nature of the amniotic fluid, i.e. whether it is clear or meconiumstained, are also recorded. Moulding of the fetal head and the presence of caput are also noted as they provide an indicator of obstructed labour. The suture lines meeting is moulding +, over riding but reducible with gentle pressure is ++, and overriding and not reducible with gentle pressure is +++. The soft tissue swelling of the scalp called caput is also marked from + to +++ but is based on relative impression formed by the clinician.</p>

                            <h4>Progress in labour</h4>
                            <p>Progress in labour is measured by assessing the rate of cervical dilatation and descent of the presenting part. The progress is assessed by vaginal examination on admission and every 3 to 4 hours afterwards during the first stage of labour. Cervical dilatation is plotted in cm along the scale of 0–10 of the cervicograph. The cervix is expected to efface and dilate from 0 to 3 cm (latent phase) in 6 hours in a multipara and 8 hours in a nullipara, followed by approximately 1 cm per hour from 3 to 10 cm dilatation (active phase) in nulli and multipara although multipara tend to dilate faster. The expected progress recorded on the chart at a rate of 1 cm per hour from admission dilatation in the active phase of labour is called the alert line which helps to identify those who are progressing slowly. A line 2 hours parallel with the alert line called the action line can be drawn to decide on when to actively intervene with artificial rupture of membranes or oxytocin infusion to augment labour in the absence of malpresentation, disproportion or concern for fetal condition.</p>
                            <p>If the progress of cervical dilatation lags more than 2 hours behind the expected rate of dilatation, it will cut the action line indicating the poor progress in the active phase of labour. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines suggest that when encountered with slow progress of &lt;1 cm in 3 hours with no other changes such as cervical effacement or descent of the head in the presence of ruptured membranes, cephalopelvic disproportion should be excluded and labour augmented with an oxytocin infusion. Descent of the station of the head is charted on the partogram based on the palpable portion of the head above the pelvic brim in fifths, i.e. whether it needs 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 finger to cover the head.</p>
                            <p>The station of the head is plotted on the 0–5 gradation of the partogram.</p>
                            <p>Descent is also recorded by assessing the level of the presenting part in cm above or below the level of the ischial spines and marked as -1, -2, and -3 when it is above the spines and +1, +2, and +3 if it is below the spines.</p>
                            <p>The nature and frequency of the uterine contractions are recorded on the chart by shading in the number of contractions per 10 minutes. Dotted squares indicate contractions of less than 20 seconds duration, cross-hatched squares are contractions between 20 and 40 seconds duration, while contractions lasting longer than 40 seconds are shown by complete shading of the squares. Frequency and duration of contractions can be measured by clinical palpation or external tocography. The intensity of contractions cannot be assessed by the degree of pain felt by the mother or by palpating the uterus abdominally and can only be determined by intrauterine pressure catheters. However intrauterine catheters are not used routinely in management of labour because their use has been shown not to improve the outcome of labour.</p>

                            <p>In most maternity units in the developed world, caesarean section rates now exceed 20%. The issue of what can be taken by mouth therefore becomes particularly important. If there is a likelihood that the mother will need operative delivery under general anaesthesia, then it is clearly important to avoid oral intake at any significant level during the first stage of labour. Delayed gastric emptying may result in vomiting and inhalation of vomitus if general anaesthesia for operative delivery is needed. On the other hand, most operative deliveries are now achieved under regional anaesthesia and therefore there is a case for giving some fluids and light nutrition orally if labour is progressing normally and a vaginal delivery can be anticipated. Recent clinical trials have suggested little concern with feeding the mother with soft easily digestible solid nutrition in addition to fluids. Intravenous fluid replacement should be considered after 6 hours in labour if delivery is not imminent. The major cause of acidosis and ketosis is dehydration, and urine should be checked for ketones in addition to sugar and protein whenever mother passes urine. Administration of normal saline or Hartmann's solution is preferred and the fluid input and output should be monitored not to over or under hydrate the mother.</p>
                            <p>The classic signs of dehydration in labour include tachycardia, mild pyrexia and loss of tissue turgor. Remember that labour can be hard physical work and that the environmental temperature of delivery rooms is often raised to meet the needs of the baby rather than the mother, leading to considerable insensible fluid loss.</p>

                                PAIN RELIEF IN LABOUR
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are a number of strategies used in labour for the relief of pain and these should be discussed with the pregnant mother in the antenatal period. Essentially, these techniques are aimed at reducing the level of pain experienced in labour whilst invoking minimal risk for the mother and baby.</p>
                            <p>The level of pain experienced in labour varies widely, some experience very little whilst others suffer from abdominal and back pain of increasing intensity throughout their labour. Thus, any programme for pain relief must be tailored to the needs of the individual. The care giver may be able to advise the best mode of pain relief based on whether the mother is nulliparous or multiparous, the current cervical dilatation, the rate of progress of labour and the extent to which the mother is feeling the pain. The mode of pain relief is best decided by the mother based on the advice given. Often this may result in a combination of methods, starting from the least to most effective method to alleviate her pain. The only technique that can provide complete pain relief is epidural analgesia.</p>

                            <h3>Narcotic analgesia</h3>
                            <p>Pethidine has traditionally been the most widely used narcotic agent but has been replaced in many centres in the UK and Australia by morphine. The common side effects for all the opiates are nausea and vomiting in the mother and respiratory depression in the baby. The effect on the neonate is particularly important when the drug is given within 2 hours of delivery. Opiates are often administered with anti-emetics to reduce nausea.</p>
                            <p>Remifentanil is used in some centres as this is an ultra-short-acting opioid that produces superior analgesia to pethidine and has less of an effect on neonatal respiration.</p>
                            <p>Because some mothers are unsuitable for regional analgesia, e.g. those on anticonvulsants, opiates are likely to continue to play a significant role in pain relief in labour.</p>

                            <h3>Inhalational analgesia</h3>
                            <p>These agents are used in early labour until the mother switches to much stronger analgesics. It is best for short-term pain relief in the late first and second stage of labour. The most widely used agent is entonox, which is a 50/50 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen. The gas is self-administered to avoid overdosing when they drop the mask off and is inhaled as soon as the contraction starts. Entonox is the most widely used analgesic in labour in the UK and provides sufficient pain relief for the majority.</p>
                            <p>Nitrous oxide has been shown to have adverse effects on birth attendants if exposure is prolonged; these effects include decreased fertility, bone marrow changes and neurological changes. Forced air change every 6–10 hours is effective in reducing the nitrous oxide levels and should be mandatory in all delivery rooms.</p>

                            <h3>Non-pharmacological methods</h3>
                            <p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) involves the placement of two pairs of TENS electrodes on the back on each side of the vertebral column at the levels of T10–L1 and S2–S4. Currents of 0–40 mA are applied at a frequency of 40–150 Hz. This can be effective in early labour but is often inadequate by itself in late labour. For the technique to be effective, antenatal training of the mother is essential.</p>
                            <p>Other non-invasive methods include acupuncture, subcutaneous sterile water injections, massage and relaxation techniques: the effectiveness of which are debated.</p>

                            <h3>Regional analgesia</h3>
                            <p>Epidural analgesia is the most effective and widely used form of regional analgesia. It provides complete relief of pain in 95% of labouring women.</p>
                            <p>The procedure may be instituted at any time and does not interfere with uterine contractility. It may reduce the desire to bear down in the second stage of labour due to lack of pressure sensation at the perineum and reduced uterine activity due to loss of 'Ferguson reflex': which is an increased uterine activity due to reflex release of oxytocin due to the presenting part stretching the cervix and upper vagina.</p>
                            <p>A fine catheter is introduced into the lumbar epidural space and a local anaesthetic agent such as bupivacaine is injected (Fig. 11.7). The addition of an opioid to the local anaesthetic greatly reduces the dose requirement of bupivacaine, thus sparing the motor fibres to the lower limbs and reducing the classic complications of hypotension and abnormal fetal heart rate.</p>

                                    <p>Many women set out in labour without requesting any form of pain relief. However, as labour progresses, the realization that labour can be painful will change the requirements of the mother. It is therefore essential to have an epidural service that can be readily available so that the labour is not too far advanced before the epidural can become established.</p>

                            <h3>Other forms of regional anaesthesia</h3>
                            <p>Spinal anaesthesia is commonly used for operative delivery, particularly as a single-shot procedure. It is not used for control of pain in labour because of the superior safety of epidural analgesia and the ability to top up with suitable doses or as continuous infusion to get pain relief over a long period of time.</p>
                            <p>Paracervical blockade involves the infiltration of local anaesthetic agents into the paracervical tissues. This is rarely used for obstetric procedures and has the greater chance of side effects to the fetus should it enter a vessel.</p>
                            <p>Pudendal nerve blockade involves infiltration around the pudendal nerve as it leaves the pudendal canal and the inferior haemorrhoidal nerve (Fig. 11.8). It was a widely used form of local anaesthesia for operative vaginal deliveries in the past but is now less frequently used as it has been replaced by epidural anaesthesia.</p>

Toxic symptoms such as cardiac arrhythmias and convulsions may result from accidental injection of the anaesthetic drug especially with larger dosage.</p>

However, most women prefer to lie down as labour advances into the second stage, although some will prefer to squat to use the forces of gravity to help expel the baby. In the past, women who had epidural anaesthesia had to remain supine because of temporary motor impairment. This has been overcome by the use of low-dose anaesthesia combined with opiates. With such mixed epidurals women are able to move about and often ambulate.</p>

                            <p>Changes in the fetal heart rate or the passage of new meconium-stained liquor (fetal bowel motion) may suggest possibility of fetal hypoxia. These signs can occur in normal labour but more so in high risk pregnancies and need to be studied to determine the fetal condition; if necessary with the adjunct use of fetal scalp blood sampling (FBS). Diminution of fetal movements (FM) on admission may indicate fetal jeopardy and cessation of movements may indicate death and hence enquiry about FM should be made on admission in labour.</p>

                            <h3>Intermittent auscultation</h3>
                            <p>During labour, the FHR is monitored every 15 minutes for a period of 1 minute soon after a contraction using a handheld Doppler ultrasound transducer or pinard fetal stethoscope in the first stage of labour. In the second stage the FHR is auscultated every 5 minutes or every other contraction. Contractions are monitored by manual palpation over a period of 10 minutes to determine the frequency and duration. The frequency of intermittent auscultation (IA) was recommended on the basis that there was no difference in fetal and neonatal outcome in randomized studies that compared IA every 15 minutes for 1 minute after a contraction in the first stage and every 5 minutes in the second stage with EFM.</p>
                            <p>The clinical guidelines for the use of electronic fetal monitoring have been produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK and Australia and New Zealand and by similar bodies in USA and Canada as well as by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK. They have great similarities and minor differences that are unlikely to influence clinical outcome. Admission cardiotocogram or routine CTG using electronic monitoring is not recommended for women classified as low risk.

                            <h3>Fetal cardiotocography</h3>
                            <p>Electronic fetal monitoring enables continuous monitoring of the fetal heart rate and the frequency and duration of uterine contractions. The heart rate of the fetus is usually calculated using a Doppler ultrasound transducer, which is applied externally to the maternal abdomen. The signals that are detected are those of cardiac movement and what is actually measured is the time interval between cardiac cycles. Traditionally, this is converted to heart rate. The heart rate can also be measured from the RR wave intervals obtained from the fetal electrocardiogram by direct application of an electrode to the presenting part.</p>
                            <p>Uterine activity is recorded either with a pressure transducer applied over the anterior abdominal wall between the fundus and the umbilicus or by inserting a fluid-filled catheter or a pressure sensor into the uterine cavity through the cervical canal (Fig. 11.9). External tocography gives an accurate measurement of the frequency and duration but only relative information of intrauterine pressure. Accurate measurements of pressure needs an intrauterine catheter or transducer and is not used as a routine in most centres due to lack of evidence of its clinical benefit.</p>

                            <h3>Basal heart rate</h3>
                            <p>The definition of normality in the pattern of the fetal heart rate is easier than defining what is abnormal. The normal heart rate varies between 110 and 160 beats/min (Fig. 11.10). A rate faster than 160 is defined as fetal tachycardia and a rate less than 110 is fetal bradycardia.</p>

                            <h3>Baseline variability</h3>
                            <p>The heart rate exhibits variations from the baseline, which is known as baseline variability. Although there is variability on a beat-to-beat basis, this is not what is recorded by the standard cardiotocograph and cannot be recorded at the standard paper speed of 1 cm/min. Baseline variability is a record of the oscillations in heart rate around the baseline heart rate and normally varies between 5 and 25 beats/min. Baseline variability is due to the millisecond-to-millisecond reaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity on the heart and reflects the integrity of the autonomic nervous system. It is reduced during the fetal sleep phase. Hypoxia, infection and medication can reduce baseline variability. A fetal heart rate with a variability of less than 5 beats/min for >90 min is abnormal and may indicate fetal jeopardy.</p>

                            <h4>Accelerations</h4>
                            <p>Accelerations are defined as transient abrupt increases in heart rate of more than 15 beats/min for more than 15 seconds and are associated with fetal movements. Accelerations are a reflection of the activity of the somatic nervous system and is a reassuring sign of good fetal health.</p>

                            <h4>Decelerations</h4>
                            <p>Decelerations are defined as decreases in heart rate of more than 15 beats/min for more than 15 seconds. These are defined both by their relationship to uterine contractions and by their intensity. There are different patterns of decelerations and these are related to the physical mechanism that causes them. Some patterns of change are generally considered to have clinical significance in relation to hypoxia.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Early decelerations:</strong> These decelerations are synchronous with uterine contractions and the nadir occurs at the peak of the contraction and the decrease in heart rate is generally less than 40 beats/min. These decelerations are generally due to head compression and are considered to be physiological. Hence they are seen in the late first and second stages of labour.</li>
                                <li><strong>Late decelerations:</strong> The onset of the slowing of heart rate occurs well after the contraction is established and does not return to the normal baseline rate until at least 20 seconds after the contraction is completed. Late decelerations are due to placental insufficiency and with repeated such decelerations, rise in the base line rate and reduction in baseline variability it may be indicative of fetal hypoxia.</li>
                                <li><strong>Variable decelerations:</strong> Variable decelerations vary in timing and amplitude, hence their name. They have an initial slight transitory rise in the baseline rate followed by a precipitous fall followed by a quick recovery to the normal baseline rate and slightly beyond. The heart rate usually falls by more than 40 beats/min and is due to cord compression which varies with each contraction giving rise to variable shapes, sizes and timing of decelerations and are considered non-reassuring features in a CTG trace. Increase in the depth and duration of the decelerations and rise in baseline rate and reduction in baseline variability suggests worsening hypoxia.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Additional changes to simple variable decelerations in the form of slow recovery to baseline rate or a combined variable followed immediately by late decelerations are called 'atypical variable decelerations' and are considered to be abnormal features.</p>
                            <p>The interpretation of the CTG now forms a major focus for litigation in cases of cerebral palsy and mental handicap. It is essential that, where electronic fetal monitoring is employed, any birth attendant responsible for intrapartum care should understand how to interpret the CTG and should be able to take the appropriate action. The actions taken are nursing the mother in the left lateral position or an alternate position, hydration and stopping oxytocin infusion if she was on this medication. If significant abnormality of heart rate persists, a fetal blood sample for acid-base status or operative delivery may be needed. This decision is also influenced by parity, cervical dilatation, rate of progress of labour and clinical risk factors.</p>

                            <h3>The fetal electrocardiogram</h3>
                            <p>The fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) can be recorded from scalp electrodes or by the placement of maternal abdominal electrodes. For ECG waveform analysis a scalp electrode and a maternal skin electrode is necessary. Some units use computerized analysis of the ST waveform with the use of special equipment (STAN® Neoventa Ltd, Sweden) along with FHR to detect hypoxia. Even with ST waveform analysis manual interpretation of CTG is needed for clinical decision making.</p>

                            <h3>Fetal acid-base balance</h3>
                            <p>Where abnormalities of fetal heart rate occur in labour, they may provide an indication of fetal acidosis but, to confirm these findings, the fetal acid-base status should be examined.</p>
                            <p>Fetal blood is obtained directly from the scalp through an amnioscope. The instrument is inserted through the cervix, which must be at least 2-cm dilated. The mother is requested to lie in the lateral position. The latter is preferable to a dorsal or lithotomy position as it will avoid the risk of inducing supine hypotension. A small stab incision is made in the fetal scalp and blood is collected into a heparinized capillary tube. The sample is then analyzed in a blood gas analyzer.</p>
                            <p>Normal pH lies between 7.25 and 7.35. A pH between 7.20 and 7.25 in the first stage of labour indicates mild acidosis and sampling should be repeated within the next 30 minutes. If it is < 7.20 delivery is recommended unless spontaneous delivery is imminent. If there is sufficient sample, a full blood gas analysis should be performed, as a raised PCO₂ with a normal base excess may indicate a respiratory acidosis that may correct itself if the posture of the mother is changed. Fetal acid-base balance may also be assessed from fetal scalp blood by measuring lactate levels. This generally requires smaller blood volumes to measure and can be done using portable hand held devices. The exact values used to determine the need for action vary according to the normal values established using the device used.</p>

                            </h2>

                            <p>Delivery from 24 completed weeks (in the UK) up to 36 weeks and 6 days is considered as preterm birth. The incidence varies from country to country and even within different ethnic and socio economic groups in the same country. The literature suggests an incidence of 8–12%. Of this nearly 75% are between 34 and 37 weeks and generally these infants do not pose short or long-term complications. The high standards of perinatal care in well-resourced countries are able to care for babies with good intact survival at even less than 32 weeks or any infant with a birth weight more than 1500 g. Of those born at less than 32 weeks gestation, about a third follow prelabour rupture of membranes, a third are due to spontaneous preterm labour and the remaining third are due to iatrogenic intervention where delivery is indicated for a medical or obstetric condition such as pre-eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage or intrauterine growth restriction.</p>

                            <h3>Spontaneous preterm labour</h3>
                            <h4>Aetiology</h4>
                            <p>There are a number of factors known to be associated with spontaneous preterm labour, although in many cases the cause is unknown.</p>
                            <p>Some of the major factors associated with the preterm labour are shown in Figure 11.11. There is an association with poor social conditions and nutritional status and also with antepartum haemorrhage, multiple pregnancy, uterine anomalies, cervical incompetence and PROM, which is often associated with infection. A previous history of preterm delivery is the best single predictor. The relative risk is about 3 and the risk increases if there has been more than one preterm delivery. Complications during a pregnancy may also precipitate preterm labour; this includes over distension of the uterus, such as multiple pregnancy and hydramnios. Other factors, such as haemorrhage in either the first or early second trimester, increase the risk of subsequent preterm labour. Severe maternal illness, particularly febrile illness, may also promote the early onset of labour.</p>

                            <p>Social factors involve maternal age (under 20 or over 35 years), primiparity, ethnicity, marital status, cigarette smoking, substance abuse and heavy, stressful work (Box 11.1). Active social intervention appeared to reduce the incidence of preterm labour in early studies but has not received unanimous support due to lack of good scientific evidence.</p>

                            <h4>The role of genital tract infection</h4>
                            <p>Genital tract infection may act either through promoting myometrial activity or by causing prelabour rupture of the fetal membranes. Organisms that have been found to be associated with chorioamnionitis and the onset of preterm labour include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group B haemolytic streptococci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Haemophilus spp. Of these, group B streptococci are probably the most sinister.</p>
                            <p>The bacteria that have penetrated the mucous plug produce proteases, resulting in tissue destruction and PROM. Organisms may also release phospholipase A₂ and phospholipase C, which releases arachidonic acid from the amnion causing the release of prostaglandins. Release of bacterial toxins may also initiate an inflammatory process in the decidua and membranes, resulting in the production of prostaglandins and cytokines, particularly interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor.</p>

                            <h3>The preterm infant</h3>
                            <h4>Survival</h4>
                            <p>If the cause is of infective origin it may affect the mother but the effect is predominantly on the fetus. Improvements in neonatal services provide good chance of intact survival if the new born is in good condition and is of reasonable birth weight. Each day of delay in birth after 24 weeks increases the chance of survival by 3–6%, and hence the need to conserve the pregnancy as long as possible. An infant born with a birth weight of less than 500 g has little chance of survival whereas one born weighing 1500 g is nearly as likely to survive as a full-term infant. Between 500 and 1000 g, every 100 g increment produces a significant increase in survival (Fig. 11.12). The major causes of death in very-low-birth weight infants are infection, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis and periventricular haemorrhage.</p>

                            <h4>Complications of preterm birth</h4>
                            <p>Immediate complications are respiratory distress, jaundice, hypoglycaemia and hypothermia. Long-term complications include pulmonary dysplasia and neurodevelopmental delay.</p>

                            <h3>The management of preterm labour</h3>
                            <p>The diagnosis of preterm labour is based on the onset of regular uterine contractions associated with progressive cervical effacement and dilatation. Uterine contractions are a common and normal occurrence during pregnancy and do not always progress to established labour. Over 30% of hospital admissions for suspected preterm labour may be discharged home undelivered. The presence of the protein fetal fibronectin in the cervix can be used in the assessment of the risk of preterm delivery. The test can be performed by taking a swab from the cervix provided that the membranes are intact and the woman has not had intercourse or a vaginal examination within the previous 24 hours. A negative result makes delivery within the next 7 days unlikely (&lt;3%) although a positive test result is of less value as only 20% of such women will deliver in the same period.</p>

                            <h4>Prevention</h4>
                            <p>Prevention has been approached from different directions, some of which appear to have been effective while others have not been convincing. In reality it has been difficult to prove efficacy with any interventional therapy for established preterm labour because of the fact that many labours stop spontaneously irrespective of treatment. Educational and interventional studies have been based on the concept that heavy work and excessive physical activity should be kept to a minimum during pregnancy and the studies by Papiernik in Paris strongly support social intervention programmes as the way to reduce the incidence of preterm labour. Other studies have not supported these observations. However it appears logical to suggest that those women who have a history of preterm labour should be advised concerning lifestyle and diet and that they should avoid heavy or stressful work during pregnancy. The treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria with antibiotics has been shown to reduce the likelihood of preterm labour and, where β-haemolytic streptococci are detected in cervical swabs, antibiotic treatment appears to reduce the incidence of PROM. Recent randomized controlled trials investigated women with short cervical length on ultrasound and the role of 17-alpha-hydoxyprogesterone caproate. In women who have a short cervix of &lt;2.5 cm beyond 24 weeks the use of progesterone reduced the incidence of delivery. Large randomized trials which studied the role of prophylactic cervical cerclage for women with short cervix on ultrasound did not show any benefit.</p>

                            <h4>Treatment</h4>
                            <p>Once the woman is admitted to hospital in established preterm labour, a decision must be made as to the approach to management. The long-term advantages of preventing preterm labour are uncertain, although every day of delay in the early preterm period increases the chance of survival and reduces morbidity and more dependence on intensive care. There is no controversy in postponing delivery long enough for the administration of corticosteroids to enable the production of fetal lung surfactant with the aim of reducing the chance of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (Fig. 11.13).</p>

                            <p>The decision whether labour should be allowed to proceed or to inhibit uterine activity depends on the period of gestation, absence of infection or bleeding, intact membranes and the cervix being less than 5 cm dilated. In cases where gestational age by ultrasound dating is less than 34 weeks, it is appropriate to inhibit uterine activity pharmacologically until corticosteroids can be administered to the mother.</p>
                            <p>Tocolysis is contraindicated in the presence of bleeding because of the risk of maternal haemodynamic compromise and with infection as delay may compromise the health of mother and fetus.</p>
                            <p>Drug therapy to delay the delivery can be divided into groups operating on different principles (Box 11.2).</p>

                            <h5>β-Adrenergic agonists</h5>
                            <p>These drugs act on the β-2-adrenergic receptor sites on the membranes of the myometrial cells, with the activation of adenyl cyclase resulting in an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Action is by inhibition of actin-myosin interaction, which inhibits uterine activity.</p>
                            <p>These drugs have potentially dangerous maternal side effects and hence must be used with caution. The side effects include palpitations and tremor, ischaemic arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema and sometimes sudden death.</p>
                            <p>The most commonly used drugs are ritodrine, salbutamol and terbutaline. The drugs should not be used where there is a known history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension.</p>
                            <p>The drugs are administered diluted in 5% dextrose or dextrose/saline and the infusion rate should be incrementally increased every 10–20 minutes until contractions are reduced to one every 15 minutes, or until the maternal heart rate has reached 140 beats/min. Careful monitoring of maternal pulse rate, blood pressure, urinary output and plasma electrolytes is essential. Fluid overload due to IV fluids and drug action increasing antiduretic hormone causing retention of fluids is the main cause of pulmonary oedema and heat failure and this may be greater in multiple pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>The dosage can be reduced slowly after the administration of corticosteroids to the mother. It is unlikely that any major benefit will accrue to the fetus if the gestational age exceeds 34 weeks. It is necessary to continue treatment till the mother is transferred to a tertiary care centre with neonatal intensive care facilities. Oral maintenance therapy remains unproven and is not recommended.</p>

                            <h5>Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors</h5>
                            <p>Drugs such as indocid (indomethacin) given at a dose of 1–3 mg/kg maternal body weight for 24 hours inhibit prostaglandin production and thus uterine activity. These drugs are very effective in preventing the progression of labour. However, they also result in in utero closure of the ductus arteriosus and may therefore adversely affect the fetal circulation. There may be occasions when they are the drug of choice and where the preterm delivery of the infant constitutes a greater risk than the not invariable early closure of the ductus. This drug also increases pulmonary and renal artery resistance and can cause oligohydramnios. Such consequences are best avoided by using the drug for 1–3 days at the minimum required dose. Usually it is given as 100 mg suppositories.</p>

                            <h5>Calcium antagonists</h5>
                            <p>The effect of slow calcium channel blockers in inhibiting uterine activity is not in doubt. There has been some evidence in animal studies using very large doses of these compounds, in particular nifedipine, that they may cause rib fusions in the fetus if given during the period of organogenesis. However, if the drugs are administered in the late second and third trimesters, this is well past this period and there is no evidence that they pose a threat.</p>
                            <p>Nifedipine is administered with a starting oral dose of 20 mg followed by 10–20 mg every 4–6 hours thereafter. Severe side effects are rare.</p>
                            <p>Calcium antagonists, although not licensed for use in pregnancy in the UK, are recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as the drug of choice to inhibit the uterine activity because of its efficacy and low cost.</p>

                            <h5>Corticosteroids</h5>
                            <p>The use of corticosteroids in the prevention of respiratory distress is based on the action of these compounds in enhancing the production of surfactant, thus enabling rapid expansion of the alveoli at the time of delivery and the establishment of normal respiratory function. Controlled trials on the antenatal effects of corticosteroids in preterm infants have shown that there are significant reductions in respiratory distress syndrome, periventricular haemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis.</p>
                            <p>The dosage of betamethasone or dexamethasone is given on the basis of 12 mg 12-hourly by intramuscular injection on two occasions. Optimal benefit can be achieved if delivery is postponed for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days. Over 34 weeks gestation, the administration of corticosteroids is not justified. The production of phosphatidylcholine can also be enhanced by the administration of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) to the mother.</p>

                            <h5>Neuroprotection by magnesium sulphate</h5>
                            <p>The use of magnesium sulphate as a tocolytic has largely been abandoned because of its low efficacy. However, large randomized studies have shown a neuroprotective effect in the neonate with its use prior to preterm delivery. It stabilizes capillary membranes and reduces the incidence of intra and periventricular haemorrhage. An IV dose of 4 g MgSO₄ is given followed by 1 g every hour for the next 24 hours. However, there is a trial that suggests that even a bolus dose of 4 g without subsequent continued dose is effective and offers neuroprotection after 24 hours. There is little information available as to whether this regime could be repeated if the delivery does not ensue and the mother restarts in preterm labour. A pragmatic approach is to give another dose if the interval was greater than one week.</p>

                            <h4>Method of delivery</h4>
                            <p>On many occasions, it may not be either possible or desirable to inhibit labour. It is rare to inhibit labour when the gestation is over 34 weeks because the benefits of intervention outweigh those of allowing the labour to proceed. If the contractions are strong and frequent and the cervix is more than 5 cm dilated on admission the likelihood of successfully stopping preterm delivery is low. If the membranes have ruptured and there is no sign of infection, short-term inhibition of contractions to enable the administration of corticosteroids is worthwhile. If there is any antepartum bleeding, non-reassuring FHR or suspicion of intrauterine infection, it may be safer to allow progress of labour and for the fetus to be delivered and at times the delivery may need to be expedited.</p>
                            <p>There is no proven evidence that the use of forceps or a wide episiotomy improves fetal outcome in the presence of a vertex presentation, although it is important that delivery should be as gentle and controlled as possible. If the perineum is tight, it is not sensible to allow the soft, premature skull to be battered on the perineum for a long period and a sudden expulsive delivery may produce intracranial bleeding due to sudden decompression. Routine forceps delivery is not the norm and a gentle controlled delivery is preferred.</p>
                            <p>However, in the presence of a breech presentation, delivery by caesarean section is the preferred option unless the gestation is greater than 34 weeks. Although there are no randomized studies, several large studies on the outcome comparing vaginal breech delivery and delivery by caesarean section overwhelmingly favour delivery by caesarean section because of lower perinatal mortality and long-term neurological deficits. The reason for this is that up to 34 weeks, the head is relatively larger than the trunk and the fetal trunk may be pushed through an incompletely dilated cervix and the head may get stuck. Forceful delivery causes sudden compression and decompression of the head and possible intra-cranial haemorrhage. Hence with CS to deliver a preterm breech, the incision type needs to be carefully planned, such as a lower segment midline incision extending upwards or use of tocolytic to relax the uterus to prevent entrapment of the aftercoming head.</p>

                            <h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
                            <p>Prelabour rupture of the membranes has no known major risk factor but is associated with first and second trimester haemorrhage and, less predictably, with smoking. However, the most common factor is infection. Various organisms have been described in this context; these include group B haemolytic streptococci, C. trachomatis and those organisms causing bacterial vaginosis.</p>

                            <h3>Management</h3>
                            <p>The mother will come with a history of sudden loss of amniotic fluid from her vagina. On admission to hospital, a speculum examination should be performed to confirm the presence of amniotic fluid, although sometimes it can be difficult to confirm the diagnosis. The use of nitrazine sticks is of limited value and tests using more specific markers based on the presence of α-fetoprotein and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are not widely used because of their cost.</p>
                            <p>The risks to the mother and baby are those of infection. However, long-term drainage of amniotic fluid may result in fetal pulmonary hypoplasia. The difficulty is to decide both when to deliver the fetus and how to effect delivery, as the uterus may not respond adequately to the action of oxytocic agents especially in the very preterm period.</p>

                            <p>Where there is doubt, it is better to continue observation to look for wetness of a sanitary pad worn to assist in the diagnosis. An ultrasound examination that shows the presence of normal quantities of amniotic fluid with a pocket of fluid between the presenting part and the cervix with no fluid escaping into the vagina is highly suggestive of intact membranes.</p>
                            <p>If there is clear evidence of amniotic fluid in the vagina, swabs should be taken for culture. Maternal infection may result in uterine tenderness, fetal and/or maternal tachycardia and pyrexia as well as the presence of a purulent vaginal discharge. Monitoring for the presence of maternal sepsis is best performed by the measurement of blood white cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). Increasing levels of CRP on subsequent estimations suggest the presence of infection.</p>

                            <p>If there is a positive culture or evidence of maternal infection, the appropriate antibiotic should be administered. If there is evidence of infection, labour should be induced using an oxytocic infusion and delivery expected in the interest of the fetus and the mother. If there is no evidence of infection, conservative management with erythromycin cover should be adopted. Tocolysis is generally ineffective in the presence of ruptured membranes if contractions are already well established and one should consider whether the underlying triggering factor may be infection. If gestation is over 28 weeks the infant probably has a better chance of survival if delivered. Most women with PROM will deliver spontaneously within 48 hours.</p>
                            <p>At term, women with PROM are induced with prostaglandins or syntocinon on admission or after 24 hours of PROM. In the preterm period conservative management is adopted with the warning that there may be risks of infection, abruption, cord prolapse, pulmonary hypoplasia or stillbirth but the need for conservatism to advance to a mature gestation for better survival and outcome.</p>

                            <p>Prolonged pregnancy is defined as pregnancy exceeding 294 days from the first day of the last menstrual period in a woman with a 28-day cycle. The perinatal mortality rate doubles after 42 weeks and trebles after 43 weeks compared with 40 weeks gestation. Although, routine induction of labour has a minimal effect on the overall perinatal mortality rate, it is offered after 41+ weeks as an adverse outcome is not an acceptable option for the individual mother. Conservative management of prolonged pregnancy is preferred by some and it involves at least twice weekly monitoring of the fetus with ultrasound assessment of liquor volume and non-stress test (NST) or antenatal CTG. Induction is undertaken if there is suspicion of fetoplacental compromise. However, many women request induction of labour on the basis of the physical discomfort of the continuing pregnancy. The chance of successful vaginal delivery should be considered and explained to the mother based on parity and cervical score. Artificial separation of membranes just past 40 weeks reduces the number who may need induction after 41 weeks.</p>

                            <h3>Cervical assessment</h3>
                            <p>Clinical assessment of the cervix enables prediction of the likely outcome of induction of labour. The most commonly used method of assessment is the Bishop score or by modification of this score. This cervical score involves clinical examination of the cervix.</p>
                            <p>A Bishop score of more than 6 is strongly predictive of labour following induction. A score of less than 5 indicates the need for cervical ripening.</p>

                            <h3>Methods of induction</h3>
                            <p>The method of induction will be determined by whether membranes are still intact and the score on cervical assessment.</p>

                            <h4>Forewater rupture</h4>
                            <p>Rupture of the membranes should be performed under conditions of full asepsis in the delivery suite. Under ideal circumstances, the cervix should be soft, effaced and at least 2 cm dilated. The head should be presenting by the vertex and should be engaged in the pelvis. In practice, these conditions are often not fulfilled, and the degree to which they are adhered to depends on the urgency of the need to start labour. The mother is placed in the supine or lithotomy position and, after swabbing and draping the vulva, a finger is introduced through the cervix, and the fetal membranes are separated from the lower segment: a process known as 'stripping the membranes'. The bulging membranes are then ruptured with Kocher's forceps, Gelder's forewater amniotomy forceps or an amniotomy hook (Fig. 11.14). The amniotic fluid is released slowly and care is taken to exclude presentation or prolapse of the cord. The fetal heart rate should be monitored for 30 minutes before and following rupture of the membranes.</p>

                            <h4>Hindwater rupture</h4>
                            <p>An alternative method of surgical induction involves rupture of the membranes behind the presenting part. This is known as hindwater rupture. A sigmoid-shaped metal cannula known as the Drewe-Smythe catheter is introduced through the cervix and penetrates the membranes behind the presenting part (Fig. 11.15). The theoretical advantage of this technique is that it reduces the risk of prolapsed cord. In reality, the risk is even lower with forewater rupture than with spontaneous rupture of the membranes, and the technique of hindwater rupture is now rarely used.</p>

                            <h4>Medical induction of labour following amniotomy</h4>
                            <p>Various pharmacological agents can be used to stimulate uterine activity. It is common practice to combine surgical induction with a Syntocinon infusion. A suitable regimen would begin at 1 mU/min and increase by 3 mU/min every 30 minutes until 3 to 4 uterine contractions each lasting >40 seconds, every 10 minutes become established.</p>

                            <p>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends the use of prostaglandins for all inductions of labour including when the cervix is favourable.</p>

                            <h5>Syntocinon infusion</h5>
                            <p>This induces uterine contractions but is more effective when combined with surgical induction.</p>

                            <h5>Prostaglandins</h5>
                            <p>The most widely used form is prostaglandin E₂. This is used to ripen the cervix and may be administered:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Orally:</strong> Doses of 0.5 mg are increased to 2 mg/h until contractions are produced. However this is not used in current practice due to the side effects of vomiting and diarrhoea.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>By the vaginal route:</strong> The most commonly used method is to insert prostaglandin pessaries or xylose gel into the posterior fornix. Nulliparous women with an unfavourable cervix (Bishop's score of less than 4) are given an initial dose of 2 mg gel and multiparous women and nulliparae with a Bishop's score of more than 4 an initial dose of 1 mg. This is repeated if necessary after 6 hours and again the following day up to a maximum dose of 4 mg until labour is established or the membranes can be ruptured and the induction continued with oxytocin. The pessaries come as 3 mg doses. If there is no response to the first pessary in 6 hours in the form of regular contractions or cervical changes, a second pessary is inserted. If the mother does not start labour or there is no cervical change another pessary is inserted the next day.</span>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The recent WHO (2011) guidelines on induction of labour recommend oral misoprostol 25 μg every 2 to 4 hours. Misoprostol (prostaglandin E₁) is not licensed in many countries for use in obstetrics, and the 25 or 50 μg formulations are not available so a 200 μg formulation needs to be divided or dissolved and the appropriate dose taken. The use of prostaglandins is contraindicated in the presence of a previous uterine scar. Some use the prostaglandin E₂ pessaries or gel with caution but not prostaglandin E₁ as there is increased incidence of uterine rupture that will compromise the fetus and the mother. The mother should be properly counselled before these drugs are used.</p>

                            <h4>Mechanical cervical ripening</h4>
                            <p>Commonly this involves the insertion of a balloon catheter through the cervix. The balloon is used to mechanically distend the cervical canal over a 12-hour period and then removed to allow amniotomy.</p>

                            <p>Occasionally, at one end of the spectrum of normal labour, vigorous but normal uterine activity may produce rapid cervical dilatation and precipitate delivery. The hazards of such labours are that the child may be delivered in a rapid and uncontrolled manner and in an inconvenient environment such as into a toilet! Any labour lasting less than 2 hours is classified as precipitate.</p>
                            <p>Fetal morbidity and mortality may be related to the lack of resuscitation facilities. Maternal morbidity may arise from severe perineal Model damage and from postpartum haemorrhage.</p>
                            <p>Precipitate labour tends to repeat itself with subsequent labours and, where there is such a history, the mother is best admitted to hospital near term to await the onset of labour.</p>

                            <h3>Uterine hyperstimulation</h3>
                        <p>The commonest contemporary cause of uterine hyperstimulation is the uncontrolled use of excessive amounts of oxytocic drugs. In extreme cases, this may result in uterine tetany with a continuous contraction. Leading up to this state, there will be frequent strong contractions and insufficient time between contractions to allow a return to normal baseline pressures. The condition can be rapidly corrected by turning off the oxytocin infusion. In fact, the condition should not arise if uterine activity is properly monitored by external or internal tocography. Contractions should not occur more frequently than five in 10 minutes. Greater than 5 contractions in 10 minutes affect the placental perfusion and oxygenation of the fetus. Hyperstimulation (>5 contractions in 10 minutes) associated with FHR changes is termed 'hyperstimulation syndrome' (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence).</p>
                        <p>The uterus becomes more and more sensitive to the same dose of oxytocin with advance in labour and greater cervical dilatation and hence it is important to carefully monitor the contractions and reduce or stop the oxytocin infusion should the contraction frequency increases to >5 in 10 minutes.</p>
                        <p>Uterine hyperstimulation can occur with the use of prostaglandins in various forms. This is due to rapid absorption of the drug from the vagina as the rate of absorption is affected by the temperature and pH of the vagina and the presence of infection/inflammation. This is best managed by removal of the PG pessary and the use of a bolus dose of a short acting tocolytic such as 0.25 mg terbutaline as SC or in 5 mL saline as a slow IV.</p>
                        <p>Hyperstimulation may also lead to uterine rupture, particularly where there is a uterine scar from a previous section or myomectomy. Such a rupture may sometimes occur even in the presence of normal uterine activity.</p>

                        <p>The view of what constitutes an abnormal labour has changed substantially over the last 2 decades. The definition of prolonged labour now relies more on the rate of progress than on absolute times. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that 90% of primigravid women deliver within 16 hours and 90% of multigravid women deliver within 12 hours. It is now rare to see a labour that lasts more than 24 hours. When labour becomes prolonged and progress is abnormally slow, the possibility of cephalopelvic disproportion must be considered but in most cases slow progress is associated with inefficient uterine activity.</p>

                        <p>Lack of progress in labour may result from weak contractions, i.e hypotonic uterine contractions, or strong contractions, i.e. hypertonic uterine inertia.</p>

                        <h3>Hypotonic uterine activity</h3>
                        <p>In this condition, the resting uterine tone is low, contractions are infrequent and often irregular, and progress is slow. This type of inertia results in delays in the latent phase and does not usually cause distress to the mother or the fetus.</p>

                        <h3>Hypertonic uterine activity</h3>
                        <p>This is a rare abnormality commonly resulting from reversed polarity of the uterine contractions. The contraction is commonly initiated in the lower segment or it may on occasions be asymmetrical, resulting in a double peak in the contraction wave. Resting uterine tone is also raised so that the level at which the pain of the contraction is felt is earlier in the contraction cycle and the pain persists for longer. Cervical dilatation is slow and the woman suffers from severe backache and pain that radiates into the lower abdomen. This type of inertia is uncommon and, when it does occur, is commonly associated with placental abruption. This diagnosis must always be considered when this type of labour occurs as the abruption may initially be concealed.</p>

                        <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>Abnormalities of uterine activity are usually recognized by the failure of progress in labour. As incoordinate uterine activity may also be associated with cephalopelvic disproportion, it is essential to exclude this possibility by careful assessment of the size and shape of the maternal pelvis and the size of the fetus.</p>

                                <p>A 23-year-old primigravida was admitted to hospital in labour with regular and painful contractions. There was no evidence of any antepartum haemorrhage. The cervix was found to be 2.5 cm dilated. However, 4 hours later the cervix was 4 cm dilated and the rate of progress was significantly delayed. The cervicogram is shown in Figure 11.16. An epidural catheter was inserted and epidural analgesia commenced. The membranes were ruptured artificially and clear amniotic fluid was released. Progress in labour continued to be slow and 3 hours later a dilute oxytocin infusion was started. This resulted in rapid progress to full dilatation and vaginal delivery some 2 hours later.</p>

                        <p>In the presence of hypotonic uterine inertia, uterine activity may be stimulated by encouraging mobilization of the mother and, if the membranes are intact, by artificial rupture of the membranes; an oxytocic infusion will also usually stimulate labour and delivery.</p>
                        <p>If the uterine activity is hypertonic, rupture of the membranes as well as cautious use of a low-dose oxytocin infusion may produce normal uterine activity. If progress continues to be slow and there is evidence of fetal distress, delivery should be effected by caesarean section.</p>
                        <p>Constriction ring dystocia can only be reversed by the use of beta-sympathomimetic agents, or ether or halothane anaesthesia.</p>

                        <p>This may arise because the fetus is abnormally large or where the pelvis, and in particular the pelvic inlet, is small, or a combination of both factors.
                        The head will not generally be engaged at the onset of labour but may engage with moulding into the pelvis. The pelvis can only be truly tested in the presence of strong uterine contractions.</p>

                        <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>When the possibility of cephalopelvic disproportion is suspected, labour should be carefully monitored. Regular observations must be recorded of uterine activity, the rate of cervical dilatation, the descent of the presenting part, the position, station and the caput and moulding and the condition of both the mother and the fetus.</p>
                        <p>In primigravid women, the uterus may become exhausted late in the first stage and contractions may cease or become attenuated and there may be no progress in cervical dilatation. If there is no change in cervical dilatation over a period of 4–6 hours, with no descent of head, increasing caput and moulding, the trial of labour should be abandoned. Similarly, if clinical signs of fetal distress or maternal exhaustion develop, the labour should be terminated by caesarean section.</p>

                            CORD PRESENTATION AND CORD PROLAPSE
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Cord presentation (Fig. 11.18) occurs when any part of the cord lies alongside or in front of the presenting part. The diagnosis is usually established by digital palpation of the pulsating cord, which may be felt through the intact membranes. When the membranes rupture, the cord prolapses and may appear at the vulva or be palpable in front of the presenting part.</p>

                        <h3>Predisposing factors</h3>
                        <p>Any condition that displaces the head or presenting part away from the cervix or where the presenting part is irregular and forms poor contact with the cervix will predispose to cord presentation or prolapse. Under these circumstances, if the membranes are ruptured artificially to induce labour, the cord may prolapse. In normal labour the uterine contractions are likely to cause descent of the presenting part and fix it to the pelvic brim and spontaneous rupture of membranes is much later in labour. With artificial rupture of membranes for induction of labour the head may be higher with slightly increased incidence of cord prolapse but because the patient will be near an operating theatre the baby can be delivered rapidly.</p>

                        <h3>Management</h3>
                        <p>The diagnosis of cord presentation is sometimes made prior to rupture of the membranes and prolapse of the cord but this is the exception rather than the rule. If the cord prolapses through a partially dilated cervix, delivery should be effected as soon as possible, as the presenting part will compress the cord or the cord arteries may go into spasm on exposure to cold air. Handling of the cord may cause the same effect. Cord spasm or compression leads to fetal asphyxia. Prolapse of the cord is an obstetric emergency.</p>
                        <p>Unless spontaneous delivery is imminent, the woman should be placed in the knee-chest position, or the buttocks elevated by pillows or head tilt in a trolley to reduce pressure on the cord. Filling the urinary bladder may help to reduce pressure on the cord by the presenting part. The cord should be digitally displaced into the vagina to maintain the warmth and moisture content and introitus covered with a wet pad. This is likely to reduce the incidence of cord arterial spasm. It is difficult to replace the cord into the uterus, although there has been a few reports about this possibility.</p>
                        <p>Vaginal examination and digital displacement of the head to alleviate pressure of the head on the cord is a possibility but it is difficult to transfer the woman to the theatre along the corridors with a hand in the vagina although she would be covered. Each uterine contraction may further compress the cord at the pelvic brim against the presenting part and a bolus dose of tocolytic (terbutaline 0.25 mg SC or slow IV in 5 mL saline) may be of help to relieve this intermittent compression.</p>
                        <p>Delivery should be effected by caesarean section unless the cervix is fully dilated and delivery can be achieved rapidly by forceps or vacuum with the assistance of the maternal expulsive efforts.</p>
                        <p>Despite the acute asphyxial insult to the fetus, which is likely to be depressed at birth, the long-term prognosis in these infants is good. Provided there is no pre-existing impairment to gaseous transfer, the fetus can effectively withstand an acute asphyxial episode without suffering long-term damage.</p>
