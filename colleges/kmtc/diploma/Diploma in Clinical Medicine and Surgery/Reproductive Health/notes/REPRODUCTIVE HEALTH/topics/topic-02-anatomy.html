                            <h3>EXTERNAL GENITALIA (SYN: VULVA, PUDENDUM)</h3>
                            <p>The vulva or pudendum includes all the visible external genital organs in the perineum. The vulva includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">mons veneris</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">conventionally the perineum</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These are all visible on external examination. It is, therefore, bounded anteriorly by the mons veneris, and posteriorly by the rectum, laterally by the genitocrural fold. The vulvar area is covered by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.</p>

                            <h4>MONS VENERIS (MONS PUBIS)</h4>
                            <p>It is the pad of subcutaneous adipose connective tissue lying in front of the pubis and in the adult female is covered by hair. The hair pattern (escutcheon) of most women is triangular with the base directed upwards.</p>

                            <h4>LABIA MAJORA</h4>
                            <p>The vulva is bounded on each side by the elevation of skin and subcutaneous tissue which form the labia majora. They are continuous where they join medially to form the posterior commissure in front of the anus. The skin on the outer convex surface is pigmented and covered with hair follicle. The thin skin on the inner surface has sebaceous glands but no hair follicle. The labia majora are covered with squamous epithelium and contain sweat glands. The adipose tissue is richly supplied with venous plexus which may produce hematoma, if injured during childbirth.</p>

                            <h4>LABIA MINORA</h4>
                            <p>They are two thin folds of skin, devoid of fat, on either side just within the labia majora. Except in the parous women, they are exposed only when the labia majora are separated. Anteriorly, they divide to enclose the clitoris and unite with each other in front and behind the clitoris to form the prepuce and frenulum respectively. The lower portion of the labia minora fuses across the midline to form a fold of skin known as fourchette. It is usually lacerated during childbirth. Between the fourchette and the vaginal orifice is the fossa navicularis. The labia minora contain no hair follicles or sweat glands. The folds contain connective tissues, numerous sebaceous glands, erectile muscle fibers and numerous vessels and nerve endings.</p>

                            <p>It is a small cylindrical erectile body, measuring about 1.5-2 cm situated in the most anterior part of the vulva. It consists of a glans, a body and two crura. The clitoris consists of two cylindrical corpora cavernosa (erectile tissue). is richly supplied with nerves.</p>

                                    <p><strong>a. Urethral opening:</strong> The opening is situated in the midline just in front of the vaginal orifice about 1-1.5 cm below the pubic arch. The paraurethral ducts open either on the posterior wall of the urethral orifice or directly into the vestibule.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>b. Vaginal orifice and hymen:</strong> The vaginal orifice lies in the posterior end of the vestibule and is of varying size and shape. In virgins and nulliparae, the opening is closed by the labia minora, but in parous, it may be exposed. It is incompletely closed by a septum of mucous membrane, called hymen. The membrane varies in shape but is usually circular or crescentic in virgins. The hymen is usually ruptured at the consummation of marriage. During childbirth, the hymen is extremely lacerated and is later represented by cicatrized nodules of varying size, called the carunculae myrtiformes. On both sides it is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>c. Opening of Bartholin's ducts:</strong> There are two Bartholin glands (greater vestibular gland), one on each side. The vestibular bulbs are two oblong masses of erectile tissue that lie on either side of the vaginal entrance. They contain a rich plexus of veins within the bulbospongiosus muscle. They are homologous to the bulb of the penis and corpus spongiosum in the male. Bartholin's glands, each about the size of a small pea, lie at the base of each bulb and open via a 2 cm duct into the vestibule between the hymen and the labia minora - outside the hymen at the junction of the anterior two-third and posterior one-third in the groove between the hymen and the labium minus. They are pea-sized and yellowish white in color. During sexual excitement, it secretes abundant alkaline mucus which helps in lubrication. Bartholin's glands are homologous to the bulb of the penis in male.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>d. Skene's glands:</strong> are the largest paraurethral glands. Skene's glands are homologous to the prostate in the male. The two Skene's ducts may open in the vestibule on either side of the external urethral meatus.</p>

                            <h4>Blood Supply to VULVA</h4>
                            <p><strong>Arteries:</strong> Branches of internal pudendal artery—the chief being labial, transverse perineal, artery to the vestibular bulb and deep and dorsal arteries to the clitoris. Branches of femoral artery—superficial and deep external pudendal.</p>
                            <p><strong>Veins:</strong> The veins form plexuses and drain into: Internal pudendal vein, vesical or vaginal venous plexus and Long saphenous vein. Varicosities during pregnancy are not uncommon and may rupture spontaneously causing visible bleeding or hematoma formation.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Lymphatics</h4>
                            <p>Vulval lymphatics have bilateral drainage. Lymphatics drain into:</p>

                                Internal Genital Organs
                            </h2>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The internal genital organs in female include: vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes and the ovaries. These organs are placed internally and require special instruments for inspection.</p>

                            <h3>VAGINA</h3>
                            <p>The vagina is a fibromuscular canal lined with stratified squamous epithelium that leads from the uterus to the vulva. It constitutes the excretory channel for the uterine secretion and menstrual blood. It is the organ of copulation and forms the birth canal of parturition. The diameter of the canal is about 2.5 cm , being widest in the upper part and narrowest at its introitus. It has got enough power of distensibility. The canal is directed upwards and backwards forming an angle of $45^{\circ}$ with the horizontal in erect posture. The long axis of the vagina almost lies parallel to the plane of the pelvic inlet and at right angles to that of the uterus.</p>

                            <h4>VAGINAL WALL</h4>
                            <p>Vagina has got an anterior, a posterior and two lateral walls. The anterior and posterior walls are opposed together but the lateral walls are comparatively stiffer especially at its middle, as such, it looks "H" shaped on transverse section. The length of the anterior wall is about 7 cm and that of the posterior wall is about 9 cm . The vaginal walls are normally in apposition, except at the vault, where they are separated by the cervix. The vault of the vagina is divided into four fornices: posterior, anterior and two lateral.</p>

                            <h4>FORNICES</h4>
                            <p>The fornices are the clefts formed at the top of vagina (vault) due to the projection of the uterine cervix through the anterior vaginal wall where it is blended inseparably with its wall.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>There are four fornices: one anterior, one posterior and two lateral.</li>
                                <li>The posterior one being deeper and the anterior, most shallow one.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    <p>The vaginal walls are rugose, with transverse folds. The vagina is kept moist by secretions from the uterine and cervical glands and by some transudation from its epithelial lining. It has no glands. The epithelium is thick and rich in glycogen, which increases in the postovulatory phase of the cycle. However, before puberty and after the menopause, the vagina is devoid of glycogen because of oestrogen deficiency. Doderlein's bacillus is a normal commensal of the vagina that breaks down the glycogen to form lactic acid, producing a pH of around 4.5. This has a protective role for the vagina in decreasing the growth of pathogenic organisms.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Anterior:</strong> The upper one-third is related with base of the bladder and the lower two-thirds are with the urethra, the lower half of which is firmly embedded with its wall.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Posterior:</strong> The upper one-third is related with the pouch of Douglas, the middle-third with the anterior rectal wall separated by rectovaginal septum and the lower-third is separated from the anal canal by the perineal body.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Lateral walls:</strong> The upper one-third is related with the pelvic cellular tissue at the base of broad ligament in which the ureter and the uterine artery lie approximately 2 cm from the lateral fornices. The middle third is blended with the levator ani and the lower-third is related with the bulbocavernosus muscles, vestibular bulbs and Bartholin's glands.</li>

                            <p>The uterus is a hollow pyriform muscular organ situated in the pelvis between the bladder in front and the rectum behind. The uterus is shaped like an inverted pear, tapering inferiorly to the cervix, and in the non-pregnant state is situated entirely within the pelvis. It is hollow and has thick muscular walls. Its maximum external dimensions are approximately 7.5 cm long, 5 cm wide and 3 cm thick. An adult uterus weighs about 70 g.</p>

                            <h4>POSITION OF UTERUS</h4>
                            <p>The longitudinal axis of the uterus is, approximately, at right-angles to the vagina and normally tilts forwards. This is termed <strong>anteversion</strong>. The uterus is usually also flexed forwards on itself at the isthmus - <strong>anteflexion</strong>. Its normal position is one of the anteversion and anteflexion. In around 20 per cent of women, this tilt is not forwards but backwards retroversion and retroflexion. This does not have a pathological significance. The uterus usually inclines to the right (dextrorotation) so that the cervix is directed to the left (levorotation) and comes in close relation with the left ureter.</p>

                            <h4>MEASUREMENTS AND PARTS</h4>
                            <p>The uterus measures about 8 cm long, 5 cm wide at the fundus and its walls are about 1.25 cm thick. Its weight varies from 50 gm to 80 gm. It has got the following parts:</p>

Each gland is oval in shape and pinkish gray in color and the surface is scarred during reproductive period. It measures about 3 cm in length, 2 cm in breadth and 1 cm in thickness. Each ovary presents: two ends (tubal and uterine), two borders (mesovarium and free posterior) and two surfaces (medial and lateral).</p>
                            <p>The ovary is the only intra-abdominal structure not to be covered by peritoneum. It lies in the ovarian fossa on the lateral pelvic wall.</p>

                            <h4>STRUCTURES:</h4>
                            <p>The ovary is covered by a single layer of cubical cell known as germinal epithelium. The substance of the gland consists of outer cortex and inner medulla.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cortex:</strong> Consists of stromal cells which are thickened beneath the germinal epithelium to form tunica albuginea. During reproductive period the cortex is studded with numerous follicular structures (primordial follicles, maturing follicles, Graafian follicles, corpus luteum).</li>
                                <li><strong>Medulla:</strong> Consists of loose connective tissues, few unstriped muscles, blood vessels and nerves. There is a small collection of cells called "hilus cells" which are homologous to the interstitial cells of the testes.</li>

                            <p>Pelvic floor is a muscular partition which separates the pelvic cavity from the anatomical perineum. It consists of three sets of muscles on either side - <strong>pubococcygeus</strong>, <strong>iliococcygeus</strong> and <strong>Ischiococcygeus</strong>. These are collectively called <strong>levator ani</strong>.</p>

                            <p>It is bounded above by inferior surface of the pelvic floor, below by the skin between the buttocks and thighs. Laterally by the ischiopubic ramus, ischial tuberosities and sacrotuberous ligaments and posteriorly by the coccyx. The diamond shaped space of the bony pelvic outlet is divided into two triangular spaces:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Urogenital Triangle:</strong> The anterior triangle. It is pierced by the terminal part of the vagina and the urethra. Has superficial and deep perineal pouch compartments.</li>
                                <li><strong>Anal Triangle:</strong> The posterior one. It contains the terminal part of the anal canal with sphincter ani externus, anococcygeal body, ischiorectal fossa, blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics.</li>

                            <h4>OBSTETRICAL PERINEUM (Perineal body)</h4>
                            <p>The pyramidal shaped tissue where the pelvic floor and the perineal muscles and fascia meet in between the vagina and the anal canal is called the obstetrical perineum. It measures about $4 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}$ with the base covered by the perineal skin and the apex is pointed and is continuous with the rectovaginal septum.</p>

                            <p>Extends from the neck of the bladder to the external urethral meatus which opens into the vestibule about 2.5 cm below the clitoris. It measures about 4 cm and has a diameter of 6 mm.</p>

                            <h3>The Urinary Bladder</h3>
                            <p>A hollow muscular organ with considerable power of distension. Its capacity is about 450 mL but can retain as much as 3-4 liters of urine. When distended it is ovoid in shape.</p>

                            <h3>The Breast</h3>
                            <p>The breasts are large, modified sebaceous glands. The breasts are bilateral and in female constitute accessory reproductive organs as the glands are concerned with lactation following childbirth. It usually extends from the second to sixth rib in the midclavicular line. A lateral projection of the breast towards the axilla is known as axillary tail of Spence.</p>

                            <h3>The Scrotum</h3>
                            <p>The scrotum is an outpouching of the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall. It contains the testes, the epididymis's, and the lower ends of the spermatic cords. The wall of the scrotum has the following layers: Skin, Superficial fascia (dartos muscle), Spermatic fasciae (External, Cremasteric, Internal), Tunica vaginalis.</p>

                            <p>Testis has ellipsoid- shaped. Testes develop in the abdomen and move before birth into the scrotum. The left testis usually lies at a lower level than the right. Lying within each lobule are 1 to 3 coiled seminiferous tubules. The tubules open into a network of channels called the rete testis.</p>

                            <h3>Epididymis</h3>
                            <p>The epididymis is a single, long coiled duct that courses along the posterolateral side of the testis. Structurally divided into Head, Body, and Tail. It stores and transports sperm.</p>

                            <h3>Ductus Deferens (Vas Deferens)</h3>
                            <p>A long muscular duct that transports spermatozoa from the tail of the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct. It traverses the inguinal canal to the deep ring, passes downwards on the lateral wall of the pelvis.</p>

                            <h3>Prostate</h3>
                            <p>The prostate is an unpaired accessory structure of the male reproductive system that surrounds the urethra in the pelvic cavity. It lies immediately inferior to the bladder, above the urogenital diaphragm, posterior to the pubic symphysis, and anterior to the rectum.</p>
                            <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Enclosed within thin dense fibrous capsule. Divided into Two lateral lobes, One median lobe, Anterior and posterior lobes.</p>

                            <h3>Penis</h3>
                            <p>The penis is a pendulous organ suspended from the front and sides of the pubic arch and containing the greater part of the urethra. It consists of internal root, external shaft, & glans. The body of the penis is essentially composed of three cylinders of erectile tissue: two dorsally placed corpora cavernosa and a single corpus spongiosum applied to their ventral surface.</p>
