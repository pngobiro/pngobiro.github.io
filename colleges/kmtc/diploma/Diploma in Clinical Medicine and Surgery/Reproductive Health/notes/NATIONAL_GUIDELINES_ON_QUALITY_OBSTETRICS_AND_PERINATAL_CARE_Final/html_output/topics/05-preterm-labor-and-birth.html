                        <p>Preterm labour denotes regular uterine contractions accompanied by progressive cervical
                            dilation with or without effacement at less than 37 weeks of gestation.</p>
                        <p>Preterm birth occurs between 24- and 37weeks gestation. In two-thirds of cases it occurs
                            following spontaneous onset of labour. Only a minority of women who present with preterm
                            contractions known as threatened premature labour (TPTL) progress to actual labour and
                            delivery</p>
                        <p>Spontaneous preterm labor, a syndrome caused by multiple pathologic processes, contributes to
                            about 70% of preterm deliveries.</p>

                        <p>In women with single gestation pregnancy and a history of spontaneous preterm delivery,
                            antenatal progesterone therapy is the most effective strategy to decrease the risk of a
                            recurrent preterm delivery. Progesterone supplementation is beneficial in these women
                            starting at 16 to 24 weeks' gestation and continuing through 34 weeks' gestation.</p>
                        <p>Two types of progesterone therapy are currently in use for the prevention of preterm
                            delivery. They include a weekly intramuscular injection of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone
                            caproate or medroxy progesterone acetate 5 mg tablet and daily administration of natural
                            micronized progesterone vaginal gel, vaginal suppository, or oral capsule.</p>

                        <h3>Cervical Cerclage and Pessary</h3>
                        <p>Cervical cerclage, an encircling suture placed around the cervix before or during pregnancy,
                            has been used to help correct structural defects or cervical weakening in high-risk women
                            with a shortened cervix.</p>
                        <p>Studies have shown that cerclage is associated with a decrease in preterm delivery and in
                            perinatal death when used in women with a prior preterm delivery and a cervical length of 25
                            mm or less.</p>

                            <li>CL should be confirmed using a standardized technique, with the TV US being the current

                            <li>A multidisciplinary team approach should be initiated, with involvement of an
                                obstetrician and neonatologist to discuss risks of PTB if the patient is found to have a
                                short cervix.</li>
                            <li>Repeat TV US in 1-2 weeks, or consider commencement of progesterone for a CL of 20-25
                                mm.</li>
                            <li>Progesterone should be offered for prevention of PTB in women at low risk if CL is
                                &lt;20 mm at 18-22 weeks.</li>
                            <li>For women deemed to be high risk, cervical cerclage should be considered if there is
                                cervical dilatation pre-viability or if the cervix continues to shorten during
                                surveillance.</li>
                            <li>Progesterone is generally the preferred treatment because of the lower risk of surgical
                                complications.</li>

                            cervical examination suggesting early dilation and/or effacement. This approach facilitates
                            early institution of therapy but results in a 50% over-diagnosis of preterm labor (PTL).</p>

                        <h3>Management of preterm labour</h3>
                        <h4>Prolongation of pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>No intervention has been shown to reduce the incidence of preterm birth. However, tocolysis
                            has been shown to prolong pregnancy for 48 hours or more.</p>
                        <p>This provides the window of opportunity for the administration and absorption of
                            corticosteroids. It also allows for the transportation of the woman to a tertiary center if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Tocolytic treatments (acute and maintenance treatments) are not recommended for women at risk
                            of imminent preterm birth for the purpose of improving newborn outcomes.</p>

                        <h4>Contraindications to Tocolysis</h4>
                        <p>In a significant percentage of women in preterm labor, tocolysis may be contraindicated:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Gestational hypertension with proteinuria or other medical indication</li>
                            <li>Chorioamnionitis</li>
                            <li>Mature fetus</li>
                            <li>Imminent delivery</li>
                            <li>Intrauterine fetal death or lethal fetal abnormality</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy</h4>
                        <p>Dexamethasone and betamethasone cross the placenta and induce enzymes that accelerate fetal
                            pulmonary maturity. It takes 48 hours after the first dose for the full benefit to be
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>Four doses of dexamethasone (6 mg IM) 12 hours apart are recommended for acceleration of
                            fetal lung maturity. Alternatively, two doses of betamethasone (12 mg IM) 24 hours apart can
                            be used.</p>
                        <p>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for women at risk of preterm birth from 24
                            weeks to 34 weeks of gestation when the following conditions are met:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Gestational age assessment can be accurately undertaken;</li>
                            <li>Preterm birth is considered imminent;</li>
                            <li>There is no clinical evidence of maternal infection;</li>
                            <li>Adequate childbirth care is available (including the capacity to recognize and safely
                                manage preterm labour and birth);</li>
                            <li>The preterm newborn can receive adequate care if needed (including resuscitation,
                                thermal care, feeding support, infection treatment and safe oxygen use).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Mode of delivery</h4>
                        <p>Routine delivery by caesarean section for the purpose of improving preterm newborn outcomes
                            is not recommended, regardless of cephalic or breech presentation. Caesarean section should
                            only be performed for obstetric indications. (Conditional recommendation based on very
                            low-quality evidence).</p>
                        <p>Pertaining to the following interventions, there is no evidence of any benefit. However,
                            there may not have been sufficient studies to evaluate the effectiveness of some of these
                            interventions:</p>

                        <h2>Definition</h2>
                        <p>This is the birth that occurs between 24- and 37-weeks' gestation. In two-thirds of cases it
                            occurs following spontaneous onset of labour. Only a minority of women who present with
                            preterm contractions known as threatened premature labour (TPTL) progress to actual labour
                            and delivery.</p>
                        <p>Spontaneous preterm labor, a syndrome caused by multiple pathologic processes, contributes to
                            about 70% of preterm deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The risk of preterm deliveries increases with low social-economic status. Countries with the
                            highest rates of preterm deliveries also report that these deliveries occur in persons of
                            lower socioeconomic status.</p>
                        <p>Preterm birth is the leading cause of mortality in children under the age of 5 with the
                            incidence increasing in babies of lower gestational ages.</p>

                        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
                        <p>Yearly, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 completed weeks) with 60%
                            of this happening in Africa and South Asia.</p>
                        <p>The rate of preterm births in countries analyzed in the WHO Global Action report ranged
                            between 5 - 18% with Kenya having an estimated range of between 10 - 15%.</p>
                        <p>A study at the Kenyatta National Referral Hospital in Kenya in 2018 put the prevalence at the
                            institution at 18.3%.</p>

                            <li>Deferring delivery to the 39th week is not recommended if there is a medical or

                            <li>In the case of an anticipated late-preterm delivery a single course of antenatal
                                betamethasone is recommended within 7 days of delivery in select women who have not
                                received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids.</li>
                            <li>However, a medically indicated late-preterm delivery should not be delayed for the
                                administration of antenatal corticosteroids</li>
                            <li>The decisions regarding delivery timing are complex and must take into account relative

                            <li>Secondly, late-preterm or early-term deliveries may be required for maternal benefit or
                                new-born benefit, or both.</li>
                            <li>In these cases, health care providers will need to weigh competing risks and benefits
                                for the woman and her fetus and the support at the level of health facility adequate or
                                referral mechanisms provided prior to delivery decision.</li>

                        <h3>Preterm Birth in Multiple Gestation</h3>
                        <p>Twin pregnancies are associated with a three-fold greater perinatal mortality than singleton
                            pregnancies. Prematurity is a main contributor, with 50% of twin pregnancies delivering
                            before 37 weeks and 10% delivering before 32 weeks of gestation. The etiology of preterm
                            delivery in twin pregnancies is likely multifactorial and different from that of singletons.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cervical cerclage reduces preterm birth rates in singletons but has mixed results in twins
                            with some studies showing harm.</p>
                        <p>The use of progesterone to prevent preterm birth in singletons has conflicting results and
                            has not been proven to prevent preterm birth in twins.</p>
                        <p>Studies continue to determine whether the cervical pessary is effective in preventing preterm
                            birth in multiple pregnancies.</p>
                        <p>There is a paucity of data available on the prevention of preterm birth in triplets/higher
                            order multiples but similar principles to twin pregnancy apply</p>

                        <h3>Care of the premature baby</h3>
                        <p>Care of the premature baby entails the following:</p>

                            <li>Essential and extra newborn care, especially feeding support</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC)</h3>
                        <p>Kangaroo mother care is defined as care of preterm infants or infants weighing less than 2000
                            g carried skin-to-skin with the mother. It aims to promote the health and wellbeing of
                            infants born preterm or at term.</p>
                        <p>This method of care was developed in Colombia as an alternative method of care in resource
                            poor settings for preterm infants who had no underlying medical condition and only needed to
                            feed and grow.</p>
                        <p>Kangaroo mother care can either be:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Continuous:</strong> This is the recommended modality of care, in which the baby
                                is maintained on skin to skin contact with the mother full time except during times of
                                feeding and cleaning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intermittent care:</strong> is recommended rather than conventional care in
                                instances where continuous kangaroo care is not possible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>When to start kangaroo care:</h4>
                        <p>At birth, preterm babies and those small for gestational age are expected to have certain
                            complications. These complications should be managed as per the institutions/ national
                            guidelines and once clinically stable then kangaroo mother care can be initiated. However,
                            in instances where no complications are present, kangaroo mother care can be initiated after
                            birth.</p>
                        <p>Birth weight ranges are given as guides for initiation as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Babies weighing 1800 g or more at birth (gestational age 30-34 weeks or more) may have
                                some prematurity-related problems, such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This may
                                raise serious concerns for a minority of those infants, who will require care in special
                                units. In most cases, however, KMC can start soon after birth.</li>
                            <li>Babies with birth weight between 1200 and 1799g (gestational age 28-32 weeks),
                                prematurity related complications are expected and therefore initial management in
                                specialized units is needed and once the baby is stable, then kangaroo care can be
                                initiated, usually after a week or more depending on the severity of the complications.
                            </li>
                            <li>Babies weighing less than 1200 g (gestational age below 30 weeks) incur frequent and
                                severe problems due to preterm birth: mortality is very high and only a small proportion
                                survives prematurity-related problems. These babies benefit most from transfer before
                                birth to an institution with neonatal intensive care facilities. It may take weeks
                                before their condition allows initiation of KMC.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>When to wean the baby off kangaroo care</h4>
                        <p>KMC tends to be used until the baby reaches term (gestational age around 40 weeks) or 2500 g.
                            Around that time the baby also outgrows the need for KMC. Certain subtle signs from the baby
                            indicate discomfort associated with skin to skin contact. At this point, it is recommended
                            that the mother weans the baby off KMC however; she can still use the method in instances of
                            extreme cold temperatures.</p>

                        <h4>Factors to consider when counselling the mother on KMC</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Willingness: the mother must be willing to provide KMC;</li>
                            <li>Full-time availability to provide care: other family members can offer intermittent
                                skin-to-skin contact but they cannot breastfeed;</li>
                            <li>General health: if the mother suffered complications during pregnancy or delivery or is
                                otherwise ill, she should recover before initiating KMC;</li>
                            <li>Adequate support systems</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Early, continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the baby;

                            <li>Can be done by any member of the family including the father. This is especially useful
