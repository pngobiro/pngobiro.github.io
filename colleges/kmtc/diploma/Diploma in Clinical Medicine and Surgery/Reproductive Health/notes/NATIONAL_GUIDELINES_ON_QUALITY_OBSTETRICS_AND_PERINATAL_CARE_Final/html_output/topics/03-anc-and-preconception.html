                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Preconception care is the provision of biomedical, behavioral and social health interventions to women and couples before conception occurs (WHO, 2012). It aims at improving their health status and reducing behaviors and individual and environmental factors that contribute to poor maternal and child health outcomes. Its ultimate aim is to improve maternal and child health, in both the short and long term.</p>

                        <h3>Life course - when to intervene?</h3>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-062-1.jpg" alt="Figure 11: Pre-conception care" class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Adopted from WHO 2012 Preconception care policy brief 2</p>
                        <p>Opportunities to prevent and control diseases occur at multiple stages of life; strong public health programmes that use a life-course perspective from infancy through childhood and adolescence to adulthood are needed. Preconception care contributes to these efforts. Even if preconception care aims primarily at improving maternal and child health, it brings health benefits to the adolescents, women and men, irrespective of their plans to become parents.</p>

                        <h3>Why is pre-conception care a public health concern?</h3>
                        <p>Despite advances in maternal and newborn health care, poor birth outcomes continue to be a problem in Kenya. Newborn mortality now contributes to 59% of all infant mortality rate, with prematurity, asphyxia and infection accounting for the majority of the deaths. HIV prevalence in WRA has increased to 9.2%; among youth women 15 to 24 years are 4 times more likely to be infected with HIV than men. This is also the group of women with the highest total fertility rate.</p>
                        <p>Among women of reproductive age, risks associated with poor pregnancy outcomes e.g. malaria and anemia remain prevalent; smoking, alcohol use and drug abuse are on the increase. Events in childhood/adolescence e.g. malnutrition, stunting, obesity may also lead to poor obstetric outcomes later. All of these factors could be addressed with proper health interventions prior to conception.</p>
                        <p>Although the recommended timing of the first ANC visit is before 16 weeks, most women present when it is too late to prevent the majority of serious maternal and newborn health problems. The foetus is most susceptible to developing certain problems in the first 4-10 weeks of intrauterine life. At this time many women are not even aware that they are pregnant and they are therefore unable to recognize and address the risks to their own and their baby's health, hence, the need for interventions to begin before conception.</p>
                        <p>Managing long-term health conditions includes ensuring that mental health issues, metabolic disorders and other chronic medical conditions-including obesity-are well managed and sufficiently monitored. Women should be informed regarding the effect of their condition on potential pregnancy and vice versa. Additionally, women and men taking teratogenic medications should be advised regarding effective contraception and provided with information about switching to alternative treatments when trying to conceive.</p>
                        <p>Assistance in stopping or avoiding risky behaviors includes counselling on smoking cessation, excessive alcohol intake and drug misuse. Promoting healthy behaviors covers advice regarding nutrition, folic acid and other supplements, vaccinations such as rubella, sexually transmitted infection and cervical screening, if appropriate, and reproductive planning. Healthcare providers should discuss effective contraception with individuals who do not wish to conceive in the near future.</p>

                        <h3>Target Population</h3>
                        <p>The target population for preconception care is women of reproductive age (WRA - 15 to 49 years), although men are also targeted by several components of preconception care.</p>
                        <p>At risk populations to whom special attention should be provided include teenage girls, refugees, women living in disaster prone regions, survivors of gender-based violence.</p>
                        <p>Inter sectoral collaborations with other key stakeholders including the Ministries of Education, Gender and Social Services, Internal Security and others including religious organizations, to support develop and implement guidelines aiding in preconception care.</p>

                        <h3>Objectives of Preconception Care</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <h3>Scope/focus areas</h3>
                        <p>Pre-conception care can be divided into three main focus areas:</p>

                            <li>management of long-term health conditions</li>
                            <li>assistance in ceasing risky behaviors</li>
                            <li>promoting healthy behaviors.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why Preconception Care?</h3>
                        <p>Preconception care has a positive effect on a range of health outcomes. Among others, preconception care can:</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Antenatal care offers a great opportunity to prevent and manage existing and potential causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The new 2016 WHO ANC model advocates for 8 contacts with the first occurring within the first trimester.</p>
                        <p>Definition- Antenatal care (ANC) can be defined as the care provided by skilled health-care professionals to pregnant women and adolescent girls in order to ensure the best health conditions /outcomes for both mother and baby during pregnancy. The components of ANC include: risk identification; prevention and management of pregnancy-related or concurrent diseases; and health education and health promotion.</p>

                        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
                        <p>Only 50% of women worldwide receive the recommended amount of care during pregnancy. Globally, while 86% of pregnant women access antenatal care with skilled health personnel at least once, only three in five (62%) receive at least four antenatal visits. In regions with the highest rates of maternal mortality, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, even fewer women receive at least four antenatal visits (52% and 46%, respectively).</p>
                        <p>History of Antenatal Care - In 2002, the WHO recommended a focused or goal-orientated approach to ANC to enhance the quality of care and increase ANC coverage, especially in LMICs. The focused ANC (FANC) model entailed four ANC visits occurring between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation, between 24 and 26 weeks, at 32 weeks, and between 36 and 38 weeks. Guidance on each visit included specific evidence-based interventions for healthy pregnant women with appropriate referral of high-risk women and those who develop pregnancy complications.</p>
                        <p>On November 7th, 2016, the World Health Organization released its comprehensive recommendations on routine ANC for pregnant women and adolescent girls and this model entailed 8 visits.</p>

                        <h3>Justification of the new 2016 ANC Model</h3>
                        <p>This guideline recommendation was informed by:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Evidence suggesting increased perinatal deaths in 4-visit ANC model</li>
                            <li>Evidence supporting improved safety during pregnancy through increased frequency of maternal and fetal assessment to detect complications</li>
                            <li>Evidence supporting improved health system communication and support around pregnancy for women and families</li>
                            <li>Evidence indicating that more contact between pregnant women and respectful, knowledgeable health care workers is more likely to lead to a positive pregnancy experience.</li>
                            <li>Evidence from HIC studies indicating no important differences in maternal and perinatal health outcomes between ANC models that included at least eight contacts and ANC models that included 11 to 15 contacts</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: As comprehensive as the current recommendations are, the guideline development process also identified several knowledge gaps such as antenatal screening of gestational diabetes mellitus and future updates will also aim at including more extensive health system-level recommendations on how to improve utilization and quality of antenatal care</p>

                        <h3>Summary of the 2016 ANC Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>49 recommendations are grouped into five topic areas:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Nutritional interventions (14)</li>
                            <li>Maternal and fetal assessment (13)</li>
                            <li>Preventive measures (7)</li>
                            <li>Interventions for common physiological symptoms (6)</li>
                            <li>Health systems interventions to improve the utilization and quality of ANC (9)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Antenatal care models with a minimum of eight contacts are recommended to reduce perinatal mortality and improve women's experience of care. There are five contacts in the third trimester, one contact in the first trimester, and two contacts in the second trimester. The new model recommends pregnant women to have their first contact during the first 12 weeks' gestation, with following contacts taking place at 20, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38 and 40 weeks of gestation.</p>

                        <h3>GROUP ANC</h3>
                        <p>This is an alternative model. ANC conventionally takes the form of a one-on-one consultation between a pregnant woman and her health-care provider. Group ANC (GANC) integrates the usual individual pregnancy health assessment with tailored group educational activities and peer support, with the aim of motivating behavior change among pregnant women, improving pregnancy outcomes, and increasing women's satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Group ANC needs to be delivered in a space large enough to accommodate a group of pregnant women based on the gestational ages, with a private area for examinations.</p>
                        <p>The intervention typically involves:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Self-assessment activities (e.g., Blood pressure measurement)</li>
                            <li>Group education with facilitated discussion</li>
                            <li>Socialization activities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Group antenatal care provided by qualified health-care professionals may be offered as an alternative to individual antenatal care for pregnant women in the context of rigorous research, depending on a woman's preferences and provided that the infrastructure and resources for delivery of group antenatal care are available.</p>
                        <p>Group care studies conducted in Kenya and Nigeria showed improved quality of ANC. Patient and provider experience was more satisfactory with group care. There was more empowerment and self-efficacy with the pregnancy, newborn care, postpartum family planning and healthier outcomes.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Reducing health inequalities by improving health literacy among less-educated women.</li>
                            <li>Providing social support. The flexibility of the format allows women to exchange valuable information with each other and discuss pregnancy-related concerns in a relaxed and informal manner</li>
                            <li>Improving maternal and neonatal outcomes</li>
                            <li>Enhances the move towards the 8 -contact model</li>
                            <li>Resources are effectively put into good use</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Group ANC may take longer than individual ANC, and this may pose practical problems for some women in terms of work and childcare.</li>
                            <li>In settings with poor transport systems or variable weather, the appointment system with group ANC may not be suitable and may have a negative impact on equity for women living in remote areas.</li>
                            <li>Group ANC may have acceptability and feasibility issues in settings where perceived differences keep people apart, e.g. women from different castes in India may not wish to be in a group together.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health-care facilities need to be seeing sufficient numbers of pregnant women, as allocation to groups is ideally performed according to gestational age.</p>

                        <h3>Recommendations and Conclusions (ACOG 2018)</h3>
                        <p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists makes the following recommendations:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Group prenatal care models are designed to improve patient education and include opportunities for social support while maintaining the risk screening and physical assessment of individual prenatal care.</li>
                            <li>Studies appear to demonstrate high levels of patient satisfaction, obstetric outcomes equally efficacious as individual prenatal care, and improved outcomes for some populations.</li>
                            <li>Specific group prenatal care models can be challenging to initiate and maintain. The cost of initiating a group prenatal care model in current obstetric practices may be a barrier to implementation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Preventive measures during pregnancy</h3>
                        <p><strong>IFAS:</strong> When anemia in pregnancy (hemoglobin level less than 11g/dl) is diagnosed, the dose of elemental iron should be increased to 120 mg until the Hb concentration rises to normal or higher.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> Vitamin A supplementation is not recommended to improve maternal or perinatal outcomes unless in areas where Vitamin A deficiency is considered a significant public health problem. When indicated Vitamin A is given daily or weekly (up to 10,000 IU per day or weekly dose of up to 25,000 IU) to prevent night blindness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tetanus Diphtheria (TD) vaccination:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>If a pregnant woman has not been previously vaccinated, or her immunization status is unknown, she should receive two doses of TD vaccine one month apart with the second dose given at least 2 weeks before delivery/childbirth. 2 doses protect against TD infection for 13 years. A third dose is recommended six months after the second dose, which should extend protection to at least 5 years.</li>
                            <li>Two further doses for women who are first vaccinated against TD during pregnancy should be given after the third dose, in the two subsequent years or during two subsequent pregnancies.</li>
                            <li>If a woman has had 1-4 TD injections in the past, she should receive one dose of TT during each subsequent pregnancy to a total of 5 doses (5 doses offer protection throughout the childbearing years).</li>

                        <p><strong>IPTp:</strong> Intermittent preventive treatment with Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is recommended for all pregnant women living in the malaria endemic areas. Dosing should start in the second trimester (13 weeks) and be given at least one month apart; with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received.</p>
                        <p>The National guidelines on Malaria prevention - start at 13 weeks, monthly till delivery. HIV positive mothers on Cotrimoxazole should not take IPT.</p>

                        <p>Additional investigations that can be done prenatally include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Chlamydia: Selective testing for Chlamydia should be considered for those who may be at increased risk according to local prevalence.</li>
                            <li>Hepatitis B serology: Women found to be chronic carriers of Hepatitis B, should have an assessment of their viral replicative status (i.e. HBV DNA level and HBe antigen status) and liver function performed, and be referred for specialist support.</li>
                            <li>Hepatitis C serology: Women who are known to be Hepatitis C antibody positive should have liver function tests performed and an assessment of their viral load (Hepatitis C RNA PCR).I Consider referral to an appropriate specialist for counseling and planning postnatal follow up.</li>
                            <li>Varicella: Consideration should be given to checking varicella antibodies at the first visit where there is no definite history of chickenpox.</li>
                            <li>Cervical screening: Cervical screening for HPV/dysplasia should be recommended at the first antenatal visit if this would fall due during the pregnancy, according to cervical screening guidelines.</li>
                            <li>Screening for Down syndrome: Chorionic venous sampling and amniocentesis</li>
                            <li>Screening for haemoglobinopathies: Hemoglobin electrophoresis (HbEPG) or highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and exclusion of iron deficiency (ferritin level) should be performed in the event of low MCV. Full assessment of fetal risk requires investigation of the partner.</li>
                            <li>Vitamin D: Gravid women at risk for vitamin D deficiency should be tested in early pregnancy or provided with vitamin D supplementation.</li>
                            <li>Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Routine serological screening for CMV infection in pregnancy is not recommended.</li>

                        <h3>RESPECTFUL MATERNITY CARE (RMC)</h3>
                        <p>Respectful maternity care - which refers to care organized for and provided to all women in a manner that maintains their dignity, privacy and confidentiality, ensures freedom from harm and mistreatment, and enables informed choice and continuous support during labour and childbirth.</p>
                        <p>Respectful maternity care (RMC) is not only a crucial component of quality of care; it is a human right. In 2014, WHO released a statement calling for the prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth, stating that "every woman has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the right to dignified, respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth."</p>
                        <p>The aim of RMC is to give total respect and to preserve the dignity of all women throughout their stay in the health facility. Their privacy and confidentiality should be respected at all times, and any kind of mistreatment, such as physical, sexual or verbal abuse, discrimination, neglect, detainment, extortion or denial of services, should be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Effective communication and engagement among health care providers, health service managers, women and representatives of women's groups and women's rights movements is essential to ensure that care is responsive to women's needs and preferences in all contexts and settings.</p>
                        <p>Interventions should aim to ensure a respectful and dignified working environment for those providing care, acknowledging that staff may also experience disrespect and abuse in the workplace and/or violence at home or in the community.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>All women and newborns have privacy around the time of antenatal, labour/childbirth, and postnatal care and their confidentiality is respected.</li>
                            <li>No woman or newborn is subjected to mistreatment, such as physical, sexual or verbal abuse, discrimination, neglect, detainment, extortion or denial of services.</li>
                            <li>All women can make informed choices about the services they receive, and the reasons for interventions or outcomes are clearly explained.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>MATERNITY OPEN DAYS</h3>
                        <p>This concept was introduced by WHO in 2019 with the aim of public health facilities showcase what services they offer in maternal health and increase facility delivery in order to utilize the free maternal health care services being offered in public health facilities. Targeted to increase antenatal attendance, skilled birth attendance and targeted postnatal care coverage to over 80% by 2030 in order to meet maternal and newborn care indicators of ICPD+25, (2019). This can be achieved through open maternity day in health facilities and community dialogue.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>During Maternity open day the pregnant mother, her partner, family and the community are provided with an opportunity to visit and tour the maternity unit, meet with obstetricians/gynecologists, midwives and other health care providers.</li>
                            <li>They interact with the health care providers one on one, learn about birth preparedness, choice of birth place and see services offered in maternity. Information on preconception care, breastfeeding, health and wellbeing, Insurance services/Linda mama package, birthing positions, danger signs in pregnancy, nutrition in pregnancy and other services relevant to pregnancy are given.</li>
                            <li>The pregnant mother, her male partner, family and community are taken round the maternity wing to see the environment and equipment available.</li>
                            <li>Maternity open days exist to facilitate birth preparedness and encourage more mothers to deliver in hospitals and also involve the male partner and community in maternal health issues.</li>
