                        <h3>People Living with Disability (PLWD)</h3>
                        <p>People Living with Disability (PLWD) have less access to health care and health promotion
                            services. Women with disabilities are recognized as particularly disadvantaged, experiencing
                            exclusion double burden to their gender and disability condition and often very vulnerable
                            to abuse.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the developing world, it is reported that people with disabilities have less
                            access to healthcare services due to barriers and often experience unmet healthcare needs.
                            Women with disabilities face more challenges in accessing healthcare, particularly maternal
                            healthcare-resulting in higher risk situations and poorer outcomes than women without
                            disabilities.</p>
                        <p>Disability is defined as a long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment
                            which in interaction with various barriers may hinder a person's full and effective
                            participation in society on an equal basis with others.</p>

                        <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                        <p>Special programmes are needed to meet the special needs of women with disabilities. These
                            should include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Training service providers on providing services to the women with disabilities e.g. in
                                communication skills with sensory disabled and to provide individualized care on types
                                of disability</li>
                            <li>Disseminating guidelines for staff on how to deal with persons with disabilities during
                                pregnancy, labour childbirth and in the postnatal period</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the existing and proposed physical infrastructure is universally accessible
                                and friendly to PWDs in all aspects to include pregnancy, labour and childbirth and
                                postnatal care</li>
                            <li>Integrate reproductive health and HIV/AIDS information and services for PLWD accessing
                                pregnancy, delivery, and postnatal services.</li>
                            <li>Designing services that can provide properly packaged information for PWDs.</li>
                            <li>Make MCH programmes more inclusive by investing in outreach and family-based approaches

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Globally, approximately 140 million births occur every year. Over a third of maternal deaths
                            and a substantial proportion of pregnancy-related life-threatening conditions are attributed
                            to complications that arise during labour, childbirth or the immediate postpartum period,
                            often as result of haemorrhage, obstructed labour or sepsis.</p>
                        <p>The burden of maternal and perinatal deaths is disproportionately higher in low- and
                            middle-income countries (LMICs) compared to high-income countries (HICs). Almost all
                            perinatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and half occur
                            intrapartum.</p>
                        <p>The partograph is associated with improved perinatal outcomes and is recommended for use with
                            intermittent auscultation for intrapartum monitoring in low resource settings. In the active
                            first stage of labour, auscultation is usually performed every 15-30 minutes, whereas in the
                            second stage it is usually performed every 5 minutes/after every contraction.</p>

                        <p>CTG analysis starts with the evaluation of basic CTG features (baseline, variability,
                            accelerations, decelerations, and contractions) followed by overall CTG classification. A
                            record of the tracing needs to be put in the patient file and with back up archiving
                            accessible to clinical staff for review.</p>

                        <p>When fetal hypoxia/acidosis is anticipated or suspected i.e. suspicious and pathological CTG
                            tracings, action is required to avoid adverse neonatal outcome. Good clinical judgement is
                            required to diagnose the underlying cause for a suspicious or pathological CTG, to judge the
                            reversibility of the conditions with which it is associated, and to determine the timing of
                            delivery, with the objective of avoiding prolonged fetal hypoxia/acidosis, as well as
                            unnecessary obstetric intervention.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Excessive uterine activity:</strong> is the most frequent cause of fetal
                                hypoxia/acidosis and it can be detected by documenting tachysystole in the CTG tracing
                                and/or palpating the uterine fundus. It can usually be reversed by reducing or stopping
                                oxytocin infusion, removing administered prostaglandins if possible, and/or starting
                                acute tocolysis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aortocaval compression:</strong> can occur in the supine position and lead to
                                reduced placental perfusion. Turning the mother to her left side is frequently followed
                                by normalization of the CTG pattern.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transient cord compression:</strong> is another common cause of CTG changes
                                (variable decelerations), and these can sometimes be reverted by changing the maternal
                                position or by performing amnioinfusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sudden maternal hypotension:</strong> can also occur during labor, usually after
                                epidural or spinal analgesia, and it is usually reversible by rapid fluid administration
                                and/or an intravenous ephedrine bolus.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Augmentation of labour is the process of stimulating the uterus to increase the frequency,
                            duration and intensity of contractions after the onset of spontaneous labour. Common
                            underlying causes include inefficient uterine contractions, abnormal fetal presentation or
                            position, inadequate bony pelvis or soft tissue abnormalities of the mother.</p>

                        <h3>Indications</h3>

                            <li>Augmentation of labour has commonly been used to treat delayed labour when uterine
                                contractions are assessed to be insufficiently strong or inappropriately coordinated to
                                dilate the Cervix</li>
                            <li>Augmentation of labour should be performed only when there is a clear medical indication

                        <h3>Treatment/ Augmentation process</h3>
                        <p>The traditional methods of labour augmentation have been with the use of intravenous oxytocin
                            infusion and artificial rupture of the membranes (amniotomy). Oxytocin augmentation is
                            recommended in women with ineffective contractions. Oxytocin Augmentation shortens birth
                            outcomes but eventual reduction in instrumental delivery is not documented.</p>

                        <h4>Administration of oxytocin</h4>
                        <p>IV 5 IU in 500 mls of N/saline starting at 10 drops/min (Primigravida) and titrating by 10
                            drops/min up to a max of 60 drops/min. For Multiparous, start at IV 2.5 IU at 10 drops/min
                            up to the max of 60drops /min. The fetus should be monitored continuously with CTG when the
                            labour is accelerated with oxytocin. Duration, Strength and frequency of contractions should
                            be continuously recorded on the partograph.</p>

                                finger into the cervical canal to separate the membranes from the lower uterine segment
                                all around as much as possible. This stimulates natural prostaglandin production.</li>

                        <h4>Amniotomy</h4>
                        <p>Mode of action: Release of prostaglandins and Bringing the presenting part closer to the
                            lower uterine segment so the uterine activity will be reflexly encouraged. Oxytocin should
                            be commenced immediately after amniotomy.</p>

                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Lithotomy position. Antiseptic measures for the vagina, vulva and perineum.</li>
                            <li>Vaginal examination to check pelvic capacity, cervical dilatation, presentation,
                                position, station and degree of flexion of the head and that the membranes are ruptured.
                            </li>
                            <li>Application of the cup: The largest cup that can easily passed is introduced sideways
                                into the vagina by pressing it backwards against the perineum. It is then applied as
                                near as possible to the posterior fontanelle over the mid sagittal line with its edge 3
                                cm from the anterior fontanelle.</li>
                            <li>Creating the negative pressure: holding the cup in place, the negative pressure is
                                gradually increased by 0.2 kg/cm² every 1 minute until -0.8 kg/cm² is attained. This
                                creates an artificial caput within the cup.</li>
                            <li>Traction: on the handle is made perpendicular to the cup and intermittently during
                                uterine contractions, the direction of pull is changing as the head descends through the
                                birth canal.</li>
                            <li>Release of the cup: when the head is delivered the vacuum is reduced as slowly as it was
                                created using the screw as this diminishes the risk of scalp damage.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A caesarean section (CS) is the process through which a fetus is delivered through an
                            abdominal and uterine incision. Caesarean sections have become increasingly common over the
                            past three decades. This has resulted in a major public health concern and cause worldwide
                            debates due to potential maternal and perinatal risks associated with this increase,
                            inequity in access and cost issues.</p>
                        <p>The incidence of caesarean sections is represented as a rate-Caesarean section rate- which is
                            defined as the number of cesarean deliveries over the total number of live births, and is
                            usually expressed as a percentage. The Caesarean section rate (CS rate) is between 10-15%.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Robson Classification</h3>
                        <p>This system was proposed by WHO in 2015 in order to provide a classification system to
                            monitor and compare CS rates at facility level in a standardized, reliable, consistent and
                            action-oriented manner. The Robson system classifies all women admitted for delivery (not
                            women who've only had a caesarean section) into one of 10 groups based on: number of
                            previous pregnancies, previous uterine scars, current gestation type (singleton vs multiple
                            gestation), gestational age, presentation and lie of the baby (cephalic, breech, transverse)
                            and onset of labor.</p>

                        <p>FGM is practised for a variety of complex reasons and socio- culturally is believed that it
                            is beneficial for the girl. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female
                            genital tissue, and interferes with the natural function of girls and women's bodies with no
                            health benefit but detrimental reproductive health consequences. These risks increasing with
                            the severity of the procedure. FGM is a human rights violation and a form of child abuse,
                            breaching the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is a severe form of
                            violence against women and girls. In Kenya this harmful practice is illegal and includes the
                            medicalization of the same.</p>

                        <h3>FGM classification</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Type I:</strong> Often referred to as clitoridectomy, this is the partial or
                                total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female
                                genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type II:</strong> Often referred to as excision, this is the partial or total
                                removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia
                                majora.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type III:</strong> Often referred to as infibulation, this is the narrowing of
                                the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by
                                cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through
                                stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type IV:</strong> This includes all other harmful procedures to the female
                                genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and
                                cauterizing the genital area.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Management of childbirth in a woman with FGM</h3>
                        <p><strong>Antenatal booking visits:</strong> Ask all women about FGM. Women who have undergone
                            Type I, II and III FGM must be examined at their first antenatal attendance to assess the
                            degree of damage. Record the appearance of the vulva on the clients ANC card.</p>

                        <p><strong>Management during labor:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>IF FGM has caused a tight introitus there is a need to increase the vaginal opening by
                                performing an episiotomy</li>
                            <li>Women with type I, tend to be able to deliver vaginally without episiotomy unless there
                                is extensive scarring causing inelasticity of the perineum</li>
                            <li>Women with type III: must be opened up during the second stage of labor when the
                                presenting part is pressing on the vulva</li>
                            <li>EPISIOTOMY usually performed during the second stage of labor however can be performed
                                earlier</li>
                            <li>If a woman presents with type III C/S is more appropriate than deinfibulation and
                                vaginal delivery; Explain the need for operation and seek her consent to perform it Or
                                refer her to a CEMONC</li>
                        </ul>
