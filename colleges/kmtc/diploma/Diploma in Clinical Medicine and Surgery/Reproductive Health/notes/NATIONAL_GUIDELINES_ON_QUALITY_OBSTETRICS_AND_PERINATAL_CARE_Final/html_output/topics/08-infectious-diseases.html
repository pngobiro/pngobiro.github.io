                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major public health problem worldwide with
                            direct and indirect impacts affecting quality of life and causing serious morbidity and
                            mortality. STIs have a direct impact on reproductive and child health through infertility,
                            cancers and pregnancy complications and an indirect impact through their role in
                            facilitating sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on national and
                            individual economies through increased morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Simple, cost-effective screening and treatment options during pregnancy can eliminate most of
                            these complications. Screening all pregnant women for syphilis at first antenatal care visit
                            is recommended in many countries of the world and is being scaled up rapidly in countries
                            committed to the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV and syphilis.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                        <p>In 2015, nearly 1 million pregnant women worldwide were infected with Syphilis. In 2012, an
                            estimated 350,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis,
                            including 143,000 early foetal deaths/stillbirths, 62,000 neonatal deaths, 44,000
                            preterm/low-birth-weight babies and 102,000 infected infants.</p>

                            <li>All women should be screened serologically for syphilis early in pregnancy</li>
                            <li>For communities and populations in which the prevalence of syphilis is high and for
                                women at high risk for infection, serologic testing should also be performed twice
                                during the third trimester: once at 28-32 weeks' gestation and again at delivery.</li>
                            <li>Any woman who has a foetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for
                                syphilis.</li>
                            <li>No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having
                                been documented at least once during pregnancy, and if the mother is considered high
                                risk, documented at delivery</li>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Malaria is a protozoan infection by the Plasmodium species. The plasmodium parasite is
                            transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. Annually, around 125 million pregnancies
                            around the world are at risk from malaria. In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 25 million
                            pregnant women are at risk of infection yearly.</p>
                        <p>Malaria in pregnancy is a significant contributing factor to maternal death. It was estimated
                            to have been responsible for approximately 15% of maternal deaths globally. Annually,
                            Malaria in pregnancy is responsible for 20% of stillbirths and 11% of neonatal deaths in
                            sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

                        <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Increased susceptibility to malaria infection during pregnancy results in high parasitemia
                            and heavy infiltration of parasite-infected RBCs in placental vasculature, a privilege site
                            where the parasite can evade maternal immune response especially filtration by the spleen.

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>A key goal of managing HIV in pregnancy and postpartum is to optimize a woman's own health
                            and zero rate infection to the neonate. The transmission of HIV from a HIV-positive mother
                            to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called mother-to-child
                            transmission. In the absence of any intervention, transmission rates range from 15% to 45%.
                            This rate can be reduced to below 5% with effective interventions.</p>

                        <h3>During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</h3>
                        <p>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) should be offered as part of a
                            comprehensive package of fully integrated, routine antenatal care interventions. Lifelong
                            ART should be initiated in all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless
                            of gestational age, WHO clinical stage and at any CD4 count.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>ART should be started, ideally, on the same day as HIV diagnosis is made with ongoing
                                enhanced adherence support</li>
                            <li>The preferred first line ART regimen for pregnant and breastfeeding women is <strong>TDF
                                    + 3TC + DTG</strong> (WHO JULY 2019)</li>
                            <li>For pregnant and breastfeeding women newly initiated on ART, obtain VL 3 months after
                                initiation, and then every 6 months until complete cessation of breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>All HEI should receive infant ARV prophylaxis consisting of 6 weeks of AZT + NVP and
                                thereafter NVP should be continued until 6 weeks after complete cessation of
                                breastfeeding</li>
                            <li>All infants irrespective of HIV status should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6
                                months of life.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Intrapartum Management</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Minimize vaginal examinations.</li>
                            <li>Avoid routine artificial rupture of membranes (ARM).</li>
                            <li>Avoid routine episiotomy.</li>
                            <li>Minimize the risk of postpartum haemorrhage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mode of delivery:</strong> Vaginal delivery is appropriate for HIV-infected
                                pregnant women who have been maintained on combined antiretroviral therapy and who have
                                viral loads of 1,000 copies/mL or less at or near delivery. The risk of mother-to-child
                                transmission in HIV-infected women with high viral loads can be reduced by performing
                                caesarean deliveries before the onset of labor and before rupture of membranes.</li>
