                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hyperglycaemia in pregnancy is increasingly becoming a public health concern due to the
                            increase in prevalence of non-communicable diseases. This is aggravated by: increasing
                            maternal ages with pregnancy, lifestyles that include poor nutritional choices and sedentary
                            habits, assisted reproductive technology that predisposes to multiple pregnancies with a
                            higher risk of metabolic syndromes.</p>

                        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>One in six live births occurs to women with some form of hyperglycaemia. The
                                International Diabetes Federation estimates that diabetes affects about 415 million
                                people globally, which is projected to increase to 642 million people by 2040.</li>
                            <li>There is an equally high burden of pre-diabetes-approximately 318 million are estimated
                                to have pre-diabetes, which is likely to increase to about 481 million by 2040. There
                                are currently over 199 million women living with diabetes and this is projected to
                                increase to 313 million by 2040.More than one-third of people with diabetes and a
                                majority of people with pre-diabetes remain undiagnosed and unaware.</li>
                            <li>Overweight and obesity, which increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, are
                                also on the rise globally. According to WHO data, in 2014 more than half of the world's
                                adult population was overweight (39%) and 41 million children under the age of 5 were
                                obese (13%). The high levels of overweight and obesity in the adult population including
                                women in the reproductive age (estimated 42 million pregnant women) has important
                                ramification for the future burden of HIP, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular
                                diseases.</li>
                            <li>In Africa, diabetes was essentially unknown in 1901, yet in 2013, 19.8 million people
                                were reportedly living with the condition and this number gestational diabetes is
                                estimated to complicate 1-14% of pregnancies with mild degrees of glucose intolerance
                                being even higher (4-7%) predicted to increase to 41.5 million in 2035.4 Prevalence of
                                gestational diabetes is higher in African than white women.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In Kenya, there is paucity of data in relation to hyperglycaemia in pregnancy</p>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p><strong>Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> is a clinical syndrome characterized by a deficiency of
                            or insensitivity to insulin and exposure of organs to chronic hyperglycaemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gestational diabetes Mellitus:</strong> Is any degree of glucose intolerance with
                            first recognition during pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3>Aetiology</h3>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes that occur in all women during
                            pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy differs from GDM in that the hyperglycaemia is more severe and
                            does not resolve after pregnancy as it does with GDM.</p>
                        <p>Increased levels of placental hormones interfere with the ability of insulin to manage
                            glucose. This condition is called "insulin resistance." Usually, the mother's pancreas is
                            able to produce more insulin (about three times the normal amount) to overcome insulin
                            resistance. If this does not occur, glucose levels will rise, resulting in gestational
                            diabetes. Usually, blood glucose levels return to normal after childbirth.</p>

                        <h3>Risk factors</h3>
                        <p>Women with risk factors for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy should be screened or tested at first
                            contact. Some of these risk factors include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Pre-pregnancy BMI >30;</li>

                            <li>Pregnant women at high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus based on multiple risk
                                factors, should be screened at first contact and repeated at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation
                                if initially normal. If for any reason it was missed or if there is a clinical suspicion
                                of later onset of gestational diabetes, a screening or diagnostic test should be
                                performed. (II-2B)</li>
                            <li>Universal screening should be offered to all pregnant women at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Women with pre-existing or gestational diabetes mellitus should be provided with care by
                                a multidisciplinary team aimed at attaining and then maintaining euglycemia (II-2B)</li>
                            <li>For patients with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus,
                                baseline sonographic assessment of foetal growth and amniotic fluid volume is
                                recommended starting at 28 weeks' gestation, with subsequent serial assessment of foetal
                                growth and amniotic fluid volume, every 2 to 4 weeks, to assess the effect of maternal
                                glycaemic control on foetal growth rate and amniotic fluid volume. (II-2B).</li>
                            <li>Initiation of weekly assessment of foetal well-being at 36 weeks is recommended in
                                pregestational diabetes mellitus and medically treated gestational diabetes mellitus. It
                                is also reasonable to consider weekly foetal assessment for women with diet-controlled
                                gestational diabetes mellitus beginning at 36 weeks. Acceptable methods of assessment of
                                foetal wellbeing near term can include the non-stress test, non-stress test + amniotic
                                fluid index, biophysical profile, or a combination of these. (III-A)</li>
                            <li>If comorbid factors are present, such as obesity, evidence of suboptimal glycaemic
                                control, large for gestational age (> 90%), previous stillbirth, hypertension, or small
                                for gestational age (< 10%), earlier onset and/or more frequent foetal health
                                    surveillance is recommended. In specific cases in which foetal growth restriction is
                                    suspected, the addition of umbilical artery and foetal middle cerebral artery
                                    Doppler assessment may be helpful. (II-2A).</li>
                            <li>Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus or pre-gestational diabetes mellitus
                                should be offered induction between 38 to 40 weeks' gestation depending on their
                                glycaemic control and other comorbidity factors. (II-2B) Should be induced at 38-39
                                weeks' gestation, guided by clinical practice, experience and country context.</li>
                            <li>The administration of betamethasone or dexamethasone to pregnant women with gestational
                                diabetes mellitus should be restricted to the routine obstetric indications related to
                                the risk of preterm and late preterm delivery between 24 to 36 weeks' gestation, when
                                clinically indicated. When administered, close maternal glycaemic surveillance is
                                recommended. (I-A).</li>
                            <li>If not previously done, in women with threatened preterm labour requiring betamethasone,
                                screening for gestational diabetes mellitus should be performed either before or at
                                least 7 days after the administration of betamethasone. (III-B).</li>
                            <li>Women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be offered testing with a 75-g oral
                                glucose tolerance test between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum to detect prediabetes and
                                diabetes. I (II-2A).</li>
                            <li>Breastfeeding is strongly recommended after delivery for all women with pre-gestational
                                diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus. (II-2A)</li>
                            <li>The adverse outcomes associated with diabetes in pregnancy are substantially associated
                                with hyperglycemia and the coexisting metabolic environment. Women with preexisting
                                diabetes should receive preconception care to optimize blood sugar control and other
                                comorbidities. Outcomes for the fetus/neonate and the mother in both pre-gestational
                                diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies are improved by
                                multidisciplinary management in which the goal is achieving optimal blood sugar control
                                and appropriate fetal surveillance. (II-2)</li>
                            <li>Retrospective studies indicate that women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus have an
                                increased risk of stillbirth before 40 weeks' gestation compared with the general
                                obstetrical population. Similarly, large recent cohort and simulation studies of women
                                with gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies also indicate a higher risk of stillbirth
                                between 36 to 39 weeks' gestation. (II-2)</li>
                            <li>Women with gestational diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of Pre-eclampsia, shoulder
                                dystocia, Caesarean section, and large for gestational age infants. (II-2)</li>
                            <li>The occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus increases the risk of developing type 2
                                diabetes in the future for the mother. (II-2)</li>
                        </ul>

                                pregnancy will reduce the risk of miscarriage, congenital malformation, stillbirth and
                                neonatal death. It is important to explain that risks can be reduced but not eliminated.

                            <li>If it is safely achievable, women with diabetes should aim to keep fasting blood glucose
                                between 3.5 and 5.9 mmol/litre and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose below 7.8
                                mmol/litre during pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Diabetics have triple the normal rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Therefore, a urine
                                culture is obtained initially, and appropriate treatment initiated if it is positive.
                                After cessation of therapy, urinary culture is again obtained to confirm the elimination
                                of the infection.</li>
                            <li>Protein detected in clean-catch urine specimens should be evaluated by 24-hour urine
                                testing and repeated as needed.</li>
                            <li>In addition to routine prenatal care, the development of oedema (including carpal tunnel
                                syndrome) is closely monitored. If oedema occurs, greater attention to glucose control
                                (e.g. returning to daily monitoring) and enhanced bed rest are necessities.</li>
                            <li>Clinical/ultrasound assessment of foetal growth should be routinely carried out. In
                                addition, women with diabetes should be offered an antenatal examination of the
                                four-chamber view of the foetal heart and outflow tracts at 18-20 weeks.</li>
                            <li>Weekly NSTs (from 32 weeks' gestation) is recommended in patients with insulin-requiring
                                gestational diabetes, with an increase to biweekly recommend after 36 weeks as well as
                                the addition of AFI evaluation. For diet-controlled gestational diabetics, weekly NSTs
                                are usually begun at 36 weeks.</li>
                            <li>All patients should be instructed to make daily assessments of foetal movements and to
                                alert the physician if a decrease is noted.</li>
                            <li>A biophysical profile should be done if decreased movement is noted or if a nonreactive
                                NST occurs.</li>
                            <li>During pregnancy, women who are suspected of having ketoacidosis should be admitted
                                immediately for critical care, where they can receive both medical and obstetric care.
                            </li>
                            <li>In the case of abnormal foetal testing, the practitioner should assess gestational age
                                and, if the foetus is found to be mature, delivery should be expedited. If the foetus is
                                intermediate in maturity, amniotic fluid assessment for pulmonary maturity may assist in
                                the decision regarding whether delivery should be effected. Lung maturity should also be
                                assessed before elective induction if glucose control is questionable or if the foetus
                                is less than 38 weeks unless foetal jeopardy is suspected. The lecithin: sphingomyelin
                                ratio should be 2.5 or higher due to the higher incidence of respiratory distress in the
                                foetus. If the foetus is immature, further testing such as contraction stress tests or
                                hospitalization with continuous foetal heart rate monitoring is advised.</li>
                            <li>Preterm labour is increased in patients with diabetes, and they should be treated with
                                magnesium sulphate as the initial tocolytic agent because the beta mimetic markedly
                                influences glucose control. Corticosteroids increase maternal glucose levels, and
                                therapy should be prescribed to keep levels in the desired range. This therapy may
                                consist of continuous insulin infusion in certain cases.</li>
                            <li>Induction of labour is recommended at 38 weeks in patients with poor glucose control and
                                macrosomia. Use of Prostaglandin to ripen the cervix reduces the caesarean section rate,
                                but is not advised without a negative contraction stress test if oligohydramnios is the
                                indication for induction.</li>

                        <h3>Glucose Measurements</h3>
                        <p>Blood glucose control can be evaluated in one of three ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)</li>
                            <li>Self-monitoring of blood glucose</li>
                            <li>Continuous glucose monitoring.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Glycosylated haemoglobin</h4>
                        <p>This test reflects the average glucose level in the three months prior to measurement. It is
                            correlated with the risk of congenital malformations, not to any other adverse pregnancy
                            outcomes. It is best used for pregnancy planning and prenatal follow-up in cases of diabetes
                            in pregnancy. HbA1c does not replace the OGTT for the diagnosis of GDM. However, in women
                            with GDM, HbA1c may be used to verify the reliability of their self-monitored glucose
                            reports.</p>

                        <h4>Self-monitoring of blood glucose</h4>
                        <p>Self-monitoring of capillary glucose is achieved by multiple daily measurements of capillary
                            blood glucose with a handheld glucometer. It only provides glucose values at the time of
                            measurement and misses in between hyper/hypoglycaemic events.</p>
                        <p>Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended for all pregnant women with diabetes, 3-4
                            times a day:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Fasting: once daily, following at least 8 hours of overnight fasting</li>
                            <li>Postprandial: 2-3 times daily, 1 or 2 hours after the onset of meals, rotating meals on
                                different days of the week</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Continuous glucose monitoring</h4>
                        <p>The device consists of a subcutaneous enzymatic sensor attached to a non-implanted
                            transmitter that sends readings to a receiver and provides numerous automated readings of
                            interstitial tissue glucose, calibrated to reflect plasma glucose. The continuous
                            measurement enables detection of virtually all glucose fluctuations and helps modify
                            treatment. Continuous glucose monitoring may help achieve a small HbA1c reduction in a
                            non-pregnant population. It can detect high postprandial blood glucose levels and nocturnal
                            hypoglycaemia.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Treatment should include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Self-monitoring of blood glucose for all pregnant women with DM</li>
                            <li>Non-Medical interventions e.g. lifestyle change, & Medical interventions</li>
                            <li>ANC with DM-trained Healthcare provider</li>

                            without undue hypoglycaemia. This should be achieved throughout pregnancy and during labour
                            and delivery. Attempts must be made to achieve glucose levels as close as possible to those

                            38-39 weeks, although there is no good-quality evidence to support such an approach.</p>
                        <p>Given the significantly greater risk of shoulder dystocia at any birthweight above 3750 g for
                            babies of women with diabetes, consideration may be given to elective caesarean delivery
                            when the best estimate of foetal weight exceeds 4000 g</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>DKA in pregnancy is a significant complication of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. It is caused by
                            a relative or absolute insulin deficiency and simultaneous increase in counter-regulatory
                            hormones (cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon and growth hormone)</p>
                        <p>DKA occurs more commonly in Type 1 DM, but can also be observed in patients with Type 2 DM
                            and GDM. DKA may be the first presentation of Diabetes in pregnancy.</p>

                        <h3>DKA Pathogenesis</h3>
                        <p>Insulin deficiency results in decrease in glucose uptake by peripheral tissues accompanied by
                            significant metabolic changes including, proteolysis, increased gluconeogenesis,
                            glycogenolysis resulting in hyperglycemia as well as lipolysis which fuels hepatic
                            ketogenesis with subsequent ketoacidosis.</p>
                        <p>There are 3 major pathophysiologic syndromes associated with hyperglycemia in DKA;</p>

                        <p>Multidisciplinary approach to care involving an obstetrician, diabetologist/endocrinologist
                            in a higher-level facility or physician in a low-level facility,
                            anaesthesiologist/intensivist, neonatologist/paediatrician is key in optimizing favorable
                            outcomes in patients on treatment for DKA.</p>
                        <p>DKA in Pregnancy is an emergency and immediate care should take place in the ICU until the

                                dioxide (CO2), leading to an increment in CO2 partial pressure (PCO2), which may, in
                                turn, decreased fetal oxygen delivery It also results in paradoxical cerebral acidosis,
                                due to faster diffusion of CO2 through the blood brain barrier compared to infused
                                bicarbonate Further, bicarbonate administration delays the wash out of ketones and can
                                worsen hypokalemia</p>

                            <li>Use of glucose by the fetoplacental unit, with decreased maternal glycogenolysis and

                        <p>Principles mirror those of hyperglycemic DKA; however, concurrent administration of 5%
                            dextrose with IV saline through a separate IV access is advisable to prevent hypoglycemia
                            caused by IV insulin.</p>
                        <p>Majority of the fetal abnormalities improve after correction of the metabolic derangements
                            and maternal stabilisation.</p>
                        <p>The decision to continue the pregnancy or to proceed with delivery can be challenging. The
                            consultant obstetrician should therefore be involved. The MFM consultant's opinion should be
                            sought if possible. The aforementioned decisions should consider the following:</p>

                            <p>DKA on its own is NOT an indication for urgent delivery as this increases both maternal

                            <li>Education - the woman should plan her pregnancy with support from a team of diabetes
                                experts, she should receive information regarding risks associated poor glycemic control
                                during pregnancy</li>
                            <li>Self monitoring - of blood glucose levels using a glucometer. If hyperglycemia is found
                                or the patient feels unwell, availed urine ketone strips for checking for ketonuria
                                should be in place.</li>
                            <li>Pre pregnancy counselling - from primary care physician or at the diabetes clinic.
                                Discuss effective contraception to avoid unplanned pregnancy</li>

                        <h4>During Pregnancy</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Team - diabetes specialist nurse/midwife, diabetes specialist dietician and/or joint
                                obstetricdiabetes consultations for effective management</li>
                            <li>Screening - universal screening for Diabetes at 24 - 28 weeks of gestation and at first
                                contact in patients at risk of DM</li>
                            <li>Education - of women diagnosed with DM on precipitating factors and manifestations of
                                DKA. Use of simple language is advised.</li>
                            <li>Self monitoring - through use of a glucometer and patients with Type 1 should monitor
                                for ketones through use of ketone strips.</li>
                            <li>Suspected DKA - pregnant women with any form of DM should be advised to seek medical
                                attention if blood glucose levels are persistently above 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or if
                                they develop precipitating features. Assessment for admission should be done</li>
                            <li>Corticosteroid treatment (ACS for fetal lung maturity) - if required in suspected or
                                anticipated preterm birth, insulin dose should be adjusted gradually (usually increased
                                by 2540%)</li>
                            <li>Tocolysis treatment - if needed betamimetics should be avoided (they increase
                                susceptibility to DKA). Tocolytics that are safer include oxytocin receptor antagonists
                                (atosiban) or calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In order to prevent recurrence of DKA, the following are recommended prior to discharge;</p>

                            <li>Educating the patient about how to identify and rectify the precipitating factors;</li>
                            <li>Review with the patient, the pre-admission diabetes control, injection technique,
                                injection sites, reliability of the glucometer, and storage of insulin</li>
                            <li>Provision of the contact information of the diabetes team and a written plan of care to
                                the patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Further, prior to discharge, planning of future monitoring of the fetus and a follow-up
                            should be organised to review both maternal and fetal antenatal progress, and ensure
                            continuity of care.</p>
