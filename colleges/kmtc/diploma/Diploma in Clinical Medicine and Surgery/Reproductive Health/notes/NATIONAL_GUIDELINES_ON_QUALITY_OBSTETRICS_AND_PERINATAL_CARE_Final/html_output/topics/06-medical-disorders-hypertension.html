                        <p>Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy constitute one of the major direct causes of maternal and
                            perinatal morbidity and mortality.</p>

                        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate up to 10% of pregnancies globally. They
                                account for 12% of the direct causes of maternal mortality which includes obstetric
                                hemorrhage (25%), puerperal sepsis (15%), unsafe abortion (13%) and obstructed labor
                                (8%).</li>
                            <li>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy account for 26% of deaths in Latin America and the
                                Caribbean and 9% of deaths in Africa</li>
                            <li>Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity
                                and mortality. Pre-eclampsia is a major contributor to prematurity.</li>
                            <li>Pre-eclampsia complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies, contributes to 15% of preterm
                                deliveries, and between 9% to 26% of maternal deaths globally.</li>
                            <li>Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia related deaths can be avoided if women received timely and

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to
                            140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg measured on 2
                            occasions and at least 4 hours apart</p>

                        <p>There are 4 manifestations of hypertension in pregnancy</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Chronic hypertension</strong> (both essential and secondary hypertension):
                                Hypertension confirmed pre-conception or prior to 20 weeks gestation</li>
                            <li><strong>Gestational hypertension/Pregnancy induced hypertension:</strong> New onset
                                hypertension arising after 20 weeks gestation in the absence of proteinuria and other
                                systemic symptoms. It resolves generally within 3 months post-partum</li>
                            <li><strong>Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia:</strong> Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of
                                unknown etiology characterized by elevated BP of 140/90 mm Hg or more with proteinuria
                                after the 20th week of gestation in a previously normotensive and non-proteinuric woman.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension:</strong> Features of
                                pre-eclampsia developing in a woman who had hypertension prior to conception</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in pregnancy (ISSHP) in 2018
                            recommended inclusion of the following as part of the hypertension disease spectrum in
                            pregnancy</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>White coat hypertension:</strong> White-coat hypertension refers to elevated
                                office/clinic blood pressure ($\geq 140/90$ mm Hg), but normal blood pressure measured
                                at home or work ($<135 /85$ mm Hg); it is not an entirely benign condition and conveys
                                    an increased risk for Pre-eclampsia</li>
                            <li><strong>Masked hypertension:</strong> Masked hypertension is more difficult to diagnose.
                                Characterized by blood pressure that is normal at a clinic or office visit but elevated
                                at other times and is typically diagnosed by 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or
                                automated home BP monitoring.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transient gestational hypertension:</strong> Transient gestational hypertension
                                arises in the second or third trimester. Usually detected in the clinic but settles with
                                repeated BP readings. It differs from white-coat hypertension that, by definition, must
                                be present from early pregnancy. It is associated with a 40% risk of developing true
                                gestational hypertension or Pre-eclampsia in the remainder of the pregnancy, a fact that
                                highlights the importance of carefully follow-up of such women.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Additionally, the following findings are indicative of Pre- eclampsia:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Proteinuria (i.e., $\geq 30$ mg/mol protein: creatinine ratio; $\geq 300$ mg/24 hour; or
                                $\geq 2+$ dipstick );</li>
                            <li>Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including: acute kidney injury (creatinine
                                $\geq 90$ $\mu$mol/L; 1 mg/dL); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine
                                aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 40 IU/L) with or without right upper
                                quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications (e.g. eclampsia,
                                altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches, and persistent
                                visual scotomata); or hematological complications (thrombocytopenia-platelet count <
                                    150000 / $\mu$L, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis);</li>
                            <li>Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery
                                Doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth).</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Classification of pre-eclampsia</h3>
                        <p>The current consensus is that pre-eclampsia should be classified as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Pre-eclampsia without severe features</li>
                            <li>Pre-eclampsia with severe features</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Subclassification of Pre-eclampsia includes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Early-onset PE (with delivery at < 34+0 weeks of gestation);</li>
                            <li>Preterm PE (with delivery at < 37+0 weeks of gestation);</li>
                            <li>Late-onset PE (with delivery at $\geq$ 34+0 weeks of gestation);</li>
                            <li>Term PE (with delivery at $\geq$ 37+0 weeks of gestation).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This sub-classification is not discrete but used to address maternal and perinatal morbidity/
                            mortality in relation to gestation.</p>

                            pre-eclampsia. Seizures may occur ante-partum, intra-partum or post-partum usually within 24
                            hours of delivery.</p>

                            <li>Imminent eclampsia is defined in the Magpie trial as at least 2 of the following:
                                frontal headache, visual disturbances, altered sensorium, hyper-reflexia, epigastric
                                tenderness.</li>
                            <li>A common finding in eclampsia is posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome
                                (PRES). Vasogenic edema in the posterior cerebral circulation, a finding also seen in
                                hypertensive encephalopathy.</li>
                            <li>The hypertension associated with eclampsia and PRES is often less severe than in
                                nonpregnant hypertensive encephalopathy, and it is possible that the endothelial damage
                                associated with Pre-eclampsia predisposes to this syndrome even at lower blood pressure
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>HELLP syndrome</h3>
                        <p>HELLP syndrome describes a constellation of Hemolysis (anemia with blood film evidence of
                            hemolysis), Elevated Liver enzymes showing hepatic dysfunction (transaminases greater than
                            twice the normal range), and Low Platelets (platelet count of less than 150,000/dl).</p>
                        <p>HELLP is associated with maternal mortality and severe morbidity including disseminated
                            intravascular coagulopathy, liver hematoma, liver failure, and renal failure</p>

                        <h3>Pulmonary edema</h3>
                        <p>Hypoalbuminemia leads to reduced oncotic pressure and relative intravascular volume depletion
                            with significant interstitial fluid. Women with Pre-eclampsia are thus much more vulnerable
                            to pulmonary edema, especially those with significant renal impairment. For this reason,
                            careful fluid management is critical in all women with Pre-eclampsia, and pulmonary edema
                            secondary to iatrogenic fluid overload is a cause of maternal mortality in Pre-eclampsia</p>

                                    the patients to tertiary care centres. This approach has special implications in the

                                <p>Phenytoin has been used successfully in eclamptic seizures, but cardiac monitoring is

                                <p>Central anticonvulsant effect of phenytoin is by stabilizing neuronal activity by
                                    decreasing the ion flux across depolarizing membranes.</p>

                            <li>Despite the peripheral edema, patients with Pre-eclampsia are intravascularly volume
                                depleted with high peripheral vascular resistance. Diuretics should be avoided.</li>
                            <li>Aggressive volume resuscitation may lead to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema occurs most
                                frequently 48-72hours post-partum, probably due to mobilization of extravascular fluid.
                            </li>
                            <li>Volume expansion has no demonstrated benefit, patients should be fluid restricted when
                                possible, at least until the period of postpartum diuresis. Total fluids should
                                generally be limited to 80 mL/h or 1 mL/kg/h.</li>
                            <li>Careful measurement of fluid input and output is advisable, particularly in the
                                immediate postpartum period. Many patients will have a brief (up to 6 h) period of
                                oliguria following delivery; this should be anticipated and not overcorrected.</li>
                            <li>If fluids are required, preferably use Ringer's Lactate or Normal saline at a rate of 80
                                mls/hour or 1 ml/kg/hr. Avoid using Dextrose or Dextrose- Saline infusion</li>

                            <li>Delivery is the definitive treatment for antepartum Pre-eclampsia.</li>
                            <li>Patients with mild Pre-eclampsia are often induced after 37 weeks' gestation. Prior to
                                this, the immature fetus is treated with expectant management with corticosteroids to
                                accelerate lung maturity in preparation for early delivery.</li>
                            <li>In patients with severe Pre-eclampsia, induction of delivery should be considered after
                                34 weeks' gestation. In these cases, the severity of disease must be weighed against the
                                risks of prematurity.</li>
                            <li>Eclampsia is common after delivery and has occurred up to 6 weeks after delivery.
                                Patients at risk for eclampsia should be carefully monitored postpartum.</li>
                        </ul>

                            eclampsia, placental abruption, acute pulmonary edema, deteriorating platelet count,
                            persistent neurological symptoms, persistent epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.</p>

                            <li>Evidence has also shown that magnesium sulphate has a neuroprotective role in preventing
