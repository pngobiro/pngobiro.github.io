                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Mental health is defined as "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or
                            her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and
                            fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community."</p>
                        <p>Maternal mental health aims to address mental health issues in women along a continuum so as
                            to include preconception care, antenatal care, intrapartum care and postpartum care.
                            Previously, maternal mental health issues mostly concentrated on the postpartum period.
                            Major maternal mental health issues are now being referred to in the context of the
                            perinatal period as opposed to the post-partum period.</p>
                        <p>Mental illness is treatable and requires the ability to recognize, assess and treat for
                            sustained maternal, new-born and family well-being. The illness may be pre-existent or
                            develop in the course of the mother's life cycle or specific to a given pregnancy.
                            Challenges with continuation, change or cessation of psychotropic drugs exist during
                            pregnancy and lactation.</p>
                        <p>A multi- disciplinary approach is recommended in maternal mental ill health.</p>

                    <h2>Specific Disorders and Management</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Peri-natal anxiety disorders</h3>
                        <p>Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders with women, particularly those
                            in their child bearing years being most affected. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more
                            common in postpartum women relative to the general population. Medical diagnoses such as
                            hypo/hyperthyroidism, anemia, and hypertension have a similar phenotype and should be ruled
                            out.</p>

                        <h3>Peri-natal depression</h3>
                        <p>Depression related disorders are common during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. The
                            point prevalence of depression (major and minor) is estimated to be up to 11% in pregnancy
                            and 13% in the first 3 months postpartum. Perinatal onset of symptoms relating to depression
                            defines symptoms occurring anytime during pregnancy up to 1-month post-partum. In addition
                            to depressed mood, loss of interest in pleasurable activities and decreased energy,
                            perinatal depression with a postpartum onset is characterized by obsessive-compulsive,
                            particularly intrusive violent thoughts, psychotic symptoms, and anxiety.</p>
                        <p>For women with suspected post- natal depression, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale can
                            be used for screening purposes prior to referral to a psychiatrist for further evaluation
                            and management.</p>

                        <h3>Postpartum blues</h3>
                        <p>Postpartum blues also known as baby blues is the commonest constellation of mood symptoms
                            experienced by women in the immediate postpartum period. This affects approximately 50-80%
                            of women. It is transient in nature with an onset after the third postpartum day, typically
                            peaking by day five and resolving by day ten postpartum.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Mood lability (rapid mood shifts)</li>
                            <li>Tearfulness -not related to depressive episodes</li>
                            <li>Irritability</li>
                            <li>Anxiety</li>
                            <li>Insomnia</li>
                            <li>Lack of energy and increased fatigue</li>
                            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                            <li>A general experience of feeling overwhelmed-particularly with regard to newborn
                                caregiving tasks</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> No need for pharmacological treatment. Psychosocial treatment
                            modalities apply and can include Psychoeducation and encouraging the mother to seek for help
                            from the spouse, family members and friends.</p>

                        <h3>Postpartum psychosis</h3>
                        <p>Postpartum psychosis occurs in association with mood disorders (major depressive or manic
                            episodes). It occurs in approximately 1-2 women per 1000 childbirths. The syndrome is often
                            characterized by the mother's depression, delusions, and thoughts of harming either herself
                            or her infant. The onset of florid psychotic symptoms is preceded by prodromal symptoms such
                            as insomnia, restlessness, agitation, lability of mood, and mild cognitive deficits.</p>
                        <p>Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency. Management is multi- disciplinary with the
                            involvement of a psychiatrist.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Quality maternal healthcare is key for the achievement of SDG-3.1 and 3.2. This includes:
                            preconception care, antenatal care (including counselling for birth preparedness and
                            possible complications), intrapartum care and post-partum care. All pregnancies should be
                            handled with caution. Amongst women selected for low obstetric risk, approximately 25% will
                            develop peri-partum complications necessitating transfer to an obstetrician led service.</p>
                        <p>Intrapartum care for positive childbirth experience articulates the norms of good practice to
                            the desired end point of a healthy mother and healthy new-born. A positive childbirth
                            experience defined as one that fulfils or exceeds a woman's prior personal and sociocultural
                            beliefs and expectations, including giving birth to a healthy baby in a clinically and
                            psychologically safe environment with continuity of practical and emotional support from a
                            birth companion(s) or kind, technically competent clinical staff.</p>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Normal labour is a physiological process which commence spontaneously at term (37 completed
                            weeks) with rhythmic regular contractions of increasing intensity and frequency accompanied
                            by progressive cervical effacement and dilation, and descent of presenting part (preferably
                            cephalic) resulting in expulsion of a healthy foetus, a complete placenta and membranes and
                            a health mother.</p>

                        <h3>Stages of Normal Labour</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>1st Stage:</strong> from onset of labour to full dilatation of the cervix.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Latent first stage:</strong> a period of time characterized by painful
                                        uterine contractions and variable changes of the cervix, including some degree
                                        of effacement and slower progression of dilatation up to 5 cm for first and
                                        subsequent labours.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Active first stage:</strong> a period of time characterized by regular
                                        painful uterine contractions, a substantial degree of cervical effacement and
                                        more rapid cervical dilatation from 5 cm until full dilatation for first and
                                        subsequent labours.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The second stage is the period of time between full
                                        cervical dilatation and birth of the baby, during which the woman has an
                                        involuntary urge to bear down, as a result of expulsive uterine contractions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> In first labors, birth is usually completed within 3
                                        hours whereas in subsequent labors, birth is usually completed within 2 hours.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>3rd Stage:</strong> from delivery of the baby, to delivery of placenta.</li>
                            <li><strong>4th Stage:</strong> Up to one hour after expulsion of placenta</li>

                        <p>In February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a consolidated set of
                            recommendations on intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience. To facilitate
                            effective implementation of the above recommendations, WHO reviewed and revised the design
                            of the previous partograph. The Labour Care Guide (LCG) was designed for health personnel to
                            monitor the well-being of women and babies during labour through regular assessments to
                            identify any deviation from normality.</p>
                        <p>The LCG has seven sections:</p>
