                        <p>The nutritional status of a woman before and during pregnancy is important for a healthy pregnancy outcome. Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning in early stages of life, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health. Poor availability or access to food of adequate nutritional quality or the exposure to conditions that impair absorption and use of nutrients leads to undernutrition, poor vitamin and mineral status or overweight and obese may often present simultaneously. Maternal malnutrition is a key contributor to poor fetal growth, low birthweight (LBW) and short- and long-term infant morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Nutrition plays a pivotal role in determining health outcomes across the life course. In resource-poor Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Central and South-East Asia, maternal under-nutrition is highly prevalent and is recognized as a key determinant of maternal and perinatal outcomes. Adequate provision of nutrients, beginning in early stages of life, is crucial to ensure good physical and mental development and long-term health outcomes. While obesity has historically been a condition associated with affluence, there is some evidence to suggest a shift in the burden of overweight and obesity seen across populations. Obesity and overweight have been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.</p>

                        <h3>Social & environmental factors</h3>
                        <p>All stages in a woman's life are connected by the effects of good nutrition. Poor nutrition at any stage has negative consequences that disrupt the cycle and impact later life stages, including future generations.</p>
                        <p>In 2015, Kenya was recognized as being on course to meet the global MDG targets for underfive overweight, under-five stunting, under-five wasting, and infant exclusive breastfeeding, however, was off course to meet the targets for anaemia in women of reproductive age and low birth weight.</p>
                        <p>The Global Nutrition Targets 2015-2025 address nutrition conditions that are responsible for a large burden of nutrition-related morbidity and mortality from conception through to the first two years of life: stunting, maternal anaemia, low birth weight, child underweight and overweight. These are the largest causes of deaths and disability-adjusted life years in children under the age of five years, and iron deficiency contributing to maternal mortality.</p>
                        <p>Sustainable Development Goal 2.2 targets, to end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant, lactating women and older persons. This is shown in Figure 2.</p>

                        <h3>Intergenerational cycle of undernutrition</h3>
                        <p>The cycle of poor nutrition perpetuates itself across generations. Young girls who grow poorly become stunted women and are more likely to give birth to low-birthweight children. If those infants are girls, they are likely to continue the cycle by being stunted in adulthood if something is not done to break the cycle. Adolescent pregnancy heightens the risk of low birthweight and the difficulty of breaking the cycle. Support is needed for good nutrition at all these stages; infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood especially for girls and women.</p>

                        <h3>Intergenerational Cycle of Growth Failure</h3>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_11_24_1f5d3abc0b734f89226ag-026-1.jpg" alt="Figure 3: The intergenerational cycle of growth failure" class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 3: The intergenerational cycle of growth failure</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>The intergenerational cycle of growth failure can be turned into a vicious cycle. However, Low birth weight can be prevented, even amongst undernourished women by improving their diet in quantity and quality. Nutrition in the early months of pregnancy has the greatest benefit on birth outcomes. The effects are greater if the mother is reached before the first semester of pregnancy or early into the pregnancy. Tackling anemia during adolescence and preventing or delaying teenage pregnancy may help to break the intergenerational cycle.</p>
                        <p>Increasing birth weight contributes to reduction in child growth faltering in the first 2 years of life, resulting in less stunting at two years of age. This is eventually reflected in increased adult height, improved cognitive function and intellectual development across the life-course, all associated with an increase in birth weight and a reduction in stunting.</p>
                        <p>There is often little emphasis on maternal nutrition because the priority focus has been placed on interventions that produce short-term gains in child survival. An understanding of the importance of growth and development outcomes is critical and a focus on birth weight should be strengthened. Furthermore, the importance of maternal nutrition for mothers' own health and development must be emphasized.</p>

                        <p>Both low body mass index (BMI) and short stature are highly prevalent among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. This leads to poor fetal development, increased risk of complications in pregnancy, and the need for assisted delivery.</p>
                        <p>In some countries in South-Central Asia, more than 10% of women aged 15-49 years are shorter than 145 cm. In Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Central and South-Eastern Asia, more than 20% of women have a BMI less than 18.5 kg/m². Recent trends show an increased proportion of women starting pregnancy with a BMI >30 kg/m², leading to increased risk of complications in pregnancy and delivery as well as heavier birth weight and increased risk of obesity in children. 34.3% of females in Kenya are overweight with a BMI of above 25 kg/M² while 11.1% are obese with a BMI of above 30 kg/M².</p>
                        <p>Globally, iron-deficiency anemia affects 30% women of reproductive age (468 million), and 42% of pregnant women (56 million). Maternal anemia is associated with reduced birth weight and increased risk of maternal mortality. In Kenya, the prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age is 27.2% out of which, 38.2% are pregnant.</p>
                        <p>Every year an estimated 13 million children are born of pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. Another 20 million children are born with low birth weight. In Kenya, 8% of newborns are low birthweight with regional disparities ranging from 13% in the coastal region to 4% in Nyanza. Low birth weight babies have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality and are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, later in life.</p>

                        <p>Pre-pregnancy nutrition is as important as nutrition during pregnancy. It influences a woman's ability to conceive and determines the fetal growth and development. Deficiencies of nutrients such as calcium, iron, Vitamin D and folic acid, as well as the use of certain drugs and alcohol have detrimental effects in embryonic growth even before a woman realizes she is pregnant.</p>
                        <p>Pre-pregnancy BMI influences gestational weight gain, pregnancy outcomes and risk for noncommunicable disease in mother and baby. It is recommended that more emphasis be placed on preconception and early pregnancy nutrition due to the following reasons:</p>

                            <li>In Kenya, 17-18% of all births are to women under the age of 20 years. This is a time of rapid physical growth with increased nutritional requirements. The additional energy and nutrient demands of pregnancy places the adolescents at increased nutritional risk.</li>
                            <li>Approximately 70% of cases of neural tube defects may be prevented by adequate intakes of folic acid from the pre-conception period and throughout the early months of pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Women of reproductive age planning to conceive are adviced to consume a healthy diet check their health and nutritional status and correct any anomalies. It is recommended that they consume folic acid three months prior to the planned conception.</li>

                    <h2>Nutritional Interventions in Pregnancy</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pregnancy is an opportune moment for reaching women (who may otherwise be neglected) with nutritional support. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recommends integrating maternal nutrition into the continuum of care offered to women. Pregnancy is a critical period in the life cycle due to the many body changes in both the mother and the fetus. Optimal maternal nutrition is critical for optimal fetal growth and development, as well as for safe delivery.</p>
                        <p>Poor nutritional status during pregnancy has been associated with Intra-uterine growth restriction/ retardation (IUGR), Low Birth Weight (LBW), premature delivery (PTB), birth defects and stillbirths (SB). This is made worse by dietary practices that increase nutritional risk at the time of pregnancy e.g. change from the traditional diet (high fiber, low fat) to highly refined foods, adherence to a vegetarian diet and rigid dieting / eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy demands additional nutrients due to the physiological changes that occur. Weight gain is one of the obvious changes that occur during pregnancy. Adequate weight gain is essential for fetal growth and desired weight gain is based upon pre-pregnancy weight using BMI criteria and pre-conceptual nutritional status of the woman. Maternal weight should be routinely monitored throughout pregnancy and the baseline measurement should be taken if possible.</p>

                        <p>During pregnancy, the needs for energy and protein are increased in order to meet the demands for adequate maternal gestational weight gain, as well as the growth and development of the fetus. Extra energy is needed to sustain the increased basal metabolic rate and there is normal accumulation of fat as the energy reserves. Maternal stores of nitrogen are increased in pregnancy, hence increased need for protein, especially those with low BMI &lt;18.5.</p>
                        <p>An increase of protein from 0.8g/kg BW per day to 1.1g/kg BW per day is required to facilitate the physiological changes of pregnancy, including: Tissue growth, nitrogen balance, fetal growth and development, enlargement of mammary glands, uterus and placenta, increased circulating blood volume and plasma proteins, formation of amniotic fluid, reserves for labor, delivery and lactation. There is evidence that providing adequate energy and protein during pregnancy improves fetal growth and may reduce the risk of stillbirth, low birthweight and infants born small for gestational age even among under nourished women. A proper dietary balance is necessary to ensure sufficient intake for adequate growth without drawing from the mother's own tissues to maintain her pregnancy. It is recommended that the woman consume one small extra meal equivalent to 300 Kcal. Further, meals should be drawn from at least five of the ten food groups daily.</p>

                        <h3>Micronutrient Requirements for Pregnant and Lactating Mothers</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>During pregnancy, there is an increased need for micronutrient requirements. All major and trace minerals and vitamins have a role in maternal health.</li>
                            <li>The pregnant and lactating mothers need extra folic acid and vitamin B 12 due to the great increase in blood volume /cells and the rapid growth of the fetus.</li>
                            <li>Iron demands increase as the body conserves more than usual during pregnancy and the growing fetus draws on maternal iron stores.</li>
                            <li>Minerals involved in building the skeleton- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are also in great demand. A non-pregnant adult woman would require 800 mg calcium, 280 mg magnesium and 800 mg of phosphorus. In pregnancy, these requirements are increased.</li>
                            <li>Micronutrients are required by the body for multiple physiological functions, including: production of enzymes & hormones; formation of brain cells; regulation of physical growth & development; regulation of the immune system and reproductive system; and for optimal functioning of the muscular and the nervous system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following micronutrients play a critical role in pregnancy.</p>

                        <h4>Iron</h4>
                        <p>Pregnant women require additional iron for their own nutritional needs and for the developing foetus. Daily oral elemental iron is recommended for pregnant women to prevent maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birthweight and preterm birth. It is essential for many enzymes that are required for metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. It plays a vital role in the body's immune system as well as in the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters. Women of reproductive age and infants have the highest need for iron.</p>
                        <p>Extra iron is needed for hemoglobin synthesis during pregnancy; the recommended daily dose in pregnancy is 60 mg/day. Inadequate iron intake, resulting in iron deficiency, is the commonest cause of anemia.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Consequences of Iron Deficiency Anemia</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Anemic women are more likely to die from Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) and in the postpartum period</li>
                            <li>Severe anemia can precipitate heart failure or circulatory shock at the time of labor, delivery and post-partum</li>
                            <li>Anemic women are also more susceptible to puerperal infection</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Risk factors for iron deficiency anemia include:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Inadequate consumption, or low intake of heme iron</li>
                            <li>High consumption of staple foods with low bio available iron</li>
                            <li>Inadequate intake of foods that enhance iron absorption from diet, such as Vitamin C containing foods</li>
                            <li>Consumption of foods high in phytate or phenolic compounds that inhibit iron absorption (legumes, cereals, coffee, tea, sorghum and millet)</li>
                            <li>Parasitic infestation such as hookworms, ascaris and schistosomiasis</li>
                            <li>Malaria in pregnancy</li>
                            <li>Chronic infections such as TB and HIV</li>
                            <li>Heavy blood loss prior to or during pregnancy</li>
                            <li>High consumption of cow's milk. (it contains high amounts of calcium which inhibit the absorption of iron)</li>
                            <li>Pica can result in helminthic infestation, intestinal obstruction and metal poisoning</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Dietary Management of Iron deficiency</strong></p>
                        <p>Encourage consumption of foods rich in iron, folic acid, proteins and other nutrients needed for blood production.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Animal sources - Red meat, Liver, Kidneys, fish, poultry, eggs</li>
                            <li>Plant source - legumes (cow peas, kidney beans, Soya beans) fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables. Provide foods rich in Vitamin B 12, Folic acid, Vitamin E and C.</li>

                        <p><strong>Prevention of Iron Deficiency</strong></p>
                        <p>The following public health interventions have been shown to increase availability of iron and prevent iron deficiency during pregnancy and in the postpartum period:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Dietary improvement through consumption of iron-rich foods</li>
                            <li>Fortification of foods</li>
                            <li>Supplementation of vulnerable groups</li>
                            <li>Intestinal worm control</li>
                            <li>Malaria and other disease control</li>
                            <li>Strengthening health promotion and prevention in school health programs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Zinc</h4>
                        <p>Zinc is the essential trace mineral occurring in the body in larger amounts than any other trace element because it is present in all tissues. Zinc promotes normal growth and development. It is a major component in body enzymes, hormones, genetic material proteins. It promotes wound healing and maintains an effective immune system.</p>
                        <p>Zinc requirements are highest in the 3rd trimester when the fetus acquires two-thirds of its zinc stores. The RDA for zinc is 15 gm/day for pregnant women, 25% higher than for non-pregnant women. Inadequate zinc in pregnancy increases the risk of delivering low birth weight infants.</p>
                        <p>Diets that are very high in calcium, fiber or phytates may decrease zinc absorption. Routine iron and folate supplementation may also impair zinc absorption. Therefore, good dietary sources of zinc as well as dietary habits should be reinforced.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Food sources:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Organs (offal, liver, kidneys), red meat (beef, lamb) white meat (fish and chicken)</li>
                            <li>Eggs and dairy products</li>
                            <li>Nuts and seeds e.g., pumpkin seeds, water melon seeds, simsim seeds</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Zinc deficiency increases the risk of the following conditions /complications:</strong></p>

                        <h4>Iodine</h4>
                        <p>Iodine is essential for the normal functioning of the thyroid gland and for normal mental and physical development. Pregnant women and young children have special needs for iodine. Iodine deficiency is the main cause of preventable mental retardation globally. Iodine deficiency also causes cretinism, congenital anomalies, stillbirths and abortions.</p>
                        <p>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for a pregnant woman is 175 mg/day and this covers for the extra demands of the fetus. Use of iodized salt is highly recommended.</p>

                        <h4>Vitamin A</h4>
                        <p>Vitamin A is an essential nutrient, which is required in small amounts for epithelial cell integrity, effective immune system function and normal sight. Improving Vitamin A status among pregnant women dramatically reduces maternal mortality, fetal growth retardation and is necessary for embryo development and spermatogenesis.</p>

                        <h4>Calcium</h4>
                        <p>Calcium is needed during pregnancy to promote adequate mineralization of the maternal skeleton & teeth, for normal blood clotting mechanism, normal muscle action and rapid fetal mineralization of skeletal tissue especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. The RDA for pregnant women is 1200 mg/day. During pregnancy, approximately 25-30 g of calcium is transferred to the fetus. Most of this is acquired during the third trimester, when calcium is deposited into the fetal skeleton at a rate of about 330 mg per day. To meet the recommended calcium requirements in pregnancy, women should be advised to consume small amounts of milk with snacks and drink fermented milk.</p>
                        <p>Dietary sources of calcium include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Milk, yogurt and cheese</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Folic Acid</h4>
                        <p>The body needs folic acid for the production, repair, and functioning of DNA. Folic acid is particularly important for the rapid cell growth that occurs during pregnancy. Its deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects. Birth defects are congenital malformation and are structural or functional abnormalities present from birth, they can be caused by a number of factors including micronutrient deficiencies. Spina Bifida is the most common neural birth defect and can be prevented by daily pre conception supplementation with $400 \mu g$ of folic acid or a combination with other micronutrients. These birth defects occur early in gestation, before pregnancy is apparent.</p>

                        <h3>Nutritional care during Labour and delivery</h3>
                        <p>Labor and delivery is a period of high-energy expenditure. At this time, the woman needs energy which should be provided in the form of light foods and drinks that are high in energy such as yoghurt, milk, fruits, soup and fruit juice. Higher intake of fluids helps prevent dehydration and is associated with shorter duration of labor and reduced need for augmentation of labor with oxytocin.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span> NB</h4>
                            <p>Encourage mothers to feed and take plenty of fluids during labour especially first stage of labour</p>

                        <h3>Nutritional Care following delivery by Caesarean Section</h3>
                        <p>A balanced diet supplies you with all the macro and micronutrients that are required for you and your growing baby. Here are some of the nutrients that you need on your road to recovery after delivery both normal and C -section.</p>

                        <h4>Foods to avoid after C-Section</h4>
                        <p>Avoid highly processed, refined, high-fat foods, especially because your physical activity is low after C -section due to increased weight. Avoid spicy foods as they can lead to gastric problems. Maintain variety in your diet and consume everything in moderation.</p>
                        <p>Here are a few more foods that are best avoided:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Carbonated drinks, as they cause bloating and flatulence.</li>
                            <li>Citric juices should be taken with caution. You may take them in small amounts and then increase to moderate quantities.</li>
                            <li>Caffeinated drinks like coffee and tea have diuretic properties hence moderate intake.</li>
                            <li>Avoid alcohol intake.</li>
                            <li>In cases of bloating and gas, then you may stop eating gas-forming foods such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, lady's finger and onions, for a few days. You may also eat white lentils, red kidney beans, chickpeas, black-eyed beans, and green peas in small quantities and one variety at a time.</li>
                            <li>Avoid spicy foods, especially the ones not prepared at home.</li>
                            <li>Avoid cold foods and drinks. They may make you catch a cold.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Follow these basic tips to ensure you get the best out of what you eat:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have small meals throughout the day instead of consuming three heavy meals.</li>
                            <li>Avoid gulping down your food. Instead, take some time to chew it slowly. It may be difficult for you to have a relaxing meal while having a newborn around, but you can ask your family members to look after your baby for some time.</li>
                            <li>With a newborn, you may not get enough sleep. So, try to rest whenever possible. Sleep will help your body repair and heal better.</li>
                            <li>Try to eat home-cooked meals as you can include lots of fresh ingredients.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>This is a crucial stage for both the mother and the baby. Adequate nutrition for the mother should be maintained to ensure that the mother remains healthy and to enhance lactation performance. Lactation is a physiological condition that places extra demand on the mother hence the need for nutrition support and care. In addition, breastfeeding is a learned behavior that needs a supportive environment at the facility, home and at the community level.</p>

                        <h3>Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h3>
                        <p>Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are extremely common, affecting up to 80% of pregnant women.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affect the health of the pregnant woman and her baby, and it can reduce quality of life and significantly contribute to healthcare costs and time lost from work.</li>
                            <li>Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is severe, intractable nausea and vomiting affecting 0.3-3.6% of pregnancies. Recurrence rate of HG ranges from <strong>15.2 % to 81%</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The onset of symptoms is usually early in the first trimester at around 4-6 weeks gestation and peaks at 9 weeks gestation. Vomiting abates in 90% of cases by 20 weeks. It may persist beyond 20 weeks in 13% of cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>HG is typically characterized by: severe nausea and vomiting that causes dehydration and imbalance of fluid and electrolyte; disruption of nutritional intake and metabolism; physical and psychological debilitation; loss of $\geq 5\%$ pre-pregnancy weight; and often necessitates hospital admission. Poorly managed patients may incur severe maternal and fetal morbidity and are at increased risk of death.</p>

                        <h4>Recommendations on management of Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Treatment in the early stages of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may help prevent hospitalization and other serious complications, because it can become more difficult to control symptoms if left untreated.</li>
                            <li>Lifestyle and dietary changes may resolve mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases.</li>
                            <li>The woman's perception of symptom severity greatly affects the decision of whether, when, and how to seek treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>Clinicians should distinguish nausea and vomiting of pregnancy from nausea and vomiting due to other causes.</li>
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy nearly always begins before 9 weeks of gestation; symptoms presenting later in pregnancy should prompt the clinician to consider other causes.</li>
                            <li>Use of prenatal vitamins for 3 months before conception may decrease the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (level A recommendation).</li>
                            <li>First-line pharmacotherapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is vitamin B6 or vitamin B6 plus doxylamine, which are safe and effective (level A).</li>
                            <li>Women with HG and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should not be treated for hyperthyroidism without evidence of intrinsic thyroid disease, such as goiter and/or thyroid autoantibodies (level A).</li>
                            <li>A non-pharmacologic option to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is ginger, which has been shown to reduce nausea (level B).</li>
                            <li>To prevent progression to HG, ACOG recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (level B).</li>
                            <li>In refractory cases, methylprednisolone may be effective for severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or HG, but it should be a last resort because of its risk profile (level B).</li>
                            <li>Women who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or who have clinical signs of dehydration should receive intravenous hydration including dextrose and vitamins. Thiamine should be given before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy (level C).</li>
                            <li>Women with HG who are unresponsive to medical therapy and who cannot maintain their weight should receive nutritional support by nasogastric or naso-duodenal enteral tube feeding as first-line treatment (C).</li>

                        <p><strong>Antiemetic Therapy</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The use of antiemetic therapy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting inpregnancy is recommended.</li>
                            <li>Patients with severe hyperemesis may require regular parenteral doses ofmore than one antiemetic to control symptoms</li>
                            <li>Ondansetron 4 mg, 8 hourly orally, intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV)can be used if hyperemesis is not responding to above antiemetics.</li>
                            <li>Side effects of antiemetics include drowsiness, particularly with phenothiazineand extra pyramidal effects and oculogyric crisis, particularly withmetoclopramide and phenothiazines.</li>
                            <li>Metoclopramide is not suitable for younger patients (younger than 20 yearsof age) as acute dystonic reactions involving facial and skeletal muscle spasmsand oculogyric crisis are common in younger people. Metoclopramide shouldbe given for a maximum 5 days.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Corticosteroid Treatment</strong></p>

                            <li>Steroids should be used for intractable hyperemesis which is not respondingto above management, after discussion with a consultant.</li>
                            <li>Steroid should be accompanied by histamine receptor antagonist or protonpump inhibitor to counteract gastric effect of steroid.</li>
                            <li>Hydrocortisone 100 mg , twice daily (BD) for 48 hours until the patient isable to tolerate tablets. It is followed by prednisolone 30-40 mg daily in asingle or divided dose. The response is usually rapid. Steroids should bediscontinued if there is no effect after 2 days.</li>

                        <h4>Nutritional needs in patients with Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h4>
                        <p><strong>Nutrition Advice</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Nil by mouth or suck ice cubes for the first 24 hours until anti-emetics are effective.</li>
                            <li>Afterwards, small and frequent dry meals are usually tolerable.</li>
                            <li>Drinking a small amount of fluid regularly is important to maintain hydration.</li>
                            <li>Eating before getting out of bed and at times when nausea is less severe may reduce severity of nausea and vomiting.</li>
                            <li>Try sipping on herbal teas containing ginger, lemon or peppermint.</li>
                            <li>Ginger 1gm per day as treatment is an effective means of reducing symptoms</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Thromboprophylaxis</strong></p>
                        <p>Hyperemesis is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to dehydration and immobilization if patients are needed to be hospitalized.</p>

                        <h4>Management Options for Extremely Severe Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h4>
                        <p>Cases that fail to respond to all of the above therapies:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Enteral nutrition</li>
                            <li>Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)</li>
                            <li>Termination of pregnancy</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>Enteral Nutrition</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The cost of enteral nutrition is considerably less than that of TPN and it is safer</li>
                            <li>It is successful in patients with meal related nausea and vomiting only.</li>
                            <li>But enteral hyperalimentation may be poorly tolerated due to nausea and vomiting and may be even contraindicated because of the risk of aspiration.</li>
                            <li>To minimize the risk of aspiration, a nasojejunal feeding tube may be placed beyond the pylorus, but this necessitates radiation exposure for correct position of tube or insertion under endoscopic guidance. Patients should be allowed to make an informed decision given the risks, benefits and alternatives of any invasive procedure aimed at improving nutrition.</li>
                            <li>Discussion with the gastroenterology and / or nutrition team is recommended.</li>
                            <li>Enteral nutrition is the management for hyperemesis in the first trimester and early second trimester.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It is very rarely necessary.</li>
                            <li>Because of substantial metabolic, infectious and thrombotic risks, it should be regarded as a measure of last resort.</li>
                            <li>Discussion with a tertiary nutrition centre should be considered Because TPN involves the use of high concentration of glucose, thiamine supplementation is mandatory.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Recurrence Risk of Hyperemesis Gravidarum</strong></p>
                        <p>The risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancy is 15.2% to 81%. The risk is reduced by a change of paternity</p>

                        <p>In a HIV positive pregnant mother, it is important to control symptoms, support the immune system and lower the viral loads in the blood.</p>
                        <p>Good nutrition supports the immune system thus preventing opportunistic infections. The role nutrition plays will vary along the disease continuum, with consideration given to the patient's age, behavior, current medication, drug history, socioeconomic status, and associated health concerns.</p>

                        <h4>Nutrient Requirements for People Living with HIV (PLHIV)</h4>
                        <p>There is increased nutrient needs due to:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Increased resting energy equilibrium.</li>

                            <li>Opportunistic Infections that increase energy demand</li>
                            <li>Malabsorption of nutrients</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The recommended amount of energy increments in HIV positive pregnant/lactating women is 10% for the asymptomatic mother and 20-30% for the symptomatic mothers. This is in addition to extra energy, proteins and micronutrients required by pregnant or lactating mothers. In case of fever and multiple infections, consider addition of 10% on the calorie requirement. The protein and fat needs for the HIV infected pregnant mother are the same as those recommended for a healthy non-HIV infected mother.</p>

                            <li>Advise the client to have periodic nutritional status assessments, especially of their weight, every 2nd month for symptomatic clients and every 4th month for asymptomatic clients</li>
                            <li>Educate and counsel PLWHA of the increased energy needs for their disease stage, and the need to consume a balanced diet. Clients with severe malnutrition should be supported with therapeutic supplementary foods.</li>
                            <li>Educate and support clients to maintain high levels of sanitation, food hygiene, and water safety at all times.</li>
                            <li>Educate and support clients to carry out physical activity or exercise in order to build muscles and increase appetite and improve health.</li>
                            <li>Drink plenty of clean safe water (filtered and boiled or treated) and use clean safe water to swallow medicines and prepare juice.</li>
                            <li>Counsel PLWHA to seek prompt treatment for all opportunistic infections and symptoms, and especially those that may interfere with food intake.</li>
                            <li>Those on medicine, including ARVs, should be informed about managing the drug food interactions and side-effects that can be managed by food and nutrition interventions.</li>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Pregnant women who are obese are at greater risk of a variety of pregnancy related complications compared with women of normal BMI, including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and longterm risk of non-communicable diseases for mother and baby. Pregnant women who are obese are also at increased risk of caesarean birth. Maternal size can make the assessment of fetal size, presentation and external monitoring of fetal heart tracing more challenging during pregnancy. Initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding may be challenging in the women with obesity especially positioning and attachment of the baby at the breast.</p>

                        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
                        <p>Overweight and obesity are associated with increased rates of chronic disease and death globally. In Kenya, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among women is high and increasing (CDC, 2018) Overall, approximately one in 3 (32.8%) women in Kenya are either overweight or obese.</p>
                        <p>According to world health organization, adults can be classified according to BMI as shown in the table below.</p>

                        <p>Class III obesity is associated with increased rates of uterine rupture during trial of labour and neonatal injury. Emergency caesarean section in women with obesity is highly associated with an increased risk of serious maternal morbidity because anesthetic and operative difficulties are more prevalent in these women than in women with a healthy BMI. This should also be taken into account when discussing the risks and benefits of mode of delivery.</p>
                        <p>Establishing venous access in women with class III obesity is more like to be difficult than in women with class I and II obesity.it is important that this is not attempted for the first time in an emergency situation when urgent venous access is required for intravenous medication or for resuscitation</p>
                        <p>Women with obesity are at increased risk of PPH. There is strong evidence from the general maternity population that active management of the third stage of labour reduces the risk of PPH, anaemia and the need for blood transfusion.</p>
                        <p>Women with class III obesity who are in established labour should receive continuous midwifery care, with consideration of additional measures to monitor the fetal condition</p>
                        <p>Women with class I obesity or greater having a caesarean section are at increased risk of wound infection and should receive prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery</p>
                        <p>Women undergoing caesarean section who have more than 2 cm subcutaneous fat should have suturing of the subcutaneous tissue space in order to reduce the risk of wound infection and wound separation.</p>

                        <h3>Postnatal care and follow-up after pregnancy in obese women</h3>
                        <p>Obesity is associated with low breastfeeding initiation and maintenance rates. Women with a booking BMI 30 kg/m2 or greater should receive appropriate specialist advice and support antenatally and postnatally regarding the benefits, initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding.</p>
                        <p>Maternal obesity is associated with a physiological delay in lactogenesis, lower rates of breastfeeding initiation, earlier cessation of breastfeeding and earlier introduction of solids. This is likely to be multifactorial in origin and may be due to women's perceptions of breastfeeding, difficulty with correct positioning of the baby and the possibility of an impaired prolactin response to suckling.</p>
