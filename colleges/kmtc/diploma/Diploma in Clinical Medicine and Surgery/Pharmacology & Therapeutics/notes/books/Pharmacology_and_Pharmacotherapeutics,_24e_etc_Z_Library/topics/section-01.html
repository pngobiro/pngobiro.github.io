                            <p>Illness has been man's heritage from the beginning of his existence, and the search for remedies to combat it is perhaps equally old. The world's oldest known therapeutic writings come from India and China. The earliest Indian records are the Vedas. Although there are medical descriptions in Rigveda (3000 B.C.), Ayurveda, the science of life advocates various medicinal preparations of herbal and mineral origin. These are presented in ancient treatise Charaka samhita, Sushruta samhita and Vagbhata.</p>
                            
                            <p>Modern medicine is considered to date from Hippocrates, a Greek physician (450 B.C.), who for the first time introduced the concept of disease as a pathologic process and tried to organise the science of medicine on the basis of observation, analysis and deduction.</p>

                            <p>The word <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="The science that deals with drugs. Derived from Pharmacon (an active principle) and logos (a discourse).">Pharmacology</dfn> is derived from two Greek words Pharmacon (an active principle) and logos (a discourse or treatise). It is the science that deals with drugs. Development of modern pharmacology as a science is fairly recent and probably started taking shape following the introduction of experimental procedures in animals by Francois Magendie (1783-1855) and Claude Bernard (1813-1878).</p>

                            <p>Pharmacology consists of detailed study of drugs, particularly their actions on living animals, organs and tissues. The actions may be beneficial or harmful. The object of pharmacology is mainly to provide such scientific data, using which one can choose a drug treatment of proven efficacy and safety from the various options available, to suit the patient.</p>

                            <p>The word <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="Any substance used for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, relief or cure of a disease in man or animals.">drug</dfn> is derived from the French word 'drogue', a dry herb. A drug is defined as any substance used for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, relief or cure of a disease in man or animals. According to WHO, "A drug is any substance or product that is used or intended to be used to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the benefit of the recipient."</p>

                            <h3>The Nature and Sources of Drugs</h3>
                            <p>The various sources of drugs are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I Mineral:</strong> e.g. Liquid paraffin, Magnesium sulfate, Kaolin and Aluminium trisilicate.</li>
                                <li><strong>II Animal:</strong> e.g. Insulin, Heparin, Gonadotropins, and Antitoxic sera.</li>
                                <li><strong>III Plant:</strong> e.g. Morphine, Digoxin, Quinine, Atropine and Reserpine. Plants contain mixtures of several chemical constituents (Table 1.1), which vary from plant to plant.</li>
                                <li><strong>IV Micro-organisms:</strong> Bacteria and Fungi, isolated from soil, are important sources of antibacterial substances, e.g., Penicillin.</li>
                                <li><strong>V Synthetic:</strong> e.g. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Hypnotics, Anticancer drugs and ACE inhibitors. Majority of the drugs currently used in therapeutics are synthetic.</li>
                                <li><strong>VI Genetic engineering (DNA recombinant technology):</strong> e.g. Insulin and Hepatitis B Vaccine.</li>
                                <li><strong>VII Biologicals:</strong> In the last decade many biological agents have also become available for therapeutic purposes. This is a heterogeneous group and includes complex protein molecules that interact with cytokines or cell surface markers e.g. growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, cytokines.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Apart from drugs, gene based therapy and stem cell therapy are available today.</p>
                            <p><strong>Gene based therapy:</strong> The developments in biotechnology, including recombinant DNA technology, have made it possible to synthesise short nucleotide sequences (genes). These are responsible for the in-vivo synthesis of proteins critical in certain metabolic pathways. They can be introduced into human beings for therapeutic purposes. The object of gene therapy is to introduce functional genetic material into mammalian cells to replace or supplement the activity of defective genes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Stem cell therapy:</strong> Recently stem cells (either embryonic or adult pleuripotent cells) have been used as a therapeutic approach for regeneration and proliferation of functional cells in the body e.g. in myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis and diabetes mellitus.</p>
                            <p><strong>Nanomedicines:</strong> These are synthesised using nanotechnology. The latter is defined as the intentional design, characterisation, production and applications of materials, structures, devices and systems by controlling their size and shape in the nanoscale range (1 to 100 nm). Nanomedicines are close to biological molecules in size and have very high surface/volume ratio.</p>

                            <h3>Routes of Drug Administration and Dosage Forms</h3>
                            <p>Drugs may be applied locally, or may be administered orally and or by injection.</p>

                                    <p>Dusting powder, paste, lotion, drops, ointment or plaster exert action at the site of application (topical action). Drugs may also be administered locally in the following forms: bougie for urethra, pessary for vagina, inhalers for bronchi, and suppository for the vagina and rectum.</p>
                                    <p>Drugs used as aqueous solutions for local effects on mucous membranes are likely to be absorbed and may produce adverse systemic effects. In case of corneal application, the drug may penetrate into the anterior chamber and affect the ciliary muscle e.g. cocaine.</p>
                                    <p>Administration of a medicament in a liquid form into the rectum is called enema. Enemata are of two types:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Evacuant enema:</strong> e.g. soap water enema. The aim is to remove the faecal matter and the flatus. The quantity of fluid administered is about 600 ml.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Retention enema:</strong> The fluid containing the drug is retained in the rectum for local action as with prednisolone enema for ulcerative colitis; or it may act systemically after absorption through the mucous membrane. The quantity of fluid administered is usually 100-120 ml.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>This is the most commonly employed route for drug administration. Its advantages are:</p>

                                        <li>The route cannot be employed in an unconscious or uncooperative patient nor in an emergency; and</li>

                            <p>Absorption is the process by which drugs enter the systemic circulation. Molecules, including drug molecules, cross a biological membrane by:</p>
                            <ul>

                                        <li><strong>Dosage forms:</strong> Particle size, disintegration time, dissolution rate, formulation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Physiological factors:</strong> Ionisation, pH of GI fluid, GI transit time, enterohepatic cycling, absorbing surface area, first pass elimination.</li>

                            <h3>Distribution of a Drug</h3>
                            <p>After absorption, a drug enters or passes through the several body fluid compartments. The <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="The volume into which the total amount of a drug in the body appears to be uniformly distributed.">apparent volume of distribution</dfn> ($V_d$) is calculated as:</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ V_{d}(L)=\frac{\text { Total amount administered }}{\text { Plasma concentration }} $$
                            </div>

                            <p><strong>Plasma concentration of a drug</strong> depends upon the drug's rate of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.</p>

                            <p><strong>Protein Binding:</strong> After absorption, the drug circulates in the blood either in the free form or bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding affects bioavailability, duration of action, and elimination.</p>

                            <p><strong>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB):</strong> The endothelial cells of the brain capillaries do not permit bulk passage of water and solutes (tight junctions). Only lipid soluble drugs or those with specific transporters can cross. P-glycoproteins act as efflux pumps to extrude drugs from the brain.</p>

                            <h3>Fate of a Drug (Metabolism)</h3>
                            <p>The changes that a drug undergoes in the body and its ultimate elimination are considered as the fate of the drug. Biotransformation usually inactivates an active drug, activates an inactive drug (prodrug), or generates active metabolites.</p>
                            <p><strong>Phase I reactions (Non-synthetic):</strong> Oxidation, Reduction, Hydrolysis. These introduce polar groups into drugs making them water soluble. Important enzymes include the Cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily.</p>
                            <p><strong>Phase II reactions (Synthetic):</strong> Conjugation or transfer reaction. This involves combining the drug/metabolite with an endogenous substance (glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, etc.) to form water-soluble conjugates for excretion.</p>

                            <h3>Drug Excretion</h3>
                            <p>Drugs and metabolites are excreted via:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Kidneys:</strong> Through passive glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion (e.g. by P-glycoprotein, MRP2), and passive tubular reabsorption.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lungs:</strong> Volatile anaesthetics, alcohol.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bile:</strong> Active secretion into bile; may lead to enterohepatic circulation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intestines</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Skin, Saliva, and Milk</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Plasma Half-life and Kinetics</h3>
                            <p>Elimination of most drugs follows <strong>First Order Kinetics</strong> (exponential), where a constant fraction of the drug is eliminated per unit time. The half-life ($t^{1/2}$) is constant.</p>
                            <div class="equation">
                                $$ \mathrm{t}^{1 / 2}=\frac{0.693}{\mathrm{~K}} $$
                            </div>
                            <p>Some drugs follow <strong>Zero Order Kinetics</strong> (saturation kinetics), where a fixed quantity of drug is eliminated per unit time (e.g., phenytoin, alcohol). This leads to disproportionate increase in plasma levels with dose increases.</p>

                            <h3>Site of Drug Action</h3>
                            <p>A drug may act locally (at the point of application) or systemically (after absorption). Methods for localisation include anatomical/physiological ablation, biochemical localisation (enzymes), pharmacological localisation (using blockers), and tracer techniques.</p>

                            <h3>Structure Activity Relationship (SAR)</h3>
                            <p>The activity of a drug is intimately related to its chemical structure. SAR knowledge allows synthesis of new compounds with specific actions, synthesis of competitive antagonists, and understanding mechanisms of action. <strong>Chirality</strong> is important; enantiomers may have different pharmacological actions (e.g., l-atenolol vs d-atenolol).</p>

                            <h3>Mechanism of Drug Action</h3>
                            <p>Drug action (initial interaction) leads to drug effects (physiological consequences). Drugs may act via physical properties (osmosis, adsorption), chemical properties (antacids), or by modulating body function regulators (receptors, enzymes, transport processes, structural proteins).</p>
                            
                            <h3>Drug Receptors</h3>
                            <p>Receptors are specific protein macromolecules. Interaction parameters include <strong>Selectivity</strong> and <strong>Affinity</strong>. <strong>Intrinsic activity (Efficacy)</strong> is the ability to elicit a response.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Agonist:</strong> High affinity, high intrinsic activity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Antagonist:</strong> High affinity, no intrinsic activity (receptor blockade).</li>
                                <li><strong>Partial agonist:</strong> Affinity, but less intrinsic activity than full agonist.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inverse agonist:</strong> Affinity, but produces opposite effect to agonist (negative efficacy).</li>

                            <h3>Dose Response Relationship</h3>
                            <p><strong>Graded dose-response:</strong> Relates size of response in a single biological unit to the dose (Fig 2.3). Indicates efficacy and potency.</p>
                            <p><strong>Quantal dose-response:</strong> Relates frequency of a fixed (all-or-none) response in a population to the dose (Fig 2.5). Used to determine ED<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Therapeutic Index (TI):</strong> Ratio of median lethal dose to median effective dose ($LD_{50}/ED_{50}$). Indicates safety margin.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Additive:</strong> Total effect = sum of individual effects ($1+1=2$).</li>
                                <li><strong>Synergism:</strong> Total effect > sum of individual effects ($1+1>2$).</li>
                                <li><strong>Antagonism:</strong> Opposing actions.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Chemical:</strong> Reaction between agents (e.g. chelators).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Competitive:</strong> Agonist and antagonist compete for same site. Surmountable. Shifts curve right (Fig 2.6a).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Non-competitive:</strong> Antagonist inactivates receptor. Non-surmountable. Depresses max response (Fig 2.6b).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Physiological:</strong> Drugs act on different receptors to produce opposite effects (e.g. Histamine vs Adrenaline).</li>

<h3>Adverse Drugs Reactions (ADR)</h3>
                            <p>The administration of a drug may result in the development of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Side effects</li>
                                <li>Untoward effects</li>
                                <li>Toxic effects; or</li>
                                <li>Allergic and idiosyncratic effects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p><strong>Side effects:</strong> Side effects are in fact pharmacological effects produced with therapeutic dose of the drug, e.g., dryness of mouth with atropine. These effects are neither harmful nor damaging and recovery is quick on stopping the drug or reducing the dose. Side effects which might be troublesome in a particular situation may be useful under other circumstances.</p>

                            <p><strong>Untoward effects:</strong> Untoward effects also develop with therapeutic dose of a drug, but are undesirable and, if severe, may necessitate the cessation of treatment, e.g. resistant staphylococcal diarrhoea following tetracycline therapy and potassium loss due to diuretic drugs.</p>

                            <p><strong>Toxic effects:</strong> These are seen usually when a drug is administered repeatedly and/or in large doses. Toxic effects always cause tissue damage to induce signs and symptoms (toxidromes). The recovery takes longer time and may be partial or impossible. Drug toxicity is usually the primary attribute of a drug and is dose dependent.</p>

                            <p>According to WHO, <dfn class="term-definition" data-definition="Any response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease.">adverse drug reaction (ADR)</dfn> is defined as "any response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease or for modification of physiological function". It excludes adverse reactions due to drug overdose (poisoning), drug abuse and therapeutic errors.</p>

                            <p><strong>Idiosyncrasy</strong> is a Type B ADR wherein the abnormal response to a drug is either due to a genetic or unknown mechanism. Thus, sometimes genetically determined absence or reduced activity of certain enzyme(s) in an individual is responsible for the ADR. In many cases, however, the cause of the idiosyncrasy is unknown.</p>

                            <h3>Drug Allergy</h3>
                            <p>'Hypersensitivity' or 'allergic' reactions can occur, when an individual sensitised to an antigen (e.g. drug), again comes in contact with the same antigen. The resulting tissue-damaging reactions are:</p>

                                    <p>IgE mediated (a) Allergic reaction and (b) Anaphylaxis. The antigen reacts with reaginic antibodies (IgE), bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils, causing degranulation with massive liberation of histamine and other mediators.

                            <h3>Drug Prescribing</h3>
                            <p>A practitioner who prescribes drugs must know: Natural course of the disease he is treating, pharmacological actions and toxicity of a drug he uses, reasons for choosing a particular drug, methods of assessing drug efficacy and safety, and the possible interactions when several drugs are administered concurrently.</p>

                                    <p><strong>"Prescribe right drug to right patient in right dose by right route at right time intervals."</strong></p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Write the prescription on your letterhead.</li>
                                        <li>Write legibly and indelibly.</li>
                                        <li>Write the patient's name, age and address. Do not abbreviate names of drugs/preparations(s) or instructions about taking the medicines. Write 'Units' not 'u'. Write mcg not µg. When decimals are unavoidable, write, say, 50mcg, not 0.05mg.</li>
                                        <li>Write clearly dose (so many tablets/capsules/puffs), dosing interval (so many hours), time of the day, relation to meals, and duration of the therapy.</li>
                                        <li>When prescribing a drug 'as required', write the minimum dosing interval and the maximum number of doses per day.</li>
                                        <li>In case of scheduled drugs, write the quantity of drug to be supplied at a time and how many times the prescribed drugs may be supplied without revalidation.</li>
                                        <li>Sign the prescription.</li>
                                        <li>Write date and your registration number.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid painful IM injections in children whenever possible. Liquid preparations are more suitable for children and old persons.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p><strong>P-drug (Personal drug) Concept:</strong> P-drugs are the drugs one chooses for prescribing regularly and with which one becomes familiar. Such a list would spare the physician repeated search for a better drug from among the many available. Steps for selecting P-drugs:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Define the diagnosis (Pathophysiology).</li>
                                <li>Specify the therapeutic objective(s).</li>
                                <li>Make an inventory of the effective drug groups.</li>
                                <li>Choose a group and select the individual drug from the group according to efficacy, safety, suitability and cost.</li>
                                <li>Prescribe treatment for a standard duration.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Essential Drugs:</strong> As per WHO definition: "Essential drugs are those drugs that satisfy the health care needs of the majority of the population. They should, therefore, be available at all times in adequate amounts and in appropriate dosage forms, at a price the individual and the community can afford."</p>

                            <p><strong>Orphan Drugs:</strong> Orphan drugs are drugs meant for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of rare diseases. They are not easily available because their manufacture is not commercially-viable.</p>

                            <h3>Factors Modifying the Effects of a Drug</h3>
                            <p>Individuals differ both in the degree and the character of the response that a drug may elicit. The important factors which influence the effect of a drug are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I Body weight:</strong> The average dose is mentioned either in terms of mg. per kg. body weight or as the total single dose for an adult weighing 50-100 kg.</li>
                                <li><strong>II Age and sex:</strong> Children may not react to all drugs in the same manner as young adults. The pharmacokinetics changes with age.
