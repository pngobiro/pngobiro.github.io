                            <p>Anatomically, the nervous system in higher animals can be divided into:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The central nervous system (CNS); and</li>
                                <li>The peripheral nervous system consisting of somatic and autonomic nerve fibres.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The CNS is not only concerned with the regulation of specialised functions like circulation, digestion and respiration but it also is responsible for the psychic processes such as feeling, attitude, thoughts and memory. The ability to think logically, to learn from past experiences and to communicate appropriately are the unique qualities of man and can be attributed to the development of the highly specialised CNS.</p>

                            <p>Both the CNS and peripheral nervous system are analogous to an elaborate system of telegraphy wherein numerous wires and connections in the form of neurons and synapses bring in information from both internal and external sources. This information is received, 'decoded', decisions are made by various centres in CNS and instructions are sent out to various peripheral tissues to produce appropriate responses such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Psychic, as manifested by change in emotions, thought and attitude.</li>
                                <li>Somatic, as demonstrated by various types of body movements; and</li>
                                <li>Autonomic, as indicated by changes in respiration, circulation and visceral functions.</li>

                            <p><strong>Drugs act on the CNS:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Directly on neurons and modify the neuronal functions.</li>
                                <li>Reflexly by sending afferent impulses to the CNS via the chemoreceptors, baroreceptors and peripheral nerves, thereby eliciting psychic, somatic or visceral responses; and</li>
                                <li>By affecting the nutrition and oxygen supply of the CNS by altering its blood supply or affecting its metabolism e.g. by causing hypoglycemia or ammonia intoxication.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>To reach the CNS, a drug must have a high lipid solubility (high oil/water partition coefficient) or a specialised transport mechanism. Ionized drugs normally cannot cross BBB.</p>

                            <p><strong>Neurochemical transmission in the nervous system:</strong> Because communication within the nervous system is almost exclusively through chemical messengers, neurosecretion is a fundamental property of all neurons. A neurosecretion is a chemical released at the nerve terminals; those released into the blood circulation are called neurohormones e.g. hypothalamic hormones released into the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pharmacological actions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Topical:</strong> Applied to the skin, it evaporates quickly. It has a cooling and refreshing effect, and is used for reducing the temperature in fevers. Higher concentrations denature proteins. Alcohol in the concentration of 70% by weight acts as an antiseptic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Gastrointestinal tract:</strong> Taken orally, it gives a local feeling of warmth and increases the salivary secretion. 50 ml of 7-10% alcohol increases the gastric secretion. Higher concentrations inhibit both gastric motility and secretion, and have a direct toxic effect on gastric mucosa.</li>
                                <li><strong>Central nervous system:</strong> Ethanol is primarily a CNS depressant and acts by enhancing the inhibitory $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor activity and inhibiting the excitatory NMDA receptors. The initial CNS effect is due to depression of the reticular activating system. The cortex is thus released from the integrating control or inhibitions required for purposeful activity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cardiovascular system:</strong> Alcohol in moderate amounts dilates skin vessels by depressing the vasomotor centre, resulting in flushing and feeling of warmth. Regular consumption of alcohol is often associated with hypertension.</li>
                                <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Ethanol causes dose-related hepatotoxicity. The common effects are fatty infiltration and hepatomegaly.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Important Agents</h3>
                            <p><strong>Halothane:</strong> Non-inflammable, pleasant, potent. Causes bronchodilatation. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Poor analgesic, muscle relaxation inadequate, sensitises heart to catecholamines (arrhythmias), hepatotoxicity (rare).</p>
                            <p><strong>Isoflurane:</strong> Muscle relaxant, bronchodilator, does not sensitise heart to catecholamines. Preferred agent in neurosurgery.</p>
                            <p><strong>Nitrous Oxide:</strong> "Laughing gas". Good analgesic, poor anaesthetic (MAC 105%). Used with O2 and other agents. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Diffusion hypoxia, expansion of closed gas spaces (pneumothorax, etc.).</p>
                            <p><strong>Thiopental:</strong> Ultra short acting barbiturate. Rapid pleasant induction. Action terminated by redistribution to fat. Poor analgesic/muscle relaxant.</p>
                            <p><strong>Propofol:</strong> Rapid induction and recovery ("clear headed"). Anti-emetic. Used for day-care surgery. Pain on injection.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ketamine:</strong> Produces "Dissociative Anaesthesia" (analgesia, amnesia, catatonia). Raises BP and heart rate. Bronchodilator. Causes hallucinations/delirium during recovery.</p>

                            <p><strong>Neuroleptanalgesia:</strong> Combination of a neuroleptic (Droperidol) and an opioid (Fentanyl). Produces a state of apathy and analgesia where patient is conscious but indifferent.</p>

                            <p>Opioids act on specific G-protein coupled receptors: <strong>Mu ($\mu$), Kappa ($\kappa$), and Delta ($\delta$)</strong>. They inhibit adenylate cyclase, facilitate $\mathrm{K}^+$ channel opening (hyperpolarisation), and inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{++}$ channel opening (preventing transmitter release).</p>
