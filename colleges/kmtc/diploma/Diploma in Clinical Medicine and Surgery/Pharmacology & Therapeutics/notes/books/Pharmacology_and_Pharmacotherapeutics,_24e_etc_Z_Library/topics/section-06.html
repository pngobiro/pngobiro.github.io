                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Cough, a protective reflex, helps to expel irritant matter from the respiratory tract. This is necessary for preventing mechanical obstruction to breathing. Stimulation of the mucosal Rapidly Adapting Receptors (RAR) and C fibre receptors ending in the respiratory tract at sites such as pharynx, larynx, trachea or bronchi generate tussal impulses. These are carried by afferent fibres in the vagus and sympathetic nerves to the brain stem nucleus solitarius which is connected to the respiration-related neurons in the central cough generator (cough centre), which initiates the act of coughing. C fibre receptors are chemoreceptors, highly sensitive to bradykinin, capsaicin and H ions (pH).</p>
                            
                            <p>The respiratory mucosa contains cells bearing cilia which transport the locally produced mucus towards the throat, from where it can be either coughed out or swallowed to keep the respiratory tract clean (mucociliary clearance). This mucociliary clearance can be defective or even absent in persons with immotile, dysfunctional or congenitally absent cilia. This leads to retention of secretions in the respiratory tract and recurrent respiratory infections including sinusitis and bronchiectasis. In turn, respiratory infection impairs the mucociliary clearance further, with worsening of the infection. Chronic cough is an important symptom in these patients.</p>

                            <p>The act of coughing involves an initial deep inspiration followed by forced expiration against a temporarily closed glottis. Closure of the glottis causes an increase in intrathoracic pressure. When the glottis opens suddenly, the pulmonary air is forced through the trachea almost at the speed of sound, throwing out the respiratory tract secretions as expectoration. The cough reflex has a tremendous reserve capacity and most coughs are greatly in excess of that required to expel particulate material. Furthermore, the strong expiration leads to a stronger succeeding inspiration and thus produces a vicious cycle in the form of a fit of coughing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Cough may be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Productive, associated with a large amount of sputum; or</li>
                                <li>Non-productive, dry and usually useless.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Environmental pollutants may cause cough by irritating the lungs, trachea or bronchi. Smoking cigarettes is a well known cause of chronic persistent cough. Cough due to the inhalation of allergens such as dust, chemicals and pollen is commonly observed in asthmatics. The commonest cause of transient cough is common cold, and is due to postnasal drip that stimulates receptors in the upper respiratory tract. A similar mechanism probably operates in case of chronic persistent cough observed in persons with allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis and obstruction due to enlarged adenoids. Enlarged, infected tonsils, an abnormally elongated uvula or nasal polyps can also cause chronic persistent cough.</p>

                            <p>Other important causes of cough are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Upper respiratory tract infections, which may be self-limiting or persistent.</li>
                                <li>Acute lung infections and pleural diseases where therapy of the underlying cause will relieve cough.</li>
                                <li>Chronic pulmonary diseases like asthma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and lung cancer where symptomatic treatment for cough is essential along with the specific therapy.</li>
                                <li>Secondary to acute LVF, which calls for immediate attention to the cardiac condition.</li>
                                <li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</li>
                                <li>Drug-induced cough.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Definitive treatment of cough depends upon its cause which should be treated. Stoppage of smoking would correct chronic cough in smokers. Mild acute cough generally does not need drugs. Only when cough serves no useful purpose and causes insomnia, or interferes with daily work, symptomatic treatment is indicated.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Barking cough</strong>, stridor and chest wall withdrawal are characteristic of croup, common in children. Cough becomes worse at night. Nebulised <strong>budesonide</strong> or oral/IM <strong>dexamethasone</strong> (0.2-0.6 mg/kg, single dose) gives dramatic relief. As dexamethasone effect lasts for 2-4 days, second dose is rarely required. Nebulised adrenaline gives immediate but short lived relief.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I. Pharyngeal demulcents and local sialogogues:</strong> e.g., Syrups and Linctuses.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Opioids and related drugs e.g. Codeine, Dextromethorphan, Pholcodeine, Levopropoxyphene, Noscapine.</li>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>IV. Peripherally acting compounds:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Local anaesthetics e.g. Benzonatate, Levodropropizine and Nebulised lignocaine.</li>
                                        <li>Mucolytics that help by liquefying thick secretions e.g. Acetylcysteine.</li>
                                        <li>Anticholinergics e.g. Ipratropium bromide by metered dose inhalation.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Mucoactive drugs</strong> include:
                            (i) <strong>Expectorants:</strong> which induce cough or increase the volume of secretions.
                            (ii) <strong>Mucolytics:</strong> which reduce the viscosity of mucus.
                            (iii) <strong>Mucokinetic drugs:</strong> which increase the mobility and transportability of mucus, and
                            (iv) <strong>Mucoregulators:</strong> which control the process of hypersecretion.</p>

                            <h3>Pharyngeal Demulcents</h3>
                            <p>Demulcents are useful in cough due to irritation of the pharyngeal mucosa above the larynx. They are administered in the form of lozenges, troches, cough drops or linctuses. They act by increasing the flow of saliva, the best natural demulcent which produces a protective and soothing effect. The 'syrup' part of most cough syrups serves the same function. Salivary secretion can be increased by such simple methods as using a few lemon drops, candy sugar, glycerrhiza or drops of lemon juice in a syrupy base.</p>

                            <h3>Expectorants</h3>
                            <p>The Latin word 'expectorare' means 'to drive from the chest'. Expectorants are the drugs which increase the production of demulcent respiratory tract fluid that covers and protects the irritated mucosa. These drugs are useful in the treatment of useless cough due to irritation of the respiratory mucosa below the larynx and respiratory conditions in which the secretion is thick and viscid, needing liquefaction. Expectorants can stimulate the output of respiratory tract fluid either directly or reflexly (reflex expectorants).</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Direct stimulants:</strong> Volatile oils like oil of eucalyptus, anise and lemon, administered orally or inhaled with steam, increase the respiratory secretions probably by a direct action. Alcohol and cedar wood oil (active ingredient terpene hydrochloride), added to steam inhalation, have a similar effect. Large doses of creosote and guaiacol have also been shown to possess this action in animals; and glyceryl guaiacolate forms an important ingredient of many commercial cough mixtures. <strong>Guaifenesin</strong>, in addition, inhibits cough reflex sensitivity in URTI.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Reflex expectorants:</strong> These drugs act by stimulating the gastric reflex which helps to increase the respiratory secretions. Obviously, they produce mild irritation of the gastric mucosa and may produce nausea. Thus, emetic drugs in subemetic doses increase bronchial secretion producing a less tenacious sputum, easier to expectorate. Ipecacuanha containing an alkaloid emetine is sometimes used as an expectorant. Tincture ipecacuanha 1 ml may increase the respiratory tract fluid and lower the viscosity of the sputum. However, it often produces anorexia and nausea.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Saline expectorants:</strong> Ammonium carbonate, once used as a saline expectorant, causes anorexia and nausea. It is no more recommended. <strong>Potassium iodide</strong> used commonly for this purpose, probably acts both directly and reflexly. It increases the respiratory secretion, and has a reputation for liquefying the thick, viscid fluid. It is generally advocated in productive cough associated with chronic bronchitis, asthma and emphysema. It is administered orally in a dose of 300 mg thrice daily in mixture form. The mixture has a slightly bitter saline taste.</p>

                                    <p>Potassium iodide can cause symptoms of iodism, characterised by nasal catarrh, conjunctival swelling, edema of eyelids, lacrimation, edema of the larynx, headache and various types of skin rashes. Chronic administration occasionally gives rise to goitre and may rarely cause hypothyroidism. It should be avoided in children and pregnant women.</p>

                            <p>The active alkaloid, vasicine, and its derivative vasicinone, from the leaves of <em>Adhatoda vasaca</em>, possess weak bronchodilator, expectorant and mucolytic properties. The aqueous extract of leaves of this plant in syrupy base appears to be safe and effective and has been used as a home remedy in India for ages.</p>

                            <h3>Central Cough Suppressants (Antitussives)</h3>
                            <p>These drugs inhibit the cough reflex by directly suppressing the cough centre in the medulla and are useful in the symptomatic relief of dry irritant cough. They are only partially successful in suppressing cough due to carinal irritation. They are invaluable in the treatment of cough due to pleural diseases.</p>

                            <p><strong>Codeine:</strong> This alkaloid of opium resembles morphine in its actions. Like morphine, it depresses the cough centre but is less constipating. Tolerance is not common and drug dependence is rare. A commonly employed preparation is linctus codeine which contains 15 mg of codeine phosphate in 5 ml. Dose: 5 ml by mouth. It is a relatively safe drug and its only bothersome adverse effect is constipation. Codeine preparations are not recommended in children.</p>

                            <p><strong>Pholcodine:</strong> Though related to opioids, has no opioid-like action. It is as effective as codeine as a cough suppressant, with a longer duration of action. It is non-sedating and non-addicting. It is a common constituent of OTC cough mixtures.</p>

                            <p><strong>Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:</strong> It is the d-isomer of codeine analogue methorphan. However, it does not act through the opioid receptors and has no analgesic or sedative property. It acts centrally to elevate the threshold for coughing. It is as effective as codeine and is much safer; hence, it is commonly used in pediatric practice. It does not depress respiration in the usual doses. It can sometimes cause excitement, irritability and confusion. Adult dose: 10-20 mg every 6-8 hours (maximum 120 mg/day). It is a drug of abuse.</p>

                            <p><strong>Noscapine:</strong> This opium alkaloid, belonging to benzylisoquinoline group, is a smooth muscle relaxant like papaverine. Its antitussive action is approximately equal to that of codeine. It does not produce constipation or drowsiness. Addiction does not occur. Sometimes it causes nausea. The antitussive dose is 15-30 mg 3-4 times a day. Large doses can cause bronchospasm and hypotension due to histamine release.</p>

                            <p><strong>Benzonatate:</strong> Chemically related to procaine, probably acts on the stretch and cough receptors in the lungs. It also possesses some central action and can cause sedation and headache. It is not recommended below the age of 10 years. The dose is 100 mg tid.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Lignocaine</strong> in nebulised form is used for suppressing cough during pharyngeal examination, bronchoscopy and persistent cough in bronchial carcinoma.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Chronic cough hypersensitivity syndrome</strong> is characterized by refractory cough not responding to conventional antitussives. Gabapentin which inhibits central sensitization has been claimed to help patients with chronic cough syndrome.</p>

                            <h3>Mucolytic Agents</h3>
                            <p>These drugs are used to make the sputum thin and less viscid, so that it can be easily expectorated.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Acetylcysteine:</strong> This derivative of a naturally occurring amino acid, 1-cysteine, reduces viscosity of sputum in vitro. It opens disulfide bonds in mucoproteins. Clinically, 2 ml of 10% solution is nebulised into a face mask every 8 hours for 5-10 days to liquefy viscous tracheobronchial secretions. Adverse reactions include bronchospasm, fever, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, rhinorrhoea and haemoptysis. It reacts with most metals and with rubber. <em>It is also used as an antidote for Paracetamol poisoning.</em></p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Bromhexine:</strong> This is a synthetic benzylamine derivative of alkaloid vasicine obtained from the plant Adhatoda vasaca. It is given orally, parenterally and by inhalation. Experimentally, the drug reduces the viscosity of sputum by dissolving mucopolysaccharide fibres (lysosomal enzyme release). It is usually administered in doses of 8-16 mg thrice daily.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Ambroxol:</strong> This active metabolite of bromhexine is used orally (15 mg tid) as an alternative to bromhexine.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Dornase alpha:</strong> This phosphorylated, glycosylated, recombinant, human deoxyribonuclease, given by nebulisation, can decrease the viscosity of purulent sputum by cleaving long strands of denatured DNA that are released by degenerating neutrophils. It is moderately effective in patients with cystic fibrosis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Bronchial asthma</strong> is a clinical syndrome characterised by recurrent cough/paroxysmal dyspnea, chest tightness and wheeze due to increased resistance to air flow through the narrowed bronchi. This narrowing is brought about by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bronchial hyperreactivity and bronchospasm.</li>
                                <li>Cellular infiltration and edema of the bronchial mucosa; and</li>
                                <li>Blockage of the bronchial lumen by inspissated mucus.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
                            <p>The etiology of bronchial asthma is multifactorial: genetic, developmental, environmental, inflammatory and immunological. Its pathogenesis involves inflammation due to infiltration of eosinophils, mast cells, CD4 lymphocytes (Th2 cells), mucus cell hyperplasia, and airway remodeling.</p>
                            
                            <p>Exposure to an antigen causes cross-linking of IgE bound to the surface of mast cells. This triggers:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Early Reaction (Immediate):</strong> Release of histamine, leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4), and prostaglandins. Causes bronchospasm, edema, and mucus secretion. Rapid onset (15-30 min).</li>
                                <li><strong>Late Phase Reaction:</strong> Influx of inflammatory cells (eosinophils, neutrophils). Release of inflammatory mediators. Causes sustained bronchoconstriction and airway hyper-responsiveness. Begins 4-6 hours after challenge.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Drug Therapy</h3>
                            
                            <h4>1. Beta-2 Sympathomimetics</h4>
                            <p>They relax smooth muscle of all airways, enhance mucociliary clearance, and inhibit mediator release. They are physiological antagonists to bronchoconstriction.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Salbutamol (Albuterol):</strong> Selective $\beta_2$ agonist. Rapid onset (1-5 min via inhalation). Duration 4-6 hours. Used for acute attacks (Rescue drug) and prevention of exercise-induced asthma.
                            <br><strong>Dosage:</strong> MDI (100 mcg/puff) 1-2 puffs. Oral 2-4 mg.
                            <br><strong>Adverse Effects:</strong> Tremors, tachycardia, hypokalemia.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Long Acting Beta Agonists (LABA):</strong>
                            <br><strong>Salmeterol:</strong> Slow onset, long duration (12 hrs). Used for maintenance and nocturnal asthma. Not for acute attacks.
                            <br><strong>Formoterol:</strong> Rapid onset, long duration.
                            <br><em>Note: LABA should always be combined with inhaled corticosteroids.</em></p>

                            <h4>2. Methylxanthines</h4>
                            <p><strong>Theophylline / Aminophylline:</strong>
                            <br><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes causing increased cAMP; Antagonism of Adenosine receptors.
                            <br><strong>Aminophylline:</strong> Water soluble salt (Theophylline + Ethylenediamine). Given IV in acute severe asthma.
                            <br><strong>Toxicity:</strong> Narrow therapeutic index (10-20 mcg/ml). Nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, convulsions (intractable).</p>

                            <h4>3. Anticholinergics</h4>
                            <p><strong>Ipratropium Bromide:</strong> Congener of methylatropine. Blocks muscarinic receptors. Less effective than $\beta_2$ agonists in asthma, but <strong>preferred in COPD</strong>. Slow onset (30 min). Given by inhalation (MDI/Nebuliser).</p>

                            <h4>4. Glucocorticoids</h4>
                            <p>Most effective anti-inflammatory drugs. They inhibit phospholipase A2 (via lipocortin), reduce microvascular leakage, inhibit influx of inflammatory cells, and prevent downregulation of beta receptors.</p>

                            <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Chronic Bronchitis/Emphysema) involves irreversible airflow obstruction.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Smoking Cessation:</strong> Critical.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bronchodilators:</strong> Anticholinergics (<strong>Tiotropium</strong>) are often preferred or combined with Beta agonists.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inhaled Steroids:</strong> Less effective than in asthma. Used in severe cases with frequent exacerbations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Oxygen:</strong> Long term home oxygen therapy improves survival.</li>
                                <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> For acute exacerbations (often due to infection).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Pharmacotherapy of Rhinitis</h3>
                            <p><strong>Allergic Rhinitis:</strong>
                            <br>1. <strong>Antihistamines:</strong> Oral (Cetirizine, Loratadine) or Topical (Azelastine). Relieve sneezing/rhinorrhea.
                            <br>2. <strong>Intranasal Corticosteroids:</strong> (Fluticasone, Mometasone). Most effective for all symptoms including congestion.
                            <br>3. <strong>Cromolyn Sodium:</strong> Nasal spray for prophylaxis.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Nasal Decongestants:</strong> Alpha-agonists (Ephedrine, Phenylephrine, Xylometazoline, Oxymetazoline). Constrict vessels, reduce edema.
                            <br><em>Note: Topical use > 5 days causes <strong>Rhinitis Medicamentosa</strong> (rebound congestion).</em></p>
