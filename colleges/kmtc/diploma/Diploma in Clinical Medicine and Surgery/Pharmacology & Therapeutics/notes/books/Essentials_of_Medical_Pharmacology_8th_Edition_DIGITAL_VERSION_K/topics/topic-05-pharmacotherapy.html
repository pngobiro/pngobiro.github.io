                        <p>'Dose' is the appropriate amount of a drug needed to produce a certain degree of response in a given patient. Accordingly, dose of a drug has to be qualified in terms of the chosen response, e.g. the analgesic dose of aspirin for headache is $0.3-0.6 \text{ g}$, its antiplatelet dose is $60-150 \text{ mg/day}$, while its antiinflammatory dose for rheumatoid arthritis is $3-5 \text{ g}$ per day. Similarly there could be a prophylactic dose, a therapeutic dose or a toxic dose of the same drug.</p>
                        
                        <p>The strategies adopted for different types of drugs and conditions are:</p>

                                <h4>1. Standard dose</h4>
                                <p>The same dose is appropriate for most patients—individual variations are minor or the drug has a wide safety margin so that a large enough dose can be given to cover them, e.g. oral contraceptives, penicillin, chloroquine, mebendazole, hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="grid-item">
                                <h4>2. Regulated dose</h4>
                                <p>The drug modifies a finely regulated body function which can be easily measured. The dosage is accurately adjusted by repeated measurement of the affected physiological parameter, e.g. antihypertensives, hypoglycaemics, anticoagulants, diuretics, general anaesthetics. In their case, measurement of plasma drug concentration is not needed.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="grid-item">
                                <h4>3. Target level dose</h4>
                                <p>The response is not easily measurable but has been demonstrated to be obtained at a certain range of drug concentration in plasma. An empirical dose aimed at attaining the target level is given in the beginning and adjustments are made later by actual monitoring of plasma concentrations. When facilities for drug level monitoring are not available, crude adjustments are made by observing the patient at relatively long intervals, e.g. antidepressants, antiepileptics, digoxin, theophylline.</p>

                                <h4>4. Titrated dose</h4>
                                <p>The dose needed to produce maximal therapeutic effect cannot be given because of intolerable adverse effects. Optimal dose is arrived at by titrating it with an acceptable level of adverse effect. Low initial dose and upward titration (in most non-critical situations) or high initial dose and downward titration (in critical situations) can be practised. Often a compromise between submaximal therapeutic effect but tolerable side effects can be struck, e.g. anticancer drugs, corticosteroids, levodopa.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">1</span> Convenience and better patient compliance—when all the components present in the FDC are actually needed by the patient and their amounts are appropriate. It may also be cost saving compared to both/all the components administered separately.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">2</span> Certain drug combinations are synergistic, e.g. sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim; levodopa + carbidopa/benserazide; combination oral contraceptives, isoniazid + rifampin.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">3</span> The therapeutic effect of two components being same may add up while the side effects being different may not. For this the components of the FDC should act by different mechanisms, e.g. amlodipine + atenolol as antihypertensive.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">4</span> The side effect of one component may be counteracted by the other, e.g. a thiazide + a potassium sparing diuretic. However, the amount of the latter may not be sufficient in all cases.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker">5</span> Combined formulation ensures that a single drug will not be administered. This is important in the treatment of tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS and falciparum malaria.</li>

                        <p>Variation in response to the same dose of a drug between different patients and even in the same patient on different occasions is a rule rather than exception. The factors modify drug action either:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Quantitatively:</strong> The plasma concentration and/or the action of the drug is increased or decreased.</li>
                            <li><strong>Qualitatively:</strong> The type of response is altered, e.g. drug allergy or idiosyncrasy.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>1. Body size</h4>
                        <p>For exceptionally obese or lean individuals and for children dose may be calculated on body weight (BW) basis:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\text{Individual dose} = \frac{\text{BW (kg)}}{70} \times \text{average adult dose}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>Body surface area (BSA) provides a more accurate basis for dose calculation. The BSA of an individual can be calculated from Dubois formula:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            \begin{aligned}
                            \text{Individual dose} &= \frac{\text{BSA } (\mathrm{m}^{2})}{1.7} \times \text{average adult dose} \\
                            \text{BSA } (\mathrm{m}^{2}) &= \text{BW } (\mathrm{kg})^{0.425} \times \text{Height } (\mathrm{cm})^{0.725} \times 0.007184
                            \end{aligned}
                        </div>

                        <h4>2. Age</h4>
                        <p>The dose of a drug for children is often calculated from the adult dose. Child dose is better calculated more accurately on BW basis. For many drugs, manufacturers give dosage recommendations on $\text{mg/kg}$ basis. However, infants and children are not small adults. The newborn has low g.f.r. and tubular transport is immature. Similarly, hepatic drug metabolizing system is inadequate in newborns. Blood-brain barrier is more permeable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Elderly:</strong> Renal function progressively declines (intact nephron loss) so that g.f.r. is $\sim 75\%$ at 50 years and $\sim 50\%$ at 75 years age compared to young adults. There is also a reduction in the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing activity and liver blood flow. Elderly are also likely to be on multiple drug therapy which increases many fold the chances of drug interactions. They are more prone to develop postural instability, giddiness and mental confusion. In general, the incidence of adverse drug reactions is much higher in the elderly.</p>

                        <h4>3. Sex</h4>
                        <p>Females have smaller body size and require doses that are on the lower side of the range. Drugs given during pregnancy can affect the foetus. There are marked and progressive physiological changes during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, which can alter drug disposition (delayed absorption, increased volume of distribution, altered protein binding, increased renal blood flow, hepatic enzyme induction).</p>

                        <h4>4. Species and race</h4>
                        <p>Rabbits are resistant to atropine, rats and mice are resistant to digitalis. Blacks require higher and Mongols require lower concentrations of atropine and ephedrine to dilate their pupil. $\beta$-blockers are less effective as antihypertensive in Afro-Caribbeans.</p>

                        <h4 id="pharmacogenetics">5. Genetics (Pharmacogenetics)</h4>
                        <p>The study of genetic basis for variability in drug response is called 'Pharmacogenetics'. It deals with genetic influences on drug action as well as on drug handling by the body.</p>

                        <h4>6. Route of administration</h4>
                        <p>Route of administration governs the speed and intensity of drug response. Parenteral administration is often resorted to for more rapid, more pronounced and more predictable drug action.</p>

                        <h4>7. Environmental factors and time of administration</h4>
                        <p>Exposure to insecticides, carcinogens, tobacco smoke and consumption of charcoal broiled meat induce drug metabolism. Type of diet and temporal relation between drug ingestion and meals can alter drug absorption. Hypnotics taken at night and in quiet, familiar surroundings may work more easily.</p>

                        <h4>8. Psychological factor</h4>
                        <p><strong>Placebo:</strong> An inert substance which is given in the garb of a medicine. It works by psychodynamic rather than pharmacodynamic means and often produces responses equivalent to the active drug.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nocebo:</strong> It is the converse of placebo, and refers to negative psychodynamic effect evoked by the pessimistic attitude of the patient.</p>

                        <h4 id="pathological-states">9. Pathological states</h4>
                        <p><strong>Gastrointestinal diseases:</strong> Can alter absorption of orally administered drugs. Achlorhydria decreases aspirin absorption by favouring its ionization.</p>
                        <p><strong>Liver disease:</strong> Bioavailability of drugs having high first pass metabolism is increased. Serum albumin is reduced—protein binding of acidic drugs is reduced. Metabolism and elimination of some drugs is decreased.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kidney disease:</strong> Clearance of drugs that are primarily excreted unchanged (aminoglycosides, digoxin, phenobarbitone) is reduced parallel to decrease in creatinine clearance $(\mathrm{CL}_{\mathrm{cr}})$.</p>

                        <p>Drugs can modify the response to each other by pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between them.</p>

                        <h4>11. Cumulation</h4>
                        <p>Any drug will cumulate in the body if rate of administration is more than the rate of elimination. Slowly eliminated drugs are particularly liable to cause cumulative toxicity, e.g. prolonged use of chloroquine causes retinal damage.</p>

                        <h4 id="tolerance">12. Tolerance</h4>
                        <p>It refers to the requirement of higher dose of a drug to produce a given response. Tolerance is a widely occurring adaptive biological phenomenon. Loss of therapeutic efficacy after prolonged/intensive use of a drug is generally called 'refractoriness'.</p>

                                <p>A 65-year-old male hepatic cirrhosis patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of gross ascites. He was administered inj. furosemide 40 mg i.m. three times a day to excrete the ascitic fluid. He responded with brisk diuresis, but on the 3rd day he was found to be talking irrelevant, was weak and partly disoriented. He had a fainting episode on getting up from the bed. His serum $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ was $2.8 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ (low) and blood pH was 7.6 (raised).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) What should be the principles of management of this complication?</strong></p>
