                        <p>Pharmacokinetics is the quantitative study of drug movement in, through and out of the body. The overall scheme of pharmacokinetic processes is depicted in Fig. 2.1. The intensity of response is related to concentration of the drug at the site of action, which in turn is dependent on its pharmacokinetic properties. Pharmacokinetic considerations, therefore, determine the route(s) of administration, dose, latency of onset, time of peak action, duration of action and frequency of administration of a drug.</p>

                        <p>Extrinsic and intrinsic protein molecules are adsorbed on the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2.2). Glycoproteins or glycolipids are formed on the surface by attachment to polymeric sugars, aminosugars or sialic acids. The specific lipid and protein composition of different membranes differs according to the cell or the organelle type. The proteins are able to freely float through the membrane: associate and organize or vice versa. Some of the intrinsic ones, which extend through the full thickness of the membrane, surround fine aqueous pores. Paracellular spaces or channels also exist between certain epithelial/endothelial cells. Other adsorbed proteins have enzymatic, carrier, receptor or signal transduction properties. Lipid molecules also are capable of lateral movement. Thus, biological membranes are highly dynamic structures.</p>
                        <p>Drugs are transported across the membranes by:<br>
                        (a) Passive diffusion and filtration<br>
                        (b) Specialized transport</p>

                        <h3>Passive diffusion</h3>
                        <p>The drug diffuses across the membrane in the direction of its concentration gradient (high to low), the membrane playing no active role in the process. This is the most important mechanism for majority of drugs; drugs are foreign substances (xenobiotics), and specialized mechanisms are developed by the body primarily for normal metabolites.</p>

                        <p>Lipid soluble drugs diffuse by dissolving in the lipoidal matrix of the membrane (Fig. 2.3), the rate of transport being proportional to the lipid : water partition coefficient of the drug. A more lipid-soluble drug attains higher concentration in the membrane and diffuses quickly. Also, greater the difference in the concentration of the drug on the two sides of the membrane, faster is its diffusion.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Influence of pH</h4>
                        <p>Most drugs are weak electrolytes, i.e. their ionization is pH dependent (contrast strong electrolytes that are nearly completely ionized at acidic as well as alkaline pH). The ionization of a weak acid HA is given by the equation:</p>
                        
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$p H=p K a+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}$$
                        </div>

                        <p>$pKa$ is the negative logarithm of acidic dissociation constant of the weak electrolyte. If the concentration of ionized drug $[\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ is equal to concentration of unionized drug $[\mathrm{HA}]$, then</p>
                        
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}=1$$
                        </div>

                        <p>since $\log 1$ is 0, under this condition</p>
                        
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$p H=p K a$$
                        </div>

                        <p>Thus, $pKa$ is numerically equal to the pH at which the drug is 50% ionized.</p>
                        <p>If pH is increased by 1 scale, then—</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\log \left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right] /[\mathrm{HA}]=1 \quad \text { or } \quad\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right] /[\mathrm{HA}]=10$$
                        </div>
                        <p>Similarly, if pH is reduced by 1 scale, then—</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right] /[\mathrm{HA}]=1 / 10$$
                        </div>

                        <p>Thus, weakly acidic drugs, which form salts with cations, e.g. sod. phenobarbitone, sod. sulfadiazine, pot. penicillin-V, etc. ionize more at alkaline pH and 1 scale change in pH causes 10 fold change in ionization.</p>
                        <p>Weakly basic drugs, which form salts with anions, e.g. atropine sulfate, ephedrine HCl, chloroquine phosphate, etc. conversely ionize more at acidic pH. Ions being lipid insoluble, do not diffuse and a pH difference across a membrane can cause differential distribution of weakly acidic and weakly basic drugs on the two sides (Fig. 2.4).</p>

                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                        </ul>
                        <p>Lipid-soluble nonelectrolytes (e.g. ethanol, diethyl-ether) readily cross biological membranes and their transport is pH independent.</p>

                        <h3>Filtration</h3>
                        <p>Filtration is passage of drugs through aqueous pores in the membrane or through paracellular spaces. This can be accelerated if hydrodynamic flow of the solvent is occurring under hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradient, e.g. across most capillaries including glomeruli. Lipid-insoluble drugs cross biological membranes by filtration if their molecular size is smaller than the diameter of the pores (Fig. 2.3). Majority of cells (intestinal mucosa, RBC, etc.) have very small pores (4 Å) and drugs with MW > 100 or 200 are not able to penetrate. However, capillaries (except those in brain) have large paracellular spaces (40 Å) and most drugs (even albumin) can filter through these (Fig. 2.8). As such, diffusion of drugs across capillaries is dependent on rate of blood flow through them rather than on lipid solubility of the drug or pH of the medium.</p>

                        <h3>Specialized transport</h3>
                        <p>This can be carrier mediated or by vesicular transport (endocytosis, exocytosis).</p>

                        <h4>Carrier transport</h4>
                        <p>All cell membranes express a host of transmembrane proteins which serve as carriers or transporters for physiologically important ions, nutrients, metabolites, transmitters, etc. across the membrane. At some sites, certain transporters also translocate xenobiotics, including drugs and their metabolites.</p>

                        <p>Absorption is movement of the drug from its site of administration into the circulation. Not only the fraction of the administered dose that gets absorbed, but also the rate of absorption is important. Except when given i.v., the drug has to cross biological membranes; absorption is governed by the above described principles.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Factors affecting absorption</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> <strong>Aqueous solubility:</strong> Drugs given in solid form must dissolve in the aqueous biophase before they are absorbed. For poorly water soluble drugs (aspirin, griseofulvin) rate of dissolution governs rate of absorption.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> <strong>Concentration:</strong> Passive diffusion depends on concentration gradient; drug given as concentrated solution is absorbed faster than from dilute solution.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> <strong>Area of absorbing surface:</strong> Larger is the surface area, faster is the absorption.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> <strong>Vascularity of the absorbing surface:</strong> Blood circulation removes the drug from the site of absorption and maintains the concentration gradient across the absorbing surface. Increased blood flow hastens drug absorption.</li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> <strong>Route of administration:</strong> This affects drug absorption, because each route has its own peculiarities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Oral</h3>
                        <p>The effective barrier to orally administered drugs is the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which is lipoidal. Nonionized lipid soluble drugs, e.g. ethanol are readily absorbed from stomach as well as intestine at rates proportional to their lipid : water partition coefficient. Acidic drugs, e.g. salicylates, barbiturates, etc. are predominantly unionized in the acid gastric juice and are absorbed from stomach, while basic drugs, e.g. morphine, quinine, etc. are largely ionized and are absorbed only on reaching the duodenum. However, even for acidic drugs absorption from stomach is slower, because the mucosa is thick, covered with mucus and the surface area is small. Absorbing surface area is much larger in the small intestine due to villi. Thus, faster gastric emptying accelerates drug absorption in general. Dissolution is a surface phenomenon, therefore, particle size of the drug in solid dosage form governs rate of dissolution and in turn rate of absorption.</p>
                        <p>Presence of food dilutes the drug and retards absorption. Further, certain drugs form poorly absorbed complexes with food constituents, e.g. tetracyclines with calcium present in milk; moreover food delays gastric emptying. Thus, most drugs are absorbed better if taken in empty stomach. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. fatty food greatly enhances lumefantrine absorption. Highly ionized drugs, e.g. gentamicin, neostigmine are poorly absorbed when given orally.</p>
                        <p>The oral absorption of certain drugs is low because a fraction of the absorbed drug is extruded back into the intestinal lumen by the efflux transporter P-gp located in the gut epithelium. The low oral bioavailability of digoxin and cyclosporine is partly accounted by this mechanism. Inhibitors of P-gp like quinidine, verapamil, erythromycin, etc. enhance, while P-gp inducers like rifampin and phenobarbitone reduce the oral bioavailability of these drugs.</p>

                        <h3>Subcutaneous and Intramuscular</h3>
                        <p>By these routes the drug is deposited directly in the vicinity of the capillaries. Lipid soluble drugs pass readily across the whole surface of the capillary endothelium. Capillaries having large paracellular spaces do not obstruct absorption of even large lipid insoluble molecules or ions (Fig. 2.9A). Very large molecules are absorbed through lymphatics. Thus, many drugs not absorbed orally are absorbed parenterally. Absorption from s.c. site is slower than that from i.m. site, but both are generally faster and more consistent/predictable than oral absorption.</p>

                        <h3>Topical sites (skin, cornea, mucous membranes)</h3>
                        <p>Systemic absorption after topical application depends primarily on lipid solubility of drugs. However, only few drugs significantly penetrate intact skin. Hyoscine, fentanyl, GTN, nicotine, testosterone, and estradiol have been used in this manner. Corticosteroids applied over extensive areas of skin can produce systemic effects and pituitary-adrenal suppression. Absorption can be promoted by rubbing the drug incorporated in an olegenous base or by use of occlusive dressing which increases hydration of the skin.</p>

                        <h3>Redistribution</h3>
                        <p>Highly lipid-soluble drugs get initially distributed to organs with high blood flow, i.e. brain, heart, kidney, etc. Later, less vascular but more bulky tissues (muscle, fat) take up the drug—plasma concentration falls and the drug is withdrawn from the highly perfused sites. If the site of action of the drug was in one of the highly perfused organs, redistribution results in termination of drug action. Greater the lipid solubility of the drug, faster is its redistribution. Anaesthetic action of thiopentone sod. injected i.v. is terminated in few minutes due to redistribution.</p>

                        <h3>Penetration into brain and CSF</h3>
                        <p>The capillary endothelial cells in brain have tight junctions and lack large paracellular spaces. Further, an investment of neural tissue (Fig. 2.9B) covers the capillaries. Together they constitute the so called blood-brain barrier (BBB). A similar blood-CSF barrier is located in the choroid plexus. Both these barriers are lipoidal and limit the entry of nonlipid-soluble drugs, e.g. streptomycin, neostigmine, etc. Only lipid-soluble drugs, therefore, are able to penetrate and have action on the central nervous system.</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span> High degree of protein binding generally makes the drug long acting, because bound fraction is not available for metabolism or excretion.</li>

On enquiry she revealed that she felt epigastric distress after taking the iron capsules, and had started taking antacid tablets along with the capsules.</p>
