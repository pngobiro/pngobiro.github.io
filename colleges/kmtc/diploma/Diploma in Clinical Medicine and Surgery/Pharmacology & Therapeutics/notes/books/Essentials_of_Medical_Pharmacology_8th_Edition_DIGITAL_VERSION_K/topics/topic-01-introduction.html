                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pharmacology is the science of drugs (Greek: <em>Pharmacon</em>—drug; <em>logos</em>—discourse in). In a broad sense, it deals with interaction of exogenously administered chemical molecules with living systems, and any single chemical substance which can produce a biological response is a 'drug'. Pharmacology encompasses all aspects of knowledge about drugs, but most importantly those that are relevant to effective and safe use of drugs for medicinal purposes.</p>
                        
                        <p>For thousands of years most drugs were crude natural products of unknown composition and limited efficacy. Only the overt effects of these substances on the body were rather imprecisely known, but how the same were produced was entirely unknown. Animal experiments, primarily aimed at understanding physiological processes, were started in the 18th century. These were pioneered by F. Magendie and Claude Bernard, who also adapted them to study effects of certain drugs. Pharmacology as an experimental science was ushered by Rudolf Buchheim who founded the first institute of pharmacology in 1847 in Germany. In the later part of the 19th century, Oswald Schmiedeberg, regarded as the 'father of pharmacology', together with his many disciples like J Langley, T Frazer, P Ehrlich, AJ Clark, JJ Abel propounded some of the fundamental concepts in pharmacology. Since then drugs have been purified, chemically characterized and a vast variety of highly potent and selective new drugs have been developed. The mechanism of action including molecular target of many drugs has been elucidated. This has been possible due to prolific growth of pharmacology which forms the backbone of rational therapeutics.</p>

                                <p><strong>Pharmacodynamics</strong> (Greek: <em>dynamis</em>—power)—What the drug does to the body.</p>
                                <p>This includes physiological and biochemical effects of drugs and their mechanism of action at organ system/subcellular/macromolecular levels, e.g.—Adrenaline $\rightarrow$ interaction with adrenoceptors $\rightarrow$ G-protein mediated stimulation of cell membrane bound adenylyl cyclase $\rightarrow$ increased intracellular cyclic $3', 5'$ AMP $\rightarrow$ cardiac stimulation, hepatic glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia, etc.</p>

                                <p><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> (Greek: <em>Kinesis</em>—movement)—What the body does to the drug.</p>
                                <p>This refers to movement of the drug in and alteration of the drug by the body; includes absorption, distribution, binding/localization/storage, biotransformation and excretion of the drug.</p>
                                <p><em>Example:</em> Paracetamol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed orally attaining peak blood levels at 30–60 min; 25% bound to plasma proteins, widely and almost uniformly distributed in the body (volume of distribution $\sim 1 \text{ L/kg}$); extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide and sulfate conjugation into inactive metabolites which are excreted in urine; has a plasma half life $(\text{t}^{1/2})$ of 2–3 hours and a clearance value of 5 ml/kg/min.</p>

                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        <p><strong>Drug</strong> (French: <em>Drogue</em>—a dry herb) It is the single active chemical entity present in a medicine that is used for diagnosis, prevention, treatment/cure of a disease.</p>
                        <p>This disease oriented definition of drug does not include contraceptives or use of drugs for improvement of health. The WHO (1966) has given a more comprehensive definition—"Drug is any substance or product that is used or is intended to be used to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the benefit of the recipient."</p>

                        <h3>Nature of Drugs</h3>
                        <p>The molecular weight of majority of drugs falls in the range of 100–1000 D, because molecules smaller than 100 D do not generally have sufficiently specific features... On the other hand, larger molecules than 1000 D do not readily pass through membranes/barriers in the body to reach the target sites in various tissues/cells. However, few drugs are as small as lithium ion (7D), and some like heparin (10–20 KD), gonadotropins (>30 KD), enzymes, proteins, antibodies (>50 KD) are much bigger. Bulky molecule drugs have to be administered parenterally.</p>

                                <p>A 5-year-old child is brought to the hospital with the complaint of fever, cough, breathlessness and chest pain. On examination he is found to be dull, but irritable with fast pulse (116/min), rapid breathing (RR 50/min) and indrawing of lower chest during inspiration, wheezing, crepitations and mild dehydration. Body temperature is $40^{\circ}\text{C}$ ($104^{\circ}\text{F}$). The paediatrician makes a provisional diagnosis of acute pneumonia and orders relevant haematological as well as bacteriological investigations. He decides to institute antibiotic therapy.</p>

                                    <li>In case he selects an antibiotic which can be given orally as well as by i.m. or i.v. injection, which route of administration will be most appropriate in this case?</li>
                                    <li>Should the paediatrician administer the antibiotic straight away or should he wait for the laboratory reports?</li>
