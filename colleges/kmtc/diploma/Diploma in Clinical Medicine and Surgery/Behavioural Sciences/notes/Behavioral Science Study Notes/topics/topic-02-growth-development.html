                        <p>In his theory of cognitive development, Jean Piaget proposed that humans progress through four developmental stages: the sensorimotor stage, preoperational stage, concrete operational stage, and formal operational stage. Cognitive development is a theory of cognitive development that defines four stages in the growth and development of an individual's brain:</p>

                                    <span class="list-content">Since infants' primary way of interacting with the world is through their mouth, Freud thought this is where the libido is focused. With the rooting and sucking reflex, breastfeeding, biting, and tasting different foods, the oral stage is about satisfying the id's needs through the mouth.</span>

Fixation could also occur at this stage if an infant's needs for security, largely fulfilled through feeding, were not met. Freud thought that an oral-stage fixation could show up later as aggression or dependency, expressing itself through compulsive habits such as smoking, overeating, and excessive drinking.</span>

Freud also believed that this is a period of independence. The child realizes that they are a person separate from their parents, with a growing list of individual needs and desires. Freud also thought that the ego, the sense of self in relation to the external world, develops during this stage.</span>

To Erikson, the main characteristics of human development did occur in stage, but the main influence seems to be certain situations one may encounter with others and how those situations are dealt with. According to Erikson, these occurrences did not take place until one was sexually mature, but across the entire life span. In this, Erikson progressed Freud's theory by acknowledging the initial stages of development and adding onto them by taking into account social influences and later stages of life.</span>

John Bowlby pointed out the fact that humans not only need differing types of social interaction in life, but they also form deep attachments, which affects their style of attachment throughout the rest of life. Bowlby explained this through the fact that some individuals strive to maintain a reliant connection in their adult relationships while others are more avoidant.</span>

He claimed that humans develop in six stages associated directly with their moral influence and the ability for moral reasoning. The main idea behind Kohlberg's theory is that as one learns right behavior from wrong, their development progresses. This may look like individual learning not to lie to others.</span>
