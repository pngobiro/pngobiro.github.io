                                            <li>He developed a theory around the notion of reinforcing behavior. He believed that behavior can be understood as a learned response to environmental events, and that behaviors are selected on the basis of their consequences.</li>

                                            <li>Freud considered that the mind is the principal determinant of motivation and personality and that what happens in our first five years of life is crucial to the formation of adult personality. freud described three aspects of mind namely, the id, ego and superego.</li>
                                            <li>The ego which represents reason (rationality) which must be in control of both the other two aspects in order to enable the person to conform to social demands.</li>

This debate concerns the relative importance of an individual's innate qualities ("nature," i.e. nativism, or innatism) versus personal experiences ("nurture," i.e. empiricism or behaviorism) in determining or causing individual differences in physical and behavioral traits. Some scholars argue that human beings acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from the upbringing and the environment (nurture) while others think otherwise. However, it has generally been accepted that personality is made up of hereditary and environmental factors and moderated by situational conditions.</p>

For example, culture establishes the norms, attitudes, and values that are passed along from one generation to next and create consistencies over time. Thus, a lot of the behaviors exhibited by the patients and the personnel have been transmitted culturally. The way the patients will queue at the health records department will be from the way we have been socialized ...either to be or not to be orderly. The environment factors that exert pressures on our personality formation are culture in which we raised, our early conditioning, the norms among our family, friends, social groups etc. that we experience.</p>

They are the strongest needs because if a person were deprived of all needs, the physiological ones would come first in the person's search for satisfaction.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Safety Needs</strong> -When all physiological needs are satisfied and are no longer controlling thoughts and behaviors, the needs for security can become active. Adults have little awareness of their security needs except in times of emergency or periods of disorganization in the social structure (such as widespread rioting). Children often display the signs of insecurity and the need to be safe.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Needs of Love, Affection, and Belongingness</strong> -When the needs for safety and for physiological well-being are satisfied, the next class of needs for love, affection, and belongingness can emerge. Maslow states that people seek to overcome feelings of loneliness and alienation. This involves both giving and receiving love, affection and the sense of belonging.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Needs for Esteem</strong> -When the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the needs for esteem can become dominant. These involve needs for both self-esteem and for the esteem a person gets from others. Humans have a need for a stable, firmly based, high level of self-respect, and respect from others. When these needs are satisfied, the person feels self-confident and valuable as a person in the world. When these needs are frustrated, the person feels inferior, weak, helpless, and worthless.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Needs for Self-Actualization</strong> -Maslow describes Self Actualization as the intrinsic growth of what is already in the organism, or more accurately, of what the organism is. "Self-actualization implies the attainment of the basic needs of physiological, safety/security, love/belongingness, and self-esteem.</p>

                            <strong>b) Self / Ego-expressive.</strong> The attitudes we express (1) help communicate who we are and (2) may make us feel good because we have asserted our identity. Therefore, our attitudes are part of our identity, and help us to be aware through expression of our feelings, beliefs and values.<br>
                            <strong>c) Adaptive.</strong> If a person holds and/or expresses socially acceptable attitudes, other people will reward them with approval and social acceptance. Attitudes then, are to do with being apart of a social group and the adaptive functions helps us fit in with a social group.<br>
                            <strong>d) The ego-defensive</strong> function refers to holding attitudes that protect our self-esteem or that justify actions that make us feel guilty.</p>

Patients are sometimes embarrassed by the labeling given to them during the diagnosis process. For instance, those diseases which carry with them stigmatization will make a patient want to hide the fact that they have been diagnosed as having those diseases. This is because the think and believe that no one will accept them with that kind of ailment. Therefore, rather than confront the intense distress and rejection, they might start looking at it as this was the will of God as everything is predestined to happen.</span>

                                    It involves the cognitive distortion of "the facts" to make an event or an impulse less threatening. A patient who has lost the card may tell the attending health care work that the card was left in the hospital the last time he/she was attended to.</span>
