                                    <span class="list-content">All cultures have systems of health beliefs to explain what causes illness, how it can be cured or treated, and who should be involved in the process. The extent to which patients perceive patient education as having cultural relevance for them can have a profound effect on their reception to information provided and their willingness to use it. Western industrialized societies such as the United States, which see disease as a result of natural scientific phenomena, advocate medical treatments that combat microorganisms or use sophisticated technology to diagnose and treat disease. Other societies believe that illness is the result of supernatural phenomena and promote prayer or other spiritual interventions that counter the presumed disfavor of powerful forces. Cultural issues play a major role in patient compliance. One study showed that a group of Cambodian adults with minimal formal education made considerable efforts to comply with therapy but did so in a manner consistent with their underlying understanding of how medicines and the body work.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content">Cultural differences affect patients 'attitudes about medical care and their ability to understand, manage, and cope with the course of an illness, the meaning of a diagnosis, and the consequences of medical treatment. Patients and their families bring culture specific ideas and values related to concepts of health and illness, reporting of symptoms, expectations for how health care will be delivered, and beliefs concerning medication and treatments. In addition, culture specific values influence patient roles and expectations, how much information about illness and treatment is desired, how death and dying will be managed, bereavement patterns, gender and family roles, and processes for decision making. Culture consists of all those things, including actions and beliefs which human beings (as physical animals) learn, which make them human. Culture includes learned behavior, but not things which are determined genetically. Culture is stored and transmitted by symbols; never by chromosomes. While some culture is learned in childhood (e.g how to talk), other culture is learned by adults.</span>

Cultural factors significantly influence health and sickness in society. Certain types of ailments are significantly correlated with such factors as class occupation, ethnicity and food habits. Diabetes, ulcer, hypertension may be regarded as urban disease, generally connected with sedentary occupations. Environmental pollution brought about by technological advancement, is now identified as one of the major causes for the growing incidence of cancer. Consumption of fatty foods and high salt intake habits are significantly correlated with cardiovascular diseases. Generally, a culture defines what diseases are to be considered as illness, and therefore requiring treatment. Intestinal worms are regarded as necessary for digestion for the Thonga of Africa and the Yap islanders. In most primitive societies, diagnosis and treatment of diseases are invariable associated with magical beliefs and rites and shamanistic practices.</span>

Consequently, a given food item, which is relished by one people may be abhorred by another. The aphorism a short sentence packed with meaning, _one man 's food is another man 's poison' is very true in a culture sense. Pork which is forbidden to Jews and Muslims is eaten with relish by the Christians. Milk and milk products are regarded as luxury food by many tribes from East Africa and West Africa and Chinese consider them as inedible and nauseating.</span>

Just as a biologist may need a particular culture 'to allow the growth of a particular organism, social cultures nurture the growth of people with particular beliefs, values, habits, etc. But, above all, culture provides a means of communication with those around us. Different styles of communication reflect the customary habits of people from different cultures. Culture, then is the medium that people use for communication; it is the lubricant of social relationships.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content">One reason why culture vary in how their individual members present illness is that different cultures require different paths to be followed in order to become legitimately ill. If the patient and the clinician know the rules to be followed each can have faith in the other. The faith of a patient, or client, in a treatment is often referred to as the placebo effect. This effect applies not just to treatments but to clinicians as well. When a patient and a clinician come from different cultural groups, this may influence the degree of faith that a patient has in the treatment offered and, the clinician, who is offering it.</span>

                                    <span class="list-content">Another aspect of the process of treatment concerns what sort of information is shared between clinician and client. A cultural difference in diagnostic disclosure (whether clinicians tell their clients the true diagnosis that they have made) is an example of this. Patients and clinicians are cast in different roles by different cultures and this affects clinical decision-making. Clinicians are a product of their culture and so too are their treatments. Sometimes inappropriate therapies can be oppressive. Culture shapes and determines what a society believes and does about disease and illness. There are many more aspects to health than simply the biological manifestation of an illness. In a culturally diverse country like Kenya, there are many beliefs about health versus disease and illness. When treating patients, it is important for the health care professional to understand that disease and illness are a result of many interrelated aspects of a person's life, including their natural environment, their biological self and their socio-cultural environment. beliefs, opinions, or goals.</span>
