Behaviors are everything that we do that can be directly observed. Mental processes refer to the thoughts, feelings, and motives that are not directly observable. Being a science, its psychology employs the use of systematic methods to observe, describe, predict, and explain behavior.</p>

The field of medical sociology regularly interacts with the sociology of science, knowledge, and technology studies, while also working alongside social epistemology.

It results from the fact that the cumulative effects of a medical illness are what people ultimately experience, and that experience is colored by the patient's background, behavior and beliefs. For instance, even biologist determines that tuberculosis is caused by the pathogen mycobacterium, the behavioral scientist will determine that tuberculosis is a result of poor nutrition and low socioeconomic status</span>
