                            <p>Elasticity, ability of a deformed material body to return to its original shape and size when the forces causing the deformation are removed. A body with this ability is said to behave (or respond) elastically</p>
                            
                            <p>To a greater or lesser extent, most solid materials exhibit elastic behavior, but there is a limit to the magnitude of the force and the accompanying deformation within which elastic recovery is possible for any given material. This limit, called the <strong>elastic limit</strong>, is the maximum stress or force per unit area within a solid material that can arise before the onset of permanent deformation. Stresses beyond the elastic limit cause a material to yield or flow. For such materials the elastic limit marks the end of elastic behavior and the beginning of plastic behavior. For most brittle materials, stresses beyond the elastic limit result in fracture with almost no plastic deformation.</p>

                                    <p>The elastic limit depends markedly on the type of solid considered; for example, a steel bar or wire can be extended elastically only about 1 percent of its original length, while for strips of certain rubberlike materials, elastic extensions of up to 1,000 percent can be achieved. Steel is much stronger than rubber, however, because the tensile force required to effect the maximum elastic extension in rubber is less (by a factor of about 0.01) than that required for steel.</p>

                            <p>Gases and liquids also possess elastic properties since their volume changes under the action of pressure. For small volume changes, the bulk modulus, $\kappa$, of a gas, liquid, or solid is defined by the equation:</p>

                            <p>where $P$ is the pressure that reduces the volume $V_0$ of a fixed mass of material to $V$. Since gases can in general be compressed more easily than liquids or solids, the value of $\kappa$ for a gas is very much less than that for a liquid or solid.</p>

                            <p>Hooke's law, law of elasticity discovered by the English scientist Robert Hooke in 1660, which states that, for relatively small deformations of an object, the displacement or size of the deformation is directly proportional to the deforming force or load. Under these conditions the object returns to its original shape and size upon removal of the load. Elastic behaviour of solids according to Hooke's law can be explained by the fact that small displacements of their constituent molecules, atoms, or ions from normal positions is also proportional to the force that causes the displacement.</p>
                            
                            <p>The deforming force may be applied to a solid by stretching, compressing, squeezing, bending, or twisting. Thus, a metal wire exhibits elastic behaviour according to Hooke's law because the small increase in its length when stretched by an applied force doubles each time the force is doubled. Mathematically, Hooke's law states that the applied force $F$ equals a constant $k$ times the displacement or change in length $x$, or:</p>

                            <p>Sometimes Hooke's law is formulated as $F = -kx$. In this expression $F$ no longer means the applied force but rather means the equal and oppositely directed restoring force that causes elastic materials to return to their original dimensions.</p>
