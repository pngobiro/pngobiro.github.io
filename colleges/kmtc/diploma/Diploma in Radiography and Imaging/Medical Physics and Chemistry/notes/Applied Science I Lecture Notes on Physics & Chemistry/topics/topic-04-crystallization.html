                            <p>Crystallization is a natural process which occurs as materials solidify from a liquid, or as they precipitate out of a liquid or gas. This can be caused by a physical change, such as a temperature change, or a chemical change such as acidity. Crystallization is a process directed by the size and shapes of the molecules involved, and their chemical properties. Crystals can be formed out of a single species of atom, different species of ions, or even large molecules like proteins. Some large molecules have a harder time undergoing the crystallization process, because their internal chemistry is not very symmetrical or interacts with itself to avoid crystallization.</p>

You can think of this as a children's building block, to which other blocks can be attached. Crystallization proceeds as if you were attaching these blocks in all directions. Some materials form different shaped crystals, which accounts for the great variation in shape, size, and color of various crystals.</p>

                            <p>The crystallization of a large amount of material from a single point of nucleation results in a single crystal. In engineering materials, single crystals are produced only under carefully controlled conditions. The expense of producing single crystal materials is only justified for special applications, such as turbine engine blades, solar cells, and piezoelectric materials. Normally when a material begins to solidify, multiple crystals begin to grow in the liquid and a polycrystalline (more than one crystal) solid forms.</p>
                            
                            <p>The moment a crystal begins to grow is known as <strong>nucleation</strong> and the point where it occurs is the <strong>nucleation point</strong>. At the solidification temperature, atoms of a liquid, such as melted metal, begin to bond together at the nucleation points and start to form crystals. The final sizes of the individual crystals depend on the number of nucleation points. The crystals increase in size by the progressive addition of atoms and grow until they impinge upon adjacent growing crystal.</p>

                            <p>In engineering materials, a crystal is usually referred to as a grain. A grain is merely a crystal without smooth faces because its growth was impeded by contact with another grain or a boundary surface. The interface formed between grains is called a grain boundary. The atoms between the grains (at the grain boundaries) have no crystalline structure and are said to be disordered.</p>
                            
                            <p>Grains are sometimes large enough to be visible under an ordinary light microscope or even to the unaided eye. The spangles that are seen on newly galvanized metals are grains. Rapid cooling generally results in more nucleation points and smaller grains (a fine grain structure). Slow cooling generally results in larger grains which will have lower strength, hardness and ductility.</p>

                            <p>In metals, the crystals that form in the liquid during freezing generally follow a pattern consisting of a main branch with many appendages. A crystal with this morphology slightly resembles a pine tree and is called a dendrite, which means branching. The formation of dendrites occurs because crystals grow in defined planes due to the crystal lattice they create.</p>

                            <p>The figure above shows how a cubic crystal can grow in a melt in three dimensions, which correspond to the six faces of the cube. For clarity of illustration, the adding of unit cells with continued solidification from the six faces is shown simply as lines. Secondary dendrite arms branch off the primary arm, and tertiary arms off the secondary arms and etcetera.</p>
                            
                            <p>During freezing of a polycrystalline material, many dendritic crystals form and grow until they eventually become large enough to impinge upon each other. Eventually, the interdendritic spaces between the dendrite arms crystallize to yield a more regular crystal. The original dendritic pattern may not be apparent when examining the microstructure of a material. However, dendrites can often be seen in solidification voids that sometimes occur in castings or welds.</p>

                            <p>Shrinkage can sometimes cause cracking to occur in component as it solidifies. Since the coolest area of a volume of liquid is where it contacts a mold or die, solidification usually begins first at this surface. As the crystals grow inward, the material continues to shrink. If the solid surface is too rigid and will not deform to accommodate the internal shrinkage, the stresses can become high enough to exceed the tensile strength of the material and cause a crack to form. Shrinkage cavitation sometimes occurs because as a material solidifies inward, shrinkage occurred to such an extent that there is not enough atoms present to fill the available space and a void is left.</p>

                            <p>In a single crystal, the physical and mechanical properties often differ with orientation. It can be seen from looking at our models of crystalline structure that atoms should be able to slip over one another or distort in relation to one another easier in some directions than others. When the properties of a material vary with different crystallographic orientations, the material is said to be <strong>anisotropic</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>Alternatively, when the properties of a material are the same in all directions, the material is said to be <strong>isotropic</strong>. For many polycrystalline materials the grain orientations are random before any working (deformation) of the material is done. Therefore, even if the individual grains are anisotropic, the property differences tend to average out and, overall, the material is isotropic. When a material is formed, the grains are usually distorted and elongated in one or more directions which makes the material anisotropic. Material forming will be discussed later but let's continue discussing crystalline structure at the atomic level.</p>

                                    <p>Crystallization is a common and useful laboratory technique. It can be used to purify substances, and can be combined with advanced imaging techniques to understand the nature of the substances crystallized. In laboratory crystallization, a substance can be dissolved into an appropriate solvent. Heat and changes in acidity can help the material dissolve. When these conditions are reversed, the materials within the solution precipitate out at different rates. If the conditions are controlled properly, pure crystals of a desired substance can be obtained.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">An advanced imaging technique, called <strong>crystallography</strong>, x-rays or other high-energy beams and particles can be shot through the crystal structure of a pure substance. Using this method, scientists can recognize almost any substance based on its crystal form.</p>

                                    <h4>Crystallization Examples</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Human time-scale:</strong> Crystals can take an enormous amount of time to form, or they can form quickly. Ice and snowflakes are great examples of the crystallization of water. Another interesting example is the crystallization of honey. When bees regurgitate honey into the honeycomb, it is a liquid. Over time, sugar molecules within the honey begin to form crystals.</p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Geological time scale:</strong> While the process is similar, the time it takes to form things like quartz, ruby, and granite are much longer. These crystals are formed under extremely high pressures within the crust and magma of the Earth. On a slightly shorter timescale, mineral buildups like stalactites and stalagmites are also formed through the crystallization process.</p>
