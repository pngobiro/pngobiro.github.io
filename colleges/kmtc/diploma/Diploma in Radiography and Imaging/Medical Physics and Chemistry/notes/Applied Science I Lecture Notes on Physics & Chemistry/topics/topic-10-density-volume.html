                            <p>Among the physical properties studied by chemists and other scientists, mass is one of the most fundamental. All matter, by definition, has mass. Mass, in turn, plays a role in two properties important to the study of chemistry: density and volume. All of these—mass, density, and volume—are simple concepts, yet in order to work in chemistry or any of the other hard sciences, it is essential to understand these types of measurement.</p>
                            
                            <p>Most qualities of the world studied by scientists can be measured in terms of one or more of four properties: length, mass, time, and electric charge. The volume of a cube, for instance, is a unit of length cubed—that is, length multiplied by "width," which is then multiplied by "height."</p>

                                    <p>Volume is measured in terms of length, and can be defined as the amount of three-dimensional space an object occupies. Volume is usually expressed in cubic units of length—for example, the milliliter (mL), also known as the cubic centimeter (cc), is equal to $6.10237 \cdot 10^{-2} \mathrm{in}^3$. As its name implies, there are 1,000 milliliters in a liter.</p>

                                    <p>Density is the ratio of mass to volume—or, to put its definition in terms of fundamental properties, of mass divided by cubed length. Density can also be viewed as the amount of matter within a given area. In the SI system, density is typically expressed as grams per cubic centimeter $(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^3)$, equivalent to 62.42197 pounds per cubic foot in the English system.</p>

                            <p>Most people who are not scientifically trained tend to think that mass and weight are the same thing, but this is like saying that apples and apple pies are the same. Of course, an apple is an ingredient in an apple pie, but the pie contains something else—actually, a number of other things, such as flour and sugar. In this analogy, mass is equivalent to the apple, and weight the pie, while the acceleration due to gravity is the "something else" in weight.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is understandable why people confuse mass with weight, since most weight scales provide measurements in both pounds and kilograms. However, the pound (lb) is a unit of weight in the English system, whereas a kilogram (kg) is a unit of mass in the metric and SI systems. Though the two are relatively convertible on Earth (1 lb = 0.4536 kg; 1 kg = 2.21 lb), they are actually quite different.</p>

Hence a person weighs less on the Moon, because the Moon possesses less mass than Earth, and, thus, exerts less gravitational force. Therefore, it would be easier on the Moon to lift a person from the ground, but it would be no easier to move that person from a resting position, or to stop him or her from moving. This is because the person's mass, and hence his or her resistance to inertia, has not changed.</p>

                            <p>Mass, because of its fundamental nature, is sometimes hard to comprehend, and density requires an explanation in terms of mass and volume. Volume, on the other hand, appears to be quite straightforward—and it is, when one is describing a solid of regular shape. In other situations, however, volume measurement is more complicated.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Solids</h3>
                            <p>As noted earlier, the volume of a cube can be obtained simply by multiplying length by width by height. There are other means for measuring the volume of other straight-sided objects, such as a pyramid. Still other formulae, which make use of the constant $\pi$ (roughly equal to 3.14) are necessary for measuring the volume of a cylinder, a sphere, or a cone.</p>
                            <p>For an object that is irregular in shape, however, one may have to employ calculus—but the most basic method is simply to immerse the object in water. This procedure involves measuring the volume of the water before and after immersion, and calculating the difference. Of course, the object being measured cannot be water-soluble; if it is, its volume must be measured in a non-water-based liquid such as alcohol.</p>

                            <h3>Liquids and Gases</h3>
                            <p>Measuring liquid volumes is even easier than for solids, given the fact that liquids have no definite shape, and will simply take the shape of the container in which they are placed. Gases are similar to liquids in the sense that they expand to fit their container; however, measurement of gas volume is a more involved process than that used to measure either liquids or solids, because gases are highly responsive to changes in temperature and pressure.</p>

                            <p>Expressed in terms of the ratio of mass to volume, the difference between helium and iron becomes much more pronounced. Suppose, on the one hand, one had a gallon jug filled with iron. How many gallons of helium does it take to equal the mass of the iron? Fourteen? Try again: it takes more than 43,000 gallons of helium to equal the mass of the iron in one gallon jug! Clearly, what this shows is that the density of iron is much, much greater than that of helium.</p>
                            
                            <p>This, of course, is hardly a surprising revelation; still, it is sometimes easy to get confused by comparisons of mass as opposed to comparisons of density. One might even get tricked by the old elementary-school brain-teaser that goes something like this: "Which is heavier, a ton of feathers or a ton of cannonballs?" Of course neither is heavier, but the trick element in the question relates to the fact that it takes a much greater volume of feathers (measured in cubic feet, for instance) than of cannonballs to equal a ton.</p>
                            
                            <p>One of the interesting things about density, as distinguished from mass and volume, is that it has nothing to do with the amount of material. A kilogram of iron differs from $10\mathrm{kg}$ of iron both in mass and volume, but the density of both samples is the same.</p>

                            <p>Note that pure water (as opposed to sea water, which is 3% more dense) has a density of 1.0 g per cubic centimeter. Water is thus a useful standard for measuring the specific gravity of other substances, or the ratio between the density of that substance and the density of water. Since the specific gravity of water is 1.00—also the density of water in g/cm³—the specific gravity of any substance (a number, rather than a number combined with a unit of measure) is the same as the value of its own density in g/cm³.</p>

To determine the answer, one must drop the sample in a beaker of water with graduated units of measure clearly marked. Suppose the item has a mass of 10 g. The density of gold is 19 g/cm³, and because density is equal to mass divided by volume, the volume of water displaced should be equal to the mass divided by the density. The latter figure is equal to 10 g divided by 19 g/cm³, or 0.53 ml. Suppose that instead, the item displaced 0.88 ml of water. Clearly it is not gold, but what is it?</p>
                                    <p>Given the figures for mass and volume, its density is equal to 11.34 g/cm³—which happens to be the density of lead. If, on the other hand, the amount of water displaced were somewhere between the values for pure gold and pure lead, one could calculate what portion of the item was gold and which lead. It is possible, of course, that it could contain some other metal, but given the high specific gravity of lead, and the fact that its density is relatively close to that of gold, lead is a favorite gold substitute among jewelry counterfeiters.</p>
