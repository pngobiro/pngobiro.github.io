                            <p>An object will not accelerate unless it is acted on by unbalanced forces.</p>
                            <p>All matter has inertia. Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in velocity, or acceleration. An object with a large mass, has a large inertia, and a high resistance to acceleration.</p>

                            <p>If you push on something it will push back with the same force, but in the opposite direction. Forces always come in equal, but opposite pairs.</p>
                            <p>Most of the time force pairs come from objects in contact, but even non-contact forces, like gravity, still obey this law.</p>

                            <p>A rapidly moving truck has a large momentum. It takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed, or to bring it to a stop afterwards. A slow moving snail has a small momentum. It would be easy to slow down or speed up a little snail.</p>

                            <p>Conservation of momentum, general law of physics according to which the quantity called momentum that characterizes motion never changes in an isolated collection of objects; that is, the total momentum of a system remains constant. Momentum is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by its velocity and is equivalent to the force required to bring the object to a stop in a unit length of time. For any array of several objects, the total momentum is the sum of the individual momenta. There is a peculiarity, however, in that momentum is a vector, involving both the direction and the magnitude of motion, so that the momenta of objects going in opposite directions can cancel to yield an overall sum of zero.</p>
                            
                            <p>Before launch, the total momentum of a rocket and its fuel is zero. During launch, the downward momentum of the expanding exhaust gases just equals in magnitude the upward momentum of the rising rocket, so that the total momentum of the system remains constant—in this case, at zero value. In a collision of two particles, the sum of the two momenta before collision is equal to their sum after collision. What momentum one particle loses, the other gains</p>
                            
                            <p>The law of conservation of momentum is abundantly confirmed by experiment and can even be mathematically deduced on the reasonable presumption that space is uniform—that is, that there is nothing in the laws of nature that singles out one position in space as peculiar compared with any other.</p>

                            <h3>Mass</h3>
                            <p>The mass of an object is a fundamental property of the object; a numerical measure of its inertia; a fundamental measure of the amount of matter in the object. Definitions of mass often seem circular because it is such a fundamental quantity that it is hard to define in terms of something else. All mechanical quantities can be defined in terms of mass, length, and time. The usual symbol for mass is m and its SI unit is the kilogram. While the mass is normally considered to be an unchanging property of an object, at speeds approaching the speed of light one must consider the increase in the relativistic mass.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Weight</h3>
                            <p>The weight of an object is the force of gravity on the object and may be defined as the mass times the acceleration of gravity, $w = mg$. Since the weight is a force, its SI unit is the newton. Density is mass/volume.</p>
                            <p>For an object in free fall, so that gravity is the only force acting on it, then the expression for weight follows from Newton's second law.</p>

                            <p>The turning effect of a force is known as the moment. It is the product of the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the pivot or point where the object will turn.</p>

                            <p>When undoing a nut fastened to a screw by hand one realises that the amount of force required is a lot greater than when undoing the same nut using a spanner. The spanner increases the distance between the fulcrum and the line of action of the force, thus for the same force a greater moment is obtained.</p>

                            <h3>Principle of Moments</h3>
                            <p>The principle of moments states that when in equilibrium the total sum of the anti-clockwise moment is equal to the total sum of the clockwise moment.</p>
                            <p>When a system is stable or balance it is said to be in equilibrium as all the forces acting on the system cancel each other out.</p>
