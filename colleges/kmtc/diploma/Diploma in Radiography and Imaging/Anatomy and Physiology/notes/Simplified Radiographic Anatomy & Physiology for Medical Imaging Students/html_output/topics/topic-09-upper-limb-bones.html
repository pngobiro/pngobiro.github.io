                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The humerus is the bone of the arm, it extends between the scapula proximally and the radius and ulna distally. The proximal end of the humerus consists of head, anatomical neck, and surgical neck, greater and lesser tubercles. The head is a rounded, smooth area faces medially, it articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint). The anatomical neck is smooth groove surrounds the articular margin of the smooth area of the head. The Greater tubercle is an expanded bony area located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus. The Lesser tubercle is located on the anterior aspect of the proximal humerus. There is a narrow groove passing between the greater and lesser tubercles known as The intertubercular groove or (bicipital groove) it provides passage for the biceps brachii muscle tendon. The surgical neck is located at the expanded region at the base of the proximal end of the humerus; it represents the connection between the head and the shaft of the humerus, it is a common site of fractures.<br>
                            The shaft of the humerus is almost triangular in cut section with 3 surfaces; the anteromedial and the anterolateral surfaces which are separated by a line drawn as a continuation of the crest of the greater tubercle. The third surface is the posterior surface which is located between the medial and lateral borders; there is a roughened, V-shaped area at the lateral side in the midshaft of the humerus known as the deltoid tuberosity, it is the site of attachment for the deltoid muscle. There is a shallow oblique spiral groove found on the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus known as the radial sulcus, it is the groove for the passage of the radial nerve and deep vessels.<br>
                            The distal end of the humerus becomes flattened with prominent bony projections on the medial and lateral sides known as medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus, with lateral epicondyle is smaller than the medial epicondyle of the humerus. There are roughened bony ridges located above the lateral and medial epicondyles known as the lateral and medial supracondylar ridges, they are areas of attachment for the muscles of the forearm, wrist, and hand. The medial epicondyle give attachment for the strong grasping muscles of the anterior forearm, thus it is larger and more prominent than the lateral epicondyle which gives attachment for the weaker muscles of the posterior forearm (Figure 9.2).<br>
                            There are two articulation areas on the distal end of the humerus joining the radius and ulna to form the elbow joint, the medial area is known as the trochlea, it is pulley shaped structure articulates with the ulna. The lateral area is known as the capitulum it is a knob-like structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus, it articulates with the radius. There are two small depressions located superior to the trochlea and capitulum; these depressions accommodate the radius and ulna during full flexion of the elbow joint. The coronoid fossa is located superior to the trochlea, it receives the coronoid process of the ulna, and the radial fossa is located superior to the capitulum, it receives the head of the radius during flexion of the elbow joint. On the posterior surface of the distal end of the humerus there is a bony depression known as the olecranon fossa, it receives the olecranon process of the ulna during full extension of the forearm (Figure 9.3).</p>

                            <p>Radius and ulna are the bones of the forearm. They extend from the elbow proximally to the wrist distally.</p>

                            <h3 id="radius">The Radius:</h3>
                            <p>It is the lateral of the two bones of the forearm; it extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna. The proximal end of the radius is a disc-shaped structure known as the head of the radius. The superior surface of the head of the radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, and the lateral margin of the head of the radius articulates with a shallow depression on the medial side of the proximal ulna known as the radial notch of the ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. A narrow region lies immediately distal to the radial head known as the neck of the radius. Inferiorly there an oval-shaped, bony protuberance acts as a muscular attachment point located on the medial side of the radius known as the radial tuberosity. On the medial side of the shaft of the radius there is small ridge forms the interosseous border of the radius, it is for the attachment of interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane is a sheet of dense connective tissue extends between the radius and ulna to unite these two bones. The distal end of the radius expands to form a rectangular end; it has two smooth facets, for articulation with the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones at the radiocarpal joint or wrist joint. On the medial surface of the distal end of the radius, there is shallow concavity known as the ulnar notch of the radius, it articulates with the head of the ulna, to form the distal radioulnar joint. The lateral side of the distal end of the radius has a projection known as the styloid process of the radius; it provides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint.</p>

                            <h3 id="ulna">The Ulna:</h3>
                            <p>It is the medial bone of the forearm; it extends, parallel to the radius, from the medial side of the elbow to the medial side of the wrist. At the proximal end of the ulna there is wrench shaped area known as the trochlear notch, it articulates with the trochlea of the humerus at the medial side of the elbow joint. The lower margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney prominence known as the coronoid process, and the upper margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney tip extends from the olecranon process which form the posterior and superior portions of the proximal ulna.<br>
                            Inferior to the trochlear notch there is a roughened area known as the ulnar tuberosity, it is the attachment area for brachialis muscle. Inferolateral to the trochlear notch, is the location of radial notch of the ulna, it is the articulation site between the proximal radius and ulna, to form the proximal radioulnar joint.<br>
                            On the lateral side of the shaft of the ulna, there is a ridge for the attachment of the interosseous membrane of the forearm, it is known as the interosseous border of the ulna. At the distal end of the ulna there is small, rounded bony prominence known as the head of the ulna. On the posterior side of the head of the ulna there is short bony projection known as the styloid process of the ulna, it serves as an attachment point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the radius and ulna. The styloid process of the radius is more prominent compared to the styloid process of the ulna; thereby it limits lateral deviation movement of the wrist joint (Figures 9.4 & 9.5).</p>

                            <p>The Scaphoid: is the boat-shaped carpal bone (Figure 9.8), it is the first and largest carpal bone on the radial side at the proximal row. It articulates with the radius proximally, trapezoid and trapezium laterally, lunate and capitate medially (Figures 9.6 & 9.7). The scaphoid is the most frequently fractured carpal bone, because of its connections with the two rows of carpal bones.</p>

Lunate is a crescent-shaped carpal bone with a convex proximal articular facet and a concave distal articular facet (Figure 9.9). It is situated in the center of the proximal row of the carpal bones, and articulates with radius proximally, the capitate distally, scaphoid laterally and Triquetrum medially (Figures 9.6 & 9.7). The lunate is the most frequently dislocated carpal bone.</p>

                            <p>Trapezium: as the Greek word (trapezion) means "a little table", the name trapezium mean the bone that looks like a table, it is a four-sided carpal bone with multiple articulation surfaces (Figure 9.12). The trapezium articulates with the scaphoid proximally, the trapezoid and second metacarpal medially, and first metacarpal distally. Trapezium articulation with the first metacarpal is saddle-shaped and is responsible for thumb opposition and movement (Figure 9.6).</p>

                            <p>Hamate: as the Latin word (hamulus) means "a little hook" Hamate means hooked bone. Hamate is a wedge-shaped bone with a hook-like process known as the hook of hamate (Figure 9.14), Hamate is situated on the medial side of the distal row of carpal bones. It articulates with lunate, triquetrum, capitate beside the fourth and fifth metacarpals (Figure 9.6).</p>

                            <p>Capitate: the name Capitate is derived from the Latin word caput, which means "head" (Figure 9.15). Capitate is a head-shaped bone situated in the center of the distal row of carpal bones. It is the most central and largest carpal bone, capitate articulates with scaphoid and lunate proximally, hamate medially, trapezoid laterally, second and third carpals distally (Figure 9.6).</p>
