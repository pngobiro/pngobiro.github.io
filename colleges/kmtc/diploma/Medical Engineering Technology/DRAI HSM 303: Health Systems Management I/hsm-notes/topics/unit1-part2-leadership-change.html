                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is important to understand the difference between management and leadership. While management deals with the administrative aspects of a manager's work (planning, organizing, monitoring), leadership deals with the interpersonal aspects (inspiration, motivation, influence).</p>
                        <p>Qualities of both a manager and a leader are necessary. While performing managerial or administrative roles (planning, organizing and controlling), managers are often called upon to take up leadership roles that deal with the interpersonal aspects of their job (inspiration, motivation, influence) that may have a long-lasting impact on individuals and the group.</p>
                        <p>A manager without leadership skills is an administrator, while a creative, far-sighted leader who is unable to implement a vision (without managerial skills) will confuse and lose the team. There may be only one or two designated leaders in an organization, such as the director or team leader, but leadership qualities can be found in many others within the team.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, the managers must perform both leadership and management functions. The major responsibilities of a manager are to operate and maintain the organization efficiently, ensuring that it provides useful services to clients and the community. Managers tend to be problem-solvers, seeking better ways to use their resources to get the job done. Effective managers bring order and consistency to programmes.</p>
                        <p>Leaders, on the other hand, are pathfinders; they branch out more in their thinking. They are concerned with building the organization for the future, providing direction, securing new resources, developing new capacities, preparing the organization to meet challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities, adapting to change, and networking.</p>
                        <p>In summary:</p>

Early leadership theories focused on what qualities distinguished between leaders and followers, while subsequent theories looked at other variables such as situational factors and skill levels. While many different leadership theories have emerged, most can be classified as one of eight major types:</p>

If particular traits are key features of leadership, then how do we explain people who possess those qualities but are not leaders? This question is one of the difficulties in using trait theories to explain leadership.</p>

                        <p>Management theories, also known as transactional theories, focus on the role of supervision, organization and group performance.

Managerial theories are often used in business; when employees are successful, they are rewarded; when they fail, they are reprimanded or punished.</p>

                        <p>Organizations are designed to fit the environment in which they operate at a given time. Their environments are constantly changing in varying degrees. Change is therefore inevitable in any organization that seeks to maintain its relevance. Managers deal with many organized groups representing various interests. Most of these groups exert power over operations of organizations. While they may be able to do little or nothing to change these forces, it is nevertheless up to the manager to anticipate and integrate these various forces that are bound to affect his operations.</p>
                        <p>Different types of change require different strategies to implement the change successfully. Managers must anticipate changes in the environment that will require future adjustments in the organizations designs. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and at the level of the individual.</p>

Change management means to plan, initiate, realize, control and finally stabilize change processes, whether corporate or personal.

                        <p>Change is the continuous adaptation of corporate strategies and structures to changing external conditions. It may take several forms, as described below:</p>
                        <p><strong>Developmental Change</strong> Developmental change occurs when an organization makes an improvement to its current way of doing business. If an organization decided to improve its processes, methods or performance standards, this would be considered developmental change.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transformational Change</strong> Transformational change occurs after the transition period. Transformational change may involve both developmental and transitional change, and it is common for the two types to occur in tandem. This happens mainly when organizations are faced with the emergence of radically different technologies, significant changes in supply and demand, unexpected competition, lack of revenue, or other major shifts in how they do business. Formal changes are the responses of an organization to major internal forces and external pressures (change drivers).</p>

                        <p>Team building is a philosophy of job design in which employees are viewed as members of interdependent teams instead of as individual workers. Team building refers to a wide range of activities, presented to businesses, schools, sports teams, religious or nonprofit organizations designed for improving team performance.</p>
                        <p>Team building is pursued via a variety of practices, and can range from simple bonding exercises to complex simulations and multi-day team building retreats designed to develop a team (including group assessment and group-dynamic games), usually falling somewhere in between. It generally sits within the theory and practice of organizational development, but can also be applied to sports teams, school groups, and other contexts.</p>
                        <p>Team building is not to be confused with "team recreation" that consists of activities for teams that are strictly recreational. Team building can also be seen in day-to-day operations of an organization and team dynamic can be improved through successful leadership. Team building is said to have benefits of self-development, positive communication, leadership skills and the ability to work closely together as a team to solve problems.</p>
                        <p>Work environments tend to focus on individuals and personal goals, with reward & recognition singling out the achievements of individual employees. Team building can also refer to the process of selecting or creating a team from scratch</p>
