                        <p>Definition of Demand: It is the need and ability and willingness to pay for a commodity - The schedule of amounts of any product that buyer will purchase at different prices during some Stated time period.</p>
                        <p>Desire: refers to people's willingness to own a good. Demand is the amount of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price.</p>
                        <p>Definition Supply: the amounts of a good producer are willing and able to sell at a given price. For many people the word market conjures up a picture of a town square with lots of small stall holders selling everything from fruit and vegetables to meat and fish. For economists, the term has a much wider meaning. It is used to describe any process of exchange between buyers and sellers.</p>
                        <p>Formally, a market can be defined as any set of arrangements which allows buyers and sellers to communicate and thus arrange exchange of goods, services or resources. A free market is where such exchange occurs without interference from the government.</p>
                        <p>Information is a vital ingredient for any market. Both buyers and sellers need to have access to sufficient information to allow them to make rational decisions. So a market for health care must involve two groups: the buyers and the sellers, who interact to trade health care. Who would the buyers and sellers be in such a market? We all want good health and so most of us would be prepared, if necessary, to purchase medical treatment to cure an illness. This suggests that everybody is potentially a buyer (or consumer) of health care. More precisely, at any moment, a buyer would be any body who was ill or who wanted preventative medical treatment such as vaccination or who wanted guidance about their health. The sellers would be those people who could provide medical and health care services, such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists and high street chemists.</p>
                        <p>The concept of supply and demand analysis helps to understand exactly how this spending of money operates in a market system. The answers to these and a thousand other questions can be found in the theory of supply and demand. This theory shows how consumer preferences determine consumer demand for commodities, while business costs underpin the supply of commodities. Finally, we will see how supply and demand are brought into balance by the movement of prices - by the prices.</p>

                        <p>When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. At this point, the allocation of goods is at its most efficient because the amount of goods being supplied is exactly the same as the amount of goods being demanded. Thus, everyone (individuals, firms, or countries) is satisfied with the current economic condition. At the given price, suppliers are selling all the goods that they have produced and consumers are getting all the goods that they are demanding.</p>

As far as government spending is concerned, the Ministry of Finance sets three year budget ceilings for each sector in Kenya. In practical terms this means that the Ministry of Health creates a budget based on what the Ministry of Finance has said it will allocate for health expenditures rather than submitting a budget request based on actual needs. The Ministry of Health then disburses the funds it receives through its District Health Management Boards.

The constitution requires the executive to raise and allocate resources for government projects within this rigorous budget process. The Budget cycle is based on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) cycle. The MTEF process prioritizes definition of a global resource envelope, determination of inter-sectoral allocations based on core functions and proposals of inter-sectoral allocations based on outcomes, activities and outputs. Public hearings and involvement of private and civil society in the budget preparation enhances transparency.</p>
                        <p>The MTEF process revolves around the activities of ten MTEF sectors, including the human resource development sector. To guide the preparation of MTEF, the Ministry of Finance issues to all ministries, departments and government agencies in August a circular detailing the guidelines with objectives for the financial year. The Circular-Budget preparation guidelines for budget 2010-11 for example directed that the preparation of the budget for the next MTEF period should be within the context of stimulating growth and creating jobs, reducing poverty and enhancing food security, and protecting the poor and most vulnerable of the society while improving government efficiency in delivering services.</p>
                        <p>The budget is prepared through Sector Working Groups (SWGs) comprising different ministries, departments, and agencies. The overall fiscal and macroeconomic framework-including strategies, outlook and forecast - determines the role of ministerial working groups (MWGs). The Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MoPHS) and the Ministry of Medical Services (MoMS) both appoint representatives to the ministerial working group who then work within the SWG. The two ministries fall under the human resource development sector.</p>
                        <p>The Sector Working Groups are urged to ensure that they only consider proposals for funding that support the achievement of the objectives and priorities outlined in the Medium Term Strategy of Vision 2030. The Circular from the Ministry of Finance encourages the involvement of districts and other stakeholders in the MTEF budget process through the sector hearings. The purpose of the Sector Hearings is to ensure transparent discussions of priorities of government for the next financial year with key stakeholders including development partners, civil society, private sector and research institutions.</p>
                        <p>Financial management is the process of achieving the organization's objectives in an efficient manner through planning (budgeting), acquiring, organizing, directing monitoring, controlling and reporting.</p>
