                        <p>A manager is a person who has the responsibility for achieving certain outcomes, along with the authority to utilize the resources of the organization in doing so. The combination of responsibility and authority is crucial to the concept of management. Timeliness is another critical aspect. The timely use of the resources - whether human, financial, information or physical assets - is essential for effective management. In an ideal management team, the team members recognize the authority of the manager and provide support in a constructive way.</p>
                        <p>A manager is therefore a person who can organize people to work together harmoniously and make effective use of resources to achieve laid-down objectives, through a process that includes planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A distinction should be made between a manager who is a leader, and one who is an administrator. Administration is a subset of management. An administrator is somebody who interprets policies and directives from above for implementation, knows the rules and applies them well. The administrator and the manager do not have to be different people.</p>

In a well-managed organization, all staff members have two responsibilities - to do their job and to improve their work processes. It is upon the management to direct and support staff in realizing these responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>A health system is managed by a team and will be most productive and efficient if the team focuses on technique - the way the team members work together, the methods through which services are delivered. It is very easy to focus on what you do. It is more important to focus on why you do it. Today the paradigm of health care is becoming more clientcentred, a concept that leads to demands for client-oriented, health promoting and higher quality health care services. Thus managers need to keep focused on the population for whom they are working to reduce suffering and mortality caused by disease. Continuous improvement is at the heart of process management.</p>

                        <p>The Administrative theory was developed by a French top Management specialist called Henri Fayol, (1841-1925). The theory emerged in 1916 and it emphasized the perspective of senior managers within the organization. Taylor argued that management was a profession and could be taught.</p>
                        <p>Fayol in his contribution, defined management as comprising of five (5) elements. These are:</p>

                        <p>Basic principles of management were set out by Henry Fayol (1841-1925), a French management theorist who developed one of the first comprehensive statements of a general theory of management. <span class="math-inline">$^1$</span> Still relevant today, the 14 principles Fayol articulated are:</p> <!-- Assuming superscript is inline math -->
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Division of work: The specialization of the workforce according to the skills a person has, creating specific personal and professional development within the labour force and therefore increasing productivity; leads to specialization, which increases the efficiency of labour. By separating a small part of work, the workers' speed and accuracy in its performance increases. This principle is applicable to both technical and managerial work.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Authority and responsibility: The issue of commands followed by responsibility for their consequences. Authority means the right of a superior to give orders to subordinates; responsibility means obligation for performance. This principle suggests that there must be parity between authority and responsibility. They go together and are two sides of the same coin.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Discipline: Discipline refers to obedience, proper conduct in relation to others, respect of authority, etc. It is essential for the smooth functioning of all organizations.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Unity of command: This principle states that every subordinate should receive orders and be accountable to one and only one superior. If an employee receives orders from more than one superior, it is likely to create confusion and conflict. Unity of command also makes it easier to fi x responsibility for mistakes.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Unity of direction: All those working in the same line of activity must understand and pursue the same objectives. All related activities should be put under one group, there should be one plan of action for them, and they should be under the control of one manager. Unity of action seeks to ensure a focus of efforts and coordination of strength.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Subordination of individual interest: The management must put aside personal considerations and put company objectives first. Therefore the interests of the goals of the organization must prevail over the personal interests of individuals.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Remuneration: Workers must be paid sufficiently as this is one of the chief motivations of employment and therefore greatly influences productivity. The quantum and methods of remuneration payable should be fair, reasonable and rewarding of effort.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The degree of centralization: The amount of power wielded within the central management depends on company size. Centralization implies the concentration of decision making authority at the top management. Sharing of authority with lower levels is called decentralization. The organization should strive to achieve a proper balance.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Scalar chain: Scalar chain refers to the chain of superiors ranging from top management to the lowest rank. The principle suggests that there should be a clear line of authority from top to bottom linking all managers at all levels. It is considered a chain of command. It involves a concept called a "gang plank", through which a subordinate may contact a superior or the superior's superior in case of an emergency, defying the hierarchy of control. However, the immediate superiors must be informed about the matter.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Order: Social order ensures the fluid operation of a company through authoritative procedure. Material order ensures safety and efficiency in the workplace.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Equity: Employees must be treated kindly, and justice must be enacted to ensure a just workplace. Managers should be fair and impartial when dealing with employees.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Stability of tenure of personnel: The period of service should not be too short and employees should not be moved from positions frequently. An employee who is removed before becoming accustomed to the assigned work cannot render useful service.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Initiative: Tapping into the initiative of employees can add strength and new ideas to an organization. Initiative on the part of employees is a source of strength for the organization because it provides new and better ideas. Employees who know their ideas are respected are likely to take greater interest in the functioning of the organization.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Esprit de corps: This refers to the need of managers to develop and ensure morale in the workplace, individually and communally. Team spirit helps develop an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding. These can be used to initiate and aid the processes of change, organization, decision making, skill management and the overall view of the management function.</span></li>

                        <p>Leading is the process of influencing people, that is, personnel, followers so that they could contribute to the goals of the organization or group. Leadership on the other hand is the interpersonal influence, exercised in situations and directed through the communication process towards the organizational goals. It is concerned with guiding others or activities of followers/subordinates towards the pre-determined objectives/goals. A leader/manager must use influence (positive) to achieve the set objectives or goals.</p>
                        <p>However, there are as many definitions of leadership as there are people who have attempted to define it. One common theme that runs through each of them is the ability of an individual to inspire confidence and to provide support to members of a group to achieve the programme objectives.</p>
                        <p>Leadership is a process or ability to influence the behaviour of others, to motivate and mobilize others to work together and achieve a common aim. It is a way of focusing and motivating a group of people to enable them to achieve their own aims and develop themselves. It also involves being accountable and responsible for the group as a whole. Leadership comprises three factors: the leader, the people, and the situation or conditions. Thus leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail in the programme or organization.</p>
