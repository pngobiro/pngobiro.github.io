\section*{UNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Concepts of leadership and management}

Leadership and management are often regarded as interchangeable which is not the case. While the most effective managers are usually also good leaders, this is not necessarily the case. Nor is a good leader always a good manager.

\section*{Management}

Originally, the term management comes from Latin word "manus" referring to the driver controlling a team of horses pulling a cart. This image helps us in considering other definitions. The examples of definitions of management as defined differently by different scholars are that, it is the;
- Process of getting things done through other people (in simple terms).
- Process through which resources in an organization are made available and effectively used in accomplishing the organizational goals.
- Process of working with and through individual and groups and other resources to accomplish organizational goals or objectives.
- Planning, organizing, co-ordinating, commanding and controlling.
- Process of creating and maintaining of an internal environment of an organization in which individuals and groups perform effectively towards the attainment of the organization goals.
- Process of integrating (bring together) all the organizational aspects for instance the structure, people and technology in order to achieve the organizational goals.
It should be noted that, the definitions of management are non-exhaustive, they vary greatly because of the nature, and types of organizations in terms of products produced or services rendered. However, the most important elements in most definitions are: -
- Process
- Resources
- Utilization and
- Goals

Management is important because it enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization's performance. It involves planning, leading, organizing and controlling an organization, as well as more the intangible qualities of inspiration and motivation. Regarding management as a process helps to ensure that operations achieve their objectives and that essential health systems are improved - the operational aspect of management.

\section*{Who Is a Manager and What Are Their Roles?}

A manager is a person who has the responsibility for achieving certain outcomes, along with the authority to utilize the resources of the organization in doing so. The combination of responsibility and authority is crucial to the concept of management. Timeliness is another critical aspect. The timely use of the resources - whether human, financial, information or physical assets - is essential for effective management. In an ideal management team, the team members recognize the authority of the manager and provide support in a constructive way.

A manager is therefore a person who can organize people to work together harmoniously and make effective use of resources to achieve laid-down objectives, through a process that
includes planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. A distinction should be made between a manager who is a leader, and one who is an administrator. Administration is a subset of management. An administrator is somebody who interprets policies and directives from above for implementation, knows the rules and applies them well. The administrator and the manager do not have to be different people.

\section*{Process Management}

Process management means documenting processes (the way work should be done in the organization), measuring the results of that work as seen by the end users, target populations and policy makers, and taking corrective action if results don't meet expectations. In a well-managed organization, all staff members have two responsibilities - to do their job and to improve their work processes. It is upon the management to direct and support staff in realizing these responsibilities.
A health system is managed by a team and will be most productive and efficient if the team focuses on technique - the way the team members work together, the methods through which services are delivered. It is very easy to focus on what you do. It is more important to focus on why you do it. Today the paradigm of health care is becoming more clientcentred, a concept that leads to demands for client-oriented, health promoting and higher quality health care services. Thus managers need to keep focused on the population for whom they are working to reduce suffering and mortality caused by disease. Continuous improvement is at the heart of process management.

\section*{THEORIES OF MANAGEMENT}

There are various management theories as listed below:
- Classical management.
- Human Relations
- Situational/Contingency.
- Management by Objectives
- Systems approach to management
- Bureaucratic Management

\section*{Classical approach}

This approach was developed between 1900 and 1910 and extended through to early 1950s. The theory had 3 branches. These are:
- Scientific Management
- Administrative/Principles of Management
- Bureaucratic Management

\section*{Scientific management theory}

This is a technique of management whereby the work methods are scientifically studied and standards established. It is a philosophy about the relationship between the people and work not technique or efficiency device.
The scientific Management approach was developed by an American engineer called Frederick Winslow Taylor, (1856-1915). He came up with this theory because the systematic approach (formally used) failed to lead to widespread production efficiency. He discovered that:
- Production and pay were poor.
- Inefficiency and waste were common.
- Many companies had unused potential.

\section*{Principles of Scientific management theory}

The scientific management theory has 4 principles. These are: -
- Developing scientific methods of designing jobs to replace the rule of thumb methods. This involves collecting and analyzing data to arrive at the best way of performing tasks or series of tasks.
- The Scientific selection and progressive teaching and developing employees to improve performance.
- Integrating scientifically selected employees and developed methods of designing jobs. The Scientific methods of job design should be well explained by management to reduce resistance.
- A division of work resulting in the interdependence between management and workers. Taylor believed that if they were truly dependent on one another, then co-operation would naturally follow.

\section*{NOTE:}
1. Scientific management theory emphasized on specialization and division of labour.
2. Taylor and other scientific management pioneers believed that employees could be motivated by economic rewards, provided those rewards were related to individual performance. "The more you work the more you earn".

\section*{Limitations of scientific management}

These are:
- Simplistic motivational assumptions.
- Workers were viewed as part of machine.
- Exploitation of labour.
- Ignored relationship between the organizations and its environment.
- Excluded senior management tasks.

These limitations prompted the development of administrative management theory.

\section*{Administrative/principles of management theory}

It is also referred to as principles of management. This type of management places emphasis on the members of the organization usually referred to as "body corporate", that is, the personnel or employees.
The Administrative theory was developed by a French top Management specialist called Henri Fayol, (1841-1925). The theory emerged in 1916 and it emphasized the perspective of senior managers within the organization. Taylor argued that management was a profession and could be taught.
Fayol in his contribution, defined management as comprising of five (5) elements. These are:
- Planning
- Organizing
- Commanding
- Coordinating and
- Controlling

In addition, Fayol stated 14 principles that he wanted them applied flexibly. These are:
- Division of work - Divide work into specialized tasks (elements) and assign responsibility to specific individual.
- Authority - Delegate authority a long with responsibility (workers are given the right to command to get the work done).
- Discipline - Rules and regulations should be enforced fairly and judiciously. There should be well- defined procedures of dealing with disciplinary matters.
- Unity of command - Each employee should be assigned to only one supervisor, otherwise conflict and confusion in authority and instructions would result.
- Unity of direction - The principle of Fayol states that "there should be one head and one plan "for group of activities/tasks having the same objectives. For example, the personnel department should have only one personnel officer with a specified plan for personnel policies, feeding personnel in all departments of the organization.
- Subordination of individual interest to organization interest - Interests of the organization must take priority over the interests of an individual or a group, whenever there is a conflict between the two.
- Remuneration of employees -All workers should be fairly paid with appropriate additional incentives for additional efforts.
- Centralization - All major policy formulation and decisions should be made at the top management level (central point).
- Scalar chain - Communication should follow the formal channel in the hierarchy. Keep the communication within the chain of command.
- Order - Place for everything and everything in its place.
- Equity - Fair discipline and order enhance employee commitment. Managers should be fair and friendly to subordinates and they should exercise impartiality.
- Initiative - Encourage employees to act on their own in support of the organization's direction regardless of the mistakes made.
- Esprit de corps

Promote a unity of interests between employees and management. Workers should work as a team.
- Stability of staff/tenure of employees

Employee turnover should be minimized. Tenure and long term commitment should be encouraged. It results in a sense of belonging to organization giving rise to dedication and better outcome/results/output.
Although in his contributions, management was viewed as a profession that could be trained and developed, emphasized the broad policy aspect of top - level managers and offered universal management prescriptions, it had limitation: -

\section*{Limitation}

The universal prescriptions need qualifications for environmental, technological and personnel factors.

\section*{Bureaucratic management theory}

It was developed by a German Sociologist, Lawyer and Historian called Max Weber (18641924). He was interested in the work of Taylor. His theory was based on authority structures (hierarchy) of a form of an organization. He was specifically concerned with the administration, that is, how the organizations are structured in terms of "who is responsible for who or to who along with the activities to be carried out. He thought bureaucracy would be:
i) Fairer
ii) More impartial and
iii) More rational

\section*{Characteristics of bureaucratic theory}
- Workers are selected and promoted on the basis of technical competence and experience (merit).
- A system of rules covering the duties and rights of employees that must be adhered to.
- Well defined hierarchy of authority.
- A division of labour by functional specialization.
- A system of procedures for dealing with work situations.
- Job- holders are expected to be impartial, that is, practice fairness and no favourism.

\section*{Limitations}

The shortcomings to this theory are:
- It had limited organizational flexibility and it is slow in decision making.
- It ignores the importance of people and interpersonal relations.
- It accumulates power that could result in authoritarian management.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Rules may become ends in themselves.
- Difficult to dismantle once established.
- Too much specialization that could result, for example, patient to die in hospital if the person assigned to that responsibility is not there.

These limitations come because of the complexity of organizations. It is better for small organizations, although it is mainly applied in the government organizations.
Bureaucratic theory served to fit the traditional organizations which were less innovative in their operations and later around 1930's, human relations theory was developed to look at the human aspect of the organization.

\section*{Human relation theory}

The theory was developed by Professor Elton Mayo around 1930s and it was backed up by A. Maslow, Mcgregor (1960), Hersberg, Likert, Argyris and Chester Bernard (1938).

\section*{Management Functions}

Managerial work consists of a number of well-defined but interrelated functions (see Figure 1 below):
- Planning: Working in a broad outline of the things that need to be done and the methods for doing them to accomplish the purpose set for organization.
- Organizing: At the senior most level, establishing the formal structure of an organization through which work subdivisions are arranged, defined and coordinated for the whole organization; at lower levels carrying out similar functions for the specific department or division.
- Guiding: On an ongoing basis, making decisions, embodying them in specific general orders and instructions, and serving as a leader of the organization.
- Controlling: Coordinating, monitoring, evaluating, and supervising.

\section*{Management by Objectives}

In this management approach the manager sets clear objectives to be realized. This is repeated in every department in the organization to help realize the broad organizational goal. As noted earlier in Chapter 4 on planning, objectives must be SMART so as to ensure the organization realizes its objectives. To recap, SMART refers to:
- Specific: The objective is exact, distinct and clearly stated. Vague language or generalities are not results. It identifies the nature of expected changes, the target, region, etc. It should be as detailed as possible without being wordy.
- Measurable: The objective is measurable qualitatively and/or quantitatively.
- Achievable: The objective is achievable with the human and financial resources available.
- Realistic: The objective addresses specific, recognized challenges and is within mandate.
- Time-bound: The objective is to be achieved in a stated time-frame or planning period Principles of Management
Basic principles of management were set out by Henry Fayol (1841-1925), a French management theorist who developed one of the first comprehensive statements of a general theory of management. ${ }^{1}$ Still relevant today, the 14 principles Fayol articulated are:
- Division of work: The specialization of the workforce according to the skills a person has, creating specific personal and professional development within the labour force and therefore increasing productivity; leads to specialization, which increases the efficiency of labour. By separating a small part of work, the workers' speed and accuracy in its performance increases. This principle is applicable to both technical and managerial work.
- Authority and responsibility: The issue of commands followed by responsibility for their consequences. Authority means the right of a superior to give orders to subordinates; responsibility means obligation for performance. This principle suggests that there must be parity between authority and responsibility. They go together and are two sides of the same coin.
- Discipline: Discipline refers to obedience, proper conduct in relation to others, respect of authority, etc. It is essential for the smooth functioning of all organizations.
- Unity of command: This principle states that every subordinate should receive orders and be accountable to one and only one superior. If an employee receives orders from more than one superior, it is likely to create confusion and conflict. Unity of command also makes it easier to fi x responsibility for mistakes.
- Unity of direction: All those working in the same line of activity must understand and pursue the same objectives. All related activities should be put under one group, there should be one plan of action for them, and they should be under the control of one manager. Unity of action seeks to ensure a focus of efforts and coordination of strength.
- Subordination of individual interest: The management must put aside personal considerations and put company objectives first. Therefore the interests of the goals of the organization must prevail over the personal interests of individuals.
- Remuneration: Workers must be paid sufficiently as this is one of the chief motivations of employment and therefore greatly influences productivity. The quantum and methods of remuneration payable should be fair, reasonable and rewarding of effort.
- The degree of centralization: The amount of power wielded within the central management depends on company size. Centralization implies the concentration of decision making authority at the top management. Sharing of authority with lower levels is called decentralization. The organization should strive to achieve a proper balance.
- Scalar chain: Scalar chain refers to the chain of superiors ranging from top management to the lowest rank. The principle suggests that there should be a clear line of authority from top to bottom linking all managers at all levels. It is considered a chain of command. It involves a concept called a "gang plank", through which a subordinate may contact a superior or the superior's superior in case of an emergency, defying the hierarchy of control. However, the immediate superiors must be informed about the matter.
- Order: Social order ensures the fluid operation of a company through authoritative procedure. Material order ensures safety and efficiency in the workplace.
- Equity: Employees must be treated kindly, and justice must be enacted to ensure a just workplace. Managers should be fair and impartial when dealing with employees.
- Stability of tenure of personnel: The period of service should not be too short and employees should not be moved from positions frequently. An employee who is removed before becoming accustomed to the assigned work cannot render useful service.
- Initiative: Tapping into the initiative of employees can add strength and new ideas to an organization. Initiative on the part of employees is a source of strength for the organization because it provides new and better ideas. Employees who know their ideas are respected are likely to take greater interest in the functioning of the organization.
- Esprit de corps: This refers to the need of managers to develop and ensure morale in the workplace, individually and communally. Team spirit helps develop an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding. These can be used to initiate and aid the processes of change, organization, decision making, skill management and the overall view of the management function.

\section*{Managerial Roles}

Managers clearly have many functions and roles. These can be summarized into three basic categories:

\section*{Interpersonal roles:}
- Managers as leaders, providing guidance and motivation.
- Managers as liaison officers, maintaining a web of relationships with individuals and groups.
- Managers as disturbance handlers, deal with situations and change beyond their control

Informational roles:
- Managers as monitors, continually seeking and receiving information as a basis for action.
- Managers as disseminators, passing factual information to supervisors, colleagues and subordinates and transmitting value statements to guide subordinates in making decisions.
- Managers as spokespeople, transmitting information into their organization's environment.

\section*{Decision roles:}
- Managers as entrepreneurs, acting as initiators of controlled change in the organization.
- Managers as resource allocators, making choices about scheduling their own time, authorizing actions and allocating people and finance to projects or activities.
- Managers as negotiators with other organizations or individuals.

\section*{Management Skills}

For managers to be effective they require certain critical skills, including those in the list below. The skills may be used singly or in combination, depending on the situation and circumstances. They are:
- Computer skills
- Technical skills
- Human skills
- Communication skills
- Interpersonal skills

\section*{Leadership}

\section*{Definition:}

Leading is the process of influencing people, that is, personnel, followers so that they could contribute to the goals of the organization or group. Leadership on the other hand is the interpersonal influence, exercised in situations and directed through the communication process towards the organizational goals. It is concerned with guiding others or activities of followers/subordinates towards the pre-determined objectives/goals. A leader/manager must use influence (positive) to achieve the set objectives or goals.

However, there are as many definitions of leadership as there are people who have attempted to define it. One common theme that runs through each of them is the ability of an individual to inspire confidence and to provide support to members of a group to achieve the programme objectives.

Leadership is a process or ability to influence the behaviour of others, to motivate and mobilize others to work together and achieve a common aim. It is a way of focusing and motivating a group of people to enable them to achieve their own aims and develop themselves. It also involves being accountable and responsible for the group as a whole. Leadership comprises three factors: the leader, the people, and the situation or conditions. Thus leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail in the programme or organization.

\section*{Process of leading}

Leading involves various activities and not merely leading people. It comprises of:
- Planning
- Organizing
- Directing
- Delegating
- Reporting
- Staffing and
- Motivating people

\section*{Are Leaders Born or Made?}
- Some argue that leaders are born, while others hold that leaders are made. Whichever the case, the training of leaders - whether born or not - gives them skills that help them to become better leaders or managers.
- To maximize their potential individuals must begin to think of leadership in place of management, accountability in place of responsibility, job roles in place of job descriptions.
- To increase our leadership ability, we must expand ourselves. Leadership development is personal development. In order for us to understand ourselves, we must gather information; we must obtain the facts and data that tell us about ourselves. For individuals to maximize potential they must begin to think of leadership in place of management, of accountability in place of responsibility. They must begin to think of job roles in place of job descriptions
- Leadership is the art of inspiring followers to perform their duties willingly, competently and enthusiastically so as to achieve organizational objectives. Leadership is determined not only by the characteristics of the leader and the team, but also by the situations that prevail. A good leader has the ability to set direction and inspire others. The leader is willing to take risk, is creative and innovative, accountable and responsible. In a service-oriented organization, leadership determines the success or failure of the delivery of services. It provides inspiration and motivation for workers to perform.

\section*{Qualities of Good Leadership}

These are numerous, as the following list suggests:
- Vision: Good leaders have a vision of the future and lead their people to their vision. A vision must be shared or it will be useless.
- Creativity: A good leader is creative - able to come up with new ideas and ways of doing things.
- Awareness: Good leaders have the ability to perceive opportunities in the environment within which they are operating, to enable them to utilize the context to achieve the intended objectives.
- Initiative: This is exercised whenever effort is concentrated on a specific activity, to start something that was not going on before, to stop something that was occurring, or to shift the direction and character of the effort.
- Inquisitive: This is the ability to gain access to facts and data from people or other information sources. The quality of information may depend on a leader's thoroughness, keenness and commitment. A leader who is keen to learn as much as possible about work activities is more likely to gain quality information than one who ignores the need for enquiry.
- Supportive: A good leader is supportive to the led. The leader in return also gets support so that the vision and mission are realized.
- Advocacy: This means taking a position in support of a cause, e.g., creating awareness on cost sharing. A leader has the ability to convince or persuade, and is prepared to take a stand.
- Making decisions: This involves choosing or selecting from two or more courses of action. It may involve choosing an intervention or how best available resources can be effectively used.
- Critiquing: Good leaders are able to give (and accept) constructive critique and feedback. Management teams need to use the "Critique Approach" when conducting supervision, counselling and guidance of their subordinates.

\section*{Leadership Styles}

It is generally accepted that leadership style - that is, the way leadership ability is exercised can be grouped into fi ve ${ }^{3}$ categories:
- Autocratic/dictatorship: Autocratic leaders use their legitimate authority to suppress their followers in order to realize their own goals.
- Democratic: Democratic leadership is about majority rule; the leader goes by the decision of the majority. The weakness of this type of leadership is that the minority are suppressed and their views are rarely heard.
- Laissez-faire: This is a leadership style in which the leader provides minimal direction and gives employees power to determine goals, make decisions and resolve problems on their own. This style can be effective when employees are highly skilled, experienced, self-motivated and well educated. Otherwise, it can result in chaos.
- Paternalistic: These leaders act as fathers to their followers.
- Charismatic leadership: The leader has a magnetic personality that in itself attracts people and instils loyalty. This type of leader is normally referred to as a born leader.

\section*{Leadership Skills}

As might be surmised from the previous section, leadership involves the following important skills:
- Getting and giving information
- Understanding group needs and characteristics
- Knowing and understanding group resources
- Controlling the group
- Counselling
- Setting the example
- Representing the group
- Planning
- Evaluating - progress, performance, people
- Sharing leadership
- Managing learning

The Difference between Managers and Leaders

It is important to understand the difference between management and leadership. While management deals with the administrative aspects of a manager's work (planning, organizing, monitoring), leadership deals with the interpersonal aspects (inspiration, motivation, influence).
Qualities of both a manager and a leader are necessary. While performing managerial or administrative roles (planning, organizing and controlling), managers are often called upon to take up leadership roles that deal with the interpersonal aspects of their job (inspiration, motivation, influence) that may have a long-lasting impact on individuals and the group.
A manager without leadership skills is an administrator, while a creative, far-sighted leader who is unable to implement a vision (without managerial skills) will confuse and lose the team. There may be only one or two designated leaders in an organization, such as the director or team leader, but leadership qualities can be found in many others within the team.
Clearly, the managers must perform both leadership and management functions. The major responsibilities of a manager are to operate and maintain the organization efficiently, ensuring that it provides useful services to clients and the community. Managers tend to be problem-solvers, seeking better ways to use their resources to get the job done. Effective managers bring order and consistency to programmes.
Leaders, on the other hand, are pathfinders; they branch out more in their thinking. They are concerned with building the organization for the future, providing direction, securing new resources, developing new capacities, preparing the organization to meet challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities, adapting to change, and networking.

In summary:
- Management is a science; leadership is an art.
- Managers manage things; leaders lead people.
- Managers run institutions; leaders build institutions.
- Managers are busy; leaders make time.

\section*{Theories of leadership}

Theories of leadership Interest in leadership increased during the early part of the twentieth century. Early leadership theories focused on what qualities distinguished between leaders and followers, while subsequent theories looked at other variables such as situational factors and skill levels. While many different leadership theories have emerged, most can be classified as one of eight major types:

\section*{1. Great Man Theories:}

Great man theories assume that the capacity for leadership is inherent - that great leaders are born, not made. These theories often portray great leaders as heroic, mythic and destined to rise to leadership when needed. The term "Great Man" was used because, at the time, leadership was thought of primarily as a male quality, especially in terms of military leadership.

\section*{2. Trait Theories:}

Similar in some ways to "Great Man" theories, trait theories assume that people inherit certain qualities and traits that make them better suited to leadership. Trait theories often identify particular personality or behavioral characteristics shared by leaders. If particular traits are key features of leadership, then how do we explain people who possess those qualities but are not leaders? This question is one of the difficulties in using trait theories to explain leadership.
3. Contingency Theories:

Contingency theories of leadership focus on particular variables related to the environment that might determine which particular style of leadership is best suited for the situation. According to this theory, no leadership style is best in all situations. Success depends upon a number of variables, including the leadership style, qualities of the followers and aspects of the situation.
4. Situational Theories:

Situational theories propose that leaders choose the best course of action based upon situational variables. Different styles of leadership may be more appropriate for certain types of decisionmaking. For example, in a situation where the leader is the most knowledgeable and experienced member of a group, an authoritarian style might be most appropriate. In other instances where group members are skilled experts, a democratic style would be more effective.

\section*{5. Behavioral Theories:}

Behavioral theories of leadership are based upon the belief that great leaders are made, not born. Rooted in behaviorism, this leadership theory focuses on the actions of leaders not on mental qualities or internal states. According to this theory, people can learn to become leaders through teaching and observation.

\section*{6. Participative Theories:}

Participative leadership theories suggest that the ideal leadership style is one that takes the input of others into account. These leaders encourage participation and contributions from group members and help group members feel more relevant and committed to the decision-making process. In participative theories, however, the leader retains the right to allow the input of others.

\section*{7. Management Theories:}

Management theories, also known as transactional theories, focus on the role of supervision, organization and group performance. These theories base leadership on a system of rewards and punishments. Managerial theories are often used in business; when employees are successful, they are rewarded; when they fail, they are reprimanded or punished.

\section*{8. Relationship Theories:}

Relationship theories, also known as transformational theories, focus upon the connections formed between leaders and followers. Transformational leaders motivate and inspire people by helping group members see the importance and higher good of the task. These leaders are focused on the performance of group members, but also want each person to fulfill his or her potential. Leaders with this style often have high ethical and moral standards.

\section*{Change management}

\section*{Managing Change}

Organizations are designed to fit the environment in which they operate at a given time. Their environments are constantly changing in varying degrees. Change is therefore inevitable in any organization that seeks to maintain its relevance. Managers deal with many organized groups representing various interests. Most of these groups exert power over operations of organizations. While they may be able to do little or nothing to change these forces, it is nevertheless up to the manager to anticipate and integrate these various forces that are bound to affect his operations.

Different types of change require different strategies to implement the change successfully. Managers must anticipate changes in the environment that will require future adjustments in the organizations designs. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and at the level of the individual.

Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and on the individual level. Change management means to plan, initiate, realize, control and finally stabilize change processes, whether corporate or personal. Change may cover such diverse problems as, for example, strategic direction or personal development programmes for staff.

\section*{The Importance of Change Management}

The capacity to manage change is the most important characteristic of leaders who succeed. This capacity depends on seven essential abilities:
- To be capable of adapting to the environment and be conscious of the gap between what is done and what can be done; to appreciate but never be satisfied with the situation as it is today and pay more attention to what does not function than to what functions.
- To be able to question the present reality.
- To be able to communicate a compelling vision of the direction the organization must take.
- To have the capacity to create a coalition of followers and supporters.
- To be capable of building a team capable of making change happen.
- To persist and persevere.
- To share with others the credit and recognition brought by success.

\section*{Types of Change}

Change is the continuous adaptation of corporate strategies and structures to changing external conditions. It may take several forms, as described below:

Developmental Change Developmental change occurs when an organization makes an improvement to its current way of doing business. If an organization decided to improve its processes, methods or performance standards, this would be considered developmental change.

Transformational Change Transformational change occurs after the transition period. Transformational change may involve both developmental and transitional change, and it is common for the two types to occur in tandem. This happens mainly when organizations are faced with the emergence of radically different technologies, significant changes in supply and demand, unexpected competition, lack of revenue, or other major shifts in how they do business. Formal changes are the responses of an organization to major internal forces and external pressures (change drivers).

\section*{Transitional Change}

Transitional change is more intrusive than developmental change, as it replaces existing processes or procedures with something that is completely new to the organization. The period when the old process is being dismantled and the new process is being implemented is called the transitional phase.

\section*{Guidelines for Change Management}

Resistance to change can be avoided or reduced by doing the following:
1.) Planning change carefully:

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Identify problems and their underlying causes.
- Formulate alternative actions to solve the problems.

Select the most feasible action(s).
- Establish an implementation plan.
2.) Involving those who will be affected by change right from the planning stage:
- Explain the benefits, for both the organization and the people, and also indicate the disadvantages that are likely to arise.
- Introduce change gradually.
- Be patient and tolerant during change; give support and help.
- Provide training that may be needed.
- Monitor change.
- Communicate frequently with people during and after change in order to identify snags and problems.
- Be firm about the end results but flexible about getting there.

\section*{Kurt Lewin's Change Model}

An early model of change developed by Kurt Lewin (1890-1947), ${ }^{4}$ one of the modern pioneers of social, organizational and applied psychology, described change as a three-stage process:
1.) "Unfreezing": It involves overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing "mind set". Defence mechanisms have to be bypassed.
2.) "Change": This is typically a period of confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged, but we do not yet have a clear picture of what we are replacing them with.
3.) "Refreezing": The new mind set is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. This is often misquoted as "refreezing" (Lewin, 1947).

Note: Change is inevitable in the current complex environment. It has been said that change is the only constant. A leader would learn change practices that produce results.

\section*{Resistance to change}

Change is actually a frightening word for many people. People resist and try to avoid changes that will leave them worse off than they are now. But, resistance may be met even if the proposed change is neutral, or beneficial to the persons concerned.
Why people resist change
- They believe that is not in their interest to change
- They think the change is the wrong thing to do, if you knew what I knew"
- They are skeptical about the possibility of success
- They don't understand why change is happening
- It isn't relevant to them
- They don't understand exactly what change is required
- They don't have the time or resources to change
- They don't think that they will be able to change (Fear of failure)
- They feel they were not involved in the decision to change
- Lack of conviction that change is needed
- Dislike of imposed change
- Dislike of surprises
- Fear of the unknown
- Reluctance to deal with unpopular issues fear of
- inadequacy and failure
- Disturbed practices, habits and relations
- Lack of respect and trust in the person promoting change

\section*{Strategies for dealing with change resistance}

\section*{1. Education \& Communication:}

One of the best ways to overcome resistance to change is to educate people about the change effort beforehand. Up-front communication and education helps employees see the logic in the change effort. This reduces unfounded and incorrect rumors concerning the effects of change in the organization

\section*{2. Participation \& Involvement:}

When employees are involved in the change effort they are more likely to buy into change rather than resist it. This approach is likely to lower resistance more so than merely hoping people will acquiesce to change

\section*{3. Facilitation \& Support:}

Managers can head-off potential resistance by being supportive of employees during difficult times. Managerial support helps employees deal with fear and anxiety during a transition period. This approach is concerned with provision of special training, counseling, time off work.

\section*{4. Negotiation and Agreement:}

Managers can combat resistance by offering incentives to employees not to resist change. This can be done by allowing change resistors to veto elements of change that are threatening, or change resistors can be offered incentives to go elsewhere in the company in order to avoid having to experience the change effort. This approach will be appropriate where those resisting change are in a position of power.

\section*{5. Manipulation and Cooptation:}
"Cooptation" (no it's not misspelled) involves the patronizing gesture of bringing a person into a change management planning group for the sake of appearances rather than their substantive contribution. This often involves selecting leaders of the resisters to participate in the change effort. These leaders can be given a symbolic role in decision making without threatening the change effort.

\section*{6. Explicit and Implicit Coercion:}

Managers can explicitly or implicitly force employees into accepting change by making clear that resisting change can lead to losing jobs, firing, or not promoting employees

\section*{Group Dynamics}

Group dynamics refers to a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (intergroup dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies. Group dynamics are at the core of understanding racism, sexism, and other forms of social prejudice and discrimination. These applications of the field are studied in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social work, business, and communication studies.

\section*{Team building}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Team building is a philosophy of job design in which employees are viewed as members of interdependent teams instead of as individual workers. Team building refers to a wide range of activities, presented to businesses, schools, sports teams, religious or nonprofit organizations designed for improving team performance.

Team building is pursued via a variety of practices, and can range from simple bonding exercises to complex simulations and multi-day team building retreats designed to develop a team (including group assessment and group-dynamic games), usually falling somewhere in between. It generally sits within the theory and practice of organizational development, but can also be applied to sports teams, school groups, and other contexts.

Team building is not to be confused with "team recreation" that consists of activities for teams that are strictly recreational. Team building can also be seen in day-to-day operations of an organization and team dynamic can be improved through successful leadership. Team building is said to have benefits of self-development, positive communication, leadership skills and the ability to work closely together as a team to solve problems.

Work environments tend to focus on individuals and personal goals, with reward \& recognition singling out the achievements of individual employees. Team building can also refer to the process of selecting or creating a team from scratch

\section*{Team dynamic}

When assembling a team it is very important to consider the overall dynamic of the team. When building a team, five dynamics are fundamental to team success:
1. The team member: Successful teams are made up of a collection of effective individuals. These are people who are experienced, have problem solving ability, are open to addressing the problem, and are action oriented.
2. Team relationships: For a team to be successful the members of the team must be able to give and receive feedback.
3. Team problem solving: An effective team depends on how focused and clear the goal of the team is. A relaxed, comfortable and accepting environment and finally, open and honest communication are required.
4. Team leadership: Effective team leadership depends on leadership competencies. A competent leader is: focused on the goal, ensures a collaborative climate, builds confidence of team members, sets priorities, demonstrates sufficient "know-how" and manages performance through feedback.
5. Organizational environment: The climate and culture of the organization must be conducive to team behavior. Competitiveness should be discouraged and uniformity should be encouraged - this will eliminate conflict and discord among team members.

\section*{Goals}

The overall goals of team building are to increase the teams understanding of team dynamics and improve how the team works together. Unlike working as a group, working as a team incorporates group accountability rather than individual accountability and results in a collective work product. Team building encourages the team approach to working on a project. Advantages to this approach include:
- Increased flexibility in skills and abilities
- More productive than work groups with individual mindset
- More beneficial in times of organizational change
- Encourage both individual and team development and improvement
- Focuses on group goals to accomplish more beneficial tasks
- Improved range of team building objectives such as collaboration, communication and increased creative or flexible thinking.

Eight (8) effective strategies a leader should employ to enhance team building:
1. Establish clear and inspiring team goals
2. Maintain a results-oriented team structure
3. Assemble competent team members
4. Strive for unified commitment
5. Provide a collaborative climate
6. Encourage standards of excellence
7. Furnish external support and recognition
8. Apply principled leadership

\section*{Organizational mission, vision and core values \\ Vision:}

This involves organization developing a clear understanding of what will be its preferred future. This might not be difficult for organizations who have been managing using strategic plan since they can adopt what they have or modify to suit the ever changing trends in technology and innovations in management approaches. To achieve the vision operation plans have to be developed.

\section*{Mission}

A mission is at a core of why organization do the work they do. This involves developing sound statement about why an organization exists. It reflects purpose and may include some strategy reflection. In health Records and Information Department for example, they have the training mission statement as "To train competent Health Records and Information Technicians who will provide quality health care to the community". However, if and organization do not existing one.

\section*{Core values and beliefs}

Values are beliefs that are shared among the stakeholders of the organization and form the principles or commitments that the organization members stand for. This is where the behaviors and ideas that are important to an organization are described. The examples are the respect of staff is the most valuable resource in an organization, Professionalism, integrity and ethic, a conducive working and learning environment, creativity, inquisitiveness and teamwork, equity across different individuals and /or groups in society and Partnerships with stakeholders.

\section*{ORGANIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES}

At the end of this unit, the learning should be able to:
1. Describe the organizational structure of the Health care system

\section*{Organization Structure}

Kenya's health system has undergone significant change and reform in recent years and with the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution will continue to evolve. Even so, the system will reflect the inter-linked levels of national, provincial, district, sub-district and community. (These levels of local administration are subject to change in line with the implementation of the new Constitution of Kenya 2010, which provides for devolution of both authority and financial resources). The national level is made up of the MOMS and MOPHS headquarters, with the provincial level serving as de-concentrated units of the national level. (Figures 3.1 and 3.2 outline the organization of the Ministry of Medical Services and the Ministry Public Health and Sanitation, respectively.)

The government health service is supplemented by privately owned and operated hospitals and clinics and faith-based organisations' hospitals and clinics, which together provide between 30 and 40 percent of the hospital beds in Kenya.

The functions of the national level are:
1. Strategic planning and policy formulation,
2. Enforcement of standards,
3. Ensuring commodity security,
4. Performance monitoring,
5. Capacity strengthening,
6. Resource mobilization, and
7. Operational and other research

The oversight and policy formulation functions are managed through the Ministers and Assistant Ministers. The Permanent Secretary (PS) is the link between the technical, administrative and oversight functions, while the Director of Medical Services (DMS) and the Director of Public Health and Sanitation (DPHS) are the coordinators of the technical functions of the respective ministries. The DMS and the DPHS execute their functions through the departments in the respective ministries. These departments are further divided into divisions as illustrated in the figures below.

\section*{Purpose of Health structures}

The purpose of an organizational structure is to define the guidelines, parameters and the procedural process necessary for a group to accomplish a main objective. For example, the anatomy of an organizational structure is further reduced to the distribution of authority, span-ofcontrol, and line vs. staff structures, organizational height and departmentalization. An organizational structure organizes priorities hierarchically by means of identifying tasks
critical to a group realizing an end goal. An organizational structure may adopt a live structure or a staff structure or both to achieve their main objectives. A line structure, sometimes called a product structure, identifies the activities directly responsible for the organization's main goal, such as the labor involved in making an actually product. A staff structure is the support staff or network assisting the line structures in their goals.

\section*{Types of health Structures}

\section*{Functions of Health Structures \\ Organizational structure of the Health care systems}

\section*{The Health Care System}

The health sector comprises the public system, with major players including the MOH and parastatal organisations, and the private sector, which includes private for-profit, NGO, and FBO facilities. Health services are provided through a network of over 4,700 health facilities countrywide, with the public sector system accounting for about 51 percent of these facilities.

The public health system consists of the following levels of health facilities: national referral hospitals, provincial general hospitals, district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries.

National referral hospitals are at the apex of the health care system, providing sophisticated diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. The two national referral hospitals are Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and Moi Referral and Teaching Hospital in Eldoret. The equivalent private referral hospitals are Nairobi Hospital and Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi.

Provincial hospitals act as referral hospitals to their district hospitals. They also provide very specialized care. The provincial level acts as an intermediary between the national central level and the districts. They oversee the implementation of health policy at the district level, maintain quality standards, and coordinate and control all district health activities. Similar private hospitals at the provincial level include Aga Khan Hospitals in Kisumu and Mombasa.

District hospitals concentrate on the delivery of health care services and generate their own expenditure plans and budget requirements based on guidelines from headquarters through the provinces.

The network of health centres provides many of the ambulatory health services. Health centres generally offer preventive and curative services, mostly adapted to local needs.
Dispensaries are meant to be the system's first line of contact with patients, but in some areas, health centres or even hospitals are effectively the first points of contact. Dispensaries provide wider coverage for preventive health measures, which is a primary goal of the health policy.

- There is also a host of other operators within the private, non-governmental, and traditional/informal sectors.
- The system is a hierarchical-pyramidal organization comprising five levels, the lowest being the village dispensary and the Kenyatta National Hospital at the apex.
- The mandate for supervision, formulation of policies, establishment and enforcement of standards, and mobilization of resources for health care rests with the Ministry of Health
- The country has eight provinces divided into lower levels of administrations called districts, which are responsible for delivering health services and implementing health programs.
- Under the decentralization strategy, districts form the central pillars of the public health system.
- Management of healthcare at the district level is headed by a District Medical Officer of Health (DMOH) appointed by the Ministry of Health.
- The DMOH is supported by a District Health Management Board (DHMB) comprising officials appointed by the MOH and from local areas, and a professional unit, the District Health Management Team (DHMT).
- The DHMT prepares technical advisories and the District Health Plan in consultation with local health actors and the DHMB.
- According to the most recent health management information system (HMIS) data, there are over 9470 health facilities across the country operated by three owner systems.
- The government running $43 \%$ of the facilities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) $3.4 \%$, and private businesses $37 \%$ all other ownership is $16.6 \%$.
- The government owns most of the hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries, while clinics and nursing homes are entirely in the hands of the private sector.

\section*{Communication Process}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_bac99fef57652838f07cg-26.jpg?height=1378&width=1725&top_left_y=1317&top_left_x=173)
message that they interfere with the communication process.
- Ourselves: Focusing on ourselves, rather than the other person, can lead to confusion and conflict. Some of the factors that cause this are defensiveness (we feel someone is attacking us), superiority (we feel we know more than the other) and ego (we feel we are the centre of the activity).
- Perception: Our preconceived attitudes affect our ability to listen. We listen uncritically to persons of high status and dismiss those of low status. If we feel the person is talking too fast, or not fluently, or does not articulate clearly, or is speaking with an undesirable accent, etc., we may dismiss the person out of hand.

\section*{Overcoming Communication Barriers}

As further illustrated in Figure 5.7, ways of minimizing communication barriers include:
- The use of different communication systems, including formal and informal methods, in order to facilitate understanding between the sender and the receiver of the message within an organization.
- The active role of managers in communication, for example in resolving conflict (relationship, task, social) and encouraging shared vision and team building.

\section*{Overcoming communication barriers; -}

Becoming an active listener
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_bac99fef57652838f07cg-27.jpg?height=150&width=171&top_left_y=1107&top_left_x=256)

\section*{1. Stop talking}

Often, we talk more than we should without giving the other person a chance to respond. If we are thinking about what we will say when we talk, we cannot focus attention on the person we wish to listen to. Do not interrupt.

\section*{2. Pay attention}

Do not allow yourself to be distracted by thinking about something else.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_bac99fef57652838f07cg-27.jpg?height=137&width=166&top_left_y=1406&top_left_x=253)

Often, we need to make an active effort to pay attention when others are speaking.
3. Listen emphathetically

Try to take the speaker's perspective. Mirror the speaker's body language and give the person non-judgemental encouragement to speak.

\section*{4. Hear before evaluating}

Do not draw premature conclusions or look for points of disagreement. Listen
- Clarity in communication: It is important to be clear about the subject and stick to the main theme of the topic when explaining it to someone else. It is also important to be well prepared yourself before trying to communicate with another person.
- Establish rapport: Because communication is an ongoing process that involves the active particiption of all concerned, people communicate effectively when they are at ease with one another. It is important to show interest in the other person, as this is the best way of getting their attention and acceptance.
- Encourage audience participation: This is especially important when unfamiliar or difficult issues are being discussed and collective decisions sought.
- Avoid ambiguity: The lack of specificity is one of the barriers to good communication. To avoid this it is necessary to be very clear when giving instructions or explanations. Vague statements such as "take appropriate action" or "make suitable arrangements" should be avoided; rather, the instructions should state exactly what needs to be done.
- Be brief: It is best to be direct and to the point and to reinforce the main points with
examples if necessary.
Language: Special terms that may be unfamiliar to the listener should be explained and jargon avoided. If the language being used to communicate is a foreign or second language, it is best to use simple words and sentences, and to verify understanding.
- Develop listening skills: Since communication is a two-way process, it is as important to listen carefully as it is to speak properly. Sometimes we do not listen well for a number of reasons, such as boredom, bias, fear of being influenced and interruptions.
- Feedback: Feedback from the listener needs to be recognized by the sender, even when it is non-verbal (example yawning, being distracted, checking text messages). If what you are saying is not being registered or has the wrong effect, change your communication approach.
- Timing and situation: Effective communications requires enough time to cover the subject adequately without unnecessary interruptions. If interruption is unavoidable, it is important to set a formal date for continuing the discussion in the not too distant future.
- Verification: This goes back to the definition of communication as a two-way process involving both transmission and reception. To ensure accurate communication, it is important to ask questions to verify that your communication has been received in the way it was intended and that you heard the message that was intended.
- Use of different communication methods: A mix of formal and informal methods may facilitate understanding between the sender and the receiver of the message within an organization.

\section*{Role of effective communication}
- Promotes teamwork,
- Enhances managerial and leadership skills,
- Enhances personal effectiveness,
(Involve the learner in adding more roles by brainstorming)

\section*{Channels of Communication}

Channels of communication are mechanisms for linking one person to the other/others and vice versa. The channels vary, but those most commonly used to communicate with staff may be divided into organizational and interpersonal.

\section*{Organizational}

Organizational communication is the consideration, analysis and criticism of the role of communication in organizational contexts; it may be formal or informal. For example, written communication becomes important when certain proceedings or instructions need to be recorded and guidelines/procedures need to be followed. Staff meetings may be called to give staff an opportunity to exchange information or solve problems, or to give instructions about a new skill that may need a detailed explanation or demonstration

\section*{Interpersonal}

This is the process of face-to-face communication between individuals. Such communication may take several forms. Messages may be verbal (that is, expressed in words), or they may not involve words at all but consist of gestures, facial expressions and certain postures. For example, managers often communicate verbally with staff members on a one-to-one basis to

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
discuss good or poor performance, to motivate and counsel them, to discuss and solve problems arising at the workplace, and to understand better the individual problems of their staff. They may also communicate in writing, to give instructions, get suggestions and document actions for disciplinary purposes.

\section*{Communication Networks}

A network consists of a set of interconnected devices, nodes, hosts or computers linked across a communication medium. Communication networks, specifically, are links and nodes especially set so that messages may be passed from one part of the network to another through multiple links and various nodes. A network can offer a choice of services including voice transfer, fi le transfer, remote login and message passing. Therefore, networks, or patterns, are aspects of direction and flow of communication.

\section*{Direction of Organizational Communication}

There are basically three directions in which communication operates - up, down and sideways:
- Downward communication: From supervisor to subordinate (e.g., job instructions, information on organization policies, performance feedback, information about the organization's goals and changes).
- Upward communication: From subordinate to supervisor (e.g., grievance procedures, department meetings, participation in decisions, others).
- Horizontal communication: This is communication between/among staff at the same level.

\section*{Ways to Improve Communication}

Once you are aware of all the aspects influencing effective communication, you can begin to enhance your own communication skills. The following suggestions intend to help you to improve your skills in conveying - and receiving - messages.

Asking Good Questions
- Asking good questions is an art that can be learned
- Not all questions are good questions
- Sometimes they are statements or commands that are disguised as a question for example, "Don't you think you should have done that differently?"
- Such inquiry blocks learning
- Leading questions also block learning

Communication skills --Good questioning
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Inquiry That Encourages Learning & Inquiry That Blocks Learning \\
\hline How do you see this differently? & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Don't you agree? (especially when said in an \\
intimidating way)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline What's your reaction to? & Did you do that because of X, Y, or Z? \\
\hline What led you to that conclusion/action? & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Do you really think you did a good job? \\
(when you think he did not)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Could you say more about that? & Why don't you just try what I'm suggesting? \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Why is that so? & Why didn't you just tell me? \\
\hline What makes you? & Why are you so defensive? \\
\hline What kept you from telling me? & Why don't you? \\
\hline How do you think I/you contributed to that? & What's the matter with you? \\
\hline How can I/you/we? & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Don't you agree? (especially when said in an \\
intimidating way)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Effective Listening}
- Good listening involves an attitude as well as a skill
- You have to believe that the other person is worth listening to, has something of value to say.
- Listening is difficult when your own mind is busy chattering away or occupied with concerns that have nothing to do with the other.
- Listening is hard when you have a strong urge to say something or when you have already come to a conclusion about the other person's problems or issues.
- There are three disciplines for learning to listen better.

\section*{-focus: \\ -empathy \\ -silence}
- To practice focus, periodically summarizing, briefly, what the other person said
- Ask if that is what she meant to say
- To practice empathy, try to rephrase in your own words what you think the other person must be feeling
- To practice silence, give time to the other person to think about a question you made.
- Practice being silence by not jumping in, counting until 30 if you must, and observe what happens.

\section*{HEALTH ECONOMICS}

\section*{Discussion questions}
- What is health and health care?
- What is health economics?
- Why is it important?
- What makes the health care market different from the market or other goods?

What type of questions do health economists ask?

\section*{What is health?}

Health is a multifaceted concept and not easily measurable. WHO defined as definition a state of complete physical and mental well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO, 1948). It refer to peoples' health status (how healthy they are). Important part of human capital:
[ Human capital: value of learning, experience and ability embodied in workers which increases productivity and income.
$\square$ Asset: accumulates and depreciates
Individual or households can improve their health through use of health care, diet .. Production of health:
- Health Production Functions
- Determinants of health

\section*{What is health care?}

\section*{Definition:}

It is the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mental and physical well-being through the services offered by the medical and allied health professions.

Important difference between health and health care is that, health care can be traded on the market but health cannot.
- Demand health care to improve our health
$\square$ Demand for Health Care
$\square$ Health care markets differ from markets for other commodities Roots of health economics:
- Concerned with the health market not with health or health status.

\section*{What is health economics?}

Economics is the study of how people allocate their limited resources in an attempt to satisfy their unlimited wants. Health economics on the other hand is the study of how (scarce) resources are allocated to and within the health economy.

\section*{Basic concepts of supply and demand analysis}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Definition of Demand: It is the need and ability and willingness to pay for a commodity - The schedule of amounts of any product that buyer will purchase at different prices during some Stated time period.

Desire: refers to people's willingness to own a good. Demand is the amount of a good that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price.

Definition Supply: the amounts of a good producer are willing and able to sell at a given price. For many people the word market conjures up a picture of a town square with lots of small stall holders selling everything from fruit and vegetables to meat and fish. For economists, the term has a much wider meaning. It is used to describe any process of exchange between buyers and sellers.

Formally, a market can be defined as any set of arrangements which allows buyers and sellers to communicate and thus arrange exchange of goods, services or resources. A free market is where such exchange occurs without interference from the government.

Information is a vital ingredient for any market. Both buyers and sellers need to have access to sufficient information to allow them to make rational decisions. So a market for health care must involve two groups: the buyers and the sellers, who interact to trade health care. Who would the buyers and sellers be in such a market? We all want good health and so most of us would be prepared, if necessary, to purchase medical treatment to cure an illness. This suggests that everybody is potentially a buyer (or consumer) of health care. More precisely, at any moment, a buyer would be any body who was ill or who wanted preventative medical treatment such as vaccination or who wanted guidance about their health. The sellers would be those people who could provide medical and health care services, such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists and high street chemists.

The concept of supply and demand analysis helps to understand exactly how this spending of money operates in a market system. The answers to these and a thousand other questions can be found in the theory of supply and demand. This theory shows how consumer preferences determine consumer demand for commodities, while business costs underpin the supply of commodities. Finally, we will see how supply and demand are brought into balance by the movement of prices - by the prices.

\section*{Equilibrium}

When supply and demand are equal (i.e. when the supply function and demand function intersect) the economy is said to be at equilibrium. At this point, the allocation of goods is at its most efficient because the amount of goods being supplied is exactly the same as the amount of goods being demanded. Thus, everyone (individuals, firms, or countries) is satisfied with the current economic condition. At the given price, suppliers are selling all the goods that they have produced and consumers are getting all the goods that they are demanding.

\section*{Law of supply and demand}

For higher prices less quantity is demanded and vice versa. Moreover, determinant of demand are taste, number of buyers, income, price of related goods and technology.

\section*{Law of supply}

For higher prices greater quantity is supplied. Supply is always based upon a firm's cost.
Determinants of supply:

\section*{Healthcare financing:}

Healthcare financing is much more than a matter of raising money for health. It is also a matter of who is asked to pay, when they pay and how the money raised is spent. This includes raising
adequate funds for health, in ways that ensure people can use needed services, and are protected from financial catastrophe or impoverishment associated with having to pay for them. It provides incentives for providers and users to be efficient.

\section*{Sources of health care financing:}
$\square$ general revenue or earmarked taxes
$\square$ social insurance contributions
$\square$ private insurance premiums
$\square$ community financing
$\square$ direct out of pocket payments

\section*{Each method}
$\square$ distributes the financial burdens and benefits differently
$\square$ each method affects who will have access to health care financial protection

\section*{General revenue or earmarked taxes}

The most traditional way of financing health care finances a major portion of the health care (especially in low income countries) Social insurance. It is compulsory. Everyone in the eligible group must enroll and pay a specific premium contribution in exchange for a set of benefits. Social insurance premiums and benefits are described in social compacts established through legislation. Premiums or benefits can be altered only through a formal political process.

\section*{Private insurance}

Private contract offered by an insurer to exchange a set of benefits for a payment of a specified premium. Marketed either by nonprofit or for profit insurance companies, consumers voluntarily choose to purchase an insurance package that best matches their preference. Private insurance is offered on individual and group basis. Under individual insurance the premium is based on that individuals risk characteristics. Major concern in private insurance is buyer's adverse selection, under group insurance; the premium is calculated on a group basis. Risk is pooled across age, gender and health status.

\section*{Community based financing}

Refers to schemes are based on three principles;-
- Community cooperation,
- Local self-reliance and
- Pre-payment

Factors for success of community financing are technical strength and institutional capacity of the local group.
Financial control as part of the broader strategy in local management and control of health care services;-
- Support received from outside organizations and individuals
- Links with other local organizations
- Diversity of funding
- Responding to other (non health) development needs of the community
- Ability to adapt to a changing environment

\section*{Direct out of pocket}
$\square$ Made by patients to private providers at the time a service is rendered
$\square$ User fees refer to fees the patients have to pay to public hospitals, clinics, and health posts not to private sector providers.
$\square$ Proponents of user fees believe that the fee can increase revenue to improve the quality of public health services and expand coverage
$\square$ Major objection raised against user fees had been on equity grounds

\section*{Community financing}
- Technical strength and institutional capacity of the local group
- Financial control as part of the broader strategy in local management and control of health care services
- Support received from outside organizations and individuals
- Links with other local organizations
- Diversity of funding
- Responding to other (non health) development needs of the community
- Ability to adapt to a changing environment

\section*{Community based insurance schemes}
- Primarily for informal sector
- Tends to cover all insured members of the community for all available services but have emphasis on primary health.
- Most financed from patient collections, government grant, donations, and such miscellaneous items as interest earnings or employment schemes
- Most NGOs have their own facilities or mobile clinics to provide health care.
- Total coverage is estimated to be about 30 million people (Ellis 1997).

\section*{Conclusion}
- Role of health economists be recognized.
- Health financing cannot be dealt separately as it has got to do with good governance, economic growth, education.
- Social inclusion and financial protection seems to be provided through community based financing.

\section*{Who Funds The Health Sector In Kenya?}

The health sector in Kenya obtains varying levels of funding from the traditional sources: public (government), private firms, households and donors. According to the 2005/06 National Health Accounts (NHA), households remain the largest contributors of health funds, at $35.9 \%$, followed by the government, and then donors, who contribute approximately $30 \%$.

\section*{Health Financing: How much is available?}

The GOK funds 25 the health sector through budgetary allocations to the MoH and the MoPHS and related government departments. As far as government spending is concerned, the Ministry of Finance sets three year budget ceilings for each sector in Kenya. In practical terms this means that the Ministry of Health creates a budget based on what the Ministry of Finance has said it will allocate for health expenditures rather than submitting a budget request based on actual needs. The Ministry of Health then disburses the funds it receives through its District Health Management Boards. The health budget shortfalls are manifest in the widespread lack of
adequate drugs and pharmaceuticals, staff shortages and poor maintenance of equipment, transport, and facilities.

\section*{From the Kenyan People (Cost Sharing)}

Over the past two decades, the GOK has pursued a policy of cost sharing to bridge the gap between actual budgets and the level of resources needed to fund public health sector activities. The revenue from the cost-sharing programme has continued to grow in absolute terms and as a percentage of the recurrent government budget. In 2002-03, cost-sharing contributed over $8 \%$ of the recurrent expenditure and about $21 \%$ of the non-wage recurrent budget of the MoH . However, because of the worsening poverty situation in the country, the MoH has changed its cost-sharing policy and replaced it with a " $10 / 20$ " policy, in which dispensaries and health centres are not to charge user fees for curative care other than Ksh 10 or 20 for client cards 28.

\section*{From the Donors}

Kenya depends significantly on donor funds, many of which supplement the development component of the national health budget. In 2009/10, on-budget external resources accounted for $15.1 \%$ of all health spending in Kenya, or Kshs 7.1 million. In 2005/06, Kenya's health budget was made up to $11.3 \%$ by donor contributions. Over the years, Kenya's health sector has increased its dependency on external sources.

All donor commitments for Kenya's health sector-on and off budget-represent USD 99 million in 200831, down from USD 147 million in 2005. The United States is the largest bilateral donor, channelling funds through PEPFAR, the President's Malaria Initiative and USAID with USD 32.4 million in 2008. The United Kingdom also commits significant bilateral funds to the health sector (USD 30 million). When analyzing donors' actual health disbursements to Kenya', the picture looks different. In 2008, donors provided USD 116 million up from USD 102 million in the previous year. The biggest donors were GAVI, Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United Kingdom. This graph shows that the US ranks only fifth.

\section*{Kenya National Budget Process}

In Kenya the budgetary process comprises three main stages: drafting, legislation, and implementation and audit. Reforms aimed at improving the budgetary process have sought to impose greater fiscal discipline on the government among other objectives such as attaining allocative and operational/technical efficiency. The constitution requires the executive to raise and allocate resources for government projects within this rigorous budget process. The Budget cycle is based on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) cycle. The MTEF process prioritizes definition of a global resource envelope, determination of inter-sectoral allocations based on core functions and proposals of inter-sectoral allocations based on outcomes, activities and outputs. Public hearings and involvement of private and civil society in the budget preparation enhances transparency.

The MTEF process revolves around the activities of ten MTEF sectors, including the human resource development sector. To guide the preparation of MTEF, the Ministry of Finance issues to all ministries, departments and government agencies in August a circular detailing the guidelines with objectives for the financial year. The Circular-Budget preparation guidelines for budget 2010-11 for example directed that the preparation of the budget for the next MTEF period
should be within the context of stimulating growth and creating jobs, reducing poverty and enhancing food security, and protecting the poor and most vulnerable of the society while improving government efficiency in delivering services.

The budget is prepared through Sector Working Groups (SWGs) comprising different ministries, departments, and agencies. The overall fiscal and macroeconomic framework-including strategies, outlook and forecast - determines the role of ministerial working groups (MWGs). The Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MoPHS) and the Ministry of Medical Services (MoMS) both appoint representatives to the ministerial working group who then work within the SWG. The two ministries fall under the human resource development sector.

The Sector Working Groups are urged to ensure that they only consider proposals for funding that support the achievement of the objectives and priorities outlined in the Medium Term Strategy of Vision 2030. The Circular from the Ministry of Finance encourages the involvement of districts and other stakeholders in the MTEF budget process through the sector hearings. The purpose of the Sector Hearings is to ensure transparent discussions of priorities of government for the next financial year with key stakeholders including development partners, civil society, private sector and research institutions.

Financial management is the process of achieving the organization's objectives in an efficient manner through planning (budgeting), acquiring, organizing, directing monitoring, controlling and reporting.

\section*{Why is it important?}
1. The size of the health economy is large and growing
2. Role of government in the health care markets
3. Health care market is difference from other markets
4. Externalities

\section*{FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES}

\section*{What are they?}
- These are firm and well defined rules, guidelines and procedures that provide both the institutional and the legal framework for managing and accounting for public funds.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{It takes two forms namely:}
- Establishment of Institutional Framework and
- Establishment of the legal Framework (Procedures) for dealing with financial affairs of the country
Financial Management Policies
The responsibility for management, supervision, control and direction of all matters related to the financial affairs of Kenya are vested in the Minister of Finance (Treasury), who discharges his responsibilities through formulation and promulgation of regulations under powers given to him in the Exchequer and Audit Act, (Cap.412).

\section*{PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FINANCIAL REGULATION}

Government Financial Management Act (GFMA)
What is a budget? The budget is more than just a number of figures
The budget should express: targets of government policy measures and instruments to reach these targets costs connected to the targets and measures

\section*{Three elementary questions in the budget}
- What is it that you want to achieve (what's your goal)?
- What measures are you going to take to achieve that goal?
- What is it going to cost?

\section*{Budgeting in the public sector :}
* Political instrument to allocate scarce resources to priorities
* Managerial tool to explain how programs achieve policy objectives
* Economic instrument to influence the economic growth of the country
* Control tool to hold managers accountable for outcomes \& outputs.

Different budget formats

\section*{(1) Line Item Budgets}
- The expenditure are expressed in considerable details but activities being undertaken are given little attention
- It shows the nature of the spending but not the purpose
- The amount in this type of budget are frequently established on the bases of historical costs that have been adjusted for anticipated changes in cost and activity levels
- Control oriented - it is a form of financial control rather than effectiveness
- Shows exactly how much is spent on each item of expenditure
- Focuses on 'inputs' not 'outputs' or 'delivery'
- Itemizes payments (and receipts) by standard categories
- Helps to ensure aggregate fiscal discipline

\section*{Advantages and Disadvantages of Line Item Budgets} Advantages:
> Are simple to draw up
$>$ Provide an analysis of expenditure on inputs
$>$ Allow for easy control over inputs used
> Easy for politicians to see an amount spent per budget item Disadvantages
$>$ Provides little information about what the budget is spent on
$>$ Gives no indication of how funds are used within programmes
$>$ Does not show the differences in expenditures on managerial, administration and operational staff
Focuses on control of funds instead of achieving results.
2 Programme Budgeting
1. process that relates resources to proposed and actual results
2. Clusters of related activities that represent the highest level of classification of the work undertaken by a department in carrying out assigned responsibilities
3. Allocates money to functions/activities and focuses on total cost of providing a service, supported by line item detail.
4. Stresses on the end product, not the means

Key Concepts for programme based Budget (PBB)
- Vision :A realistic and attractive future scenario for the organization
- Mission: A broad definition of why the agency exists, what are the main activities and who are the targeted beneficiaries
- Programme:
- A group of independent but closely related services and activities which contribute to the programme goal.
- A grouping of activities that contribute to a common strategic objective.
- Programmes are divided into component sub-programmes

Objectives of Programme Based Budget
- Making public management results-oriented
- Improving efficiency/effectiveness of activities;
- Using performance information for setting targets and priorities;
- Guiding resource re-allocation with greater information;
- Making efficiency savings wherever necessary.

Line Item Budgeting vs. PBB
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Line Item Budgeting & PBB \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
- Focuses on compliance/use of inputs
- Presentation in terms of categories of inputs (line item)
- No information on performance
- No information on unit costs of goods and services provided;
- Lack of information on future funding needs.
- No clear distinction between externally "administered" items (e.g., level of grants or subsidies) and "controlled" items (subject to managerial control)
- Focuses on outputs/results
- Presentation by activities/tasks performed (fewer appropriation items)
- Performance measures defined
- Costing facilitated by defining outputs;
- Greater predictability in funding needs
- "Controlled" and "administered" items are identified and separately recorded

\section*{Why Move to a PBB System?}
1) To improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness in public financial management using techniques and planning frameworks based on international best practice;
2) To improve resource allocation by identification, ranking and prioritization of programmes ;
3) To improve the efficiency of budget management by including performance information in budget documents to assist monitoring and evaluation;
4) To use performance information to guide outlays on different activities, providing a more structured framework for budget resource allocation, both within and across sectors.

\section*{Challenges of Programme Based Budgets}
- Time consuming
- Requires a lot of information
- Requires a major change in the way a Ministry operates and change can be difficult
- Requires a paradigm shift in management behaviour

\section*{Financial Recording and Reporting Documents}
- General voucher
- General allowance claim form
- Imprest request/retirement voucher
- Cash reconciliation sheet:
- Monthly schedule of outstanding imprests
- General ledger card

\section*{Types of Budgets}

Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF): This is a three-year rolling budget process aimed at aligning policy, planning and budgeting.
Annual budget: An annual estimate of Government expenditures and revenues for all ministries.
The Revised/Supplementary Budget
- Prepared in December of every year.
- Enable ministries and departments adjust their budgetary allocation in line with the expenditure trends observed over the past six months.
- Usually treasury only allows reallocations where savings can be realized from other expenditure areas.
The budget preparation process
Sector Working Groups (SWGs)
- The MTEF process grouped ministries in economic divisions referred to as sectors.
- Various ministries in a sector submit their budget proposals to the sector for funding (popularly known as bidding process).
- The requests from the various ministries are evaluated by the Sector Working Groups (SWGs) which comprises officers from the respective ministries in the sector, Treasury and Ministry of Planning officials.

\section*{Budget implementation}
- From 1 ${ }^{\text {st }}$ July (which year 2013 Ministries operate on Vote on Account whereby they are allowed to spend only one half of their provisions/ allocations until the Appropriation bill is passed
- Field stations are given Authority to Incur Expenditures (AIES) and cheques / checks qu Sources of Government Finance/ revenue
- GOV. Finance = All monies receivable by the Government for financing its services and implementation of development programes
- Classified into two:
1. Recurrent Revenue

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Finances needed to pay for the operating costs of running the government services.

Main sources of this revenue are:
* Fines and fees
* Taxes e.g. VAT, P.A.Y.E
* Duties e.g. custom duty, excise duty
* Investment revenue etc.

\section*{1.Appropriation in Aid}
- Is a form of revenue that the Treasury allows an accounting officer to collect and use in addition to amounts issued from the exchequer.
2. Development Revenue

Finances needed to implement development programes and projects.
Main sources are:
- Sale of non strategic assets
- Grants
- Loans quarterly in order to implement their planned activities.

\section*{Budgeting-Facility level}
$\square$ The budgetary process is carried out in tandem with the planning process.
Technical and financial units work together in deriving costs of what is being proposed in the plan.
Budgeting Process:
- Consider each objective separately.
- Examine the approach accepted by the planning group noting the measures being proposed.
- Define the operational targets and specify the operational output and the quantification.
- List the activities, including support activities necessary to reach the operational targets, and quantify these activities Assess the costs related to activities.
- Develop a table that shows for each stratum of the plan, the objectives, approaches (strategies), activities, targets and costs.
- Apply the costs of each target to a line-item budget format by categories ( personnel, supplies, equipment, transportation, emergency funds for, say, malaria epidemic control and research).
- Prepare a clear presentation of the budget linked to the plan and be ready to defend it. Determine whether existing budgetary control procedures must undergo some changes and formulate recommendations for the proposed changes.
- Note the major budgetary implications of a decentralized organization.
- Costs of large categories of activities may already be known from previous planning exercises or from a continuous programme of activity monitoring. If not, analyse tasks for major activity linked to every target and determine:

The time taken to accomplish every task.
The labour costs to estimate the staff needed.
The work that can be achieved in one day, one week, and one month.
The quantity and type of supplies and equipment required to accomplish the tasks and the costs.
- Factors that may assist and should be taken into account in assessing cost/efficiency are:
- Human resources relative to plans, and efficiency of human resources in relation to expectations.
- Financial resources intended for implementation and correct use of these resources.
- Suitability of the sequence of activities and the appropriateness and timeliness of the logistical support.
- Collaboration with other services in the health, social and economic sectors.

Applicability of operational plans.
- Work schedules.
- The methods applied.
- During the planning phase. the cost analysis will be stratified so as to permit analysis of each activity as well as of the programme as a whole. This operation may require additional human and other resources and may considerably increase the volume of reporting, but the results will permit substantial improvements in the programme's operating efficiency and considerable savings in the long term.

Cash management
$\checkmark$ Cash is the most important asset an organization can have. Its availability or lack of it can determine the success or failure of an organization.
Why manage cash?
$\checkmark$ Inflows and outflows do not coincide i.e. cash needs vary.
$\checkmark$ Cash is usually managed through preparation of a cash budget that can be prepared to capture the inflows and outflows on monthly basis for the next year and quarterly for second year.
Areas to monitor
$\checkmark$ Imprests - especially for projects that require liquidation of advance before additional funds can be released.
$\checkmark$ IOU's - they are illegal
$\checkmark$ Substantial cash purchases - room for rent seeking
$\checkmark$ The 'big three' i.e. Receivables, Payables and Inventory

\section*{PUBLIC RELATIONS AND CUSTOMER CARE}

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a social process of managing all networks of communication to ensure mutual understanding between the service provider (health worker) and the customer (e.g. patient from OPD or Nurse in the Theatre).

Relationships are preceded by social communication for both internal and External Customers. Communication in this context relates to both verbal and nonverbal. In order to achieve effective communication there is a need to ensure the existence of the 'integrated marketing system' (Triangular model).

\section*{Triangular Model}

\section*{Integrated System}

Integrated System Interactive Marketing +ve or -ve (EMPLOYEES) (EXT. CUSTOMERS) (ORGANISATION) HIGH PERFORMANCE
The Customers in Health System
The customers in health systems can be categorized as internal customer and external customers.

\section*{Internal Customers}

Internal customers include all individuals, departments, sections within the organization who use the output of your job (e.g. Pharmacist \& the Accountant of the Hospital). The satisfaction of the internal customers is crucial to the achievement of the organizational goals and positive image. Internal customer relationship is a crucial part of CRM as when it fails it gives room for Gossips that distorts the image of the organization.

\section*{External Customers}

External customers include individuals, organizations and anybody outside the organization who buy/use/ the goods and services provided by the organization. In the case of Health service; suppliers, patients, regulatory bodies and the like form the external customers.
The concept of Integrated Marketing targets the employees, employers \& external Customers given that it highlights the roles of each of the above mentioned. It is important to note that a customer may belong to various categories.
Categories of Customers
- Internal Vs External
- Industrial Vs Individual
- Existing Vs New
- Physical Product Customers Vs Service Customers
- Short term Vs Long term
- General Vs Prestigious (VIP)

\section*{Types of customers in the individual markets (human-human interaction) \\ The silent (uncommunicative) Customer}

Is shy, quiet or deliberately uncommunicative; scarcely talks (e.g. a patient with an STD)

\section*{The talkative Customer}

Is friendly and has a sense of humor, willing to talk about different issues

\section*{The sarcastic (over-familiar) Customer}

Talks a lot; often fast, without stop, could be the most difficult customer (e.g. a doctor who is a patient)

\section*{The good-nurtured Customer}

Says yes to almost everything but will not make a decision (e.g. a Nurse who fears a doctor or a doctor with his boss
The angry-bad tempered Customer
Is irritated with something small (trivial)
The hostile, rude, argumentative Customer
Very difficult customer; she/he always attacks you on whatever you say to challenge your position (a Pharmacist when procuring the drugs)

\section*{The aloof/disinterested customer}

Similar to the silent customers, very reserved.
The busy Customer (Impulse Customer)
Appears busy, has hurried movements and air of anxiety and can't concentrate on service offered at the counter.
The invisible Customer/Telephone Customer

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

This is a customer you can't see and must be handled carefully, has never complained.

\section*{The dictatorial Customer}

Has a power complex and wishes to put you at a disadvantage. His/her actions are discourteous and intolerable.

\section*{The hesitant/suspicious/uncertain Customer}

Is challengeable, uncertain and lacks confidence.
The 'woman' type (or men type!) customer.
Focus on high quality with low price

\section*{Expectations of Customers}

Every time clients come for health services they have expectations. Consumer expectations are an important factor when considering improvement of health systems management. The product of Health Systems Management is consumer satisfaction, which can only be achieved if the following are observed in the interest of the client:
- Speed and timeliness of service delivery/Punctuality
- Courtesy and helpfulness
- Service reliability
- Quality Service
- Consistency in service delivery
- Accuracy of paperwork
- Positive attitude from staff
- User-friendly systems/
- less bureaucracy
- Aesthetic environment

In order to improve customer relationship management at any level, it is necessary to know your customers, their needs and expectations very well (Carlzon, 1989). At the same time it is important to be clear on your role in order to meet your consumer demand to the level of their expectation.

\section*{The Value of the Relationship}

Customer relationship management is about adding value to the relationship between the service provider and the client/customer. The result of value added relationship include increased loyalty of the customers, increased customers engagement in marketing the organization and finally improved performance and synergy on the basis of team spirit.

\section*{Internal Relationship Marketing System}

Internal relationship management system recognizes the application of networking in working relationships between the organization and its customers. All employees are customers of managers who wish to carry out the departments` objectives.

The crucial aspects of internal relationship marketing system include the employer's engagement with those who create value as well as the need to brand the organization positively both inside and outside. Integrating psychological contract built from social capital reduces insecurity by filling in the gaps in the relationship not covered by a formal written employment contract. It is important to display commitment on the part of the organization to care for the personal and
social needs of the employees who are customers of the managers who wish to carry out the firm's objectives.

\section*{Common terminology used in disaster management}

A Hazard: A hazard is a dangerous phenomenon, substance, human activity or condition that may cause the loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

A Natural Hazard: Natural processes or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

A Geological Hazard: Geological process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.
Technological Hazard: A hazard originating from technological or industrial conditions, including accidents, dangerous procedures, infrastructure failures or specific human activities, that may cause loss of life, injury, illness or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

A Disaster: A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental loses which exceed the ability of the affected community/society to cope using its own resources.

A Disaster Risk: The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period.

Disaster Risk Management: The systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Disaster Risk Reduction: The concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.

Risk Assessment: A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analyzing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property, services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend.

Climate Change: A change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variabilities of its properties and that persist for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate Change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use.

Adaptation to Climate Change: The adjustment in natural or human activities in responses to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects which moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities.

Vulnerability: The characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that makes it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard.

Disaster occurs when a hazard results in devastation that leaves communities or even whole nations unable to cope unaided but disasters are neither inevitable nor 'natural'. There is no such thing as a 'natural' disaster. Many hazards are natural and usually inevitable, like cyclones, floods, droughts and earthquakes. They are 'hazards' in that they can potentially harm people, economies and the environment if they are not adequately prepared.
Moreover, the world has witnessed an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of disasters. Disaster cases are rising throughout the world due to a number of factors that include:
- more frequent extreme weather events
- agricultural production systems that increase risk
- population growth combined with demographic change and movements leading, for instance, unplanned urbanization, growing demand for food, industrial goods and services; and
- Over-exploitation of natural resources.

While better emergency response systems will save lives and properties, many of these losses can be avoided - or reduced - if appropriate policies and programmes are instituted to address the root causes and set in place mitigation, preparedness and response mechanisms that are effectively integrated into overall development planning.
These issues were debated during the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (January 2005). It was therefore insisted on the need to move from theory to concrete action in disaster risk reduction.

\section*{Hazard and Disaster:}
- closely related terms
- However, a hazard is a natural event while the disaster is its consequence
- Hazard" refers to the event which may cause disaster
- They could be either man-made or naturally occurring hazards in our environment
Disaster is combination of two words: 'des' meaning evil and 'astre' meaning star
- Disaster therefore means evil star. A complete definition of disaster provided by Turner (1976) as 'an event, concentrated in time and space, which threatens a society or a subdivision of a society with major unwanted consequences as a result of the collapse of precautions which had hitherto been culturally accepted as adequate'
- Common definition: major misfortune which disrupts the normal functioning of the society
- Emergency:
- The term 'emergency' is used to describe the crisis which a community has great difficulty to cope with
- External assistance is needed to cope with the emergencies
- political emergency, drought, famine etc.
- Calamity:

Calamity is defined as deep distress, disaster to a lesser degree of damage, which disrupts the normal functioning of the people of a society

\section*{- Vulnerability:}
- "Vulnerability" basically means susceptibility of a population or system (e.g., a hospital, water supply and sewage system, or aspects of infrastructure) to the effects of the hazard
- "The extent to which a community, structure, service or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted by the impact of particular disaster hazard..."
- Its magnitude is expressed on a scale from 0.0 (No damage or loss) to 1.0 (total loss).

\section*{- Risk:}
- The probability that a particular system or population will be affected by hazards is known as the "risk."
- Risk is a function of the vulnerability and the hazard, and is expressed as follows:
- Risk $=$ Vulnerability $x$ Hazard. It means, the risk increases if the vulnerability of the population or the systems is more; and also of the magnitude of the hazard is more.

\section*{Characterization of Disasters}

\section*{Types disasters:}

Various types of disasters have been categorized under five sub groups
- Sub-Group 1: Water and Climate Related Hazards.
(i) Floods, (ii) Droughts, (iii) Cyclones, (iv) Tornadoes \& Hurricanes, (v) Hailstorm, (vi) Cloudburst, (vii) Snow Avalanches, (viii) Heat \& Cold Waves, (ix) Sea Erosion, (x) Thunder and Lightening
- Sub-Group 2: Geologically related Hazards

Earthquakes, (ii) Landslides, (iii) Mudflows, (iv) Dam Bursts, (v) Dam Failures
- Sub-Group 3: Chemical, Industrial \& Nuclear related Disasters
- Sub-Group 4: Accident Related Disasters.

Road, Rail and other Transportation accidents, (ii) Major Building Collapse, (iii) Serial Bomb Blasts, (iv) Festival related Disasters, (v) Fires, (vi) Forest Fires
- Sub-Group 5: Biologically Related Disasters
(i) Biological Disasters, (ii) Epidemics, (iii) Cattle Epidemics, (iv) Pest Attacks, (v) Food Poisoning

\section*{Similarly, disasters can be classified as follows:}
1. Anthropogenic hazards: These are human made hazards such as
a. anthropogenic pollutant hazards which come as a result of transformation of the nature by human beings e.g. production of chemical,
b. anthropogenic pollutant hazards which come as a result of transformation of nature by human being e.g. nuclear plant, industrial pollution
2. Environmental degradation. These hazards can be anthropogenic, socio-natural or natural
3. Biological hazards. These hazards include anthropogenic, socio-natural or natural. Examples are: epidemics, pandemics, locusts bioterrorism/biological weapons
4. Geological/geotectonic origin: The category include land movement, volcanoes, earthquake and tsunami
5. Geological/geomorphism origin: These include land slide, avalanche/snow slide, land and coastal erosion
6. Meteorological and climate origin: The include hurricanes, tropical storms and tornados
7. Hydraulic origin: food, water stagnation

The last two can be combined together as hydro-meteorological
8. Socio-natural hazards. Examples are: Flood, Desertification, Drought, Deforestation, Climate change and Global warming
9. Occupational/ergonomic hazards. These are occupational accidents arising due to work position at work place.
10. Physical hazards: these are heat, cold, global warming and climate change
11. Mechanical hazards. These are accidents
12. Psychological hazards. Examples are stress, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression and mental disorders
13. Agricultural hazards. Pesticides, fertilizers

What is understanding hazard?
Understanding hazard involves:
- How hazards arise
- Probability of occurrence and magnitude
- Physical mechanism of destruction
- Eg. In earthquakes, most fatalities are due to building collapse. Focus should be on prevention of building collapse
- In floods, death occurs due to drowning in fast flowing currents. Focus is on limiting the exposure of people by keeping them out of track of water
- Elements most vulnerable
- Consequence of damage
- Damage to factory can lead to jobless people

\section*{AIMS OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT}
- Reduce (Avoid, if possible) the potential losses from hazards.
- Assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims when necessary.
- Achieve rapid and durable recovery.

\section*{Stages of disaster management}
- Pre-disaster phase: taken prior to the occurrence of any disasters. For. E.g. Construction of buildings which can withstand the impact of disaster. It is also called 'mitigation phase'.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Actual disaster phase: During this phase, timely warning is to be given to the people so that they can timely take action to face the disaster. It is also called the 'preparatory phase'.
- Post-disaster phase: It includes the measures that are taken after the occurrence of a disaster. It further includes three phases:
- Relief phase: immediately after the occurrence of a disaster.
- Rehabilitation phase: to rehabilitate the community through the development of house, restoring water supply, sanitation, food and providing loans so that the people are brought back to the normal work.
- Reconstruction Phase: It involves developing new colonies to make the disaster affected people to settle permanently.

\section*{"Five-R Strategy"}

Disaster management is based on "Five-R Strategy" of
- Rescue
- Relief
- Restoration
- Rehabilitation
- Reconstruction

\section*{Disaster risk management}

\section*{Preparatory phase}
- The preparatory phase of disaster response includes all of the activities that help a society and the disaster agencies to prepare for a disaster event. These activities are broadly classified as:
- disaster prevention:
- The objective of prevention is to prevent the disaster from occurring.
- disaster mitigation
- Disaster mitigation accepts that some natural event may occur, but it tries to lessen the impact by improving the common ability
- disaster preparedness.
- Disaster preparedness assumes that a disaster will occur; it focuses on structuring the emergency response and on laying a framework for recovery.

\section*{Disaster mitigation}
- Disaster Mitigation is essentially measures taken in advance of a disaster aimed at minimizing or eliminating the impact of disaster on community and environment
- 2 components: reducing hazard and reducing vulnerability

\section*{Reducing hazard vs reducing vulnerability}
- Reducing hazard:
- protection against threat by removing the cause of threat
- Eg. Construction of levees along banks of river to reduce chance of flooding
- Tree plantation
- Reducing vulnerability:
- reducing the effect of threat
- Eg. Constructing buildings as per bylaws in NBC
- Most of the natural hazards are unpreventable, therefore, we mostly work towards reducing vulnerability

\section*{Disaster Mitigation Measures:}
- Passive mitigation measure
- Active mitigation measures

\section*{Passive mitigation measures:}

Authoritics prevent undesirod actions through conimols and penaltics by:
- Requirement to conform with design codes
- Checking compliance of controls on-site
- Imposing court procecdings, fines, closure orders on offeroders
- Control of landi use
- Denial of utilitios and infrastmacture to areas where developanent is undesired
- Compulsory insumance

Requirements of passive comtrol systems
a. An existing and enforceable system of conirol
b. Acceptance by the affected commmity of the objoctives and the authority imposing the controls
c. The oconomic capability of the affected commmmity to comply with the regulations.

\section*{Active mitigation measures}

Authorities promote desired actions through incentives like:
Planning control dispensations
- Training and cducation
- Ecomomic assistamoe (grants and preferential loans)
- Subsidies on safeqy equipment, safer building materials, etc.

目 Provision of facilities: safer buildings, refuge points, storage
- Public information dissemnimation and awareness raising
- Promotion of volumtary insumace
- Creation of community organizations

Aotive Progroms
a. Aim to create a self-perpethating safety colture in arcas of weak authority or poor ability to comply with existing controls.
b. Require large budgets, skilled mampower and extensive administration.
c. Are usefal in areas of low income, mul areas or elsew here where there is no external jumisdiction over land use or building activity.

\section*{Phases of disaster mitigation}
- Risk analysis
- Prevention
- Preparedness

\section*{Risk Analysis:}
- What is risk?
- Expected loss caused by a particular phenomenon
- Risk analysis:
- Process of determining the nature and scale of losses which can be anticipated in a particular area.
- It involves analysis of
- the probability of a hazard of a particular magnitude occurring (called hazard assessment)
- the elements susceptible to potential loss or damage ( called elements at risk)
- the nature of vulnerability of those elements (vulnerability analysis), and a specified future time period (loss estimation)

\section*{Hazard assessment}
- The process of estimating the probability of occurrence of a damaging phenomenon of given magnitude in a given area
- Based on collection of historical and scientific data
- Points to be considered in Hazard assessment:
- History
- Probability of various intensities
- Maximum threat

Possible secondary hazards: eg. Earthquake can cause dam burst

\section*{Elements at risk:}
- People: loss of life,
- Personal health: injury or disease,
- Damage, destruction of property,
- Damage, destruction of infrastructure, public service systems,
- Damage, destruction of environment,
- Damage, destruction of crops,
- Disruption, loss of production,
- Disruption, loss of livelihood,
- Disruption, loss of essential services,
- Disruption, loss of national infrastructure,
- Disruption to governmental process, systems,
- Loss to national, local economies,
- Disruption, loss of community or lifestyle, and
- Sociological and psychological consequences.

\section*{Effects of disaster on health:}
1. Population density
2. Population displacement
3. Disruption and contamination of water supply and sanitation services
4. Disruption of public health programme
5. Economic changes that favour breeding of factors
6. Displacement of domestic and wild animals
7. Provision of emergency food, water and shelter in disaster situation
8. Climate change and health issues

Disaster building block:
1. Disaster/impact
2. Response
3. Rehabilitation
4. Reconstruction
5. Mitigation
9. Preparedness

In comprehensive emergency management model (CEMM), there should be disaster preparedness in such as way that if there is a disaster, there is effective disaster response and therefore, able to deal effectively with rehabilitation and reconstruction. Moreover, disaster mitigation is crucial in dealing with disaster.

\section*{Vulnerability analysis:}
- A process which results in an understanding of the types and levels of exposure of persons, property, and the environment to the effects of identified hazards at a particular time.
- Vulnerability $=$ People + Condition + Place + Time + Event
- vulnerability also differs according to intensity of the hazard

Types of Vulnerability:
- Physical Vulnerability
- Economic
- Social
- environmental

\section*{Physical Vulnerability:}
- pertaining to matters of location, structural and infrastructural conditions etc
- Includes
- Buildings at risk
- Unsafe infrastructure: eg. Transportation system, sanitation system etc.
- Unsafe critical facilities
- Rapid urbanization
- Agricultural-primarily considering physical assets-related, but opportunity loss potential of essential natural resources, crops, trees, livestock, fisheries, also should be recognized.
Economic Vulnerability:
- Determined by evaluating
- the direct loss potential of economic assets
- indirect loss potential
- secondary effects
- Direct Loss Potential
- destruction of buildings, plants, facilities, raw material, products,
- Replacement costs,
- Loss of employment,
- Crop losses, and
- Damage to means of production.
- Indirect Loss Potential
- Impact of lost production,
- Impact of lost employment,
- Loss of markets,
- Loss of opportunity,
- Loss to consequential income-earning activities.
- Secondary Effects
- Inflation,
- Indebtedness,
- Labour migration,

\section*{Social Vulnerability:}
- determined by the perception of risk and the ability of people to take measures to reduce that risk
- more difficult to measure than either physical or economic vulnerability
- Critical Indicators of Perceived Risk, Ability of Response:
- Poverty, limitation of resources, reserves or options,
- Degree of public awareness about the immediate social and physical environments
- Prior personal experience of specific risk, consequence.
- Demographic Considerations:
- Magnitudes, total population,
- Concentration densities,
- Demographic distinctions, vulnerable groups of socially disadvantaged people or those requiring special attention. These include children, disabled, elderly people, women

\section*{Capabilities:}

When conducting vulnerability analysis, special note should be taken of positive attributes able to be identified that may contribute to an enhanced ability to prevent or mitigate the effects of a disaster, or which may strengthen a community's ability to respond effectively to the hazard

\section*{Technocratic view for managing the risk}
- Problem-Physical vulnerability
- Symptoms as perceived- High death toll and damages of infrastructure attribute to severity of hazard, extensive and recurrent rehabilitation needs.
- The causes- uncontrolled characteristics of hazard events, physiography of the prone areas, lack of inadequacy of protective infrastructure, failure of forecasting and warning.

\section*{Risk Management Process}

Risk management has three components namely:
- Risk identification
- Risk reduction
- Risk transfer

Risk identification has to be done through mapping and using other available technological options
It is usual to allocate risk management to special body at national level. Usually, it is a national disaster management organization at national level. Others support should be obtained within a National Action Plan for disaster management.
At local, it may be the responsibility of a disaster mitigation committee, which administers risk management.

\section*{Risk reduction:}

Effective risk reduction involves mitigation measures in hazard prone areas. It may also involve overcoming the socio-economic, institutional and political barriers to the adoption of effective risk reduction strategies and measures in developing countries.

\section*{Risk Management:}

This is the process by which assessed risks are mitigated, minimized or controlled through engineering, management of land use prances or other operational means. This involves the optimal allocation of available resources in support of group goals

\section*{Risk Transfer:}

Effective risk transfer involves different tools such as insurances; tax polices special measures focused on land management. Organizational structures, policies, legislation etc is required for effective implementation of risk transfer strategies for a country or local government areas.

\section*{Steps in Hazard analysis}
- Understand the type and nature of hazard
- Collect the data from history about frequency, duration, controllability etc.
- Vulnerability analysis: physical, economic etc.

\section*{PROJECT MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Planning}

Planning is making decisions about which courses of action to follow. It is the root to objective where it involves conceptualizing and anticipating future action

\section*{It includes the following activities:}
- Establishing objectives to determine the end result;
- Developing strategies to determine how to reach objectives, by when, and by whom;
- Preparing budgets to determine the cost of using resources;
- Establishing policies to have standing decisions on recurring situations;
- Establishing standards to ensure continued quality of services and products.

\section*{Importance of planning}
- Gives a sense of direction.
- Focuses attention on objectives.
- Involve others -participation, teamwork.
- Helps anticipate problems and cope with any change in an organization.
- Enhances appropriate allocation of resources.
- Helps in coordination
- Leads to more effectiveness and efficiency of services

Key elements of planning
- Knowing where we are (Situation)
- Deciding where we want to go (Vision/Objectives)
- What do we need to reach where we want to go (Resources)
- How we are going there (Method/process/how)
- Deciding how far we can get towards your target in a period of time (Time line/When)
- How will we know when we get there?

This requires the development of measurable indicators for monitoring progress and evaluating results
- How far we have gone
- Where we are not on target
- How we can do better in future
- Amending the implementation plan (RE-planning

\section*{THE PLANNING CYCLE}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_bac99fef57652838f07cg-86.jpg?height=928&width=1473&top_left_y=1455&top_left_x=288)

Who should plan?

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Planning should be a participatory process
- Community /key stakeholders must be involved through the process, e. g in doing the contextual and situational analysis, setting priorities e.t.c.
- Basic components of every organization with which the manager must work are people, things and ideas.

\section*{Rationale for Participatory planning}
- Mobilization and allocation of resources to different health problems
- Participation is open-ended hence allows greater participation (Ownership and sustainability)
- Guide the anticipation of potential constraints and solutions to achieving the vision systematic and predictable way
- Promote synergy and greater coordination of health problems in a multi-stakeholders' environment

\section*{Key Steps in Planning}
1. Situation analysis
2. Setting priority
3. Options appraisal
4. Programming
5. Implementation and Monitoring
6. Evaluation

\section*{Situation analysis}

Improving the understanding of the current situation in order to:
- Provide a common reference point for the planning process
- Allow the selection of priority areas of concern for planning

SA outlines and assesses 3 broad areas
- Demographic situation and health needs
- Services and resources
* Socioeconomic Status
* Health related services of other sectors
* Geographic and topographic pattern
* Present infrastructure and service pattern
* Existing service resources
* Effectiveness and efficiency of current services
- Policy and political environment (General, Govt. Policies)

\section*{Setting priority}
- Making choices among major needs so as to allocate resources efficiently.
- Consider the following in setting priority
- Magnitude of the issue/Problem
- Who is determining the needs
- Target group
- Cost, ease and effectiveness of intervention
- Political context

\section*{Options appraisal}
- Process of deciding between alternative approaches to achieve an objective
- Determine the objectives of the activity being appraised
- Identify alternative options (exclude unfeasible and uneconomical option)
- Identify resources required to achieve each option and the benefit of each option
- Cost the resources required
- A good option appraisal should;
- Present quantifiable and non-quantifiable costs and benefits
- Explicitly recognize and incorporate the need for other perspective
- Recognize the resource and financial implication
- Examine the technical feasibility
- Consider the process effects
- Set out information on the methodology used
- Perform where necessary sensitivity analysis
- Set out key assumptions
- Use of sustainability Grid

\section*{Programming}
- Budgeting and Developing of a plan of action
- This process is carried out for each priority area and its associated set of targets.
- It translates the results of the earlier decisions into a series of programs each with a budget and resources

\section*{Common Planning Tools}
- Logical Framework
- Gantt Charts
- Activity Schedule

\section*{Logical Framework}

A tool to help designers of projects think logically about:
- what the project is trying to achieve (Purpose),
- what things the project need to do to bring that about (Outputs)
- what needs to be done to produce these outputs (Activities)
- What is required to implement the activities (Input)
- What potential problems could affect the success of the project
- How the progress and ultimate success of the project will be measured

\section*{Advantages of Log Frame}
- It brings together in one place a statement of all the key components of a project
- It presents them in a systematic, concise and coherent way, thus clarifying and exposing the logic of how the project is expected to work
- It separates out the various levels in the hierarchy of objectives, helping to ensure that inputs and outputs are not confused with each other or with objectives and that wider ranging objectives are not overlooked
- It clarifies the relationships which underlie judgments about likely efficiency and effectiveness of projects
- It identifies the main factors related to the success of the project
- It provides a basis for monitoring and evaluation by identifying indicators of success, and means of quantification or assessment

\section*{Gantt Charts}
- A special chart used by project planners to illustrate the project schedule from the start to the end
- Shows the broad work breakdown structure of a project

\section*{Project Activity Schedule}

\section*{Budgeting}
- Determination of cost of inputs and activities required to implement a plan
- Personnel costs
- Non labor charges: equipment, travel, reproduction of materials, computer use, office space, supplies etc
- Administrative costs
- Overheads eg. Staff benefits etc

\section*{Implementation and monitoring}

Implementation is the process of transforming the broad program into more specific timed and budgeted sets of tasks and activities. It is the action portion of the plan. Drawing up a more operational plan or a work plan and taking action accordingly.Implementation involves securing community participation for launching the project, co-ordination of activities, monitoring, and
taking care of contingencies. Project implementation includes various management functions Including
- Co-ordination
- Organizing
- Staffing
- Controlling
- Team-building
- Monitoring
- Contingency Management
- Monitoring - Continuous assessment of the progress of an activities over time. Observes whether an activity or service is occurring as planned based on activity plans and schedules

A good monitoring system ensures that the programme interventions stay on course by:
- checking that activities are implemented
- measuring progress towards objectives
- identifying problems as they come up
- identifying strengths that can be built on.
- adapting to changing circumstances.
- It uses the systematic collection of data on specified indicators to inform management and the main stakeholders of an ongoing operation of the extent of progress and achievement of results in the use of allocated funds.

\section*{EVALUATION}

Definition: Evaluation means measurement, appraisal, or making judgments on the output and impact of the project in terms of the objectives.
It is the periodic assessment of the relevance, performance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability, and benefits to the target community
Evaluations are conducted to determine whether a project has met its objective/goals.
The process of determining whether the program is achieving it's purpose, whether it should be continued or terminated, and how it can be improved or better managed.

\section*{The purpose of evaluation}
- To improve health programmes and the services of delivering them
- Guide the allocation of financial and human resources
- Provides a basis for the next assessment hence a fresh lead in to the planning spiral
- Evaluation is used to determine whether
- The activities were worth carrying out
- The activity should be continued or not
- It accomplished the objectives it set out to achieve
- It should be extended here or elsewhere
- Modification of the activity might make a difference to its performance
- To justify spending on an activity

\section*{EVALUATION CYCLE}
1. Define the purpose of the evaluation

Who wants the evaluation, why and what how are they going to use the results
2. Define the priority areas to be evaluated. This includes the most important area to be evaluated - e.g projects' progress towards reaching its goals and objectives, technical aspects and so on
3. Information collection plan: Use the focus areas and list:

What key factors (indicators) will be researched on each area,
The source of information (i.e. the data collection tool and where that information is to be found)
4. The implementation plan.
- Decide who will participate.
- Make a budget.
- A list of participants,
- Detailed calendar of tasks and responsibilities, including a target date for report completion,
- If instruments (interviews, surveys, etc.) are needed, these can be designed immediately after the planning session, and field-tested according to the plan.
5. Analyse and organize the information.

How is the information to be analysed and by whom? Who will develop the final conclusions and recommendations? Make an outline of the final report. Decide how much data will be needed, and what limits of time and other resources affect the work of tabulation.

\section*{6. Communicating the findings and making follow- up}

A follow-up plan should include
a). An agreement on specific tasks/actions to be taken by the donor agency, the project implementer, and the beneficiary organization to meet the evaluation's recommendations,
b). Designation of persons to do each follow-up activity,
c). An estimate of dates for implementing each activity
d). The date when the activity is to be completed.

\section*{Types of evaluation}
1. Process evaluation

Internal evaluation - periodic self evaluation of a project including review of goals, strategies and work plans. Answers the questions about : HOW the program is implemented and how the outcomes are achieved

\section*{Components of process evaluation}

Relevance - rationale for adopting the community based health care policies and practices. Measures the response of the project to essential human needs and social and health policies and priorities
Adequacy - sufficient attention has been paid to certain previously determined courses of action Process - comparison of actual with scheduled activities, the identification of reasons for achievements or short comings and indications for remedies for any shortcomings Purpose is to facilitate the monitoring and operational control of on going activities

Efficiency- an expression of the relationship between results obtained from a health program or activity and the efforts expended in terms of human, financial and other resources. - aims at improving implementation
Effectiveness - expression of the desired effect of a program, service institution or support activity in reducing a health problem. Measures the degree of attainment

\section*{2. Impact evaluation}

Aims at identifying any necessary change in the direction of health programs so as to increase their contribution to overall health and socioeconomic development.
- Impact evaluation measures whether or not a project achieved its goals and attempts to see what impact the project had on participants
- An independent consultant may conduct the impact evaluation
- Scope includes all stake holders - donor agency, international cooperating agency, local project organization and the beneficially community
an expression of the overall effect of a program, service or institution on health and related sociodemographic development

\section*{INDICATORS FOR EVALUATION}

Indicators are variables that help to measure changes.
The indicators for evaluation include:
- Health policy indicators which include
- Political commitment
- Resource allocation
- Degree of equitable distribution of the resources
- Level of community involvement

Social and economic indicators

\section*{BENEFITS OF PROGRAM EVALUATION}
- Reflect on progress; see where we are going and where we are coming from and improve programs
- Influence policy makes and funders
- Build community capacity and engage communities
- Benefits of program evaluation
- Share what works and what doesn't work with other communities
- Ensure funding and sustainability
- Strengthen accountability
