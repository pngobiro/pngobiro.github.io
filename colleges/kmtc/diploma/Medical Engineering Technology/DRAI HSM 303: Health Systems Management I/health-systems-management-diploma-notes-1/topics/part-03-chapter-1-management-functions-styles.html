                        <p>Authoritarian leadership styles allow a leader to impose expectations and define outcomes.</p>
                        <p>A one-person show can turn out to be successful in situations when a leader is the most knowledgeable in the team. Although this is an efficient strategy in time-constrained periods, creativity will be sacrificed since input from the team is limited.</p>
                        <p>The authoritarian leadership style is also used when team members need clear guidelines.</p>
                        <p>An authoritarian leader behaves in a commanding and strongly controlling manner.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages:</h4>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Laissez-faire leadership</h3>
                        <p>It is also known as, a delegative leadership style, it focuses on delegating initiative to team members. This can be a successful strategy if team members are competent, take responsibility and prefer engaging in individual work. However, disagreements among the members may split and divide a group, leading to poor motivation and low morale.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Transactional leadership</h3>
                        <p>Transactional leadership styles use "transactions" between a leader and his or her followers rewards, punishments and other exchanges - to get the job done. The leader sets clear goals, and team members know how they'll be rewarded for their compliance. This "give and take" leadership style is more concerned with following established routines and procedures in an efficient manner, than with making any transformational changes to an organization.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Transformational Leadership</h3>
                        <p>In transformational leadership styles, the leader inspires his or her followers with a vision and then encourages and empowers them to achieve it. The leader also serves as a role model for the vision.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
