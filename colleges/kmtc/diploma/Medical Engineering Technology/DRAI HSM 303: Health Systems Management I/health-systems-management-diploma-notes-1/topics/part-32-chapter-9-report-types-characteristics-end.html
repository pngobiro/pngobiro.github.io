                        <span class="heading-text">TYPES OF REPORTS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Long Report and Short Reports:</h3>
                        <p>These kinds of reports are quite clear, as the name suggests. A two-page report or sometimes referred to as a memorandum is short, and a thirty-page report is absolutely long. But what makes a clear division of short reports or long reports? Well, usually, notice that longer reports are generally written in a formal manner.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Internal and External Reports:</h3>
                        <p>As the name suggests, an internal report stays within a certain organization or group of people. In the case of office settings, internal reports are for within the organization.</p>
                        <p>We prepare external reports, such as a news report in the newspaper about an incident or the annual reports of companies for distribution outside the organization. We call these as public reports.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vertical and Lateral Reports:</h3>
                        <p>This is about the hierarchy of the reports' ultimate target. If the report is for your management or for your mentees, it's a vertical report. Wherever a direction of upwards or downwards comes into motion, we call it a vertical report.</p>
                        <p>Lateral reports, on the other hand, assist in coordination in the organization. A report traveling between units of the same organization level (for example, a report among the administration and finance departments) is lateral.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Periodic Reports:</h3>
                        <p>Periodic reports are sent out on regularly pre-scheduled dates. In most cases, their direction is upward and serves as management control. Some, like annual reports, is not vertical but is a Government mandate to be periodic in nature.</p>
                        <p>That is why we have annual or quarterly or half-yearly reports. If they are this frequent, it only makes sense to pre-set the structure of these reports and just fill in the data every period. That's exactly what happens in most cases too.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Formal and Informal Reports:</h3>
                        <p>Formal reports are meticulously structured. They focus on objectivity and organization, contain deeper detail, and the writer must write them in a style that eliminates factors like personal pronouns.</p>
                        <p>Informal reports are usually short messages with free-flowing, casual use of language. We generally describe the internal report/memorandum as an informal report. For example, a report among your peers, or a report for your small group or team, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Informational and Analytical Reports:</h3>
                        <p>Informational reports (attendance reports, annual budget reports, monthly financial reports, and such) carry objective information from one area of an organization to maybe a larger system.</p>
                        <p>Analytical reports (scientific research, feasibility reports, and employee appraisals) show attempts to solve actual problems. These analytical reports usually require suggestions at the end.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proposal Reports:</h3>
                        <p>These kinds of reports are like an extension to the analytical/problem-solving reports. A proposal is a document one prepares to describe how one organization can provide a solution to a problem they are facing.</p>
                        <p>There's usually always a need to prepare a report in a business set-up. The end goal is usually very solution-oriented. We call such kinds of reports as proposal reports.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Functional Reports:</h3>
                        <p>These kinds of reports include marketing reports, financial reports, accounting reports, and a spectrum of other reports that provide a function specifically. By and large, we can include almost all reports in most of these categories. Furthermore, we can include a single report in several kinds of reports.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Precision</h3>
                        <p>In a good report, the report writer is very clear about the exact and definite purpose of writing the report. His investigation, analysis, recommendations and others are directed by this central purpose.</p>
                        <p>Precision of a report provides the unity to the report and makes it a valuable document for best usage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Accuracy of Facts</h3>
                        <p>Information contained in a report must be based on accurate facts.</p>
                        <p>Since decisions are taken based on report information, any inaccurate information or statistics will lead to a wrong decision. It will hamper to ensure the achievement of the organizational goal.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Relevancy</h3>
                        <p>The facts presented in a report should not be only accurate but also be relevant. Irrelevant facts make a report confusing and likely to be misleading to make a proper decision.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Reader-Orientation</h3>
                        <p>While drafting any report, it is necessary to keep in mind about the person who is going to read it. That's why a good report is always reader oriented.</p>
                        <p>Reader's knowledge and level of understanding should be considered by the writer of the report. Well, reader-oriented information qualifies a report to be a good one.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Simple Language</h3>
                        <p>Simplicity is the best for anything. It is just another essential feature of a good report. A good report is written in simple language avoiding vague and unclear words.</p>
                        <p>The language of the report should not be influenced by the writer's emotion or goal. The message of a good report should be self-explanatory.</p>
                        <p>A good reporter should be careful of using simple sentences instead of using a complex sentence in the narration of facts.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Conciseness</h3>
                        <p>A good report should be concise but it does not mean that a report can never be long.</p>
                        <p>Rather it means that a good report or a business report is one that transmits maximum information with minimum words.</p>
                        <p>It avoids unnecessary detail and includes everything which are significant and necessary to present proper information.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Grammatical Accuracy</h3>
                        <p>A good report is free from errors. Any faulty construction of a sentence may make its meaning different to the reader's mind. And sometimes it may become confusing or ambiguous.</p>
                        <p>If a report is not accurate grammatically, then it will have lost its usefulness to its users.</p>
                        <p>So, while writing a report, a reporter should keep in head about the grammatical accuracy of his writing.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">8. Unbiased Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>Recommendation on report usually make effect on the reader mind.</p>
                        <p>So if recommendations are made at the end of a report, they must be impartial and objective.</p>
                        <p>They should come as logical conclusion for investigation and analysis.</p>
                        <p>A reporter should try to use universal and proven truth in his report rather than using the concept which is not yet established or completed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">9. Clarity</h3>
                        <p>Clarity depends on proper arrangement of facts. A good report is absolutely clear.</p>
                        <p>Reporter should make his purpose clear, define his sources, state his findings and finally make necessary recommendation.</p>
                        <p>To be an effective communication through report, A report must be clear to understand for making communication success.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">10. Attractive Presentation</h3>
                        <p>Presentation of a report is also a factor which should be consider for a good report. A good report provides a catchy and smart look and creates attention of the reader.</p>
                        <p>Structure, content, language, typing and presentation style of a good report should be attractive to make a clear impression in the mind of its reader.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">11. Complete Information</h3>
                        <p>A good report shown important information. Most of these information is analyzed as the basis of importancy. A good reporter has to show the skill in such cases efficiently.</p>
                        <p>A good reporter should have shown information as importance and not much so that the report become useless or vague but it should give the read a completeness feeling.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">12. Positivity</h3>
                        <p>A good report should have the positivity. It should narrate the positive statement instead of showing negative one. Showing positivity in report helps to observe the issue positively which is covered in a report.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">13. Summary</h3>
                        <p>A good report should have a summary by which the reader of the report can take a decision at all or stand on a decision what to do next in such condition.</p>
                        <p>A summary can reflect the whole picture at a glance. So, it has a large impact.</p>
                        <p>So, writing a summary is an important feature of a good report. A good reporter should not forget this.</p>
