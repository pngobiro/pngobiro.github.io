                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Healthcare financing refers to the "function of a health system concerned with the mobilization, accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the people, individually and collectively, in the health system.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of health financing is to make funding available, as well as to set the right financial incentives to providers, to ensure that all individuals have access to effective public health and personal health care"</p>
                        <p>Health financing is fundamental to the ability of health systems to maintain and improve human welfare.</p>
                        <p>At the extreme, without the necessary funds no health workers would be employed, no medicines would be available and no health promotion or prevention would take place.</p>
                        <p>However, financing is much more than a simple generation of funds.</p>
                        <p>To understand the nature of indicators that can be used to monitor and evaluate health systems financing requires explicit assessment of what it is expected to achieve.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the financing system is often divided conceptually into three inter-related functions</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">

                        </ol>
                        <p>According to the WHO framework for health systems, a well-functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines and technologies of assured quality, safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness, and their scientifically sound and cost-effective use.</p>
                        <p>To achieve these objectives, the following are needed:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <p>The purpose of health financing is to make funding available, as well as to set the right financial incentives to providers, to ensure that all individuals have access to effective public health and personal health care.</p>
                        <p>Different countries have adopted different health financing mechanisms depending on factors such as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">the economic basis or policy of the country where high-income countries are more likely to have Social Health Insurance.</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">International pressure also plays a significant role where for instance bodies such as the World Bank may advocate particular funding mechanisms.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nonetheless, no country has a single funding mechanism and hence the overall health system is funded through a mixed approach. Where there is mandatory health insurance, there are also other funding mechanisms such as donor funding, general tax revenue, payroll deductions etcetera.</p>
                        <p>Kenya has a mixed health financing system consisting of revenue collected by government through taxes, mandatory health insurance (NHIF), private health insurance, out of pocket payments and donor funding.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">SOURCES OF HEALTHCARE FINANCING</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Public Sources of healthcare financing.</h3>
                        <p>This is generally achieved either through tax-based funding or mandatory health insurance. The tax-based system is more common in high income countries where healthcare is funded through general tax revenue.</p>
                        <p>This ensures comprehensive cover for the general population since it includes even those not in the formal sector and equity is attained where progressive tax mechanisms are applied i.e. tax is paid according to income.</p>
                        <p>In Africa, the 2001 Abuja declaration urged African Union countries to allocate at least 15% of their national budgets to the health sector. However, most countries have less than 10% of total government expenditure devoted to healthcare with only 3 countries namely Tanzania, DRC and Mozambique having above 15% of government expenditure devoted to healthcare.</p>
                        <p>Mandatory health insurance refers to where there is a legal requirement for particular groups of the population to become members such as those in formal employment. In Africa, Kenya is one of the few countries that has implemented mandatory health insurance through the National Hospital Insurance Fund which was developed in 1966. Initially, it covered formal sector employees and their dependents only but it was expanded in 1998 to cover informal sector workers as well. Membership is mandatory to all formal sector workers and voluntary for informal sector workers. Those employed in the formal sector are subjected to income rated monthly contributions deducted from their income whereas those in the informal sector pay a flat rate contribution directly to NHIF.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Private sources of healthcare financing.</h3>
                        <p>This forms the largest proportion of health financing in most developing countries. Private health financing includes out of pocket spending by individuals and households, private health insurance, community-based insurance and donor funding.</p>
                        <p>Most health systems in Africa are funded primarily through out-of-pocket spending which can result into catastrophic health spending, i.e. a large proportion of the household income is spent seeking healthcare hence foregoing other goods and services. This impacts negatively on living standards where poor households are pushed further into poverty. Kenyans are becoming poorer due to high healthcare payments. Most households spend over a tenth of their budget on healthcare payments each year. The burden is highest among the poor who spent a third of their household hold expenditure on healthcare and studies report that about 1.48 million Kenyans are pushed below the national poverty line yearly as a result.</p>
                        <p>Private health insurance is where individuals arrange medical cover through insurance schemes and pay a regular premium based on different factors. There is a likelihood of a stratified healthcare system where the type of medical cover depends on ability to pay premiums with those who can afford to pay high premiums enjoying greater benefits. Most of these schemes are also tied to employment. Most developing countries including Kenya, rely heavily on donor funding in the form of grants, loans, either in kind or in cash, technical assistance, free drugs, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">User fees</h3>
                        <p>The term user fee relates to a charge made to the patient or user of the health service, tor treatment or service received. The fee might be for consultation, drugs and dressings, and diagnostic tests.</p>
                        <p>Fees are commonly charged for curative services since people are generally more willing to pay for a cure in the form of, say, drugs, than for promotive or preventive services.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prepayment (insurance)</h3>
                        <p>Prepayment (insurance) schemes operate to provide health care only for people who are members of the scheme. In order to join, it is necessary to make regular payment of a predetermined sum, which means that people pay whether they are healthy or not.</p>
                        <p>This payment entitles a person to receive health care for little or no extra charge when it is required. A major advantage of such form of health care financing is that the costs are shared between sick and healthy people.</p>
                        <p>Direct transfers and grants refer to the provision of a quantity of resources, whether money or supplies, which does not have to be repaid. The quantity of the transfer or grant will usually have to be re-negotiated in advance and it might be a regular payment or a one-off gift. The choice of financing methods will depend upon what it is hoped to be achieved with the health programme</p>

                        <p>Bbudgets for businesses or departments created for an accounting period, i.e., for one year.</p>
                        <p>However, the period could be less or more than a year.</p>
                        <p>Complete flexibility is there as the method remains the same, and the business can make or plan a budget for the period they want.</p>
                        <p>There are different types of budgets and, thus, budgeting methodologies.</p>

                        <h4>Master Budget</h4>
                        <p>The master budget is the sum total of the company's budget that includes the allocation of funds to different activities of the business. It evaluates the cost centres within the organization and allocates funds by including different factors. The master budget is developed by including different factors like sales, working capital, operating expenses, income sources, etc. This budget ensures that the managers are working in line with the goals and objectives of the business.</p>

                        <h4>Operating Budget</h4>
                        <p>Operating budget of the business involves costs related to the operational activities. The costs include production cost, overhead cost, manufacturing cost, labour cost, administrative cost, working capital, etc. The income flow includes the sales of the business.</p>
                        <p>Operating budgets are prepared considering all the above factors. This budget can be on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or even yearly basis. The operating budget ensures that the managers know their scope of work in proportion to the amount of funds allocated to the department. On this basis, the evaluation of a manager's performance is possible.</p>

                        <h4>Financial Budget</h4>
                        <p>A business is always in need of short term, medium-term and long-term funds. The financial budget ensures that the right types of funds are available whenever they are required. The aim of this budget is to manage the outflows with the inflows. The outflow is in the form of expenses and inflow is in the form of sales. Decisions like mergers and acquisitions depend on the financial budgets of the organizations. If the business has the desire to take over any company, its financial budget shall determine the value up to which the business can quote for acquiring another organization. In simple words, the financial budget describes the financial health of the business.</p>

                        <h4>Cash Flow Budget</h4>
                        <p>Cash flow budget is more about managing the cash of the business. The cash flow budget determines whether the accounts payable and accounts receivable are dealt with timely. It ensures that the inflow of the cash is regular and timely. This budget is important as it helps the managers to determine the period of cash shortage and accordingly take necessary action towards it. Cash flow budget also enables the business to know whether it would be able to handle new projects efficiently or not.</p>

                        <h4>Static Budget</h4>
                        <p>A static budget is one that remains the same even after the change in the factors that affect the budget preparation. A company that is seeing a constant drop or rise in sales may not change its budget allocation as it follows a static budget. Static budget presumes the input, output values of the future period and based on that allocation of resources is done. The results of the presumption of static budgets are very different from the actual outcome.</p>
