                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Running or chairing a meeting means more than just moving the group through the agenda.</p>
                        <p>When you chair a meeting, you are responsible for the well-being of the group and the members in it.</p>
                        <p>That demands a certain amount of attention be paid to "group dynamics" and other process issues. All of that "touchy feely" stuff is important!</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 1: Planning the Meeting</h3>
                        <p>If you pay attention to planning your meeting, you can avoid the "meeting killers" like:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Wasting meeting time</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Wasting people's time</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Boring meetings that go nowhere</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Meetings for meeting's sake</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Decide The Goal of the Meeting</h4>
                        <p>Is it to revise the by-laws, plan volunteer recruitment, or something else? No clear goal? A boring and unfocused meeting may result! Come up with a clear goal and the agenda becomes your road map to getting there.</p>
                        <p>If you need information or research for the meeting, better have it done before the meeting starts. What happens when you show up at a meeting where important information is missing? It's usually a big waste of time!</p>

                        <h4>Decide Who Needs to Be There</h4>
                        <p>If you are working on a billboard campaign, does the whole membership need to attend or just the Billboard Committee? Think before you send out those meeting notices!! When people come to a meeting where they don't care about the agenda, guess what? They usually don't come back!</p>

                        <h4>Plan with Others</h4>
                        <p>This is a great way to develop new leaders and get other people more invested in the work of your group! Just get three or four interested folks together and hash out the agenda--it won't take more than an hour!</p>

                        <h4>Good Agendas Count!</h4>
                        <p>List the amount of time you plan for each item. If someone other than you is presenting some part of the agenda, list that too, and send it out at least a week ahead of time. Members of any group should know what they are coming to do!</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 2: Setting Up the Meeting</h3>

                        <h4>Start and End on Time</h4>
                        <p>It's disrespectful to abuse members' time and about the biggest turn-off there is! If you must start late because only three people are in the room when you're supposed to start, at least apologize! Better yet, get into the habit of starting on time EVEN if there are only three people in the room. Word will get around and eventually; people will come on time or won't come at all. If people keep showing up late, or not showing up at all, this may be a hint to change your meeting time, or your meeting pattern, or both.</p>

                        <h4>Sign Them In</h4>
                        <p>Sign-in sheets do more than tell you who came. They also help update your membership list and give you names for phone trees. Be sure to include name, organization, address, and phone number!</p>

                        <h4>Do Your Best to Make Everyone Comfortable</h4>
                        <p>Meeting spaces should be comfortable and convenient. The room should be centrally located, and the right size for the size of your group. Get there early to set up and try to use a space where you can make a circle, not sit in rows like an auditorium. If the meeting space is hard to get to for seniors or others, try to arrange transportation or perhaps a volunteer "escort" service (a great teen/senior project!).</p>

                        <h4>All Work and No Play Is No Good!</h4>
                        <p>Have informal time before and after the meeting for people to talk and socialize. That's a big reason people joined your group in the first place, and it's where you can recruit volunteers. Remember, sometimes "the meeting after the meeting" is where people get attached to the group--and also get their best ideas to bring to the next meeting!</p>

                        <h4>A Regular Cycle</h4>
                        <p>If you have a regular meeting cycle, people will start to save the date (e.g. the first Monday of the month); but don't have a meeting just to meet! Always have a clear goal or don't have the meeting.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 3: Running the Meeting</h3>
                        <p>Being a meeting chairperson is more than one task; it's many jobs in one. If you take it from the top, your job as a chairperson means it is up to you to:</p>

                        <h4>Do Introductions</h4>
                        <p>That includes getting everyone to introduce themselves, as well as introducing yourself and your role. When there's a special speaker, his or her introduction is your job too.</p>

                        <h4>Get Agreement on Agenda and Rules</h4>
                        <p>Remember, it's everyone's meeting, so everyone needs to "buy in" to the agenda. You can ask for feedback on the agenda before you begin. Rules like no interrupting, etc. can also be helpful if you have some potential "disrupters" in the house.</p>

                        <h4>Keep The Discussion on Track</h4>
                        <p>If someone's going off the agenda or is speaking too long, pull 'em back in! Be gentle but firm: people respect a meeting that's run well and remember all too clearly the meetings where someone was allowed to go on and on and on.</p>
                        <p>Remember about starting and ending! Honor agenda time limits. If the group seems to want to go beyond the agreed upon time on an issue, ask for agreement from all members.</p>

                        <h4>Summarize What You Hear</h4>
                        <p>Wrap-up each agenda item by summarizing any conclusions out loud. Then move on when no one objects or everyone agrees.</p>

                        <h4>Encourage Participation</h4>
                        <p>If a usually quiet person speaks, show your appreciation. Try to draw everyone in and not just let the usual suspects speak!</p>

                        <h4>Use The Power Of Your Position Wisely</h4>
                        <p>Watch what you say and how and how much you say it! Don't take sides, and be fair to everyone.</p>

                        <h4>Develop New Leaders By Handing Over The Gavel</h4>
                        <p>Try rotating chairing responsibility. The only way others will learn is by watching you and then doing.</p>
                        <p>Have a sense of humor, and don't be defensive</p>
                        <p>Use open-ended questions that require people to say more than "yes" or "no"</p>
                        <p>Look around the room and watch for signs that you should slow things down or speed them up</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 4: Following Up On The Meeting</h3>
                        <p>Just because the meeting is over, it doesn't mean your work is done! In order for you to successfully follow up after the meeting, you will need to:</p>

                        <h4>Gather Feedback From The Group</h4>
                        <p>You will want to gather information about how the participants felt about the meeting, what could be improved, etc. You may not want to do this at every meeting, but at least once in a while; making sure that people have clear assignments, setting or reaffirming the date for the next meeting, and maximizing opportunities for people to stay around and talk after the meeting (which is very important).</p>

                        <h4>Make Follow-Up Calls</h4>
                        <p>The Chair or a designated person may want to make follow-up calls, send out follow -up correspondence, and/or take some follow-up actions. These after-the-meeting activities often serve as the glue that hold the group together.</p>

                        <h4>Summarize The Meeting</h4>
                        <p>It's helpful to have a list of the decisions made, with follow-ups. Formal minutes are valuable for many (not all) organizations--they contain announcements, informational items, etc., that are important to report even though they are not "decisions. "</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TIPS ON HANDLING DIFFICULT MEMBERS</h3>

                        <h4>a) Interventions</h4>
                        <p>Interventions are techniques to use when you are confronted with disruption or problems during the meetings. They can be used separately, but are usually more effective when used in combination. Interventions attempt to be low on the confrontation scale but still are effective in getting disrupters under control.</p>

                        <h4>b) Have the group decide:</h4>
                        <p>If someone refuses to stick to the agenda, keeps bringing up the same point again and again, challenges how you are handling the meeting, etc.</p>

                        <h4>c) Use the agenda and ground rules:</h4>
                        <p>If someone keeps going off the agenda, has side conversations through the whole meeting, verbally attacks others, etc.</p>

                        <h4>d) Be honest: Say what's going on:</h4>
                        <p>If someone is trying to intimidate you, you feel upset and undermined, you need to enlist the help of the group, etc.</p>

                        <h4>e) Use humor:</h4>
                        <p>If there is a lot of tension in the room, people are resistant to being at the meeting, scared/shy about participating, you are seen as an outsider, etc.</p>

                        <h4>f) Accept, deal, or defer:</h4>
                        <p>If someone keeps expressing doubts about accomplishing anything, is bitter and puts down every suggestion, keeps bringing up the same point over and over, has power issues, etc. This means: ACCEPT that what they are saying is true, don't ignore it; DEAL with it right there by spending some time on it, or DEFER it to the group for a decision about what to do. Also see points G and H below.</p>

                        <h4>g) Use body language (if possible):</h4>
                        <p>To quiet side conversations, help quiet people participate, re-focus attention, etc. You can speak volumes by making eye contact, by smiling (or not smiling), or by a change in your seating position.</p>

                        <h4>h) Take a break: Confront disrupters outside the meeting room:</h4>
                        <p>When less confrontational tactics haven't worked, someone keeps verbally attacking other participants, shuffling papers, having side conversations or cutting people off. You can deal with this issue outside the room, at a naturally-occurring break in the action.</p>

                        <h4>i) Confront in the room:</h4>
                        <p>If it's appropriate and will not create backlash, if the group will support you, if you've tried less confrontational tactics already, etc.</p>
