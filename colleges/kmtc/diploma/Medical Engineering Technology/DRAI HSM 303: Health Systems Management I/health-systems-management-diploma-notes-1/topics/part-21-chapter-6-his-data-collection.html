                        <p>Health information management (HIM) is the collection, analysis, storage, and protection of patient health information and medical records.</p>
                        <p>It is a multidisciplinary field composed of technology, research, and health care experts. Although this field doesn't involve direct patient care, it is undeniably vital to the industry because health care systems rely heavily on the data innovation this expertise generates and oversees.</p>
                        <p>A health information system (HIS) refers to a system designed to includes systems that collect, store, manage and transmit a patient's electronic medical record (EMR), a hospital's operational management or a system supporting healthcare policy decisions.</p>
                        <p>Health information systems also include those systems that handle data related to the activities of providers and health organizations. As an integrated effort, these may be leveraged to improve patient outcomes, inform research, and influence policy-making and decision-making. Because health information systems commonly access, process, or maintain large volumes of sensitive data, security is a primary concern.</p>
                        <p>Health information technology (HIT) involves the development of health information systems.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Health information systems can be used by everyone in healthcare from patients to clinicians to public health officials. They collect data and compile it in a way that can be used to make healthcare decisions.</p>
                        <p>Examples of health information systems include:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Electronic Health Record (EHR)</h3>
                        <p>These two terms are almost used interchangeably. The electronic medical record replaces the paper version of a patient's medical history. The electronic health record includes more health data, test results, and treatments. It also is designed to share data with other electronic health records so other healthcare providers can access a patient's healthcare data.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Practice Management Software</h3>
                        <p>Practice management software helps healthcare providers manage daily operations such as scheduling and billing. Healthcare providers, from small practices to hospitals, use practice management systems to automate many of the administrative tasks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Master Patient Index (MPI)</h3>
                        <p>A master patient index connects separate patient records across databases. The index has a record for each patient that is registered at a healthcare organization and indexes all other records for that patient. MPIs are used to reduce duplicate patient records and inaccurate patient information that can lead to claim denials.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Patient Portals</h3>
                        <p>Patient portals allow patients to access their personal health data such as appointment information, medications and lab results over an internet connection. Some patient portals allow active communication with their physicians, prescription refill requests, and the ability to schedule appointments.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</h3>
                        <p>Also known as telehealth, remote patient monitoring allows medical sensors to send patient data to healthcare professionals. It frequently monitors blood glucose levels and blood pressure for patients with chronic conditions. The data is used to detect medical events that require intervention and can possibly become part of a larger population health study.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Decision Support (CDS)</h3>
                        <p>Clinical decision support systems analyse data from various clinical and administrative systems to help healthcare providers make clinical decisions.The data can help prepare diagnoses or predict medical events such as drug interactions. These tools filter data and information to help clinicians care for individual patients.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In Statistics, data collection is a process of gathering information from all the relevant sources to find a solution to the research problem. It helps to evaluate the outcome of the problem. The data collection methods allow a person to conclude an answer to the relevant question. Most of the organizations use data collection methods to make assumptions about future probabilities and trends. Once the data is collected, it is necessary to undergo the data organization process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES OF DATA</h3>

                        <h4>Quantitative Data</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Quantitative data is measurable, often used for comparisons, and involves counting of people, behaviours, conditions, or other discrete events (Wang, 2013).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Quantitative data uses numbers to determine the what, who, when, and where of healthrelated events (Wang, 2013).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Examples of quantitative data include: age, weight, temperature, or the number of people suffering from diabetes.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Qualitative Data</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Qualitative data is a broad category of data that can include almost any non-numerical data.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Qualitative data uses words to describe a particular health-related event (Romano).</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SOURCES OF HEATH DATA</h3>

                        <h4>Surveys</h4>
                        <p>Surveys are an important means of collecting health and social science information from a sample of people in a standardized way to better understand a larger population. There are many methods used to conduct surveys, including questionnaires and in-depth interviews via phone, mail, email, and in-person.</p>
                        <p>Survey research allows researchers to collect empirical data in a relatively short period of time. Depending on the design and scope, surveys can collect data on a representative sample of people, particularly when samples are randomized or purposive nonprobability sampling is used.</p>

                        <h4>Medical Records</h4>
                        <p>Medical records are used to track events and transactions between patients and health care providers. They offer information on diagnoses, procedures, lab tests, and other services. Medical records help us measure and analyse trends in health care use, patient characteristics, and quality of care.</p>
                        <p>Medical records are usually accurate and detailed because they come from health care providers. The data are automatically collected, including information that patients might not think to add or feel comfortable sharing through other data sources like surveys.</p>

                        <h4>Claims Data</h4>
                        <p>Claims data, also known as administrative data, are another sort of electronic record, but on a much bigger scale. Claims databases collect information on millions of doctors' appointments, bills, insurance information, and other patient-provider communications.</p>
                        <p>The good thing about claims data is that, like other medical records, they come directly from notes made by the health care provider, and the information is recorded at the time patient sees the doctor.</p>

                        <h4>Vital Records</h4>
                        <p>Vital records are collected by the National Vital Statistics System, and are maintained by state and local governments. Vital records include births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and fetal deaths. They also record information about the cause of death, or details of the birth.</p>
                        <p>Vital records are useful because they offer very detailed information and include information about rare disorders that end in death. Unfortunately, because there are so many state and local governments collecting this information, records can be inconsistent. Also, vital records only provide information on diseases and illnesses that end in death.</p>

                        <h4>Surveillance</h4>
                        <p>Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease and injury.</p>
                        <p>Surveillance activities are usually associated with the study of infectious diseases.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">METHODS OF DATA COLLECION.</h3>
                        <p>Observation method is used when the study relates to behavioural science. This method is planned systematically. It is subject to many controls and checks. The different types of observations are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Structured and unstructured observation</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Controlled and uncontrolled observation</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Participant, non-participant and disguised observation</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Interview Method</h4>
                        <p>The method of collecting data in terms of oral or verbal responses. It is achieved in two ways, such as</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Personal Interview</strong> - In this method, a person known as an interviewer is required to ask questions face to face to the other person. The personal interview can be structured or unstructured, direct investigation, focused conversation, etc.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Telephonic Interview</strong> - In this method, an interviewer obtains information by contacting people on the telephone to ask the questions or views orally.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Questionnaire Method</h4>
                        <p>In this method, the set of questions are mailed to the respondent. They should read, reply and subsequently return the questionnaire. The questions are printed in the definite order on the form. A good survey should have the following features:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Short and simple</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Should follow a logical sequence</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Provide adequate space for answers</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Avoid technical terms</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Should have good physical appearance such as colour, quality of the paper to attract the attention of the respondent</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Schedules</h4>
                        <p>This method is similar to the questionnaire method with a slight difference. The enumerations are specially appointed for the purpose of filling the schedules. It explains the aims and objects of the investigation and may remove misunderstandings, if any have come up. Enumerators should be trained to perform their job with hard work and patience.</p>
