                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Public speaking: is the process of speaking to a few or many people with the purpose of informing, motivating, persuading, educating or entertaining the listeners.</p>
                        <p>The five elements of public speaking are</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon"> </span><span class="item-text">is saying what</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon"> </span><span class="item-text">to whom</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon"> </span><span class="item-text">using what medium</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon"> </span><span class="item-text">with what effects?</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Public speaking is a skill that is best mastered through continuous practice.</p>
                        <p>A talkative person may not necessarily be an eloquent speaker.</p>
                        <p>To give a great speech, you must understand the type of speech you are expected to give, and prepare along those lines.</p>
                        <p>An effective public speaker understands the needs of the audience and is flexible enough to adopt changes that may arise even while delivering the speech. Public speaking is when you stand before an audience and deliver a speech on a topic.</p>
                        <p>This could be at a formal or an informal occasion. For many people, speaking in front of a large audience is a daunting task, so it is quite natural to become very nervous (with effective training this fear could be overcome).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Some benefits to speaking in public include:</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors that influence your ability to communicate effectively.</h3>

                        <h4>1. Voice control</h4>
                        <p>Your voice is the most basic communication tool you possess. Learning to use it properly is key for improving your public speaking.</p>
                        <p>Diaphragmatic breathing is a useful voice control technique. It can give your voice greater power and clarity and prevent the shortness of breath that anxiety causes.</p>
                        <p>To do this technique, relax your belly and let it expand as you breathe. Extend your inhalations and exhalations to a count of four each.</p>
                        <p>Practicing this type of breathing without speaking will help you prepare to use it while speaking.</p>
                        <p>It also helps calm your nerves.</p>

                        <h4>2. Body language</h4>
                        <p>Your body language is the combination of your gestures, facial expressions, and movements.</p>
                        <p>It's an integral part of how we communicate. It helps your audience better understand the nuances of your message.</p>
                        <p>If your body language contrasts with what you want to transmit or seems incoherent, your speech will be confusing.</p>

                        <h4>3. Delivery</h4>
                        <p>Delivery is the way you speak. Good delivery is essential for your audience to understand your speech.</p>
                        <p>Follow these tips to improve your delivery:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Speak at the speed of a normal conversation. Avoid speaking too quickly because people will get lost in what you are saying. But don't speak too slowly, either, as they will get bored.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Pause regularly. This gives people time to absorb the concepts and ideas. It also makes you appear more confident.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Don't mumble or eat your words - articulate clearly.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Avoid making noises such as "ahh" or "umm" between words. If you need time to think, take a brief pause. There is nothing wrong with a few seconds of silence.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>4. Audience relations</h4>
                        <p>If you want your audience to listen to you, you need to engage them from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>The following are ways to connect with your audience:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Smile and greet the audience. Thank them for being there. This will humanize you and establish a conversational tone.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Look for people in the audience who seem actively engaged in your speech. Imagine speaking only to them.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Make eye contact with as many people as possible. This will help establish personal connections with your audience.</span></li>
