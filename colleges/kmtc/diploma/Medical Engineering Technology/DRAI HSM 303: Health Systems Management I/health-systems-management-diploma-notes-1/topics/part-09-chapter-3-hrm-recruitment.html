                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is Human Resource management?</h3>
                        <p>Human resource management (HRM) is the process of employing people, training them, compensating them, developing policies relating to them, and developing strategies to retain them. As a field, HRM has undergone many changes over the last twenty years, giving it an even more important role in today's organizations. In the past, HRM meant processing payroll, sending birthday gifts to employees, arranging company outings, and making sure forms were filled out correctly-in other words, more of an administrative role rather than a strategic role crucial to the success of the organization.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Role of HRM</h3>
                        <p>Keep in mind that many functions of HRM are also tasks other department managers perform, which is what makes this information important, despite the career path taken. Most experts agree on the following roles that HRM plays in organizations.</p>

                        <h4>Staffing</h4>
                        <p>You need people to perform tasks and get work done in the organization. Even with the most sophisticated machines, humans are still needed. Because of this, one of the major tasks in HRM is staffing. Staffing involves the entire hiring process from posting a job to negotiating a salary package.</p>

                        <h5>Recruitment.</h5>
                        <p>This involves finding people to fill the open positions.</p>
                        <p>It is a positive process of posting job openings and attracting prospective employees to apply for their desired job openings in an organization so that the eligible candidate can be selected.</p>

                        <h5>Selection</h5>
                        <p>Involves eliminating the unsuitable candidates through the process of tests or interviews and identifying the suitable ones, which are the best fit for the positions.</p>
                        <p>In this stage, people will be interviewed and selected, and a proper compensation package will be negotiated. This step is followed by training, retention, and motivation.</p>
                        <p>Every organization has policies to ensure fairness and continuity within the organization. One of the jobs of HRM is to develop the verbiage surrounding these policies. In the development of policies, HRM, management, and executives are involved in the process. For example, the HRM professional will likely recognize the need for a policy or a change of policy, seek opinions on the policy, write the policy, and then communicate that policy to employees. It is key to note here that HR departments do not and cannot work alone. Everything they do needs to involve all other departments in the organization. Some examples of workplace policies might be the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Discipline process policy</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Vacation time policy</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Dress code</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Ethics policy</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Internet usage policy</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Compensation and Benefits Administration</h4>
                        <p>HRM professionals need to determine that compensation is fair, meets industry standards, and is high enough to entice people to work for the organization. Compensation includes anything the employee receives for his or her work. In addition, HRM professionals need to make sure the pay is comparable to what other people performing similar jobs are being paid. This involves setting up pay systems that take into consideration the number of years with the organization, years of experience, education, and similar aspects. Examples of employee compensation include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Pay</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Health benefits</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">401(k) (retirement plans)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Stock purchase plans</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Vacation time</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Sick leave</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Bonuses</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Tuition reimbursement</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Retention</h4>
                        <p>Retention involves keeping and motivating employees to stay with the organization.</p>
                        <p>Compensation is a major factor in employee retention, but there are other factors as well. Ninety percent of employees leave a company for the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Issues around the job they are performing</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Challenges with their manager</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Poor fit with organizational culture</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Poor workplace environment</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Training and Development</h4>
                        <p>Once we have spent the time to hire new employees, we want to make sure they not only are trained to do the job but also continue to grow and develop new skills in their job. This results in higher productivity for the organization. Training is also a key component in employee motivation. Employees who feel they are developing their skills tend to be happier in their jobs, which results in increased employee retention. Examples of training programs might include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Job skills training, such as how to run a particular computer program</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Training on communication</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Team-building activities</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Policy and legal training, such as sexual harassment training and ethics training</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Communication</h4>
                        <p>Besides these major roles, good communication skills and excellent management skills are key to successful human resource management as well as general management.</p>

                        <h4>Performance management</h4>
                        <p>There should be proper management of the work done and the future goals. Performance management refers to appraising the performance of the employees and enhancing it. For such a management, it is necessary to encourage the employees so as to raise their confidence levels. This can be done by providing them with fair rewards so that they work in their optimum productivity levels.</p>

                        <h4>Employee Relations</h4>
                        <p>There should be a sound relation between the employee and the organization. There are various factors which motivate as well as demotivate the employees to stick with the organization. These factors include working environment, labor law and relations, compensation, etc. The employers must ensure all these factors to build employee relationships that in turn garner better employee retention.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">RECRUITMENT</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Recruitment is a core function of the Human Resource department. It is a process that involves everything from identifying, attracting, screening, shortlisting, interviewing, selecting, hiring, and onboarding employees.</p>
                        <p>The recruitment teams can be large or small depending on the size of an organization. However, in smaller organizations, recruitment is typically the responsibility of a recruiting manager.</p>
                        <p>Many organizations outsource their recruiting needs, while some companies rely exclusively on advertisements, job boards, and social media channels to recruit talent for new positions. Many companies of today, use recruitment software to make their recruitment process more effective and efficient.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Recruitment Process</h3>
                        <p>The recruitment lifecycle consists of seven interrelated steps which are as follows:</p>

                        <h4>1. Identifying the Hiring Needs</h4>
                        <p>Whether a job opening is newly formed or just vacated, you cannot find what you need if you don't know what you need in the first place. So, your recruitment process should start with identifying the vacancies that exist followed by analyzing the job specifications including the knowledge, skills and experience needed for the role. Here's how you can determine your hiring needs:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Figure out where the gaps are in your current team. Check if you have new needs in terms of ability, performance or personality. Ask yourself if you need someone to take care of something that is not being addressed currently. This will tell you that there is a hiring need.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Keep a track of input versus output when it comes to your team. See if there is an increase in workload that needs to be addressed by hiring.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Regularly analyse performance and make a list of missing qualities, qualifications, skills and proficiencies that you need to add to your team. This can also signal towards hiring needs.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Be mindful of existing employees leaving. This is definitely when you will have a hiring need.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Preparing the Job Description</h4>
                        <p>Once you know exactly what you need in terms of knowledge, skills and experience, it is time to determine the duties and responsibilities of the job. Preparing a comprehensive job description (JD) will help you know what your potential employees must have in order to meet the demands of the role. More importantly, it provides your prospects with a checklist or a list that they can compare themselves to before applying. It is a tool to ensure that you get applications from the right candidates (hopefully).</p>
                        <p>A job description must include all of the following and can be as comprehensive as you want:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Title</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Duties & Responsibilities</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Qualification & Skills</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Location</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Compensation, Perks & Benefits</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Talent Search</h4>
                        <p>Identifying the right talent, attracting them and motivating them to apply are the most important aspects of the recruitment process. The job listing should be advertised internally to generate referrals as well as externally on popular social networking sites and preferred job boards. Recruiters can also conduct job fairs and promote openings in leading industry publications to cast a wider net. Broadly, there are two sources of recruitment that can be tapped for a talent search:</p>

                        <h4>4. Screening and Shortlisting</h4>
                        <p>A survey of recruiters revealed that while 46% struggle to attract top talent in the current candidate-driven market, 52% confirmed that the most challenging part of hiring was identifying the right candidates from a large pool of applicants.</p>
                        <p>In order to move forward with the recruitment process, you need to screen and shortlist applicants efficiently and accurately. This is where the recruitment process gets difficult and challenging. You can resolve this recruitment bottleneck by following these four steps:</p>

                        <h5>Steps to Effectively Screen or Shortlist Candidates</h5>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Screen applications on the basis of minimum qualifications.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Next, sort resumes that have the preferred credentials by looking at their certifications, relevant experience, domain expertise, technical competencies and other specific skills that are required for the role.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Then, shortlist candidates who have both the preferred credentials and the minimum qualifications.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text">Finally, flag any concerns or queries in the resume so they can be clarified during the interview.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>No wonder, the most arduous task of the recruitment process is reviewing resumes. Fortunately, you can make this complicated, time-consuming task a total breeze with an applicant tracking system that is designed to screen resumes in a jiffy. Using an ATS will ensure that you have an unbiased, objective filter that will smartly wade through the sea of resumes to narrow down your talent pool in no time!</p>

                        <h4>5. Interviewing</h4>
                        <p>The shortlisted applications will now move through the interview process prior to receiving an offer letter or a rejection note. Depending on the size of the hiring team and their unique recruitment needs, several interviews may be scheduled for every candidate.</p>

                        <h5>Telephonic Screening/Video Interviewing</h5>
                        <p>This is a quick, easy and convenient way to screen candidates and their capabilities. The telephonic or video interview is also your first opportunity to leave a lasting first impression on your potential employees. So, while you need to keep your very first interview short, make sure you also take the time to screen them against the knowledge, skills and experience mentioned in your job description, so you can eliminate the irrelevant profiles first.</p>

                        <h5>Face-to-Face Interviewing</h5>
                        <p>Personal interviews can last longer because this is the last step before the recruiter does a final evaluation and makes the job offer. Final interviews may be conducted by the top management and are typically extended to a very small pool of standout candidates. The final choice should be agreed upon at this stage along with a backup candidate selection.</p>

                        <h5>Interview Tips</h5>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Interviews are a two-way process. During the process, the potential candidate also assesses whether your company is the right fit or not. So, be courteous, respectful and sell the benefits of the job role and the organization.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Prepare questions that give you deep insights into every job applicant's professional background to assess whether they might be a good fit for your open role.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Refrain from asking abstract questions to check your candidate's reaction; Rather, keep your questions relevant to the role.</span></li>
