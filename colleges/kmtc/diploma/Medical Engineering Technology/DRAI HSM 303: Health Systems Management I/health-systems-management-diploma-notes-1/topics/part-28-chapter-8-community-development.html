                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS</h3>
                        <p>Income Generating Activities (IGAs) consist of small businesses managed by a group of people to increase their household income through livelihood diversification.</p>
                        <p>Income-generating activities are activities that have the potential to generate revenue and nonincome generating activities are activities that do not. No matter who you are or what field you work in, every business activity can be clearly delineated as one or the other.</p>
                        <p>'Income-generating activities' refers to activities focused on creating opportunities for communities to productively use locally-available resources in order to develop less state dependent and more self-reliant households and communities that are able to take care of themselves. Thus, income-generating activities focus on productively using locally-available resources as a means of benefitting the entire community.</p>

                        <h4>Income Generating Projects</h4>
                        <p>For income generating projects the two key factors are the quantity that can be sold (i.e. that will be purchased), and the price that the buyer will pay. For some products, such as grains, construction blocks or cooking oil, demand is rarely a limiting factor; the market is large and the sort of projects supported by RuralInvest are unlikely to meet more than a small fraction of total consumption. Furthermore, as the products are not readily perishable, they can be made available year round, and prices tend to change only gradually, reflecting variations in raw material and storage costs. Thus determining volumes and prices for these products is a matter of project output, and predominant market price (less transport costs to the market).</p>
                        <p>Perishable products, however, are a different story. Here available volumes, and therefore prices, can vary enormously, as the product is expensive if not impossible to keep for another day. Fresh vegetables may be very abundant and cheap in the winter, for example, when rainfall is adequate and temperatures moderate, but may be very scarce and expensive in the summer when irrigation and even shade netting may be required. For perishable products, therefore, it is critical to consider the seasonality of production for the proposed project, and relate that seasonality to the prices likely to be encountered.</p>
                        <p>Specialized products (including many processed foods, clothing and services) are the most difficult categories for which to determine market demand and prices. Prices are not standard for all goods or services of one type, but vary according to ingredients, quality, and the perceptions of the buyer. Prices may be estimated on the basis of the closest comparable product, although if no distinct and obvious difference exists which will attract the buyer, a significant price reduction may be necessary at the beginning to persuade purchasers to shift from the existing alternatives to the new product or service offered by the project. Sales volumes can be equally hard to estimate, especially if the product or service is new, or is entering a very limited market. In such cases, investment plans should not be over ambitious, and the minimum scale of production that is compatible with cost considerations is recommended, at least for start-up. Where services are concerned, it must be remembered that a service not sold during a particular time period (e.g. the use of a tractor for land preparation) is lost forever, so variations in demand according to season are critical.</p>

                        <h4>Non Income Generating Projects</h4>
                        <p>Although it may be difficult to estimate demand for a marketed product, where there is no market at all, estimating demand can be even harder. What will be the demand for an investment in watershed protection, or for a new primary school? The starting point in the absence of markets must be to identify who are the expected beneficiaries, both direct and indirect. Normally one thinks of beneficiaries in terms of families, so for every school child or patient at a medical clinic, there is a family which benefits.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the best way to try and identify potential direct beneficiaries is to ask: "What are people doing in the absence of this product or service? Would they change over to become users (i.e. beneficiaries) of the new project?". Another key question is: "How many new users might be created if the project goes ahead?".</p>
                        <p>Perhaps only a few children in the area currently go to school, as the only existing facility is some kilometres away in the nearest town. But how many might be tempted if the school was now within walking distance? It should not be forgotten that suppliers and workers are also direct beneficiaries, and should be included in the estimation.</p>
                        <p>An erosion control project might have few direct beneficiaries (e.g. farmers and householders directly affected by the erosion), but a considerable number of indirect beneficiaries (e.g. all those using the river or streams that would be protected). In fact, indirect beneficiaries often include the entire population of the area served by the project, whether it be a bridge, potable water, or a day care facility, so this number is often quite large in comparison with the number of direct beneficiaries.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES</h3>

                        <h4>Multidisciplinary approach</h4>
                        <p>A multidisciplinary approach involves drawing appropriately from multiple disciplines to redefine problems outside of normal boundaries and reach solutions based on a new understanding of complex situations. Multidisciplinary working is often seen as revolutionary by skill-centred specialists but it is simply a fundamental expression of being guided by holism rather than reductionism, as described by Jan Smuts in his 1926 book Holism and Evolution. One of the major barriers to the multidisciplinary approach is the long established tradition of highly focused professional practitioners cultivating a protective boundary around their area of expertise.</p>

                        <h4>Directive Approach</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The directive approach is more common.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Directive approach itself decides</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The decision of directive approach makes decision of which is for the betterment of people itself.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The agencies will then provide whatever staff equipment, premises and programs are needed to meet the needs and interest of people.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It wish to help themselves whenever some activities are provided.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is the essence of this approach that the agency and it's worker think, decide, pan, organize, administer and provide for people. "Always the initiative and the final say, remain them."</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Many of those who are attracted to these kind of program they may not only recent but even welcome directive advice and guidance from someone who have learned to like, respect and accept as their leaders.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Most of effective in meeting people short term needs and less effective for the long term goal of helping them to realize their full potentialities as person.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Non-Directive Approach</h4>
                        <p>The worker who uses non-directive approach does not attempt to decide people or to lead, guide and pursue them any of the specific conclusion about what is good for them.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">He/She tries to get them to decide for themselves what their needs are what if anything they are willing to do meet the goal and how they can best organize, plan and act to carry their project through.</span></li>
