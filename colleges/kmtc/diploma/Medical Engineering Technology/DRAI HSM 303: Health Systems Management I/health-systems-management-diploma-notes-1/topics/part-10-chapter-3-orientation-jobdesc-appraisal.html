                        <p>When applicants accept the job offer, they officially become the employees of the company. The joining date and time is communicated to the employee. Once that's done, pre-employment screening that includes reference and background checks are conducted. Once the verification is done, the employees are then introduced to the organization. The induction process of the employees then begins. During the induction process, a welcome kit is usually given to the new employees, and then the employment contract is signed.</p>

                        <p>An introductory stage in the process of new employee assimilation, and a part of his or her continuous socialization process in an organization.</p>
                        <p>Orientation is the planned introduction of new employees to their jobs, coworkers, and the organization. However, orientation should not be a mechanical, one-way process. Because all employees are different, orientation must incorporate a sensitive awareness of the anxieties, uncertainties, and needs of the individual.</p>
                        <p>Orientation in one form or another is offered by most employers. The orientation is meant to educate new employees about the goals and responsibilities of the position and company, as well as to answer any questions they may have about HR, benefits and payroll information.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Major objectives of orientation are to</h3>

                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Purposes of Orientation</h3>
                        <p>Employers have to realize that orientation isn't just a nice gesture put on by the organization. It serves as an important element of the recruitment and retention process. Some key purposes are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>To Reduce Startup Costs:</strong> Proper orientation can help the employee get "up to speed" much more quickly, thereby reducing the costs associated with learning the job.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>To Reduce Anxiety:</strong> Any employee, when put into a new, strange situation, will experience anxiety that can impede his or her ability to learn to do the job. Proper orientation helps to reduce anxiety that results from entering into an unknown situation, and helps provide guidelines for behavior and conduct, so the employee doesn't have to experience the stress of guessing.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>To Reduce Employee Turnover:</strong> Employee turnover increases as employees feel they are not valued, or are put in positions where they can't possibly do their jobs. Orientation shows that the organization values the employee, and helps provide the tools necessary for succeeding in the job.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>To Save Time For Supervisor & Co-Workers:</strong> Simply put, the better the initial orientation, the less likely supervisors and co-workers will have to spend time teaching the employee.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>To Develop Realistic Job Expectations, Positive Attitudes and Job Satisfaction:</strong> It is important that employees learn as soon as possible what is expected of them, and what to expect from others, in addition to learning about the values and attitudes of the organization. While people can learn from experience, they will make many mistakes that are unnecessary and potentially damaging.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Productivity enhancement:</strong> Both employers and new employees want individuals starting jobs to become as productive as possible relatively quickly. Texas Instruments found that orientation helps new employees reach full productivity levels at least two months sooner than those without effective orientation experiences.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some employers, including a large accounting firm, give new employees computer and intranet access upon acceptance of a job offer. That way new employees can become more familiar with the organization and its operations even before they go through a formal orientation program. This example illustrates that orientation to the organization really begins during the recruiting and selection processes, because the way individuals are treated and what they learn about the organization during the first contacts may shape how they approach new jobs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Organizational Overview</h3>
                        <p>Another purpose of orientation is to inform new employees about the nature of the organization. A general organizational overview might include a brief review of the organization; the history, structure, key executives, purpose, products, and services of the organization; how the employee's job fits into the big picture; and other general information. If the employer prepares an annual report, a copy may be given to a new employee. Also, some organizations give new employees a list of terms that are used in the industry to help them learn regularly used vocabulary.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">JOB DESCRIPTIONS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Job description is all about the relative ranking of an individual job in relation to other jobs that exist within the group. This also refers to technique used in ranking of jobs in an organization. This is normally carried out on the basis of various responsibilities and duties that are assigned to the specific job or task. The results of the job description process include the job being assigned a specific range of payment.</p>
                        <p>The range normally includes a maximum pay rate that the specific job can attract and also the minimum rate of payment that can be given to a person holding such a position.</p>
                        <p>Job description as a management tool has been used by employers and managers for approximately more than seventy-five years. This management tool has been used both in the private and in the public sector. Basing on some generic factors, the value of each job is well defined in the job description process (Harzing and Ruysseveldt, 2004).</p>
                        <p>Job description is very important to employers and managers. The reason as to why job description as a management tool never goes out of fashion is because it plays a big role in reducing employee turnover. One of the steps involved in job description is bench marking the jobs.</p>
                        <p>This is done in relation to the jobs that have been evaluated before. In this case the bench mark jobs are those that are commonly included in salary surveys found in most organizations. In this process the bench mark jobs of internal pay structures are related to the external structure's existing in the labor market.</p>
                        <p>This greatly helps in reducing employee turnover in the various organizations. This is because job description carried out will enable the organization's pay grades to be at per with competitor organizations. In this case employees will not see the need of looking for greener pastures since their pay grades will be similar to what their colleagues in the same positions are paid in other organizations. This is really important to employers and managers because they will not be worried about losing employees to better paying organization. This generally plays a big role to stability in the organization.</p>
                        <p>Job description process as management tool is very important to employers. This is because; research shows that job description helps in minimizing conflicts in the organization. Job description process results in the various jobs in an organization being given a pay rate. This is normally clear to employees in the organization. When job description is carried out in an organization, it results in fairness in terms of payment rates given to various jobs in the organization (Brewster, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Job descriptions help employers and managers to easily explain the reason as to why some employees earn more and others less. Job description helps in the lessening of employee grievances over relative wages. Managers and employees find it easier to solve any problems that arise concerning relative wages. This plays a big role in minimizing conflicts related to salary payment in the organization. This is because it plays a big role in establishing a grading and a basic pay structure which all employees will regard as fair. This explains why job description as a management tool refuses to go out of fashion.</p>
                        <p>The job description process as a management tool refuses to go out of fashion for so many reasons. According to research carried out in the private and public sector, employers say that this tool is very fundamental in management. This is because it helps them to come up with pay structures that are simple and very easy to understand. This is because most of the organizations have diverse classes of employees. Some are professionals while others are not. It makes it easy for employees who are not so learned to understand the different pay rates. It is less stressing to come up with pay rates for specific jobs using job description method than if other means are used.</p>
                        <p>According to employers and managers in both the private and public sector, job structures have made their work far much simpler. This is because, once an organization has carried out job description, it becomes simpler to fit new jobs into the previously set pay structures. It is understood that in every organization, new posts and vacancies always come up which were not existing in the organization.</p>
