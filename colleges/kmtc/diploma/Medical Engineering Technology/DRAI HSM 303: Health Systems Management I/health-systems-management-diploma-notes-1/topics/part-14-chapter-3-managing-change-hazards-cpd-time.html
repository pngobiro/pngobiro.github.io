                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Leadership is about change, but what is a leader to do when faced with ubiquitous resistance? Resistance to change manifests itself in many ways, from foot-dragging and inertia to petty sabotage to outright rebellions. The best tool for leaders of change is to understand the predictable, universal sources of resistance in each situation and then strategize around them. Here are the ten I've found to be the most common.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">1.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Loss of control.</strong> Change interferes with autonomy and can make people feel that they've lost control over their territory. It's not just political, as in who has the power. Our sense of selfdetermination is often the first things to go when faced with a potential change coming from someone else. Smart leaders leave room for those affected by change to make choices. They invite others into the planning, giving them ownership.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">2.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Excess uncertainty.</strong> If change feels like walking off a cliff blindfolded, then people will reject it. People will often prefer to remain mired in misery than to head toward an unknown. As the saying goes, "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know." To overcome inertia requires a sense of safety as well as an inspiring vision. Leaders should create certainty of process, with clear, simple steps and timetables.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">3.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Surprise, surprise!</strong> Decisions imposed on people suddenly, with no time to get used to the idea or prepare for the consequences, are generally resisted. It's always easier to say No than to say Yes. Leaders should avoid the temptation to craft changes in secret and then announce them all at once. It's better to plant seeds - that is, to sprinkle hints of what might be coming and seek input.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">4.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Everything seems different.</strong> Change is meant to bring something different, but how different? We are creatures of habit. Routines become automatic, but change jolts us into consciousness, sometimes in uncomfortable ways. Too many differences can be distracting or confusing. Leaders should try to minimize the number of unrelated differences introduced by a central change. Wherever possible keep things familiar. Remain focused on the important things; avoid change for the sake of change.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">5.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Loss of face.</strong> By definition, change is a departure from the past. Those people associated with the last version - the one that didn't work, or the one that's being superseded - are likely to be defensive about it. When change involves a big shift of strategic direction, the people responsible for the previous direction dread the perception that they must have been wrong. Leaders can help people maintain dignity by celebrating those elements of the past that are worth honoring, and making it clear that the world has changed. That makes it easier to let go and move on.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">6.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Concerns about competence.</strong> Can I do it? Change is resisted when it makes people feel stupid. They might express skepticism about whether the new software version will work or whether digital journalism is really an improvement, but down deep they are worried that their skills will be obsolete. Leaders should over-invest in structural reassurance, providing abundant information, education, training, mentors, and support systems. A period of overlap, running two systems simultaneously, helps ease transitions.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">7.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>More work.</strong> Here is a universal challenge. Change is indeed more work. Those closest to the change in terms of designing and testing it are often overloaded, in part because of the inevitable unanticipated glitches in the middle of change, per "Kanter's Law" that "everything can look like a failure in the middle." Leaders should acknowledge the hard work of change by allowing some people to focus exclusively on it, or adding extra perqs for participants (meals? valet parking? massages?). They should reward and recognize participants - and their families, too, who often make unseen sacrifices.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">8.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Ripple effects.</strong> Like tossing a pebble into a pond, change creates ripples, reaching distant spots in ever-widening circles. The ripples disrupt other departments, important customers, people well outside the venture or neighbourhood, and they start to push back, rebelling against changes they had nothing to do with that interfere with their own activities. Leaders should enlarge the circle of stakeholders. They must consider all affected parties, however distant, and work with them to minimize disruption.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Past resentments.</strong> The ghosts of the past are always lying-in wait to haunt us. As long as everything is steady state, they remain out of sight. But the minute you need cooperation for something new or different, the ghosts spring into action. Old wounds reopen, historic resentments are remembered - sometimes going back many generations. Leaders should consider gestures to heal the past before sailing into the future.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">10.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Sometimes the threat is real.</strong> Now we get to true pain and politics. Change is resisted because it can hurt. When new technologies displace old ones, jobs can be lost; prices can be cut; investments can be wiped out. The best thing leaders can do when the changes they seek pose significant threat is to be honest, transparent, fast, and fair. For example, one big layoff with strong transition assistance is better than successive waves of cuts.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Although leaders can't always make people feel comfortable with change, they can minimize discomfort. Diagnosing the sources of resistance is the first step toward good solutions. And feedback from resistors can even be helpful in improving the process of gaining acceptance for change.</p>

                        <p>Success is usually more to do with tenacity that genius. Persistence is only possible when you have clarified your values and when you are able to build on the bedrock of purpose. Successful people keep going in the face of change, finding new and creative ways to achieve a positive outcome.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Be flexible and creative.</h3>
                        <p>Persistence does not mean pushing through by force. If you are unable to achieve success one way, try another, and then another. Keep looking for more creative solutions and innovative responses to problems.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Think outside the box.</h3>
                        <p>Read widely, and don't confine yourself to your own area of 'expertise.' Try to see links between apparently separate and diverse elements in your life and experience.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Accept uncertainty and be optimistic.</h3>
                        <p>Life is inherently uncertain, so don't waste your energy trying to predict the future. Of all the possible outcomes, focus on the most positive one. This is not to be a 'Pollyanna,' but to accept that if you respond well and work to the best of your ability, a good outcome is as likely as any other. Don't waste your energy being negative.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Occupational hazards are risks of illnesses or accidents in the workplace. In other words, hazards that workers experience in their place of work. An occupational hazard is something unpleasant that a person experiences or suffers as a result of doing their job. Some dictionaries say that the term also includes hazards that people experience as a result of working on their hobbies.</p>
                        <p>A hazard is an undesirable, unpleasant event or danger. It can also mean 'risk.'</p>
                        <p>When talking specifically about workplace injuries, we use the term Occupational Injury.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Occupations hazards - several types</h3>
                        <p>There are many types of occupational hazards, such as biohazards, chemical hazards, physical hazards, and psychosocial hazards.</p>

                        <h4>Biological hazards</h4>
                        <p>Biological hazards or biohazards refer to biological substances that threaten the health of human beings and other living organisms.</p>
                        <p>This type of hazard may include samples of a toxin of a biological source, a virus, or a microorganism. Specifically, samples that harm human health.</p>

                        <h4>Chemical hazards</h4>
                        <p>Chemical hazards are occupational hazards that exposure to chemicals in the workplace may cause. Victims can suffer acute or long-term negative health effects.</p>
                        <p>There are hundreds of hazardous chemicals, including immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, neurotoxins, and reproductive toxins. Asthmagens, sensitizers, and systemic toxins are also hazardous chemicals.</p>
                        <p>"Long-term exposure to chemicals such as silica dust, engine exhausts, tobacco smoke, and lead (among others) have been shown to increase risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure."</p>

                        <h4>Physical hazards</h4>
                        <p>Physical hazards may be factors, agents, or circumstances that can cause harm without or with contact. We classify them as either environmental or occupational hazards.</p>
                        <p>Radiation, heat and cold stress, vibrations, and noise, for example, are types of physical hazards.</p>
                        <p>Physical hazards cause injuries and illnesses in several industries. In some industries, such as mining and construction, they are unavoidable.</p>
                        <p>However, over time, we have developed safety procedures and methods to minimize the risks of physical danger in people's place of work.</p>

                        <h4>Psychosocial hazards</h4>
                        <p>Psychosocial hazards are occupational hazards that affect employees' psychological health. These hazards affect their ability to take part in a work environment with other colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Psychosocial hazards are associated with how the work was designed, organized, and managed. They are also related to the social and economic contexts of the work. Patients suffer psychological or psychiatric injury or illness. Some also suffer physical injury or illness.</p>
                        <p>Workplace violence and occupational stress, for example, are psychosocial hazards.</p>

                        <p>Examples of professional development opportunities include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Attend a professional conference.

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Shadow a colleague.

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Read a book that can help you in your field.

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.</p>
                        <p>Time management refers to the judicious use of time for achieving success in life. Time Management helps an individual to make the best possible use of time. It is essential for individuals to value time and allocate the right time to the right activity.</p>
                        <p>Let us go through some Time Management Techniques:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Set your Priorities. Know what all needs to be done on an urgent basis. Prepare a "TO DO" List or a "Task Plan" to jot down tasks you need to complete against the time slot assigned to each activity. High Priority Tasks must be written on top followed by tasks which can be done a little later. Make sure you stick to your Task List.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Make sure you finish your assignments within the stipulated time frame. Tick the tasks you have already finished. Treat yourself with a chocolate if you finish your assignments ahead of deadlines.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Understand the difference between urgent and important work. Manage your work well. Do not begin your day with something which is not so important and can be done a little later. First finish off what all is urgent and important. Do not wait for your Boss's reminders.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Stay focused. Do not leave your work station if some urgent work needs to be done. Going for strolls in the middle of an urgent work breaks continuity and an individual tends to loose his focus. Individuals who kill time at work find it difficult to survive workplace stress.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Do include time for your tea breaks, net surfing, personal calls and so on in your daily schedule. It is important. Human being is not a machine who can work at a stretch for eight to nine hours. Assign half an hour to fourty five minutes to check updates on social networking sites, call your friends or family or go for smoke breaks etc.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Set realistic and achievable targets for yourself. Know what you need to achieve and in what duration? Do not lie to yourself. Assigning one hour to a task which you yourself know would require much more time does not make sense.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Do not overburden yourself. Say a firm no to your boss if you feel you would not be able to complete a certain assignment within the assigned deadline. Don't worry, he will not feel bad. Probably he can assign the same to any of your fellow workers. Accept tasks which you are really confident about.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Be disciplined and punctual. Avoid taking unnecessary leaves from work unless there is an emergency. Reach work on time as it helps you to plan your day better.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Keep things at their proper places. Files must be kept at their respective drawers. Staple important documents and put them in a proper folder. Learn to be a little more organized. It will save your time which goes on unnecessary searching.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Do not treat your organization as a mere source of money. Change your attitude. Avoid playing games on computer or cell phones during office hours. It is unprofessional. Do not work only when your boss is around. Taking ownership of work pays you in the long run.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Develop the habit of using an organizer. It helps you plan things better. Keep a notepad and a pen handy. Do not write contact numbers or email ids on loose papers. You will waste half of your time searching them. Manage your emails. Create separate folders for each client. Do not clutter your desktop.</span></li>
