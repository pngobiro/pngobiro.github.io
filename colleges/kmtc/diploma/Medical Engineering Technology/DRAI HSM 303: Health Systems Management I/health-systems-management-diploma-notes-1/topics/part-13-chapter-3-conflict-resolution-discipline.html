                        <p><strong>Conflict</strong> is defined as a clash between individuals arising out of a difference in thought process, attitudes, understanding, interests, requirements and even sometimes perceptions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Conflict resolution</strong> can be defined as the informal or formal process that two or more parties use to find a peaceful solution to their dispute.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conflict is classified into the following four types:</h3>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Interpersonal conflict</strong> refers to a conflict between two individuals. This occurs typically due to how people are different from one another. We have varied personalities which usually results to incompatible choices and opinions. Apparently, it is a natural occurrence which can eventually help in personal growth or developing your relationships with others. In addition, coming up with adjustments is necessary for managing this type of conflict. However, when interpersonal conflict gets too destructive, calling in a mediator would help so as to have it resolved.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">2.</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Intrapersonal conflict</strong> occurs within an individual. The experience takes place in the person's mind. Hence, it is a type of conflict that is psychological involving the individual's thoughts, values, principles and emotions. Interpersonal conflict may come in different scales, from the simpler mundane ones like deciding whether or not to go organic for lunch to ones that can affect major decisions such as choosing a career path. Furthermore, this type of conflict can be quite difficult to handle if you find it hard to decipher your inner struggles. It leads to restlessness and uneasiness, or can even cause depression. In such occasions, it would be best to seek a way to let go of the anxiety through communicating with other people. Eventually, when you find yourself out of the situation, you can become more empowered as a person. Thus, the experience evoked a positive change which will help you in your own personal growth.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Intragroup conflict</strong> is a type of conflict that happens among individuals within a team. The incompatibilities and misunderstandings among these individuals lead to an intragroup conflict. It is arises from interpersonal disagreements (e.g. team members have different personalities which may lead to tension) or differences in views and ideas (e.g. in a presentation, members of the team might find the notions presented by the one presiding to be erroneous due to their differences in opinion). Within a team, conflict can be helpful in coming up with decisions which will eventually allow them to reach their objectives as a team. However, if the degree of conflict disrupts harmony among the members, then some serious guidance from a different party will be needed for it to be settled.</span>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Intergroup conflict</strong> takes place when a misunderstanding arises among different teams within an organization. For instance, the sales department of an organization can come in conflict with the customer support department. This is due to the varied sets of goals and interests of these different groups. In addition, competition also contributes for intergroup conflict to arise. There are other factors which fuel this type of conflict. Some of these factors may include a rivalry in resources or the boundaries set by a group to others which establishes their own identity as a team.</span>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONFLICT MANAGEMENT STYLES</h3>

                        <h4>Accommodating</h4>
                        <p>Accommodation involves having to deal with the problem with an element of self-sacrifice; an individual sets aside his own concerns to maintain peace in the situation. Thus, the person yields to what the other wants, displaying a form of selflessness. It might come as an immediate solution to the issue; however, it also brings about a false manner of dealing with the problem.</p>
                        <p>This can be disruptive if there is a need to come up with a more sound and creative way out of the problem. This behaviour will be most efficient if the individual is in the wrong as it can come as a form of conciliation.</p>

                        <h4>Avoiding</h4>
                        <p>In this approach, there is withdrawal from the conflict. The problem is being dealt with through a passive attitude. Avoiding is mostly used when the perceived negative end outweighs the positive outcome. In employing this, individuals end up ignoring the problem, thinking that the conflict will resolve itself. It might be applicable in certain situations but not in all. Avoidance would mean that you neglect the responsibility that comes with it. The other individuals involved might think that you are neglecting the problem. Thus, it is better to confront the problem before it gets worse.</p>

                        <h4>Collaborating</h4>
                        <p>Collaborating aims to find a solution to the conflict through cooperating with other parties involved. Hence, communication is an important part of this strategy. In this mechanism, effort is exerted in digging into the issue to identify the needs of the individuals concerned without removing their respective interests from the picture. Collaborating individuals aim to come up with a successful resolution creatively, without compromising their own satisfactions.</p>

                        <h4>Competing</h4>
                        <p>Competition involves authoritative and assertive behaviors. In this style, the aggressive individual aims to instil pressure on the other parties to achieve a goal. It includes the use of whatever means to attain what the individual thinks is right. It may be appropriate in some situations but it shouldn't come to a point wherein the aggressor becomes too unreasonable. Dealing with the conflict with an open mind is vital for a resolution to be met.</p>

                        <h4>Compromising</h4>
                        <p>Compromising is about coming up with a resolution that would be acceptable to the parties involved. Thus, one party is willing to sacrifice their own sets of goals as long as the others will do the same. Hence, it can be viewed as a mutual give-and-take scenario where the parties submit the same amount of investment for the problem to be solved. A disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that since these parties find an easy way around the problem, the possibility of coming up with more creative ways for a solution would be neglected.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONFLICT RESOLUTION SKILLS</h3>

                        <h4>Active listening</h4>
                        <p>Active listening is a crucial part of conflict resolution. An employee might be approached by someone about a way in which their behavior is disruptive, and by actively listening, they can understand the origin of the complaint and what to do about it.</p>

                        <h4>Bias for action</h4>
                        <p>Having a bias for action means assertively seeking out the next steps rather than waiting for someone else to do something. In conflict resolution, this could manifest as a coworker noticing they may have upset someone else and actively seeking to address that with them as soon as possible. A manager could also realize there is a conflict taking place and step in to resolve the conflict before too much time has passed.</p>

                        <h4>Perspective taking</h4>
                        <p>Perspective-taking is the ability to understand someone else's point of view. You can ask yourself: "What are their thoughts, triggers and observations?" For example, a client may call customer service because they are confused about how to use the company's product. Even though the customer service agent who receives the call may understand clearly how to use the product, they can benefit from understanding the client's confusion. In fact, these conversations can help reveal potential improvements to product design or training.</p>

                        <h4>Facilitation</h4>
                        <p>When there is conflict, you can arrange the environment around you to make resolution easier. For example, a manager who oversees two different groups might bring those groups together in a comfortable conference room to address points of disagreement on a joint project. Providing time and space for discussion can facilitate a speedy end to the conflict.</p>

                        <h4>Mediation</h4>
                        <p>Mediation is when a neutral third party is involved in the resolution of a conflict. A mediator can be a trained professional, someone from an outside group (such as HR), or a person outside the conflict who can provide an objective perspective. In addition to all the other skills listed here, a successful mediator has the ability to summarize what they are hearing and observing to demonstrate progress and agreement.</p>

                        <h4>Problem solving</h4>
                        <p>Problem-solving skills help you determine the source of a problem and find an effective solution. During conflict resolution, a manager might use their problem-solving skills to identify areas of compromise between two team members who disagree.</p>

                        <h4>Responsibility</h4>
                        <p>The ability to hold people responsible for their actions is important in conflict resolution. For example, when an agreement is reached, an HR representative may need to check in a few days later to make sure everyone is still on the same page.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Employee discipline is defined as the regulations or conditions that are imposed on employees by management in order to either correct or prevent behaviors that are detrimental to an organization.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Importance of Discipline in an Organization</h3>
                        <p>Discipline in business is a type of training in which individuals are subject to particular regulations designed to mold behaviors. It is necessary to instill a disciplining program in your small business in order to move forward. An effective regimen will help improve workplace performance, provide a safe and honest environment conducive to production.</p>

                        <h4>Promotes Appropriate Behavior</h4>
                        <p>A disciplined environment helps put both management and employees on their best behavior. Managers must strictly adhere to the company's protocols in order to effectively lead those looking to them as examples. Employees who enter this type of administration know what the expectations are as well as the penalties for committing infractions. This knowledge promotes appropriate actions and conduct which are essential for a small company. Discipline should always be used as a means of ensuring that all employees adhere to a unified set of standards.</p>

                        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                        <p>Efficiency is tied to a disciplined organization. Staff members must discipline themselves in working in a timely manner to produce quality output. Small business owners must strive to cultivate a workplace in which standards are set which everyone in the organization is called upon to meet. This allows management and workers to get things done. Discipline requires concentration, time management, and orderliness, which all contribute to efficient labor.</p>

                        <h4>Peaceful Environment</h4>
                        <p>Peacefulness ensues when you have a workplace that is committed to values of a concentrated regimen. The environment that exists in organizations which do not issue specific guidelines for behavior is frequently impulsive, erratic and uncertain. It is extremely difficult for management to effectively lead workers under these conditions. A disciplined facility, however, encourages a pleasant environment that promotes good management and employee relations.</p>

                        <h4>Fairness</h4>
                        <p>Discipline helps to produce an honest environment in which everyone is treated fairly. An employee does not have to fear being shouldered with an unfair amount of tasks because set protocols are in place that call for workers to share the load. Managers are less likely to play favorites in a disciplined environment as well, as they are subject to the same conduct requirements as all others in the company. The compliance organization HR.BLR.com states that employers can ensure fair treatment of all workers by uniformly following their performance discipline plans.</p>

                        <h4>Ensures Safety</h4>
                        <p>Safety in your small company is of vital importance. You do not want any of your staff or customers to suffer preventable accidents from which personal harm occurs, which could also lead to possible legal action. You must abide by all occupational safety regulations and train your staff appropriately. Kelly Services' Smart Manager website says that a disciplined environment is necessary to provide a secure workplace. For this reason, it is necessary to train all employees on safety procedures. Employees who fail to follow safety directives are subject to disciplinary measures.</p>
