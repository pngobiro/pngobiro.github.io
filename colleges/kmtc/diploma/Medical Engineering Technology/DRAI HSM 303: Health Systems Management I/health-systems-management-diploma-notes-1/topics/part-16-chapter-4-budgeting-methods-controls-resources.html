                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">What is Traditional Budgeting Method?</h3>
                        <p>Traditional budgeting is a budget preparation method that considers last year's budget as the base. The current year's budget is prepared by making changes to the previous year's budget by adjusting the expenses on the basis of the inflation rate, consumer demand, market situation, etc. The basis of the preparation of current year's budget is last year's revenues and costs. Only those items in traditional budgets need to be justified which are over and above the last year's budget. This technique is easy to prepare and implement, barring some amount of rigidity as budgets, once prepared, cannot change.</p>
                        <p>To have a detailed understanding of the method and its advantages and disadvantages, visit - Traditional Budgeting.</p>

                        <p>Incremental budgeting is a method where the executives prepare the current year's budget by making changes in the past year's budget. The changes are in the form of addition or reduction of expenses to last year's budget. In Incremental budgeting, the starting point for preparing a budget is the prior period's budget. The budgeting technique gives no priority to the vital activities of a business. We simply adjust last year's budget, considering the inflation factor. This is a quick and easy method of preparing budgets.</p>

In ZBB, the current year's budget preparation begins from scratch, without considering the budget of the previous year. For every financial period, a new budget is prepared to take the base as zero, and resources allocated to each department is justified according to the expenses of that particular period. The ranking for allocation of resources is on the basis of the priority of all the activities of the business. Though this method is time-consuming, it gives accurate results.</p>

                        <p>Activity-based budgeting is a method where the output or the budget targets or activity is decided first. In other words, here, the management adopts a top-down approach. After defining and determining the activities, what all cost drivers required to complete that activity, target, or output is analyzed. And then a budget is prepared after considering all those cost drivers.</p>
                        <p>It does not take into account last year's budget or expenses. This method does an in-depth analysis of all the activities that incur the cost. The outcome of the research determines the allocation of resources to an activity. This method aligns business activities with business goals.

In essence, it is the process of allocating resources to achieve the greatest organizational value. Good resource management results in the right resources being available at the right time for the right work.</p>

Accordingly, resources can be mobilized from non-billable to billable and strategic work. Sometimes when resources are rolled off from projects, there isn't any suitable work to engage them. So, eventually, these resources end up on the bench. Resource managers can initially engage these resources in non-billable work before quickly assigning them to suitable billable/strategic projects</span></li>
