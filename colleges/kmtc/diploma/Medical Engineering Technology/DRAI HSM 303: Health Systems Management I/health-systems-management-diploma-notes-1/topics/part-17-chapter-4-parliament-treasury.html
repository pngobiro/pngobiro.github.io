                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In Kenya the Legislature (Parliament) has three critical functions with regard to Public Finance.</p>
                        <p>These are;</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Revenue mobilization (imposition of taxes and borrowing).</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Supervisory function.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Under the Constitution, Exchequer and Audit Act, and respective tax laws, only Parliament can impose taxes and authorize public borrowing. However, in practice there are serious Constitutional restrictions on parliamentary ability to act. Parliament is further inhibited by other factors such as budgetary traditions and practices which allow for delegation of powers on taxation with very limited reporting. Other factors inhibiting the role of Parliament include lack of technical capacity to quickly scrutinize finance data, conduct analysis and make pertinent conclusions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tax Law.</h3>
                        <p>Once Parliament passes the tax law, the only time it ever gets involved again is when the Audit Report is filed, which can be as long as three years later. The debt situation is even worse since Parliament does not get involved at all in scrutinizing domestic borrowing. Indeed, there is no Constitutional or legal requirement for the local debt to finance approved expenditures or any expenditures. There is also no limit on how much the minister can borrow locally. It is up to the minister to decide how much to borrow, at what terms and for what purpose.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">External borrowing.</h3>
                        <p>On external borrowing, there are only two soft conditions. First, there is a ceiling on how much government can borrow, which is a flat amount, and second, the external funds should be used to finance approved expenditures. However, here too there is no requirement to ensure productive investments or cost effectiveness in external borrowing. As the law stands, the minister can borrow and spend before seeking Parliamentary approval as long as he submits supplementary estimates later. Under the Constitution, Parliament is empowered to authorize spending public funds to meet various public purposes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Supervisory function.</h3>
                        <p>As regards supervisory function, this is performed on the basis of audits and reports of the Controller and Auditor General. Looking at the records of deliberations of Parliament, it is obvious that the supervisory role is limited to linking Parliamentary approval to release of funds. It does not relate to quality of expenditure or realization of results. In other words, the audits simply answer the question whether or not the money was spent for the purposes approved by Parliament and if the necessary procedures were followed in release and spending of funds.</p>
                        <p>As long as these two conditions are fulfilled, the expenditure is considered to be in order, whether the money could have been better used to e.g buy medical supplies instead of buying Mercedes Benz cars for the executive. As a result, the whole process of public finance management has not been managed in a manner which can enhance the public good.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Parliament is one of the three branches of government, which include the executives and the Judiciary. Of these three, only Parliament is empowered to impose taxes or allocate public resources. All other persons and institutions with powers to collect taxes or spend public money do so on the basis of delegated authority.</p>
                        <p>To achieve national objectives, tax policies and tax administration should not serve vested interests. Writers on public finance have advocated for observations of principles of;</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Efficiency.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Equity.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Stability.</span></li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>These principles are necessary to enable the public assess effectiveness of fiscal policies and also encourage managers of public affairs to be accountable, for what they do, how they do it, and finally ensure that they conduct public affairs transparently. Unfortunately, this is not the case with fiscal policies in Kenya, neither accountable nor transparent.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Taxation and other charges.</h3>
                        <p>Parliament imposes taxes and allocates money to benefit the public. If the tax is paid and the money spent but the desired results are not achieved, the responsibility should be on Parliament to find out why. Therefore, Parliament has to ensure proper collection of taxes and spending of public funds. It is therefore incumbent on Parliament to require that budget execution be monitored and performance audits conducted to assess achievement of results. On this matter, Parliament should face no hindrances.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preparation of annual estimates.</h3>
                        <p>The Minister for finance is required to prepare annual estimates of revenue and expenditures and lay them before Parliament. The expenditures are required to be prepared in separate votes. But as regards revenues, the Constitution does not require any form of presentation, as to the source. Therefore, it cannot be over-emphasized that budget preparation and execution is solely a responsibility of the executive. Parliamentary role is confined to approval, monitoring, and evaluating results.</p>
                        <p>To ensure proper budgeting;</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: It is essential to note that once the tax is imposed, the amount payable becomes public money. Any person who gives such money away dispenses public funds and needs to be accountable.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Corruption and protection of public property.</h3>
                        <p>Corruption and misuse of public property, especially money, causes underdevelopment and rising poverty. These types of instances are well documented in Parliamentary committee reports, where public money and other properties, have been converted into private property. To protect public resources, the Constitution should entrench and institutionalize modalities:</p>
