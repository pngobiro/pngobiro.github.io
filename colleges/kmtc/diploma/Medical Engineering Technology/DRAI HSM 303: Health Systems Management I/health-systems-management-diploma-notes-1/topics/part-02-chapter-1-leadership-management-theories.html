                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Top Level Management</h3>
                        <p>They comprise of the senior-most executives of the organization. They are normally regarded as the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the Chief Operating Officer (COO). Top management is a team consisting of managers from various operational levels.</p>
                        <p>These top-level managers are accountable for the progress and continuation of the organization. They investigate the trading atmosphere and its connections for the survival of the health facility. They form the overall organisational aims and approaches for their accomplishment. They are held responsible for all the pursuits of the organization and for its influence on the society.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Middle Level Management</h3>
                        <p>It is the connection between top and lower-level managers. They are lower to the top managers and above to the first line managers. They are normally called as division heads, for instance. Middle management is accountable for executing and regulating systems generated by the top management.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, they are liable for all the actions of the first-line managers. Their principal task is to bring out the plans formed by the top managers. For this purpose, they have to:</p>

                        <p>Managers and supervisors make up the lower level of the management in the hierarchy of the any organization. Supervisors immediately manage the efforts of the workforce. Their power and ability are defined according to the maps drawn by the top management.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Contingency Theory</h3>
                        <p>This theory proposes that no one way or style of leadership may be applicable to all situations. In other words, it recognizes that there might be variables influencing any particular situation, and a leader must choose the right course of action, taking into account those variables.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, leadership researchers White and Hodgson state, "Effective leadership is about striking the right balance between needs, context, and behavior." The best leaders have not only the right traits but also the ability to assess the needs of their followers, analyze the situation at hand, and act accordingly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Situational Leadership Theory</h3>
                        <p>Like the Contingency Theory, the Situational Theory stresses the importance of situational variables and doesn't consider anyone's leadership style to be better than the others.</p>
                        <p>Put forward by US professor, Paul Hersey and leadership guru, Ken Blanchard, the situational theory is a combination of two factors; the leadership style and the maturity levels of the followers. According to this theory, different situations demand different styles of leadership and decision-making. Leaders must act by judging the situation they are facing.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Transformational Leadership Theory</h3>
                        <p>The Transformational Leadership theory, also known as Relationship theories, focuses on the relationship between the leaders and followers. This theory talks about the kind of leader who is inspirational and charismatic, encouraging their followers to transform and become better at a task.</p>
                        <p>Transformational leaders typically motivated by their ability to show their followers the significance of the task and the higher good involved in performing it. These leaders are not only focused on the team's performance but also give individual team members the required push to reach his or her potential. These leadership theories will help you to sharp your Skill.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Transactional Theories</h3>
                        <p>Transactional Theories, also referred to as Management theories or exchange leadership theories, revolve around the role of supervision, organization, and teamwork. These leadership theories consider rewards and punishments as the basis for leadership actions. This is one of the oft-used theories in business, and the proponents of this leadership style use rewards and punishments to motivate employees.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Behavioral Theory</h3>
                        <p>In the Behavioral Theory, the emphasis shifts from the traits or qualities of leaders to their behaviors and actions. In sharp contrast to the Great Man Theory and the trait approach to leadership, this theory considers effective leadership to be the result of many learned or acquired skills. It proposes that an individual can learn to become a good leader. This is one of the best leadership theories.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Great Man Theory of Leadership</h3>
                        <p>This is one of the earliest leadership theories and is based on the assumption that leadership is an inborn phenomenon and that leaders are "born" rather than "made." According to this theory, a person capable of leading has the personality traits of a leader; charm, confidence, intellect, communication skills, and social aptitude; from birth, which set them apart. This theory emphasizes leadership as a quality that you either possess or you don't; it isn't something that you can learn.</p>
                        <p>While the theory sounds pretty discouraging to those wanting to learn the ropes of leadership, you might take heart in the fact that most modern theorists dismiss it and even by some leaders themselves. It's still an interesting take on leadership and one that highlights the qualities of great leaders, which have more or less remained unchanged over time.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Trait Theory of Leadership</h3>
                        <p>This theory walks in the footsteps of the Great Man theory in assuming that leaders are born with traits that make them more suitable for the role of a leader than others who lack those naturalborn traits.</p>
                        <p>As such, the theory pinpoints certain qualities such as intelligence, accountability, sense of responsibility, and creativity, among others, that lets an individual excel at leadership.</p>
