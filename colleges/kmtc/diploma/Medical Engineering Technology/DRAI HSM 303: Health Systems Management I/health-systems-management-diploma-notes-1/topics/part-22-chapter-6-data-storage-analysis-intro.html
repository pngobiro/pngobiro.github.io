                        <p>Data storage refers to magnetic, optical or mechanical media that records and preserves digital information for ongoing or future operations.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Onsite data storage</h3>
                        <p>Healthcare facilities and hospitals overwhelmingly prefer on-premises data storage to store and manage patient data for greater control over internal data. The idea that healthcare providers can access data at any time from a secure, native data centre appeals to most, making onsite data storage a generally popular choice.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Public cloud data storage</h3>
                        <p>With cloud-based data storage, the process of delivering patient data can be simplified, making it quick and easy without compromising security. Cloud storage is more scalable, requiring less capital investment for implementation and maintenance. Data accessibility also improves dramatically. Healthcare organisations can start with a smaller space and eventually increase cloud space as the amount of data increases.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hybrid cloud data storage solution</h3>
                        <p>A hybrid cloud data storage solution includes on-premises data storage, public cloud storage and the services needed to share data and orchestrate workloads between these environments. Most organisations choose a form of hybrid data storage when scaling up or implementing a more advanced storage solution. Organisations may choose to store more bandwidth-intensive data, such as images, on a local server so that it can be accessed quickly.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modelling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.</p>
                        <p>A simple example of Data analysis is whenever we take any decision in our day-to-day life is by thinking about what happened last time or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. This is nothing but analysing our past or future and making decisions based on it. For that, we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing but data analysis. Now same thing analyst does for business purposes, is called Data Analysis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of data analysis methods</h3>

                        <h4>1. Cluster analysis</h4>
                        <p>The action of grouping a set of data elements in a way that said elements are more similar (in a particular sense) to each other than to those in other groups - hence the term 'cluster.' Since there is no target variable when clustering, the method is often used to find hidden patterns in the data. The approach is also used to provide additional context to a trend or dataset.</p>
                        <p>By grouping customers into clusters based on demographics, purchasing behaviours, monetary value, or any other factor that might be relevant for your company, you will be able to immediately optimize your efforts and give your customers the best experience based on their needs.</p>

                        <h4>2. Cohort analysis</h4>
                        <p>This type of data analysis method uses historical data to examine and compare a determined segment of users' behaviour, which can then be grouped with others with similar characteristics. By using this data analysis methodology, it's possible to gain a wealth of insight into consumer needs or a firm understanding of a broader target group.</p>
                        <p>Cohort analysis can be really useful to perform analysis in marketing as it will allow you to understand the impact of your campaigns on specific groups of customers.</p>

                        <h4>3. Regression analysis</h4>
                        <p>The regression analysis uses historical data to understand how a dependent variable's value is affected when one (linear regression) or more independent variables (multiple regression) change or stay the same. By understanding each variable's relationship and how they developed in the past, you can anticipate possible outcomes and make better business decisions in the future.</p>

                        <h4>4. Neural networks</h4>
                        <p>The neural network forms the basis for the intelligent algorithms of machine learning. It is a form of data-driven analytics that attempts, with minimal intervention, to understand how the human brain would process insights and predict values. Neural networks learn from each and every data transaction, meaning that they evolve and advance over time.</p>
                        <p>A typical area of application for neural networks is predictive data analysis.</p>

                        <h4>5. Factor analysis</h4>
                        <p>The factor analysis, also called "dimension reduction," is a type of data analysis used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. The aim here is to uncover independent latent variables, an ideal analysis method for streamlining specific data segments.</p>

                        <h4>6. Data mining</h4>
                        <p>A method of analysis that is the umbrella term for engineering metrics and insights for additional value, direction, and context. By using exploratory statistical evaluation, data mining aims to identify dependencies, relations, data patterns, and trends to generate and advanced knowledge. When considering how to analyse data, adopting a data mining mindset is essential to success as such, it's an area that is worth exploring in greater detail.</p>

                        <h4>7. Text analysis</h4>
                        <p>Text analysis, also known in the industry as text mining, is the process of taking large sets of textual data and arranging it in a way that makes it easier to manage. By working through this cleansing process in stringent detail, you will be able to extract the data that is truly relevant to your business and use it to develop actionable insights that will propel you forward.</p>
