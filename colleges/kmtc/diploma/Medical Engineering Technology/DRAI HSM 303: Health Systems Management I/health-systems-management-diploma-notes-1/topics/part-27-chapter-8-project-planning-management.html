                        <p><strong>Project management</strong> is the application of processes, methods, skills, knowledge and experience to achieve specific project objectives according to the project acceptance criteria within agreed parameters. Project management has final deliverables that are constrained to a finite timescale and budget.</p>
                        <p><strong>Project planning</strong> is a discipline addressing how to complete a project in a certain timeframe, usually with defined stages and designated resources.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Importance of Planning</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions.</p>
                        <p>Planning helps an organization chart a course for the achievement of its goals. The process begins with reviewing the current operations of the organization and identifying what needs to be improved operationally in the upcoming year. From there, planning involves envisioning the results the organization wants to achieve, and determining the steps necessary to arrive at the intended destination - success, whether that is measured in financial terms, or goals that include being the highest-rated organization in customer satisfaction.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Efficient Use of Resources</h3>
                        <p>All organizations, large and small, have limited resources. The planning process provides the information top management needs to make effective decisions about how to allocate the resources in a way that will enable the organization to reach its objectives. Productivity is maximized and resources are not wasted on projects with little chance of success.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Establishing Organizational Goals</h3>
                        <p>Setting goals that challenge everyone in the organization to strive for better performance is one of the key aspects of the planning process. Goals must be aggressive, but realistic.</p>
                        <p>Organizations cannot allow themselves to become too satisfied with how they are currently doing - or they are likely to lose ground to competitors.</p>
                        <p>The goal setting process can be a wake-up call for managers that have become complacent. The other benefit of goal setting comes when forecast results are compared to actual results. Organizations analyze significant variances from forecast and take action to remedy situations where revenues were lower than plan or expenses higher.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Managing Risk and Uncertainty</h3>
                        <p>Managing risk is essential to an organization's success. Even the largest corporations cannot control the economic and competitive environment around them. Unforeseen events occur that must be dealt with quickly, before negative financial consequences from these events become severe.</p>
                        <p>Planning encourages the development of "what-if" scenarios, where managers attempt to envision possible risk factors and develop contingency plans to deal with them. The pace of change in business is rapid, and organizations must be able to rapidly adjust their strategies to these changing conditions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Team Building and Cooperation</h3>
                        <p>Planning promotes team building and a spirit of cooperation. When the plan is completed and communicated to members of the organization, everyone knows what their responsibilities are, and how other areas of the organization need their assistance and expertise in order to complete assigned tasks. They see how their work contributes to the success of the organization as a whole and can take pride in their contributions.</p>
                        <p>Potential conflict can be reduced when top management solicits department or division managers' input during the goal setting process. Individuals are less likely to resent budgetary targets when they had a say in their creation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Creating Competitive Advantages</h3>
                        <p>Planning helps organizations get a realistic view of their current strengths and weaknesses relative to major competitors. The management team sees areas where competitors may be vulnerable and then crafts marketing strategies to take advantage of these weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>Observing competitors' actions can also help organizations identify opportunities they may have overlooked, such as emerging international markets or opportunities to market products to completely different customer groups.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Types of Plans</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Operational Planning</h3>
                        <p>"Operational plans are about how things need to happen," motivational leadership speaker Mack Story said at LinkedIn. "Guidelines of how to accomplish the mission are set."</p>
                        <p>This type of planning typically describes the day-to-day running of the company. Operational plans are often described as single use plans or ongoing plans. Single use plans are created for events and activities with a single occurrence (such as a single marketing campaign). Ongoing plans include policies for approaching problems, rules for specific regulations and procedures for a step-by-step process for accomplishing particular objectives.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Strategic Planning</h3>
                        <p>"Strategic plans are all about why things need to happen," Story said. "It's big picture, long-term thinking. It starts at the highest level with defining a mission and casting a vision."</p>
                        <p>Strategic planning includes a high-level overview of the entire business. It's the foundational basis of the organization and will dictate long-term decisions. The scope of strategic planning can be anywhere from the next two years to the next 10 years. Important components of a strategic plan are vision, mission and values.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tactical Planning</h3>
                        <p>"Tactical plans are about what is going to happen," Story said. "Basically at the tactical level, there are many focused, specific, and short-term plans, where the actual work is being done, that support the high-level strategic plans."</p>
                        <p>Tactical planning supports strategic planning. It includes tactics that the organization plans to use to achieve what's outlined in the strategic plan. Often, the scope is less than one year and breaks down the strategic plan into actionable chunks. Tactical planning is different from operational planning in that tactical plans ask specific questions about what needs to happen to accomplish a strategic goal; operational plans ask how the organization will generally do something to accomplish the company's mission.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Contingency Planning</h3>
                        <p>Contingency plans are made when something unexpected happens or when something needs to be changed. Business experts sometimes refer to these plans as a special type of planning.</p>
                        <p>Contingency planning can be helpful in circumstances that call for a change. Although managers should anticipate changes when engaged in any of the primary types of planning, contingency planning is essential in moments when changes can't be foreseen. As the business world becomes more complicated, contingency planning becomes more important to engage in and understand.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">PHASES OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 1: Project initiation</h3>
                        <p>The project initiation phase is the first stage of turning an abstract idea into a meaningful goal. In this stage, you need to develop a business case and define the project on a broad level. In order to do that, you have to determine the need for the project and create a project charter.</p>
                        <p>The project charter is an important document consisting of details like the project constraints, goals, appointment of the project manager, budget, expected timeline, etc.</p>
                        <p>Once you have the project goals and project scope, identify key project stakeholders-the people who are to be involved in the project. Create a stakeholder register with the roles, designation, communication requirements, and influence.</p>
                        <p>While a clear goal of the project is established in this phase, a project charter does not contain any technical details that happen in the planning stage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 2: Project planning</h3>
                        <p>The project planning stage requires complete diligence as it lays out the project's roadmap. Unless you are using a modern project management methodology like agile project management, the second phase of project management is expected to take almost half of the entire project's timespan.</p>
                        <p>In this phase, the primary tasks are identifying technical requirements, developing a detailed project schedule, creating a communication plan, and setting up goals/deliverables.</p>
                        <p>During the planning stage, the scope of the project is defined. There is a possibility of changing the scope of the project demands it but the project manager must approve the change. Project managers also develop a work breakdown structure (WBS), which clearly visualizes the entire project in different sections for the team management.</p>
                        <p>Risk mitigation is another important aspect of project management that is a part of the planning stage. The project manager is responsible for extrapolating past data to identify potential project management risks and develop a strategy to minimize them.</p>
                        <p>An important element that professionals often overlook is an effective change management plan. As a project manager, you must be ready to incorporate a few changes in the project to avoid bottlenecks and project delays.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of a working change management plan, scope creep happens and causes huge problems for the project team in the later stages of the project. So, it's best to reduce the possibility of unforeseen changes as much as possible.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 3: Project execution</h3>
                        <p>The project execution stage is where your team does the actual work. As a project manager, your job is to establish efficient workflows and carefully monitor the progress of your team.</p>
                        <p>Another responsibility of the project manager during this phase is to consistently maintain effective collaboration between project stakeholders. This ensures that everyone stays on the same page and the project runs smoothly without any issues.</p>
                        <p>You can take help from the best project collaboration tools that are available in the market. They'll not only make your life easier but also improve efficiency and increase the productivity of your team.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 4: Project monitoring and controlling</h3>
                        <p>In the project management process, the third and fourth phases are not sequential in nature. The project monitoring and controlling phase run simultaneously with project execution, thereby ensuring that objectives and project deliverables are met.</p>
                        <p>As a project manager, you can make sure that no one deviates from the original plan by establishing Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).</p>
                        <p>During the monitoring phase of project management, the manager is also responsible for quantitatively tracking the effort and cost during the process. This tracking not only ensures that the project remains within the budget but also is important for future projects.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phase 5: Project closing</h3>
                        <p>This is the final phase of the project management process. The project closure stage indicates the end of the project after the final delivery. There are times when external talent is hired specifically for the project on contract. Terminating these contracts and completing the necessary paperwork is also the responsibility of the project manager.</p>
                        <p>Most teams hold a reflection meeting after the completion of the project in order to contemplate their successes and failures during the project. This is an effective method to ensure continuous improvement within the company to enhance the overall productivity of the team in the future.</p>
