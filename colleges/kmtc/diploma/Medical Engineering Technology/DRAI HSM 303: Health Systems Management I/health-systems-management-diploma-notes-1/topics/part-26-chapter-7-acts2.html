                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Employee's Compensation Act, 2010 is a social security/welfare scheme that provides comprehensive compensation to employees who suffer from occupational diseases or sustain injuries arising from accidents at workplace or in the course of employment.</p>
                        <p>The basis or justification for 'compensation' is the employer's duty of care.</p>
                        <p>The idea of compensation suggests that someone has suffered a wrong for which he has to be compensated monetarily.</p>
                        <p>This implies that another person has a duty to prevent the occurrence of the wrong suffered. Payment of compensation by the employer to the employee is rooted in the accepted principle that the employer has a duty of care, a duty to protect the health, welfare and safety of workers at work. Where the worker sustains injuries, gets ill or dies in work-related circumstances, the employer is liable to pay compensation to the worker or to his dependents, in the event of death. This article is intended to examine the issues, prospects and challenges of the Employee's Compensation Act, 2010.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This act is the general law of succession in the country. The law of succession rules vary for estate and testate successions. Here is the procedure in the law of succession in Kenya for the different types of succession.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Testate succession</h3>
                        <p>Under testate succession, the disposal of the property of the deceased person is carried out according to the will or testament.</p>
                        <p>In the context of the law of succession, the will is a record of a deceased person's wishes and intentions pertaining to the devolution of his property upon his death.</p>
                        <p>The owner of the property arranges to ensure that upon his death, the property passes to a person or persons of his choice through a valid will. Image: instagram.com,</p> <!-- Note: Stray image reference -->
                        <p>It is important to note that the will has no legal effect until the maker dies. While he is alive, it neither limits his rights of ownership nor confers any benefits to anyone.</p>
                        <p>Beneficiaries under a will do not acquire an interest in the property before the testator's death.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intestate succession</h3>
                        <p>In the case of intestate succession, the deceased person does not leave behind a will spelling out how the estate should be distributed to the people entitled to it.</p>
                        <p>Under the law, the nature of the devolution of the property upon intestacy depends on whether the deceased was polygamous or monogamous.</p>
                        <p>The Law of Succession Act makes provision for both monogamous and polygamous situations. Provisions relating to intestacy are contained in Part V of the Act from Section 32 to Section 42. The rules of this act only benefit the people who have a direct blood link with the intestate. Under Section 35 and 37 of this act, immediate family members, including the spouse and children, are given priority to inherit the estate.</p>
                        <p>The surviving spouse is entitled to the personal and household effects of the deceased. He/she is required to hold the estate in trust for the children and to divide it to the children in equal shares in the future. If there is no surviving spouse, the net intestate estate devolves upon the child or children of the deceased.</p>
                        <p>The personal and household effects of the deceased absolutely, The first Kshs.10, 000.00 out of the residue of the net intestate estate 20% of the residue of the net intestate whichever is greater, and A life interest in the whole of the remainder</p> <!-- Note: Formatting issue in MMD -->
                        <p>Section 40 addresses the case of the polygamous intestate. In such a case, his/her personal and household effects and the residue of the net intestate estate should in the first place be divided among the houses according to the number of children in each house.</p>
                        <p>If there are no immediate family members, distant relatives are allowed to inherit it. There are no benefits conferred on categories such as the parents-in-law and unmarried partners except in the case where the deceased left a will. In the case where there are no blood relatives, the estate or property devolves to the state.</p>
