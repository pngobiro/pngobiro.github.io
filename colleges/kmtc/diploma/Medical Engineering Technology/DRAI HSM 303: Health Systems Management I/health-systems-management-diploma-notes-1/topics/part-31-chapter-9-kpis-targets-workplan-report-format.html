                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Customer satisfaction</h3>
                        <p>Our service at the end of the day is to serve our customers and clients. So, the ultimate measure of success in a project is customer satisfaction. Surveys are carried out to get their feedback.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Productivity</h3>
                        <p>Productivity measures the output of a resource as compared to its input. For every unit of input, what is the output? One way to measure this would be revenue per employee; the ratio of revenue per employee to the average salary per employee gives a productivity ratio for the organization. We could measure the number of projects done per employee or the number of lines of code per employee as well.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Cost efficiency</h3>
                        <p>Cost Performance Index is the ratio of the value earned and the cost incurred to obtain that value. This helps organizations reduce financial risk by keeping the capital cost in check and allocating the capital wisely.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Time</h3>
                        <p>The time taken from the beginning to the end of a project is referred to as the cycle time. Similar schemes can have a standard benchmark of cycle time to measure against. A shorter cycle time means a faster return on investment to the organization. Also, giving time for more projects to be taken up.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Return on investment (ROI)</h3>
                        <p>ROI can be calculated as the total benefit divided by the total cost, expressed as a percentage (multiply by 100). It measures the returns for every dollar invested. Benefits can include the profits, cost savings, increased outputs expressed as a dollar amount while costs can consist of the cost of resources, travel expenses, cost of design and maintenance of a project, etc.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Alignment with goals of the organization</h3>
                        <p>You also need to measure if the projects you are doing are right for you keeping in mind the purposes of the organization as a whole. Surveys can be conducted along with alignment ratings where the business managers, leaders and project managers are the participants.</p>
                        <p>With these KPIs in mind, you are on your way to effectively manage any project that serves the goals of your organization.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Setting performance targets can help you deliver the strategic changes that many growing businesses need to make. The top-level objectives of your strategic plan can be implemented through departmental goals, and setting targets based on KPIs is an ideal way of doing this.</p>
                        <p>For example, a company seeking to expand on the basis of its product design capabilities might target year-on-year increases in the number of patents it secures, new product launches, or licensing income. The specifics will depend on which KPIs best capture the dynamics in the market.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Setting SMART targets</h3>
                        <p>Your targets should be SMART - specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Using KPIs ensures your targets will meet the first two criteria, as all KPIs should, by definition, be <strong>specific</strong>and <strong>measurable</strong>.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Achievable</strong>- you need to set ambitious targets that will motivate and inspire your employees. Look back at your recent performance to get a sense of what is feasible.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Realistic</strong>- setting realistic targets means being fair on the people who will have to reach them. Make sure you only ask for performance improvements in areas that your staff can actually influence.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Time-bound</strong>- people's progress towards a goal will be more rapid if they have a clear sense of the deadlines against which their progress will be assessed.</span></li>

                        <span class="heading-text">WORK PLAN</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A work plan is a set of goals and processes by which a team can accomplish those goals. It can be used in professional or private life and help you stay organized while working on projects.</p>
                        <p>A work plan is an important tool that helps a project to assign tasks, manage workflow and track the various components and milestone deadlines. A work plan often has a duration of six to 12 months, but it can be adjusted, based on a specific need within the company. Implementing work plans helps articulate strategies to employees in a way to improve team member focus and drive. Businesses use a work plan to organize large projects. A work plan gives everyone on the team the project framework and the background, goals and timelines are defined for the overall project. A work plan then breaks down the tasks, and assigns different items to different project members, giving them individual timelines.</p>
                        <p>A well-written work plan enables a project manager to oversee the big picture while managing smaller project components. When creating a work plan for your next big project, incorporate common sections.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction and Background</h3>
                        <p>Introduce your project by explaining its purpose, and the key reasons why it is necessary. Also provide a background of historical and statistical data as it relates to the project's objective, so that it supports why the project will resolve a specific problem or issue. This doesn't need to be a long section, but it must define concisely what the project is about.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Project Scope and Team</h3>
                        <p>Elaborate on the purpose of the project by defining the project's entire scope. Explain the problem and how the project delivers the needed solution. Break things down, and define the departments or who are the key players and what are their assignments.</p>
                        <p>For example, a mortgage company needs a new secured server that has upgraded client data security. The company project lead or an internet tech-company consultant creates a work plan that explains how the company and its team will work with existing key mortgage company personnel who will develop a new server system, and will have a strategic plan to migrate the data in a seamless fashion.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Schedule and Timelines</h3>
                        <p>Time is money, and business owners can't have projects that drag on. A well-written work plan sets a deadline for the project's completion and establishes timelines for the key project deliverables. Specific teams or specific individuals are assigned tasks, including notifying a new department when the task is completed, which triggers a new deliverable timeline.</p>
                        <p>You might find that some tasks on a project operate simultaneously while other tasks cannot start until someone else delivers his part of the project. For example, with the IT secured server, the data cannot migrate until the security protocol is complete. But a compilation of client data and key company information can be compiled while the security protocol is being created so that the data is prepared when the server is ready.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Budget Planning and Monitoring</h3>
                        <p>Every work plan needs to establish a budget. Budgets are often defined by a project's total cost and are then further broken down into department or subcontractor costs. Some project managers account for hourly wages and the necessary overtime so they can implement final components during a large project.</p>
                        <p>Project managers must continuously monitor the budget on the project, especially if hourly wages and overtime are part of the budget. Underestimating the amount of time that employees devote to a project can quickly lead to overspending and running out of money before the project is complete. Keep the team moving quickly and efficiently to stay on budget.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Quality Control and Continuity Plan</h3>
                        <p>Project managers must review the deliverables and monitor its progress, making sure that things are done properly. When a big project is done, two courses of action result. The first is to implement and move on. The second is to implement and maintain.</p>
                        <p>With the example of the IT server creation for the mortgage company, the project manager should have the ability to make sure that the correct data is being compiled for migration to test deliverables at various times to make certain that things are working properly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Secondary Plans for Some Projects</h3>
                        <p>This type of project needs maintenance. Establish a secondary plan that has a budget to review, and to troubleshoot and maintain the server. The continuity plan might move some outside contractors to internal maintenance or might contract the vendor to periodically work on the system to upgrade items and troubleshoot problems. A work plan should look beyond the main project completion so that it is a comprehensive plan.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A report is a specific form of writing that is organised to identify and examine issues, events, or findings that have happened in a physical sense, within an organisation, or findings from a research investigation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">FORMAT OF A REPORT</h3>
                        <h4>1. Title Section</h4>
                        <p>The format of the title section of your report would depend on the length of the said document. Short reports may include just the author, date prepared, and other information deemed necessary. Long reports, on the other hand, may require designated pages for its table of contents and definition of terms as well.</p>
                        <h4>2. Summary</h4>
                        <p>A summary is an essential part of any lengthy document. It should provide an overview of the report's content for readers to refer to. Since some people choose to skim through the summary rather than read the whole report, this section must consist of the key points, conclusion, and recommendations. Relevant information must be presented accordingly for the audience to comprehend. It would be best to write this portion by the very end of the writing process to ensure that every major detail is included in the report.</p>
                        <h4>3. Introduction</h4>
                        <p>The introduction of your report should explain the problem at hand along with the purpose of preparing the report. You may also insert the definition of terms in this part if you have failed to include it in the title section. An explanation about how the details of the report are arranged must also be presented to provide a general overview for readers.</p>
                        <h4>4. Body</h4>
                        <p>The body of your report typically consists of the most number of pages. It may also be broken down into subparts with subtitles that support and expound the major points stated in the report. These subparts may vary depending on the type of report you are creating as well. Information is typically arranged according to its level of importance, with the most significant data coming first.</p>
                        <h4>5. Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>This part connects everything together. Similar to the summary, most people read this section to study the data and results gathered in the report. For this reason alone, crafting a conclusion that is free of jargon is important. Instead of repeating everything you have mentioned in your report, you must present your final thoughts or statement on the subject at hand.</p>
                        <h4>6. Recommendations</h4>
                        <p>Any suggestions or additional actions that need to be taken are discussed in this part of the report. Any limitations or concerns that you have failed to tackle in your report must be stated for future reference as well. In most cases, recommendations are presented in order of priority.</p>
                        <h4>7. Appendices</h4>
                        <p>Technical details of your report are usually found in this section. Experts in the given field usually consider this section critical for further studies. This may either be in a statistical, explanatory or bibliographical nature.</p>
