                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Standards of care in nursing are important because they recognize the trusted role that a nurse plays. These standards are considered the baseline for quality care. They must be developed while assessing the state and federal rules, regulations and laws that govern the practice of nursing. Other agencies and organizations may also assist in the development of these standards. Standards of care apply equally to nurses in various settings. They govern the nurse's practice at every level of practice.</p>
                        <p>Often, standards of care are established at the national level so that care will be the same regardless of the venue. However, states and local areas may also establish their own set of standards of care.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Importance of Standards</h3>
                        <p>Nursing standards of care are important for a number of reasons.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">They outline professional expectations of nurses.</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Ultimately, standards give nurses the necessary information that they need to know the quality of care that they must provide to patients and establish measures in which to evaluate the care provided.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Generally, nurses are expected to be in compliance with these standards and to ensure that their own underlings are in compliance. It is critical that they comply with these standards in order to protect the public whom they treat.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Monitoring</strong> is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing and using information to track a programme's progress toward reaching its objectives and to guide management decisions. Monitoring usually focuses on processes, such as when and where activities occur, who delivers them and how many people or entities they reach.</p>
                        <p>Monitoring is the systematic and routine collection of information from projects and programmes for four main purposes:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">To learn from experiences to improve practices and activities in the future;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">To have internal and external accountability of the resources used and the results obtained;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">To take informed decisions on the future of the initiative;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">To promote empowerment of beneficiaries of the initiative.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Monitoring allows results, processes and experiences to be documented and used as a basis to steer decision-making and learning processes. Monitoring is checking progress against plans. The data acquired through monitoring is used for evaluation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Evaluation</strong> is assessing, as systematically and objectively as possible, a completed project or programme (or a phase of an ongoing project or programme that has been completed).</p>
                        <p>Evaluations appraise data and information that inform strategic decisions, thus improving the project or programme in the future.</p>
                        <p>Evaluations should help to draw conclusions about five main aspects of the intervention:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">relevance</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">effectiveness</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">efficiency</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">impact</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">sustainability</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Information gathered in relation to these aspects during the monitoring process provides the basis for the evaluative analysis.</p>
                        <p>In general, monitoring is integral to evaluation. During an evaluation, information from previous monitoring processes is used to understand the ways in which the project or programme developed and stimulated change. Monitoring focuses on the measurement of the following aspects of an intervention:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">On quantity and quality of the implemented activities (outputs: What do we do? How do we manage our activities?)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">On processes inherent to a project or programme (outcomes: What were the effects /changes that occurred as a result of your intervention?)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">On processes external to an intervention (impact: Which broader, long-term effects were triggered by the implemented activities in combination with other environmental factors?)</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The evaluation process is an analysis or interpretation of the collected data which delves deeper into the relationships between the results of the project/programme, the effects produced by the project/programme and the overall impact of the project/programme.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Evaluation Criteria</h3>
                        <p>Evaluations are typically carried out using the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria. Grantees will be expected to plan for, and conduct evaluations that assess their project against the following criteria.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Relevance:</strong> The extent to which the aid activity is suited to the priorities and policies of the target group, recipient and donor.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> A measure of the extent to which an aid activity attains its objectives.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Efficiency measures the outputs -- qualitative and quantitative -- in relation to the inputs. It is an economic term, which signifies that the aid uses the least costly resources possible in order to achieve the desired results.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Impact:</strong> The positive and negative changes produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended. This involves the main impacts and effects resulting from the activity on the local social, economic, environmental and other development indicators. The examination should be concerned with both intended and unintended results and must also include the positive and negative impact of external factors, such as changes in terms of trade and financial conditions.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Sustainability is concerned with measuring whether the benefits of an activity are likely to continue after donor funding has been withdrawn. Projects need to be environmentally as well as financially sustainable.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MONITORING TOOLS</h3>

                        <h4>1. Employee Monitoring Software</h4>
                        <p>Whether you want to keep track of your in-office or remote team, online employee monitoring technology may be the solution.</p>
                        <p>Employee monitoring and productivity software is the most widely used method to keep track of your employees today. This is probably because employee tracking software provides the most direct employee monitoring experience compared to the other methods we'll discuss here.</p>
                        <p>They're also the least invasive way to monitor your employees - and can be used by inoffice and remote work teams!</p>
                        <p>An excellent employee monitoring tool should offer various functionalities like time tracking, distraction management, and features to differentiate between productive and unproductive activities.</p>

                        <h4>2. Video Surveillance</h4>
                        <p>CCTV cameras are part of the most common surveillance technology you'll find in almost every workplace today. Many employers use this method of employee surveillance to prevent misbehavior and for safety reasons.</p>
                        <p>While CCTV cameras can show you whether your employees are at their workstations, it doesn't help you recognize if they're productive or not.</p>
                        <p>However, it's important to note that some countries require businesses to install video surveillance systems to assist their workplace safety measures better.</p>

                        <h4>3. Network and Email Monitoring</h4>
                        <p>Network and email monitoring is a more direct way of monitoring employees.</p>
                        <p>Here's how they help you keep tabs on your employees:</p>
                        <h5>A. Network Monitoring</h5>
                        <p>Network monitoring is a process that involves analyzing all the incoming and outgoing traffic from your office network.</p>
                        <p>A network monitoring system can monitor malicious programs, infected workstations, and even unusual internet usage in your organization. You can also check if your employees are accessing unproductive sites, like social media, during work.</p>
                        <h5>B. Email Monitoring</h5>
                        <p>Work email addresses are meant only for official or work-related purposes.</p>
                        <p>If you're an employee, your office IT team/administrator usually has complete control over your email inbox. That's why employees are heavily discouraged from using their work email account for personal purposes.</p>
                        <p>The only valid reason to use email monitoring at work is to check if employees are using their official email IDs to send out private email messages.</p>
                        <p>However, there are better ways to prevent workers from misusing an employee's email address. For example, instead of monitoring all employee communication, you could use a filter to block non-work emails from reaching the staff's inboxes.</p>

                        <h4>4. Keycards and Biometric Terminals</h4>
                        <p>Here's how keycards and biometric terminals can help monitor employees:</p>
                        <h5>A. Keycards</h5>
                        <p>Keycards are used by many companies, especially those with high security levels, to protect trade secrets.</p>
                        <p>Each keycard is linked to its owner, which means you can set individual security settings for each employee.</p>
                        <p>Keycards are mostly used to restrict employees from accessing unauthorized locations within the office. For example, every access point in your office will have a keycard sensor that only allows people carrying authorized keycards to enter.</p>
                        <p>You can also use keycards to monitor employee attendance and track the physical location of employees within the office premises.</p>
                        <p>However, keycards can't show you whether your employees are actually tending to their work or just idling at their workstations. Additionally, it doesn't help with remote work monitoring.</p>
                        <h5>B. Biometric Terminals</h5>
                        <p>Biometric terminals are great for companies that demand very high levels of security. These systems either have fingerprint or iris scanners on doors that lead to restricted areas.</p>
                        <p>They're better than keycards at security since they're less susceptible to data breaches and theft. However, you can only use them to keep employees out of restricted areas.</p>

                        <h4>5. GPS Tracking</h4>
                        <p>GPS tracking helps businesses keep track of employees who are always out on the field, like construction engineers or delivery drivers.</p>
                        <p>But there are certain limitations when it comes to GPS tracking.</p>
                        <p>For example, while you can always fit a tracker to a company vehicle to see its location in realtime, you can't always force employees to download tracking apps on their personal smartphones.</p>
