                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Establish your questions</strong><br>Once you've outlined your core objectives, you should consider which questions will need answering to help you achieve your mission. This is one of the most important data analytics techniques as it will shape the very foundations of your success.<br>To help you ask the right things and ensure your data works for you, you have to ask the right data analysis questions.</span>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Data democratization</strong><br>After giving your data analytics methodology some real direction, and knowing which questions need answering to extract optimum value from the information available to your organization, you should continue with data democratization.<br>Data democratization is a process that aims to connect data from various sources efficiently and quickly so that anyone in your organization can access it at any given moment. You can extract data in text, images, videos, numbers, or any other format. And then perform cross-database analysis to achieve more advanced insights to share with the rest of the company interactively.<br>Once you have decided on your most valuable data sources, you need to take all of this information into a structured format to start collecting your insights. For this purpose, data pine offers an easy all-in-one data connectors feature to integrate all your internal and external data sources and manage them at your will. Additionally, data pine's end-to-end solution automatically updates your data, allowing you to save time and focus on performing the right analysis to grow your business.</span>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Clean your data</strong><br>After harvesting from so many sources you will be left with a vast amount of information that can be overwhelming to deal with. At the same time, you can be faced with incorrect data that can be misleading to your analysis. The smartest thing you can do to avoid dealing with this in the future is to clean the data. This process is fundamental before visualizing it, as it will ensure that the insights you extract from it are correct.<br>There are many things that you need to look for while cleaning your data. The most important one is to eliminate any duplicate observations; this usually appears when using multiple internal and external sources of data. You can also add any missing codes, fix empty fields, and eliminate incorrectly formatted data.</span>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Set your KPIs</strong><br>Once you've set your data sources, cleaned your data, and established clear-cut questions you want your insights to answer, you need to set a host of key performance indicators (KPIs) that will help you track, measure, and shape your progress in a number of key areas.<br>KPIs are critical to both analysis methods in qualitative and quantitative research. This is one of the primary methods of data analysis you certainly shouldn't overlook.<br>To help you set the best possible KPIs for your initiatives and activities, here is an example of a relevant logistics KPI: transportation-related costs.

These roadmaps, if developed properly, are also built so they can be tweaked and scaled over time.<br>Invest ample time in developing a roadmap that will help you store, manage, and handle your data internally, and you will make your analysis techniques all the more fluid and functional one of the most powerful types of data analysis methods available today.</span>
