                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Theory X and theory Y.</h3>
                        <p>Theory X and theory Y are theories of human motivation. They describe two very different attitudes towards workforce motivation. McGregor thought that the key to connecting selfactualization with work is determined by the managerial trust of subordinates.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Theory X.</h4>
                        <p>In this theory which has been proved counter-effective in most modern practice, management assumes employees are inherently lazy and will avoid work if they can and they inherently dislike work. As a result of this, management beliefs that workers need to be closely supervised and comprehensive systems of controls developed.</p>
                        <p>Hierarchy - A hierarchical structure is needed with narrow span of control at each and every level. According to this theory, employees will show little ambition without incentive and will avoid responsibility.</p>
                        <p>If the organizational goals are to be met, theory X managers rely heavily on threats and coercion to gain their employees compliance (according to Michael J. Papa). Beliefs of this theory lead to mistrust, highly restrictive supervision, punitive atmosphere etc. Theory X manager tends to believe that everything must end in blaming someone (suspicious always). They will blame the person first without questioning whether it may be the system, policy, or lack of training that deserves the blame. Theory X manager believes that his or her employees do not really want to work but they are out for themselves and that their interest in the job is only money.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Theory Y.</h4>
                        <p>In this theory, management assumes employees may be ambitious and self-motivated and exercise self-control. It is believed that employees enjoy their mental and physical work duties and to them, work is as natural as play. They possess the ability for creative problem solving, but their talents are underused in most organizations.</p>
                        <p>Self-control- Given the proper conditions, theory Y managers believe that employees will learn to seek out and accept responsibility and to exercise self-control and self-direction in accomplishing objectives to which they are committed. Theory Y managers believe that given the right condition, most people will want to do well at work. They believe that the satisfaction of doing a good job is a strong motivation. Many people interpret theory Y as a positive set of beliefs about workers.</p>
                        <p>McGregor thinks that theory Y managers are more likely than theory X managers to develop the climate of trust with employees that is required for human resource development, which is a crucial aspect of any organization. This would include managers communicating openly with subordinates, minimizing difference between superior subordinate relationships, creating a comfortable environment, subordinates develop and use their abilities, sharing of decision making and employer is under less pressure than in theory X .</p>

                        <p>Organizational Behavior ( OB ) is the study and application of knowledge about how people, individuals, and groups act in organizations. It does this by taking a system approach, meaning it interprets people-organization relationships in terms of the whole person, whole group, whole organization, and whole social system. Its purpose is to build better relationships by achieving human objectives, organizational objectives, and social objectives.</p>

                        <p>There are four major models or frameworks that organizations operate out of.</p>

                        <h4>Model 1: Autocratic.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Basis</strong> - The basis of this model is power with a managerial orientation of authority. The employees in turn are oriented towards obedience and dependence on the boss.</p>
                        <p><strong>Employee needs</strong>- The employee need, that is met is subsistence.</p>
                        <p><strong>Performance Result</strong> - The performance result is minimal.</p>

                        <h4>Model 2: Custodial.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Basis</strong> - The basis of this model is economic resources with a managerial orientation of money. The employees in turn are oriented towards security and benefits and dependence on the organization.</p>
                        <p><strong>Employee needs</strong> - The employee need, that is met is security.</p>
                        <p><strong>Performance result</strong>- The performance result is passive cooperation.</p>

                        <h4>Model 3: Supportive.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Basis</strong> - The basis of this model is leadership with a managerial orientation of support. The employees in turn are oriented towards job performance and participation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Employee needs</strong>- The employee need that is met is status and recognition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Performance result</strong> - The performance result is awakened drives.</p>

                        <h4>Model 4: Collegial.</h4>
                        <p><strong>Basis</strong>- The basis of this model is partnership with a managerial orientation of teamwork. The employees in turn are oriented towards responsible behavior and self-discipline.</p>
                        <p><strong>Employee needs</strong> - The employee need that is met is self-actualization.</p>
                        <p><strong>Performance result</strong>- The performance result is moderate enthusiasm.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Group dynamics is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (intergroup dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Process/Stages of Group Development/Evolution:</h3>
                        <p>Group Development is a dynamic process. How do groups evolve? There is a process of five stages through which groups pass through. The process includes the five stages: forming, storming, forming, performing, and adjourning.</p>

                        <h4>Forming:</h4>
                        <p>The first stage in the life of a group is concerned with forming a group. This stage is characterized by members seeking either a work assignment (in a formal group) or other benefit, like status, affiliation, power, etc. (in an informal group). Members at this stage either engage in busy type of activity or show apathy.</p>

                        <h4>Storming:</h4>
                        <p>The next stage in this group is marked by the formation of dyads and triads. Members seek out familiar or similar individuals and begin a deeper sharing of self. Continued attention to the subgroup creates a differentiation in the group and tensions across the dyads / triads may appear. Pairing is a common phenomenon. There will be conflict about controlling the group.</p>

                        <h4>Norming:</h4>
                        <p>The third stage of group development is marked by a more serious concern about task performance. The dyads/triads begin to open up and seek out other members in the group. Efforts are made to establish various norms for task performance.</p>
                        <p>Members begin to take greater responsibility for their own group and relationship while the authority figure becomes relaxed. Once this stage is complete, a clear picture will emerge about hierarchy of leadership. The norming stage is over with the solidification of the group structure and a sense of group identity and camaraderie.</p>

                        <h4>Performing:</h4>
                        <p>This is a stage of a fully functional group where members see themselves as a group and get involved in the task. Each person makes a contribution and the authority figure is also seen as a part of the group. Group norms are followed and collective pressure is exerted to ensure the Process of Group effectiveness of the group.</p>
                        <p>The group may redefine its goals Development in the light of information from the outside environment and show an autonomous will to pursue those goals. The long-term viability of the group is established and nurtured.</p>

                        <h4>Adjourning:</h4>
                        <p>In the case of temporary groups, like project team, task force, or any other such group, which have a limited task at hand, also have a fifth stage, This is known as adjourning.</p>
                        <p>The group decides to disband. Some members may feel happy over the performance, and some may be unhappy over the stoppage of meeting with group members. Adjourning may also be referred to as mourning, i.e. mourning the adjournment of the group.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Groups:</h3>
                        <p>One way to classify the groups is by way of formality - formal and informal. While formal groups are established by an organization to achieve its goals, informal groups merge spontaneously. Formal groups may take the form of command groups, task groups, and functional groups.</p>

                        <h4>1. Command Groups:</h4>
                        <p>Command groups are specified by the organizational chart and often consist of a supervisor and the subordinates that report to that supervisor. An example of a command group is a market research firm CEO and the research associates under him.</p>

                        <h4>2. Task Groups:</h4>
                        <p>Task groups consist of people who work together to achieve a common task. Members are brought together to accomplish a narrow range of goals within a specified time period. Task groups are also commonly referred to as task forces. The organization appoints members and assigns the goals and tasks to be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>Examples of assigned tasks are the development of a new product, the improvement of a production process, or designing the syllabus under semester system.</p>
                        <p>Other common task groups are ad hoc committees, project groups, and standing committees. Ad hoc committees are temporary groups created to resolve a specific complaint or develop a process are normally disbanded after the group completes the assigned task.</p>

                        <h4>3. Functional Groups:</h4>
                        <p>A functional group is created by the organization to accomplish specific goals within an unspecified time frame. Functional groups remain in existence after achievement of current goals and objectives. Examples of functional groups would be a marketing department, a customer service department, or an accounting department.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to formal groups, informal groups are formed naturally and in response to the common interests and shared values of individuals. They are created for purposes other than the accomplishment of organizational goals and do not have a specified time frame. Informal groups are not appointed by the organization and members can invite others to join from time to time.</p>
                        <p>There are three main things that can affect a team's cohesion (the act of working together well). They are:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Environmental factors.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Personal factors.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Leadership factors.</span></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Intragroup dynamics (within group).</h3>
                        <p>Intragroup dynamics (also referred to as in-group, within-group) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms, roles, relations, and common goals that characterize a particular social group. Examples of groups include religious, political, military, environmental groups, sports teams, work groups and therapy groups. Amongst the members of a group, there is a state of interdependence, through which the behaviors, attitudes, opinions and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members.</p>
                        <p>The dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group. Often, there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group. For each of these groups, there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed. Notably, on this very broad level, the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of culture.</p>

                        <h4>Group formation.</h4>
                        <p>Group formation starts with a psychological bond between individuals. The social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction. In contrast, the social identity approach suggests that a group starts when a collection of individuals perceive that they share some social category (smokers, nurses, Clinicians students, hockey players etc), and that interpersonal attraction only secondarily enhances the connection between individuals.</p>

                        <h4>Identification.</h4>
                        <p>From the social identity approach, group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others. So to say, a level of psychological distinctiveness is necessary for group formation. Through interaction, individuals begin to develop group norms, roles, and attitudes which define the group, and are internalized to influence behavior. Emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation. For example, in response to a natural disaster, an emergent response group may form.</p>

                        <h4>Group membership and social identity.</h4>
                        <p>The social group is a critical source of information about individual identity. An individual's identity (or self-concept) has two components: personal identity and social identity. One's personal identity is defined by individual qualities and attributes. In contrast, one's social identity is defined by his or her group membership, and the general characteristics that define the group and differentiate it from others.</p>

                        <h4>Group cohesion.</h4>
                        <p>Group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected. Terms such as attraction, solidarity, and morale are often used to describe group cohesion.</p>
                        <p>Group cohesion, as a scientifically studied property of groups, is commonly associated with Kurt Lewin and his student, Leon Festinger. Lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together, and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist. Later, this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group, termed attraction to the group.</p>

                        <h4>Black sheep effect.</h4>
                        <p>Beliefs within the in-group are based on how individuals in the group see their other members. Individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members, making them a separate out-group. This is called the black sheep effect. The way a person judges socially desirable and socially undesirable individuals depends upon whether they are part of the in-group or out-group.</p>

                        <h4>Group influence on individual behavior.</h4>
                        <p>Individual behaviour is influenced by the presence of others. For example, studies have found that individuals work harder and faster when others are present and that an individual's performance is reduced when others in the situation create distraction or conflict. Groups also influence individual's decision-making processes. These include decisions related to in-group bias, persuasion, obedience and group think. There are both positive and negative implications of group influence on individual behaviour. This type of influence is often useful in the context of work settings, team sports, and political activism. However, the influence of groups on the individual can also generate extremely negative behaviours, example in mob justice.</p>

                        <h4>Group structure.</h4>
                        <p>A group's structure is the internal framework that defines members' relations to one another over time. Frequently studied elements of group structure include roles, norms, values, communication patterns, and status differentials. Group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles, norms, and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group.</p>

                        <h5>Group roles.</h5>
                        <p>These can be defined as a tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way. Roles may be assigned formally, but more often are defined through the process of role differentiation. Role differentiation is the degree to which different group members have specialized functions. A group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined. A key role in a group is the leader, but there are other important roles as well, including task roles, relationship roles, and individual roles. Functional (task) roles are generally defined in relation to the tasks the team is expected to perform. Individuals engaged in task roles focus on the goals of the group and on enabling the work that members do; examples of task roles include coordinator, recorder, critic, or technician.</p>

                        <h5>Group norms.</h5>
                        <p>These are the informal rules that groups adopt to regulate members' behaviour. Norms refer to what should be done and represent value judgments about appropriate behaviour in social situations. Although they are infrequently written down or even discussed, norms have powerful influence on group behaviour. They are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation, and organize the social interactions of members. Norms are said to be emergent, as they develop gradually throughout interactions between group members. While many norms are widespread throughout society, groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group. There are various types of norms, including: prescriptive, proscriptive, descriptive, and injunctive.</p>

                        <h5>Group values.</h5>
                        <p>These are goals or ideas that serve as guiding principles for the group. Like norms, values may be communicated either explicitly or on an ad hoc basis. Values can serve as a rallying point for the team.</p>

                        <h5>Group communication patterns.</h5>
                        <p>These describe the flow of information within the group and they are typically described as either centralized or decentralized. With a centralized pattern, communications tend to flow from one source to all group members. Centralized communications allow standardization of information, but may restrict the free flow of information. Decentralized communications make it easy to share information directly between group members. When decentralized, communications tend to flow more freely, but the delivery of information may not be as fast or accurate as with centralized communications. Another potential downside of decentralized communications is the sheer volume of information that can be generated, particularly with electronic media.</p>
