                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is a systematic approach to dealing with the transition or transformation of an organization's goals, processes or technologies. The purpose of change management is to implement strategies for effecting change, controlling change and helping people to adapt to change. Such strategies include having a structured procedure for requesting a change, as well as mechanisms for responding to requests and following them up.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Meaning of Change</h3>
                        <p>Change is basically a variation in the common way of doing things. Whenever people perform a task in a certain way, they get accustomed to them. They develop methods which they can implement routinely to achieve these tasks. Any variation in these methods is nothing but change.</p>
                        <p>Changes may be either natural or reactive. Natural changes generally occur routinely in the ordinary course of business. For example, the effects of the growth of an organization lead to changes in management styles.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of Change</h3>
                        <p>Every good manager must be able to anticipate predictable changes. Apart from that, he should also be able to smoothly incorporate these changes into the organization. This is basically the entire aim of change management.</p>
                        <p>Change is always inevitable; one can never completely prevent it. Managers can either wait for changes to occur or they can anticipate them and act in advance. A good manager will always do the latter.</p>
                        <p>This process generally requires a thorough understanding of factors that affect changes. This is because external and internal factors are solely responsible for effecting changes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of Change</h3>
                        <p>Changes affecting an organization are basically the result of its environment. Both, external as well as internal factors play a huge role here. Hence, managers need to understand all types of changes possible under these two classifications.</p>

                        <h4>External factors</h4>
                        <p>These factors always lie outside an organization. Neither the organization itself nor its members are responsible for them. However, they always feel the effect of these factors. Some of these factors include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Economic factors: Access to resources, market demand, competition, inflation, interest rates, etc.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Technology: The growth of technology always forces an organization to adapt. For example, the discovery of new production methods.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Politics: Policies of a government change routinely. Even the government itself changes every term. These factors play a large role in the external environment.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Other factors: Factors like urbanization, education, cultural changes, change in social mindset, etc. also affect every business organization.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Internal factors</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes changes can also occur internally. An organization and its own members are responsible for these changes. For example, the top management of a company might decide to diversify its business. This decision will lead to several changes in which the company functions. Similarly, other internal factors include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Changes in personnel due to hiring, termination of employment, retirement, promotion, etc.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Change of functional policy decisions like holidays, work hours, paid leaves, etc.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Changes affecting physical facilities like usage of alternative raw materials or adaptation to new machinery.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reasons why people resist change:</h3>

                        <h4>(1) Loss of status or job security in the organization</h4>
                        <p>It is not our nature to make changes that we view as harmful to our current situation. In an organizational setting, this means employees, peers, and managers will resist administrative and technological changes that result in their role being eliminated or reduced. From their perspective, your change is harmful to their place in the organization!</p>
                        <p>Forcing a change on others has its place. Over time, however, when this is the only approach that you use to make change, you'll find that your change results suffer. If you overuse this approach, you will harm your effectiveness over the long term as others will find direct and indirect ways to resist you. Without a thoughtful change strategy to address resistance to change, you will trigger strong resistance and organizational turnover.</p>

                        <h4>(2) Poorly aligned (non-reinforcing) reward systems</h4>
                        <p>Confused ManagerThere is a common business saying that managers get what they reward. Organizational stakeholders will resist change when they do not see any rewards.</p>
                        <p>When working with managers, I will ask them, Where is the reward to employees for implementing your change?</p>
                        <p>Without a reward, there is no motivation for your team to support your change over the long term. This often means that organizational reward systems must be altered in some way to support the change that you want to implement. The change does not have to always be major or costly. Intrinsic rewards are very powerful motivators in the workplace that are non-monetary.</p>

                        <h4>(3) Surprise and fear of the unknown</h4>
                        <p>The less your team members know about the change and its impact on them, the more fearful they will become. Leading change also requires not springing surprises on the organization! Your organization needs to be prepared for the change.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of continuing two-way communication with you, grapevine rumors fill the void and sabotage the change effort. In fact, ongoing communication is one of your most critical tools for handling resistance to change. But, it's not just telling! The neglected part of two-way communication - listening - is just as powerful.</p>

                        <h4>(4) Peer pressure.</h4>
                        <p>Whether we are introverted or extroverted, we are still social creatures. Organizational stakeholders will resist change to protect the interests of a group.</p>
                        <p>You might see this among some of your team members who feel compelled to resist your change to protect their co-workers. If you're a senior executive or middle manager, your managers who report to you may will resist your change effort to protect their work groups.</p>
                        <p>As the psychologist Abraham Maslow discussed, the need to belong to a group is a powerful need in the workplace. If your change effort threatens these workplace social bonds, some of your team members may resist your change effort.</p>

                        <h4>(5) Climate of mistrust</h4>
                        <p>Skeptical Suspicious Doubting WomanMeaningful organizational change does not occur in a climate of mistrust. Trust, involves faith in the intentions and behavior of others. Mutual mistrust will doom an otherwise well-conceived change initiative to failure.</p>
                        <p>If you are trying to implement your change effort in an environment where most of the people working with you mistrust each other, you'll have limited success. You'll need to spend some time rebuilding trust if you want better results from your change effort.</p>
                        <p>Trust is a fragile asset that is easily harmed.</p>
                        <p>It's hard to get employees to support the changes that leadership wants to make when all that the employees see for themselves are negative consequences.</p>

                        <h4>(6) Organizational politics</h4>
                        <p>Some resist change as a political strategy to "prove" that the decision is wrong. They may also resist to show that the person leading the change is not up to the task. Others may resist because they will lose some power in the organizational. In these instances, these individuals are committed to seeing the change effort fail.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes when I work with managers they become frustrated with the political resistance that they encounter from others. Political obstacles are frustrating when you are trying to implement needed change.</p>

                        <h4>(7) Fear of failure</h4>
                        <p>Sweeping changes on the job can cause your team members to doubt their capabilities to perform their duties. What is known is comfortable! Your team members may be resisting these changes because they are worried that they cannot adapt to new work requirements.</p>
                        <p>Fear is a powerful motivator that can harden people's intent to resist your efforts to implement change. If you want your change effort to be successful, you'll need to help your team members move beyond these fears.</p>

                        <h4>(8) Faulty Implementation Approach (Lack of tact or poor timing)</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes it is not what a leader does, but it is how s/he does it that creates resistance to change! Undue resistance can occur because changes are introduced in an insensitive manner or at an awkward time.</p>
                        <p>In other words, people may agree with the change that you want to implement but they may not agree with how you are going about making the change.</p>
                        <p>For any significant organizational change effort to be effective, you'll need a thoughtful strategy and a thoughtful implementation approach to address these barriers.</p>
                        <p>So, the next time you hear someone say that people naturally resist change explain to them that this is a myth. We change all of the time.</p>
