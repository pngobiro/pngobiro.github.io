b. Departments within a health facility are running smoothly
c. Right people are in the right jobs,
d. People know what is expected of them
e. Resources are used efficiently
f. All departments are working towards a common goal for mutual development and growth.

\section*{CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION TO LEADERSHIPAND MANAGEMENT.}

Leadership- Leadership is the ability to influence, inspire and help others become their best selves, building their skills and achieving goals along the way. Leadership is also how you, as an individual, choose to lead your life.

Management.Management is the process of getting activities completed efficiently and effectively with and through other people.

It is also referred to as the art of making things happen with the help of resources.
Management is required for an established life and is essential for managing all types of organisations. Managing life implies getting everything done to accomplish the aspirations of life and maintaining an establishment.

This means getting things done with and by other people to fulfill its objectives.

\section*{Levels Of Management}

There are 3 levels of management in the ranking order of an establishment and these are:
1. Top-level management
2. Middle-level management
3. Lower-level management

\section*{Top Level Management}

They comprise of the senior-most executives of the organization. They are normally regarded as the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the Chief Operating Officer (COO). Top management is a team consisting of managers from various operational levels.

These top-level managers are accountable for the progress and continuation of the organization. They investigate the trading atmosphere and its connections for the survival of the health facility. They form the overall organisational aims and approaches for their accomplishment. They are held responsible for all the pursuits of the organization and for its influence on the society.

\section*{Middle Level Management}

It is the connection between top and lower-level managers. They are lower to the top managers and above to the first line managers. They are normally called as division heads, for instance. Middle management is accountable for executing and regulating systems generated by the top management.

At the same time, they are liable for all the actions of the first-line managers. Their principal task is to bring out the plans formed by the top managers. For this purpose, they have to:
- Understand the procedures outlined by the top management
- Guarantee that their staff has the required workers
- Designate certain tasks and duties to them, and drive them to accomplish the aspired objectives.
- Interact with other departments for the stable operation of the company. At the same time, they are subject to all the actions of the first-line managers.

\section*{Lower-Level Management.}

Managers and supervisors make up the lower level of the management in the hierarchy of the any organization. Supervisors immediately manage the efforts of the workforce. Their power and ability are defined according to the maps drawn by the top management.

\section*{THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP}

\section*{1. Contingency Theory}

This theory proposes that no one way or style of leadership may be applicable to all situations. In other words, it recognizes that there might be variables influencing any particular situation, and a leader must choose the right course of action, taking into account those variables.

In this regard, leadership researchers White and Hodgson state, "Effective leadership is about striking the right balance between needs, context, and behavior." The best leaders have not only the right traits but also the ability to assess the needs of their followers, analyze the situation at hand, and act accordingly.

\section*{2. Situational Leadership Theory}

Like the Contingency Theory, the Situational Theory stresses the importance of situational variables and doesn't consider anyone's leadership style to be better than the others.

Put forward by US professor, Paul Hersey and leadership guru, Ken Blanchard, the situational theory is a combination of two factors; the leadership style and the maturity levels of the followers. According to this theory, different situations demand different styles of leadership and decision-making. Leaders must act by judging the situation they are facing.

\section*{3. Transformational Leadership Theory}

The Transformational Leadership theory, also known as Relationship theories, focuses on the relationship between the leaders and followers. This theory talks about the kind of leader who is inspirational and charismatic, encouraging their followers to transform and become better at a task.

Transformational leaders typically motivated by their ability to show their followers the significance of the task and the higher good involved in performing it. These leaders are not only focused on the team's performance but also give individual team members the required push to reach his or her potential. These leadership theories will help you to sharp your Skill.

\section*{4. Transactional Theories}

Transactional Theories, also referred to as Management theories or exchange leadership theories, revolve around the role of supervision, organization, and teamwork. These leadership theories consider rewards and punishments as the basis for leadership actions. This is one of the oft-used theories in business, and the proponents of this leadership style use rewards and punishments to motivate employees.

\section*{5. Behavioral Theory}

In the Behavioral Theory, the emphasis shifts from the traits or qualities of leaders to their behaviors and actions. In sharp contrast to the Great Man Theory and the trait approach to leadership, this theory considers effective leadership to be the result of many learned or acquired skills. It proposes that an individual can learn to become a good leader. This is one of the best leadership theories.

\section*{6. Great Man Theory of Leadership}

This is one of the earliest leadership theories and is based on the assumption that leadership is an inborn phenomenon and that leaders are "born" rather than "made." According to this theory, a person capable of leading has the personality traits of a leader; charm, confidence, intellect, communication skills, and social aptitude; from birth, which set them apart. This theory emphasizes leadership as a quality that you either possess or you don't; it isn't something that you can learn.

While the theory sounds pretty discouraging to those wanting to learn the ropes of leadership, you might take heart in the fact that most modern theorists dismiss it and even by some leaders themselves. It's still an interesting take on leadership and one that highlights the qualities of great leaders, which have more or less remained unchanged over time.

\section*{7. Trait Theory of Leadership}

This theory walks in the footsteps of the Great Man theory in assuming that leaders are born with traits that make them more suitable for the role of a leader than others who lack those naturalborn traits.

As such, the theory pinpoints certain qualities such as intelligence, accountability, sense of responsibility, and creativity, among others, that lets an individual excel at leadership.

\section*{Management functions:}
- Planning is the purpose of ascertaining in advance what is supposed to be done and who has to do it. This signifies establishing goals in advance and promoting a way of delivering them effectively and efficiently.
- Organising is the administrative operation of specifying grouping tasks, duties, authorising power and designating resources needed to carry out a particular system. Once a definite plan has been set for the completion of an organisational intent, the organising party reviews the actions and resources expected to execute the program. It ascertains what actions and resources are needed. It determines who will do a distinct job, where and when it will be done.
- Staffing is obtaining the best resources for the right job. A significant perspective of management is to make certain that the appropriate people with the apt skills are obtainable in the proper places and times to achieve the goals of the company. This is also called the human resource operations and it includes activities such as selection, placement, recruitment and coaching of employees.
- Directing involves, leading and encouraging the employees to complete the tasks allocated to them. This entails building an environment that inspires employees to do their best. Motivation and leadership are two chief elements of direction.

Directing also includes communicating efficiently as well as managing employees at the workplace. Motivating workers means simply building an atmosphere that urges them to want to work. Leadership is inspiring others to do what the manager wants them to do.
- Controlling is the process of assessing the organization's progress towards accomplishments of organizational goals and objectives. The job of controlling comprises ascertaining criteria of performance, computing the current performance, comparing this with organised rules and taking remedial action where any divergence is observed. Here management should ascertain what activities and outputs are important to progress, how and where they can be regulated and who should have the power to take remedial response.

\section*{LEADERSHIP STYLES}

Throughout history, great leaders have emerged with particular leadership styles in providing direction, implementing plans and motivating people. These can be broadly grouped into 5 different categories:
- Authoritarian Leadership
- Democratic Leadership
- Laissez-faire leadership
- Transactional Leadership
- Transformational Leadership

Health systems management

Despite these definitions, questions still remain.
- What is the meaning of each leadership style mentioned above?
- What is the difference between the different leadership approaches?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using each of the leadership styles?

\section*{1. Authoritarian Leadership}

Authoritarian leadership styles allow a leader to impose expectations and define outcomes.
A one-person show can turn out to be successful in situations when a leader is the most knowledgeable in the team. Although this is an efficient strategy in time-constrained periods, creativity will be sacrificed since input from the team is limited.

The authoritarian leadership style is also used when team members need clear guidelines.
An authoritarian leader behaves in a commanding and strongly controlling manner.

\section*{Advantages:}
- Time spent on making crucial decisions can be reduced.
- Chain of command can be clearly emphasized.
- Mistakes in the implementation of plans can be reduced.
- Using authoritarian leadership style creates consistent results.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- A very strict leadership style can sometimes lead to employee rebellion.
- It kills employee creativity and innovation.
- It reduces group synergy \& collaboration.
- Group input is reduced dramatically.
- Authoritarian leadership increases employee turnover rate.

\section*{2. Democratic Leadership}
- In this leadership style, subordinates are involved in making decisions. Unlike the autocratic style, this leadership is centered on subordinates' contributions. The democratic leader holds final responsibility, but he or she is known to delegate authority to other people, who determine work projects.
- The most unique feature of this leadership is that communication is active upward and downward. With respect to statistics, democratic leadership is one of the most preferred styles of leadership, and it entails the following: fairness, competence, creativity, courage, intelligence and honesty.

\section*{Advantages:}
- It increases employee motivation and job satisfaction.
- It encourages use of employee creativity.
- A participative leadership style helps in the creation of a strong team.
- High level of productivity can be achieved.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Decision-making processes become time-consuming.
- Leaders have a high probability of being apologetic to employees.
- Communication failures can sometimes happen.
- Security issues can arise because of transparency in information sharing.
- Poor decisions can be made if the employees are unskilled.

\section*{3.Laissez-faire leadership}

It is also known as, a delegative leadership style, it focuses on delegating initiative to team members. This can be a successful strategy if team members are competent, take responsibility and prefer engaging in individual work. However, disagreements among the members may split and divide a group, leading to poor motivation and low morale.

\section*{Advantages:}
- Experienced employees can take advantage of their competence and experience.
- Innovation \& creativity is highly valued.
- Delegative leadership creates a positive work environment.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Command responsibility is not properly defined.
- Delegative leadership creates difficulty in adapting to change.

\section*{4. Transactional leadership}

Transactional leadership styles use "transactions" between a leader and his or her followers rewards, punishments and other exchanges - to get the job done. The leader sets clear goals, and team members know how they'll be rewarded for their compliance. This "give and take" leadership style is more concerned with following established routines and procedures in an efficient manner, than with making any transformational changes to an organization.

Advantages:
- Leaders create specific, measurable and time-bound goals that are achievable for employees.
- Employee motivation and productivity is increased.
- Transactional leadership eliminates or minimizes confusion in the chain of command.
- It creates a system that is easy to implement for leaders and easy to follow by employees.
- Employees can choose reward systems.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Innovation \& creativity is minimized.
- Empathy is not valued.
- Transactional leadership creates more followers than leaders among employees.

\section*{5. Transformational Leadership}

In transformational leadership styles, the leader inspires his or her followers with a vision and then encourages and empowers them to achieve it. The leader also serves as a role model for the vision.

\section*{Advantages:}
- It leads to a lower employee turnover rate.
- Transformational leadership places high value on corporate vision.
- High morale of employees is often experienced.
- It uses motivation and inspiration to gain the support of employees.
- It is not a coercive approach to leadership.
- It places high value on relationships.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Leaders can deceive employees.
- Consistent motivation and constant feedback may be required.
- Tasks can't be pushed through without the agreement of employees.
- Transformational leadership can sometimes lead to the deviation of protocols and regulations.

\section*{The major difference between leadership and management are;}
a. Leadership, is a virtue of leading people through encouraging them. Management is a process of managing the activities of the organization.
b. Leadership requires trust of followers on his leader. Unlike Management, which needs control of manager over its subordinates.
c. LeadershipisaskillofinfluencingotherswhileManagementisthequalityoftheruling.
d. Leadership demands foresightedness of leader, but Management has a short-range vision.
e. In leadership, principles and guidelines are established, whereas, in the case of management, policies and procedures are implemented.
f. Leadership is Proactive. Conversely, management is reactive in nature.
g. Leadership brings change. On the other hand, Management brings stability.

\section*{MANAGEMENT THEORIES.}

\section*{Theory $X$ and theory $Y$.}

Theory X and theory Y are theories of human motivation. They describe two very different attitudes towards workforce motivation. McGregor thought that the key to connecting selfactualization with work is determined by the managerial trust of subordinates.

\section*{Theory $X$.}

In this theory which has been proved counter-effective in most modern practice, management assumes employees are inherently lazy and will avoid work if they can and they inherently dislike work. As a result of this, management beliefs that workers need to be closely supervised and comprehensive systems of controls developed.

Hierarchy - A hierarchical structure is needed with narrow span of control at each and every level. According to this theory, employees will show little ambition without incentive and will avoid responsibility.

If the organizational goals are to be met, theory X managers rely heavily on threats and coercion to gain their employees compliance (according to Michael J. Papa). Beliefs of this theory lead to mistrust, highly restrictive supervision, punitive atmosphere etc. Theory X manager tends to believe that everything must end in blaming someone (suspicious always). They will blame the person first without questioning whether it may be the system, policy, or lack of training that deserves the blame. Theory X manager believes that his or her employees do not really want to work but they are out for themselves and that their interest in the job is only money.

\section*{Theory Y.}

In this theory, management assumes employees may be ambitious and self-motivated and exercise self-control. It is believed that employees enjoy their mental and physical work duties and to them, work is as natural as play. They possess the ability for creative problem solving, but their talents are underused in most organizations.

Self-control- Given the proper conditions, theory Y managers believe that employees will learn to seek out and accept responsibility and to exercise self-control and self-direction in accomplishing objectives to which they are committed. Theory Y managers believe that given the right condition, most people will want to do well at work. They believe that the satisfaction of doing a good job is a strong motivation. Many people interpret theory Y as a positive set of beliefs about workers.

McGregor thinks that theory Y managers are more likely than theory X managers to develop the climate of trust with employees that is required for human resource development, which is a crucial aspect of any organization. This would include managers communicating openly with subordinates, minimizing difference between superior subordinate relationships, creating a comfortable environment, subordinates develop and use their abilities, sharing of decision making and employer is under less pressure than in theory X .

\section*{ORGANIZATIONAL BEAHAVIOUR.}

Organizational Behavior ( OB ) is the study and application of knowledge about how people, individuals, and groups act in organizations. It does this by taking a system approach, meaning it interprets people-organization relationships in terms of the whole person, whole group, whole organization, and whole social system. Its purpose is to build better relationships by achieving human objectives, organizational objectives, and social objectives.

\section*{Elements of organizational behaviour.}
1. The organization's base rests on management's philosophy, values, vision and goals.
2. Organizational behaviour drives its culture which is composed of the formal organization, informal organization and the social environment.
3. The Organizational Behaviour culture determines the type of leadership, communication and group dynamics within the organization.
4. The workers perceive this as the quality of work life which directs their degree of motivation.
5. The final outcome is performance, individual satisfaction, and personal growth and development.
6. To build the model or framework that the organization operates from.

\section*{Models of organizational behaviour.}

There are four major models or frameworks that organizations operate out of.

\section*{Model 1: Autocratic.}

Basis - The basis of this model is power with a managerial orientation of authority. The employees in turn are oriented towards obedience and dependence on the boss.

Employee needs- The employee need, that is met is subsistence.
Performance Result - The performance result is minimal.

\section*{Model 2: Custodial.}

Basis - The basis of this model is economic resources with a managerial orientation of money. The employees in turn are oriented towards security and benefits and dependence on the organization.

Employee needs - The employee need, that is met is security.

Performance result- The performance result is passive cooperation.

\section*{Model 3: Supportive.}

Basis - The basis of this model is leadership with a managerial orientation of support. The employees in turn are oriented towards job performance and participation.

Employee needs- The employee need that is met is status and recognition.
Performance result - The performance result is awakened drives.

\section*{Model 4: Collegial.}

Basis- The basis of this model is partnership with a managerial orientation of teamwork. The employees in turn are oriented towards responsible behavior and self-discipline.

Employee needs - The employee need that is met is self-actualization.

Performance result- The performance result is moderate enthusiasm.

\section*{GROUP DYNAMICS.}

Group dynamics is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group (intragroup dynamics), or between social groups (intergroup dynamics). The study of group dynamics can be useful in understanding decision-making behavior, tracking the spread of diseases in society, creating effective therapy techniques, and following the emergence and popularity of new ideas and technologies.

\section*{Process/Stages of Group Development/Evolution:}

Group Development is a dynamic process. How do groups evolve? There is a process of five stages through which groups pass through. The process includes the five stages: forming, storming, forming, performing, and adjourning.

\section*{Forming:}

The first stage in the life of a group is concerned with forming a group. This stage is characterized by members seeking either a work assignment (in a formal group) or other benefit, like status, affiliation, power, etc. (in an informal group). Members at this stage either engage in busy type of activity or show apathy.

\section*{Storming:}

The next stage in this group is marked by the formation of dyads and triads. Members seek out familiar or similar individuals and begin a deeper sharing of self. Continued attention to the subgroup creates a differentiation in the group and tensions across the dyads / triads may appear. Pairing is a common phenomenon. There will be conflict about controlling the group.

\section*{Norming:}

The third stage of group development is marked by a more serious concern about task performance. The dyads/triads begin to open up and seek out other members in the group. Efforts are made to establish various norms for task performance.

Members begin to take greater responsibility for their own group and relationship while the authority figure becomes relaxed. Once this stage is complete, a clear picture will emerge about hierarchy of leadership. The norming stage is over with the solidification of the group structure and a sense of group identity and camaraderie.

\section*{Performing:}

This is a stage of a fully functional group where members see themselves as a group and get involved in the task. Each person makes a contribution and the authority figure is also seen as a part of the group. Group norms are followed and collective pressure is exerted to ensure the Process of Group effectiveness of the group.

The group may redefine its goals Development in the light of information from the outside environment and show an autonomous will to pursue those goals. The long-term viability of the group is established and nurtured.

\section*{Adjourning:}

In the case of temporary groups, like project team, task force, or any other such group, which have a limited task at hand, also have a fifth stage, This is known as adjourning.

The group decides to disband. Some members may feel happy over the performance, and some may be unhappy over the stoppage of meeting with group members. Adjourning may also be referred to as mourning, i.e. mourning the adjournment of the group.

\section*{Types of Groups:}

One way to classify the groups is by way of formality - formal and informal. While formal groups are established by an organization to achieve its goals, informal groups merge spontaneously. Formal groups may take the form of command groups, task groups, and functional groups.

\section*{1. Command Groups:}

Command groups are specified by the organizational chart and often consist of a supervisor and the subordinates that report to that supervisor. An example of a command group is a market research firm CEO and the research associates under him.

\section*{2. Task Groups:}

Task groups consist of people who work together to achieve a common task. Members are brought together to accomplish a narrow range of goals within a specified time period. Task groups are also commonly referred to as task forces. The organization appoints members and assigns the goals and tasks to be accomplished.

Examples of assigned tasks are the development of a new product, the improvement of a production process, or designing the syllabus under semester system.

Other common task groups are ad hoc committees, project groups, and standing committees. Ad hoc committees are temporary groups created to resolve a specific complaint or develop a process are normally disbanded after the group completes the assigned task.

\section*{3. Functional Groups:}

A functional group is created by the organization to accomplish specific goals within an unspecified time frame. Functional groups remain in existence after achievement of current
goals and objectives. Examples of functional groups would be a marketing department, a customer service department, or an accounting department.

In contrast to formal groups, informal groups are formed naturally and in response to the common interests and shared values of individuals. They are created for purposes other than the accomplishment of organizational goals and do not have a specified time frame. Informal groups are not appointed by the organization and members can invite others to join from time to time.

There are three main things that can affect a team's cohesion (the act of working together well). They are:
1. Environmental factors.
2. Personal factors.
3. Leadership factors.

\section*{Intragroup dynamics (within group).}

Intragroup dynamics (also referred to as in-group, within-group) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms, roles, relations, and common goals that characterize a particular social group. Examples of groups include religious, political, military, environmental groups, sports teams, work groups and therapy groups. Amongst the members of a group, there is a state of interdependence, through which the behaviors, attitudes, opinions and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members.

The dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group. Often, there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group. For each of these groups, there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed. Notably, on this very broad level, the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of culture.

\section*{Group formation.}

Group formation starts with a psychological bond between individuals. The social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction. In
contrast, the social identity approach suggests that a group starts when a collection of individuals perceive that they share some social category (smokers, nurses, Clinicians students, hockey players etc), and that interpersonal attraction only secondarily enhances the connection between individuals.

\section*{Identification.}

From the social identity approach, group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others. So to say, a level of psychological distinctiveness is necessary for group formation. Through interaction, individuals begin to develop group norms, roles, and attitudes which define the group, and are internalized to influence behavior. Emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation. For example, in response to a natural disaster, an emergent response group may form.

\section*{Group membership and social identity.}

The social group is a critical source of information about individual identity. An individual's identity (or self-concept) has two components: personal identity and social identity. One's personal identity is defined by individual qualities and attributes. In contrast, one's social identity is defined by his or her group membership, and the general characteristics that define the group and differentiate it from others.

\section*{Group cohesion.}

Group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected. Terms such as attraction, solidarity, and morale are often used to describe group cohesion.

Group cohesion, as a scientifically studied property of groups, is commonly associated with Kurt Lewin and his student, Leon Festinger. Lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together, and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist. Later, this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group, termed attraction to the group.

\section*{Black sheep effect.}

Beliefs within the in-group are based on how individuals in the group see their other members. Individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members, making them a separate out-group. This is called the black sheep effect. The way a person judges socially desirable and socially undesirable individuals depends upon whether they are part of the in-group or out-group.

\section*{Group influence on individual behavior.}

Individual behaviour is influenced by the presence of others. For example, studies have found that individuals work harder and faster when others are present and that an individual's performance is reduced when others in the situation create distraction or conflict. Groups also influence individual's decision-making processes. These include decisions related to in-group bias, persuasion, obedience and group think. There are both positive and negative implications of group influence on individual behaviour. This type of influence is often useful in the context of work settings, team sports, and political activism. However, the influence of groups on the individual can also generate extremely negative behaviours, example in mob justice.

\section*{Group structure.}

A group's structure is the internal framework that defines members' relations to one another over time. Frequently studied elements of group structure include roles, norms, values, communication patterns, and status differentials. Group structure has also been defined as the underlying pattern of roles, norms, and networks of relations among members that define and organize the group.

\section*{Group roles.}

These can be defined as a tendency to behave, contribute and interrelate with others in a particular way. Roles may be assigned formally, but more often are defined through the process of role differentiation. Role differentiation is the degree to which different group members have specialized functions. A group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined. A key role in a group is the leader, but there are other important roles as well, including task roles, relationship roles, and individual roles. Functional (task) roles are generally defined in relation to the tasks the team is expected to perform. Individuals engaged in task roles focus on the goals of the group and on enabling the work that members do; examples of task roles include coordinator, recorder, critic, or technician.

\section*{Group norms.}

These are the informal rules that groups adopt to regulate members' behaviour. Norms refer to what should be done and represent value judgments about appropriate behaviour in social situations. Although they are infrequently written down or even discussed, norms have powerful influence on group behaviour. They are a fundamental aspect of group structure as they provide direction and motivation, and organize the social interactions of members. Norms are said to be emergent, as they develop gradually throughout interactions between group members. While many norms are widespread throughout society, groups may develop their own norms that members must learn when they join the group. There are various types of norms, including: prescriptive, proscriptive, descriptive, and injunctive.
- Prescriptive Norms: the socially appropriate way to respond in a social situation, or what group members are supposed to do (e.g. saying thank you after someone does a favour for you).
- Proscriptive Norms: actions that group members should not do; prohibitive (e.g. not belching in public).
- Descriptive Norms: describe what people usually do (e.g. clapping after a speech).
- Injunctive Norms: describe behaviours that people ought to do; more evaluative in nature than a descriptive norm.

\section*{Group values.}

These are goals or ideas that serve as guiding principles for the group. Like norms, values may be communicated either explicitly or on an ad hoc basis. Values can serve as a rallying point for the team.

\section*{Group communication patterns.}

These describe the flow of information within the group and they are typically described as either centralized or decentralized. With a centralized pattern, communications tend to flow from one source to all group members. Centralized communications allow standardization of information, but may restrict the free flow of information. Decentralized communications make it easy to share information directly between group members. When decentralized, communications tend to flow more freely, but the delivery of information may not be as fast or accurate as with centralized communications. Another potential downside of decentralized communications is the sheer volume of information that can be generated, particularly with electronic media.

\section*{Intergroup dynamics.}

Intergroup dynamics refers to the behavioural and psychological relationship between two or more groups. This includes perceptions, attitudes, opinions, and behaviours towards one's own group, as well as those towards another group. In some cases, intergroup dynamics is pro-social, positive, and beneficial (for example, when multiple research teams work together to accomplish a task or goal). In other cases, intergroup dynamics can create conflict.

\section*{Intergroup conflict.}

According to social identity theory, intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group (the in-group) to those of another group (the out-group).

This comparison process is not unbiased and objective. Instead, it is a mechanism for enhancing one's self-esteem. In the process of such comparisons, an individual tends to:
- Favour the in-group over the out-group.
- Exaggerate and overgeneralize the differences between the in-group and the out-group (to enhance group distinctiveness).
- Minimize the perception of differences between in-group members.
- Remember more detailed and positive information about the in-group, and more negative information about the out- group .

\section*{MISSION.}

A mission statement focuses on today and what an organization does to achieve it. Both are vital in directing goals.

Your mission statement drives the company. It is what you do/the core of the business, and from it come the objectives and finally, what it takes to reach those objectives. It also shapes your company's culture.

A mission statement is a short statement of an organization's -
- Purpose,
- Identifying the scope of its operations,
- What kind of product or service it provides,
- Its primary customers or market,
- Its geographical region of operation.
- It includes a short statement of fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies.

A mission is not simply a description of an organization by an external party, but an expression, made by its leaders, of their desires and intent for the organization.
(KMTC MISSION - "To produce competent health professionals through training and research and provide consultancy services").

\section*{Purpose.}

The purpose of a mission statement is -
- To focus and direct the organization itself.
- Communicates primarily to the people who make up the organization, its members or employees.
- Gives members a shared understanding of the organization's intended direction.

Organizations normally do not change their mission statements over time, since they define their continuous, ongoing purpose and focus.

\section*{VISION.}

A vision statement focuses on tomorrow and what an organization wants to ultimately become. Your vision statement gives the company direction. It is the future of the business, which then provides the purpose.

The vision statement is about what you want to become. It's aspirational.
Vision is an idea or the big picture towards which one aspires. It is something imaginary, a creation of fancy. It is also an aspirational description of what an organization would like to achieve or accomplish in the mid-term or long-term future. It is intended to serves as a clear guide for choosing current and future courses of action.

\section*{Purpose of vision.}

Purpose of Vision is to;
- Help in setting direction.
- Establishing priorities.
- Clarifying goals.
- Serve as foundations for a broader strategic plan.
- Motivate existing employees and attract potential like-minded individuals.
- Focus organizations efforts and facilitate the creation of core competencies.
- Help organizations differentiate from competitors.
(KMTC VISION - "A model institution in the training and development of competent health professionals").

\section*{MOTTO.}

A motto is a phrase meant to formally summarize the general motivation or intention of an individual, family, social group or organization. Mottos are usually not expressed verbally, unlike slogans, but are expressed in writing and usually stem from long traditions of social foundations, or also from significant events, such as a civil war or a revolution.
(KMTC MOTTO - "Training for better health").

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS.}
1. A mission and vision are standard and critical elements of a company's or individuals organizational strategy.
2. Mission and vision statements serve as foundational guides in the establishment of organizations objectives.
3. The organizations develop strategic and tactical plans from their mission and vision statements.
4. Mission and vision statements serve as a guide for all of the organization's decisionmaking.
5. Mission and vision should help workers within the organization know what decisions and tasks best align with the organization.
6. A mission and vision statement offers insight into what company leaders view as the primary purpose for being in business.
7. Some organizations have profit-motivated mission and visions, while others make customers a focal point. Other firms use mission and vision to point out more altruistic intentions that ultimately lead to profits.

\section*{CHANGE MANAGEMENT}

It is a systematic approach to dealing with the transition or transformation of an organization's goals, processes or technologies. The purpose of change management is to implement strategies for effecting change, controlling change and helping people to adapt to change. Such strategies include having a structured procedure for requesting a change, as well as mechanisms for responding to requests and following them up.

\section*{Meaning of Change}

Change is basically a variation in the common way of doing things. Whenever people perform a task in a certain way, they get accustomed to them. They develop methods which they can implement routinely to achieve these tasks. Any variation in these methods is nothing but change.

Changes may be either natural or reactive. Natural changes generally occur routinely in the ordinary course of business. For example, the effects of the growth of an organization lead to changes in management styles.

\section*{Management of Change}

Every good manager must be able to anticipate predictable changes. Apart from that, he should also be able to smoothly incorporate these changes into the organization. This is basically the entire aim of change management.

Change is always inevitable; one can never completely prevent it. Managers can either wait for changes to occur or they can anticipate them and act in advance. A good manager will always do the latter.

This process generally requires a thorough understanding of factors that affect changes. This is because external and internal factors are solely responsible for effecting changes.

\section*{Causes of Change}

Changes affecting an organization are basically the result of its environment. Both, external as well as internal factors play a huge role here. Hence, managers need to understand all types of changes possible under these two classifications.

\section*{External factors}

These factors always lie outside an organization. Neither the organization itself nor its members are responsible for them. However, they always feel the effect of these factors. Some of these factors include:
- Economic factors: Access to resources, market demand, competition, inflation, interest rates, etc.
- Technology: The growth of technology always forces an organization to adapt. For example, the discovery of new production methods.
- Politics: Policies of a government change routinely. Even the government itself changes every term. These factors play a large role in the external environment.
- Other factors: Factors like urbanization, education, cultural changes, change in social mindset, etc. also affect every business organization.

\section*{Internal factors}

Sometimes changes can also occur internally. An organization and its own members are responsible for these changes. For example, the top management of a company might decide to diversify its business. This decision will lead to several changes in which the company functions. Similarly, other internal factors include:
- Changes in personnel due to hiring, termination of employment, retirement, promotion, etc.
- Change of functional policy decisions like holidays, work hours, paid leaves, etc.
- Changes affecting physical facilities like usage of alternative raw materials or adaptation to new machinery.

\section*{Reasons why people resist change:}

\section*{(1) Loss of status or job security in the organization}

It is not our nature to make changes that we view as harmful to our current situation. In an organizational setting, this means employees, peers, and managers will resist administrative and technological changes that result in their role being eliminated or reduced. From their perspective, your change is harmful to their place in the organization!

Forcing a change on others has its place. Over time, however, when this is the only approach that you use to make change, you'll find that your change results suffer. If you overuse this approach, you will harm your effectiveness over the long term as others will find direct and indirect ways to resist you. Without a thoughtful change strategy to address resistance to change, you will trigger strong resistance and organizational turnover.

\section*{(2) Poorly aligned (non-reinforcing) reward systems}

Confused ManagerThere is a common business saying that managers get what they reward. Organizational stakeholders will resist change when they do not see any rewards.

When working with managers, I will ask them, Where is the reward to employees for implementing your change?

Without a reward, there is no motivation for your team to support your change over the long term. This often means that organizational reward systems must be altered in some way to support the change that you want to implement. The change does not have to always be major or costly. Intrinsic rewards are very powerful motivators in the workplace that are non-monetary.

\section*{(3) Surprise and fear of the unknown}

The less your team members know about the change and its impact on them, the more fearful they will become. Leading change also requires not springing surprises on the organization! Your organization needs to be prepared for the change.

In the absence of continuing two-way communication with you, grapevine rumors fill the void and sabotage the change effort. In fact, ongoing communication is one of your most critical tools for handling resistance to change. But, it's not just telling! The neglected part of two-way communication - listening - is just as powerful.

\section*{(4) Peer pressure.}

Whether we are introverted or extroverted, we are still social creatures. Organizational stakeholders will resist change to protect the interests of a group.

You might see this among some of your team members who feel compelled to resist your change to protect their co-workers. If you're a senior executive or middle manager, your managers who report to you may will resist your change effort to protect their work groups.

As the psychologist Abraham Maslow discussed, the need to belong to a group is a powerful need in the workplace. If your change effort threatens these workplace social bonds, some of your team members may resist your change effort.

\section*{(5) Climate of mistrust}

Skeptical Suspicious Doubting WomanMeaningful organizational change does not occur in a climate of mistrust. Trust, involves faith in the intentions and behavior of others. Mutual mistrust will doom an otherwise well-conceived change initiative to failure.

If you are trying to implement your change effort in an environment where most of the people working with you mistrust each other, you'll have limited success. You'll need to spend some time rebuilding trust if you want better results from your change effort.

Trust is a fragile asset that is easily harmed.
It's hard to get employees to support the changes that leadership wants to make when all that the employees see for themselves are negative consequences.

\section*{(6) Organizational politics}

Some resist change as a political strategy to "prove" that the decision is wrong. They may also resist to show that the person leading the change is not up to the task. Others may resist because they will lose some power in the organizational. In these instances, these individuals are committed to seeing the change effort fail.

Sometimes when I work with managers they become frustrated with the political resistance that they encounter from others. Political obstacles are frustrating when you are trying to implement needed change.

\section*{(7) Fear of failure}

Sweeping changes on the job can cause your team members to doubt their capabilities to perform their duties. What is known is comfortable! Your team members may be resisting these changes because they are worried that they cannot adapt to new work requirements.

Fear is a powerful motivator that can harden people's intent to resist your efforts to implement change. If you want your change effort to be successful, you'll need to help your team members move beyond these fears.

\section*{(8) Faulty Implementation Approach (Lack of tact or poor timing)}

Sometimes it is not what a leader does, but it is how $\mathrm{s} /$ he does it that creates resistance to change! Undue resistance can occur because changes are introduced in an insensitive manner or at an awkward time.

In other words, people may agree with the change that you want to implement but they may not agree with how you are going about making the change.

For any significant organizational change effort to be effective, you'll need a thoughtful strategy and a thoughtful implementation approach to address these barriers.

So, the next time you hear someone say that people naturally resist change explain to them that this is a myth. We change all of the time.

\section*{CHAPTER 2: COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING.}

What is communication?

Communication is the act of giving, receiving, and sharing information through, talking, writing, listening, reading.

\section*{What Is Networking?}

Networking is the exchange of information and ideas among people with a common profession or special interest, usually in an informal social setting. Networking often begins with a single point of common ground.

Communication can be categorized into three basic types:
(1) verbal communication, in which you listen to a person to understand their meaning;
(2) written communication, in which you read their meaning; and
(3) nonverbal communication, in which you observe a person and infer meaning.

\section*{Benefits of effective communication in healthcare.}

Effective communication can:
- Enhance the patient experience;
- Reduce complains among the healthcare workers.
- Increase self-confidence to the healthcare workers,
- Help in career prospects and job satisfaction
- Help to Reduce stress in the workplace.

\section*{Public speaking:}

Public speaking: is the process of speaking to a few or many people with the purpose of informing, motivating, persuading, educating or entertaining the listeners.

The five elements of public speaking are
who
is saying what
to whom
using what medium
with what effects?

Public speaking is a skill that is best mastered through continuous practice.

A talkative person may not necessarily be an eloquent speaker.

To give a great speech, you must understand the type of speech you are expected to give, and prepare along those lines.

An effective public speaker understands the needs of the audience and is flexible enough to adopt changes that may arise even while delivering the speech. Public speaking is when you stand before an audience and deliver a speech on a topic.

This could be at a formal or an informal occasion. For many people, speaking in front of a large audience is a daunting task, so it is quite natural to become very nervous (with effective training this fear could be overcome).

\section*{Some benefits to speaking in public include:}
- improves confidence
- better research skills
- stronger deductive skills
- ability to advocate for causes

\section*{Factors that influence your ability to communicate effectively.}

\section*{1. Voice control}

Your voice is the most basic communication tool you possess. Learning to use it properly is key for improving your public speaking.

Diaphragmatic breathing is a useful voice control technique. It can give your voice greater power and clarity and prevent the shortness of breath that anxiety causes.

To do this technique, relax your belly and let it expand as you breathe. Extend your inhalations and exhalations to a count of four each.

Practicing this type of breathing without speaking will help you prepare to use it while speaking.

It also helps calm your nerves.

\section*{2. Body language}

Your body language is the combination of your gestures, facial expressions, and movements.

It's an integral part of how we communicate. It helps your audience better understand the nuances of your message.

If your body language contrasts with what you want to transmit or seems incoherent, your speech will be confusing.

\section*{3. Delivery}

Delivery is the way you speak. Good delivery is essential for your audience to understand your speech.

Follow these tips to improve your delivery:

Speak at the speed of a normal conversation. Avoid speaking too quickly because people will get lost in what you are saying. But don't speak too slowly, either, as they will get bored.

Pause regularly. This gives people time to absorb the concepts and ideas. It also makes you appear more confident.

Don't mumble or eat your words - articulate clearly.

Avoid making noises such as "ahh" or "umm" between words. If you need time to think, take a brief pause. There is nothing wrong with a few seconds of silence.

\section*{4. Audience relations}

If you want your audience to listen to you, you need to engage them from the beginning.

The following are ways to connect with your audience:

Smile and greet the audience. Thank them for being there. This will humanize you and establish a conversational tone.

Look for people in the audience who seem actively engaged in your speech. Imagine speaking only to them.

Make eye contact with as many people as possible. This will help establish personal connections with your audience.

\section*{REPORT WRITING}

A report is a short, sharp, concise document which is written for a particular purpose and audience.

It is purely based on observation and analysis. A report gives an explanation of any circumstance.
In today's corporate world, reports play a crucial role. They are a strong base for planning and control in an organization, i.e., reports give information which can be utilized by the management team in an organization for making plans and for solving complex issues in the organization.

A report discusses a particular problem in detail.
It brings significant and reliable information to the limelight of top management in an organization. Hence, on the basis of such information, the management can make strong decisions. Reports are required for judging the performances of various departments in an organization.

\section*{Report writing steps;}
a. Determine the objective of the report, i.e., identify the problem.
b. Collect the required material (facts) for the report.
c. Study and examine the facts gathered.
d. Plan the facts for the report.
e. Prepare an outline for the report, i.e., draft the report.
f. Edit the drafted report.
g. Distribute the draft report to the advisory team and ask for feedback and recommendations.

\section*{The essentials of good/effective report writing are as follows-}
a. Know your objective, i.e., be focused.
b. Analyse the niche audience, i.e., make an analysis of the target audience, the purpose for which audience requires the report, kind of data audience is looking for in the report, the implications of report reading, etc.
c. Decide the length of report.
d. Disclose correct and true information in a report.
e. Discuss all sides of the problem reasonably and impartially. Include all relevant facts in a report.
f. Concentrate on the report structure and matter. Pre-decide the report writing style. Use vivid structure of sentences.
g. The report should be neatly presented and should be carefully documented.
h. Highlight and recap the main message in a report.
i. Encourage feedback on the report from the critics. The feedback, if negative, might be useful if properly supported with reasons by the critics. The report can be modified based on such feedback.
j. Use graphs, pie-charts, etc to show the numerical data records over years.
k. Decide on the margins on a report. Ideally, the top and the side margins should be the same (minimum 1 inch broad), but the lower/bottom margins can be one and a half times as broad as others.
1. Attempt to generate reader's interest by making appropriate paragraphs, giving bold headings for each paragraph, using bullets wherever required, etc.

\section*{REPORT STRUCTURE}

The recommended structure for reports is shown below.

\section*{TITLE PAGE}

The title should clearly convey to the reader the nature of the report. It should also include the name of the author, date written and, if appropriate, details of confidentiality.

\section*{CONTENTS PAGE}

This should show a list of the sections or chapters with page numbers in the sequence in which they appear. Generally, it will be in this order:
1) Executive summary
2) Terms of reference
3) Background/introduction
4) Information-gathering activities
5) Findings
6) Conclusions
7) Recommendations

\section*{8) References}
9) Appendices.

\section*{NEGOTIATION}

Negotiation is a type of discussion used to settle conflicts and reach agreements between two or more sides. Negotiation is a process of "give and take" resulting in a compromise where each side makes a concession for the benefit of everyone involved.

There are many situations where you may need to negotiate at work, no matter what your role is. You may be part of negotiations between co-workers, departments or clients. You may negotiate salary, your position, contract terms, project timelines or more. To be a successful negotiator, you need a variety of skills.

\section*{What are negotiation skills?}

Negotiation skills are qualities that allow two or more sides to reach a compromise. These are often soft skills such as communication, persuasion, planning, strategizing and cooperating. Understanding these skills is the first step to becoming a stronger negotiator.

\section*{12 important negotiation skills}

The skills you'll need depend on your environment, your intended outcome and the people or businesses involved. Here are several key negotiation skills that apply to many situations:

\section*{1. Communication}

Essential communication skills include identifying nonverbal cues and verbal skills to express yourself in an engaging way. Skilled negotiators can change their communication styles to meet the listener's needs. By establishing clear communication, you can avoid misunderstandings that could prevent you from reaching a compromise.

\section*{2. Active listening}

Active listening skills are also crucial for understanding another's opinion in negotiation. Unlike passive listening, which is the act of hearing a speaker without retaining their message, active
listening ensures you're able to engage and later recall specific details without needing information repeated.

\section*{3. Emotional intelligence}

Emotional intelligence is the ability to control your own emotions and recognize others' feelings. Being conscious of the emotional dynamics during negotiation can allow you to remain calm and focused on the core issues. If you're unsatisfied with the current negotiation, express the need for a break so you and the other party can return later with refreshed perspectives.

\section*{4. Expectation management}

Just as you should enter a negotiation with a clear goal, the other side also likely has its own defined expectations. If you believe you might not be able to agree to each other's terms, you could try adjusting your expectations. Skilled expectation management involves maintaining a balance between being a firm negotiator and a collaborative one.

\section*{5. Patience}

Some negotiations can take a long time to complete, occasionally involving renegotiation and counteroffers. Rather than seeking a quick conclusion, negotiators often practice patience to properly assess a situation and reach the best conclusion for their clients.

\section*{6. Adaptability}

Adaptability is a vital skill for a successful negotiation. Each negotiation is unique, and the situation within a singular negotiation may change from one day to the next. For example, an involved party may change their demands abruptly. While it's difficult to plan for every possible situation, a good negotiator can adapt quickly and determine a new plan, if needed.

\section*{7. Persuasion}

The ability to influence others is an important skill of negotiation. It can help you define why your proposed solution is beneficial to all parties and encourage others to support your point of view. In addition to being persuasive, negotiators should be assertive when necessary. Assertiveness allows you to express your opinions while respecting the other side's perspectives.

\section*{8. Planning}

Negotiation requires planning to help you determine what you want. You should consider what's the best possible outcome, what's your least acceptable offer and what you will do if an agreement isn't reached. The ability to prepare, plan and think ahead is crucial to a successful negotiation. Planning skills are necessary not only for the negotiation process but also for deciding how the terms will be carried out.

\section*{9. Integrity}

Integrity, or having strong ethical and moral principles, is an essential skill for negotiations. Being thoughtful, respectful and honest allows the other side to trust what you say. As a negotiator, you should be able to follow through on commitments. To demonstrate trustworthiness, avoid over-promising.

\section*{10. Rapport building (creating a friendly environment).}

The ability to build rapport lets you establish relationships with others where both sides feel supported and understood. Building a rapport requires you effectively communicate your goals but also understand the other side's wants and needs. Rapport helps ease tensions, promotes collaboration and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement. To build rapport, showing respect and using active listening skills are critical.

\section*{11. Problem-solving}

Negotiation requires the ability to see the problem and find a solution. If a price is too high, how can it be lowered? If a resource is in short supply, what can be done to increase it? Being able to find unique solutions to problems may be the determining factor in compromise.

\section*{12. Decision making}

Good negotiators can act decisively during a negotiation. It may be necessary to agree to a compromise during a bargaining arrangement. You need to be able to react decisively. Keep in mind that your decisions may have lasting effects on yourself or your company. It is important to think through your options carefully without overthinking your decision. Going back and forth between your options without a clear answer might bring unnecessary stress.

\section*{TYPES OF NEGOTIATION}

Most negotiation outcomes will fall into one of two categories: "win-win" or "win-lose." By understanding the different types of negotiations, you can determine the most relevant skills for your role and work to improve them. Distributive and integrative negotiations are the most common types of negotiation.

\section*{Distributive negotiations}

In distributive negotiations, also called "distributive bargaining," both sides try to gain control of a limited amount of resources. This is considered a "win-lose" negotiation. One side's gain equals the other side's loss. For example, a client may feel that if Company XWZ does not lower the price for a service, they will be paying too much. The company may feel if it decreases its price, it will lose money.

\section*{Integrative negotiations}

Often referred to as a "win-win," an integrative negotiation occurs when everyone benefits from the agreement. There is usually more than one issue to be negotiated so there are opportunities for tradeoffs. To reach an agreement, each side receives value. For example, a client believes Company XWZ should reduce the cost of its service to $\$ 800$, and the company believes it should maintain the cost at $\$ 1,000$. Both sides may negotiate a $\$ 900$ service. In this case, both "win" \$100.

\section*{HOW TO SKILLFULLY PREPARE FOR A NEGOTIATION}

By considering these steps ahead of time, you can be prepared to use your negotiation skills to your full potential.

\section*{1. Do your research}

Before entering a negotiation, evaluate all sides and consider their goals. For example, if you're nearing the end of the hiring process, you may be preparing to negotiate a salary. The employer likely wants to hire someone who can complete the required job duties for a competitive salary. You likely want to offer your experience and knowledge to a company in return for what you perceive to be fair pay.

It can also be helpful to research the person with whom you are negotiating. Understand the limitations of the negotiator. Do they have the ability to give you what you want? Sometimes the person you are negotiating with will be unable to meet your demands. Understanding these limitations can help you strategize.

\section*{2. Know your priorities}

Negotiations often require each side to compromise. Determine what is most important and what you are willing to settle for in its place. Setting your priorities ahead of time can help you evaluate what you refuse to give up as well as where you're willing to budge.

\section*{3. Consider the opposition}

Consider the potential opposition to your negotiations. Do you think that your manager will object to a pay increase because of declining sales? Will you be denied a higher starting salary for a position because your requested rate is above the average range? Write down all the potential oppositions and then gather the information you can use to argue your case.

\section*{4. Know when to walk away}

One of the hardest parts of negotiation can be knowing when to walk away from a deal. It is important to enter all negotiations recognizing that you may not be able to agree. Once you realize no further compromises can be made and one or neither side is willing to accept the terms, it's probably time to walk away.

\section*{INTERSECTORAL COLLABORATION}

Intersectoral collaboration for health is defined as "actions undertaken by sectors outside the health sector, possibly, but not necessarily, in collaboration with the health sector, on health or health equity outcomes or on the determinants of health or health equity."

Cooperation among different social groups that enables them to solve common problems, e.g., a public health crisis.

\section*{Why engage in ISC?}

This practice provides a collective approach to address the social determinants of health.

ISC makes it possible to work across structural levels, attract a diversity of participants and decision makers, address a variety of health factors, and mobilize social capital to address health equity.

This approach can coordinate policies to limit structured inequality among governments, service providers, community members, the private sector, and many other stakeholders.

It is especially important when health is not the explicit focus of the policy. Because policies external to the health sector have a critical impact on health equity, investments in other areas must be considered or opportunities for action on the social determinants will be missed.

\section*{Where does ISC happen?}

ISC often involves small groups of people from different sectors of society working across formal organizational boundaries to coordinate and provide services and programs to address health equity.

This can take the form of inter-agency meetings, community coalitions, coordinated care teams, information systems links, and co-location of officials in program delivery. The details of the collaboration can range from informal to formal (written or unwritten agreements, pooling of budgets, integration of service delivery, and coordinated action), horizontal (across sectors at the same level) or vertical (across sectors at different levels), narrow (a specific service) or broad (overall system change).

\section*{When is ISC needed?}

ISC has been demonstrated to be effective to address service integration problems, duplications, gaps and inconsistencies in service provision, efficient use of limited resources, and pooling of skills and resources to address health on a broad level.

Although ISC is not necessary for the delivery of individual and behavioural-based health information and services, it can be especially helpful for coordinating service delivery for populations that are difficult to reach. There are a number of challenges with ISC.

To do it well takes more than just bringing people to the table. It also takes time, resources (financial and human), visionary leadership, strong and trusting relationships, common and clear
goals, and a sense of trust. It is important to consider what is necessary to create conditions of success.

\section*{Who is part of ISC?}

Effective collaborations can be large or small, but most importantly the participants need to "own" a common vision that is described in a language that is understood by everyone. Service providers in the health and non-health sectors, various levels of government, and private sector institutions are all potential collaborators, along with members of the public. The importance of involving community members cannot be overstated - it is from here that solutions appropriate to the local context emerge, often through the use of community based participatory methods and other community engagement tools.

\section*{PLANNING AND CONDUCTING MEETING}

Running or chairing a meeting means more than just moving the group through the agenda.
When you chair a meeting, you are responsible for the well-being of the group and the members in it.

That demands a certain amount of attention be paid to "group dynamics" and other process issues. All of that "touchy feely" stuff is important!

\section*{Phase 1: Planning the Meeting}

If you pay attention to planning your meeting, you can avoid the "meeting killers" like:

Wasting meeting time

Wasting people's time

Boring meetings that go nowhere

Meetings for meeting's sake

Decide The Goal of the Meeting

Is it to revise the by-laws, plan volunteer recruitment, or something else? No clear goal? A boring and unfocused meeting may result! Come up with a clear goal and the agenda becomes your road map to getting there.

If you need information or research for the meeting, better have it done before the meeting starts. What happens when you show up at a meeting where important information is missing? It's usually a big waste of time!

\section*{Decide Who Needs to Be There}

If you are working on a billboard campaign, does the whole membership need to attend or just the Billboard Committee? Think before you send out those meeting notices!! When people come to a meeting where they don't care about the agenda, guess what? They usually don't come back!

\section*{Plan with Others}

This is a great way to develop new leaders and get other people more invested in the work of your group! Just get three or four interested folks together and hash out the agenda--it won't take more than an hour!

\section*{Good Agendas Count!}

List the amount of time you plan for each item. If someone other than you is presenting some part of the agenda, list that too, and send it out at least a week ahead of time. Members of any group should know what they are coming to do!

\section*{Phase 2: Setting Up the Meeting}

\section*{Start and End on Time}

It's disrespectful to abuse members' time and about the biggest turn-off there is! If you must start late because only three people are in the room when you're supposed to start, at least apologize! Better yet, get into the habit of starting on time EVEN if there are only three people in the room. Word will get around and eventually; people will come on time or won't come at all. If people
keep showing up late, or not showing up at all, this may be a hint to change your meeting time, or your meeting pattern, or both.

\section*{Sign Them In}

Sign-in sheets do more than tell you who came. They also help update your membership list and give you names for phone trees. Be sure to include name, organization, address, and phone number!

\section*{Do Your Best to Make Everyone Comfortable}

Meeting spaces should be comfortable and convenient. The room should be centrally located, and the right size for the size of your group. Get there early to set up and try to use a space where you can make a circle, not sit in rows like an auditorium. If the meeting space is hard to get to for seniors or others, try to arrange transportation or perhaps a volunteer "escort" service (a great teen/senior project!).

\section*{All Work and No Play Is No Good!}

Have informal time before and after the meeting for people to talk and socialize. That's a big reason people joined your group in the first place, and it's where you can recruit volunteers. Remember, sometimes "the meeting after the meeting" is where people get attached to the group--and also get their best ideas to bring to the next meeting!

\section*{A Regular Cycle}

If you have a regular meeting cycle, people will start to save the date (e.g. the first Monday of the month); but don't have a meeting just to meet! Always have a clear goal or don't have the meeting.

\section*{Phase 3: Running the Meeting}

Being a meeting chairperson is more than one task; it's many jobs in one. If you take it from the top, your job as a chairperson means it is up to you to:

\section*{Do Introductions}

That includes getting everyone to introduce themselves, as well as introducing yourself and your role. When there's a special speaker, his or her introduction is your job too.

\section*{Get Agreement on Agenda and Rules}

Remember, it's everyone's meeting, so everyone needs to "buy in" to the agenda. You can ask for feedback on the agenda before you begin. Rules like no interrupting, etc. can also be helpful if you have some potential "disrupters" in the house.

\section*{Keep The Discussion on Track}

If someone's going off the agenda or is speaking too long, pull 'em back in! Be gentle but firm: people respect a meeting that's run well and remember all too clearly the meetings where someone was allowed to go on and on and on.

Remember about starting and ending! Honor agenda time limits. If the group seems to want to go beyond the agreed upon time on an issue, ask for agreement from all members.

\section*{Summarize What You Hear}

Wrap-up each agenda item by summarizing any conclusions out loud. Then move on when no one objects or everyone agrees.

\section*{Encourage Participation}

If a usually quiet person speaks, show your appreciation. Try to draw everyone in and not just let the usual suspects speak!

\section*{Use The Power Of Your Position Wisely}

Watch what you say and how and how much you say it! Don't take sides, and be fair to everyone.

\section*{Develop New Leaders By Handing Over The Gavel}

Try rotating chairing responsibility. The only way others will learn is by watching you and then doing.

Have a sense of humor, and don't be defensive

Use open-ended questions that require people to say more than "yes" or "no"

Look around the room and watch for signs that you should slow things down or speed them up

\section*{Phase 4: Following Up On The Meeting}

Just because the meeting is over, it doesn't mean your work is done! In order for you to successfully follow up after the meeting, you will need to:

\section*{Gather Feedback From The Group}

You will want to gather information about how the participants felt about the meeting, what could be improved, etc. You may not want to do this at every meeting, but at least once in a while; making sure that people have clear assignments, setting or reaffirming the date for the next meeting, and maximizing opportunities for people to stay around and talk after the meeting (which is very important).

\section*{Make Follow-Up Calls}

The Chair or a designated person may want to make follow-up calls, send out follow -up correspondence, and/or take some follow-up actions. These after-the-meeting activities often serve as the glue that hold the group together.

\section*{Summarize The Meeting}

It's helpful to have a list of the decisions made, with follow-ups. Formal minutes are valuable for many (not all) organizations--they contain announcements, informational items, etc., that are important to report even though they are not "decisions. "

\section*{TIPS ON HANDLING DIFFICULT MEMBERS}

\section*{a) Interventions}

Interventions are techniques to use when you are confronted with disruption or problems during the meetings. They can be used separately, but are usually more effective when used in combination. Interventions attempt to be low on the confrontation scale but still are effective in getting disrupters under control.

\section*{b) Have the group decide:}

If someone refuses to stick to the agenda, keeps bringing up the same point again and again, challenges how you are handling the meeting, etc.
c) Use the agenda and ground rules:

If someone keeps going off the agenda, has side conversations through the whole meeting, verbally attacks others, etc.
d) Be honest: Say what's going on:

If someone is trying to intimidate you, you feel upset and undermined, you need to enlist the help of the group, etc.
e) Use humor:

If there is a lot of tension in the room, people are resistant to being at the meeting, scared/shy about participating, you are seen as an outsider, etc.
f) Accept, deal, or defer:

If someone keeps expressing doubts about accomplishing anything, is bitter and puts down every suggestion, keeps bringing up the same point over and over, has power issues, etc. This means: ACCEPT that what they are saying is true, don't ignore it; DEAL with it right there by spending some time on it, or DEFER it to the group for a decision about what to do. Also see points G and H below.
g) Use body language (if possible):

To quiet side conversations, help quiet people participate, re-focus attention, etc. You can speak volumes by making eye contact, by smiling (or not smiling), or by a change in your seating position.
h) Take a break: Confront disrupters outside the meeting room:

When less confrontational tactics haven't worked, someone keeps verbally attacking other participants, shuffling papers, having side conversations or cutting people off. You can deal with this issue outside the room, at a naturally-occurring break in the action.
i) Confront in the room:

If it's appropriate and will not create backlash, if the group will support you, if you've tried less confrontational tactics already, etc.

\section*{CHAPTER 3: MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES}

\section*{What is Human Resource management?}

Human resource management (HRM) is the process of employing people, training them, compensating them, developing policies relating to them, and developing strategies to retain them. As a field, HRM has undergone many changes over the last twenty years, giving it an even more important role in today's organizations. In the past, HRM meant processing payroll, sending birthday gifts to employees, arranging company outings, and making sure forms were filled out correctly-in other words, more of an administrative role rather than a strategic role crucial to the success of the organization.

\section*{The Role of HRM}

Keep in mind that many functions of HRM are also tasks other department managers perform, which is what makes this information important, despite the career path taken. Most experts agree on the following roles that HRM plays in organizations.

\section*{Staffing}

You need people to perform tasks and get work done in the organization. Even with the most sophisticated machines, humans are still needed. Because of this, one of the major tasks in HRM is staffing. Staffing involves the entire hiring process from posting a job to negotiating a salary package.

\section*{Recruitment.}

This involves finding people to fill the open positions.

It is a positive process of posting job openings and attracting prospective employees to apply for their desired job openings in an organization so that the eligible candidate can be selected.

\section*{Selection}

Involves eliminating the unsuitable candidates through the process of tests or interviews and identifying the suitable ones, which are the best fit for the positions.

In this stage, people will be interviewed and selected, and a proper compensation package will be negotiated. This step is followed by training, retention, and motivation.

Every organization has policies to ensure fairness and continuity within the organization. One of the jobs of HRM is to develop the verbiage surrounding these policies. In the development of policies, HRM, management, and executives are involved in the process. For example, the HRM professional will likely recognize the need for a policy or a change of policy, seek opinions on the policy, write the policy, and then communicate that policy to employees. It is key to note here that HR departments do not and cannot work alone. Everything they do needs to involve all other departments in the organization. Some examples of workplace policies might be the following:

Discipline process policy
Vacation time policy
Dress code

Ethics policy
Internet usage policy

\section*{Compensation and Benefits Administration}

HRM professionals need to determine that compensation is fair, meets industry standards, and is high enough to entice people to work for the organization. Compensation includes anything the employee receives for his or her work. In addition, HRM professionals need to make sure the pay is comparable to what other people performing similar jobs are being paid. This involves setting up pay systems that take into consideration the number of years with the organization, years of experience, education, and similar aspects. Examples of employee compensation include the following:

\section*{Pay}

Health benefits

401(k) (retirement plans)
Stock purchase plans

Vacation time

Sick leave

\section*{Bonuses}

Tuition reimbursement

\section*{Retention}

Retention involves keeping and motivating employees to stay with the organization.
Compensation is a major factor in employee retention, but there are other factors as well. Ninety percent of employees leave a company for the following reasons:

Issues around the job they are performing
Challenges with their manager
Poor fit with organizational culture

Poor workplace environment

\section*{Training and Development}

Once we have spent the time to hire new employees, we want to make sure they not only are trained to do the job but also continue to grow and develop new skills in their job. This results in higher productivity for the organization. Training is also a key component in employee motivation. Employees who feel they are developing their skills tend to be happier in their jobs, which results in increased employee retention. Examples of training programs might include the following:

Job skills training, such as how to run a particular computer program
Training on communication
Team-building activities

Policy and legal training, such as sexual harassment training and ethics training

\section*{Communication}

Besides these major roles, good communication skills and excellent management skills are key to successful human resource management as well as general management.

\section*{Performance management}

There should be proper management of the work done and the future goals. Performance management refers to appraising the performance of the employees and enhancing it. For such a management, it is necessary to encourage the employees so as to raise their confidence levels. This can be done by providing them with fair rewards so that they work in their optimum productivity levels.

\section*{Employee Relations}

There should be a sound relation between the employee and the organization. There are various factors which motivate as well as demotivate the employees to stick with the organization. These factors include working environment, labor law and relations, compensation, etc. The employers must ensure all these factors to build employee relationships that in turn garner better employee retention.

\section*{RECRUITMENT}

Recruitment is a core function of the Human Resource department. It is a process that involves everything from identifying, attracting, screening, shortlisting, interviewing, selecting, hiring, and onboarding employees.

The recruitment teams can be large or small depending on the size of an organization. However, in smaller organizations, recruitment is typically the responsibility of a recruiting manager.

Many organizations outsource their recruiting needs, while some companies rely exclusively on advertisements, job boards, and social media channels to recruit talent for new positions. Many companies of today, use recruitment software to make their recruitment process more effective and efficient.

\section*{Recruitment Process}

The recruitment lifecycle consists of seven interrelated steps which are as follows:

\section*{1. Identifying the Hiring Needs}

Whether a job opening is newly formed or just vacated, you cannot find what you need if you don't know what you need in the first place. So, your recruitment process should start with identifying the vacancies that exist followed by analyzing the job specifications including the
knowledge, skills and experience needed for the role. Here's how you can determine your hiring needs:
- Figure out where the gaps are in your current team. Check if you have new needs in terms of ability, performance or personality. Ask yourself if you need someone to take care of something that is not being addressed currently. This will tell you that there is a hiring need.
- Keep a track of input versus output when it comes to your team. See if there is an increase in workload that needs to be addressed by hiring.
- Regularly analyse performance and make a list of missing qualities, qualifications, skills and proficiencies that you need to add to your team. This can also signal towards hiring needs.
- Be mindful of existing employees leaving. This is definitely when you will have a hiring need.

\section*{2. Preparing the Job Description}

Once you know exactly what you need in terms of knowledge, skills and experience, it is time to determine the duties and responsibilities of the job. Preparing a comprehensive job description (JD) will help you know what your potential employees must have in order to meet the demands of the role. More importantly, it provides your prospects with a checklist or a list that they can compare themselves to before applying. It is a tool to ensure that you get applications from the right candidates (hopefully).

A job description must include all of the following and can be as comprehensive as you want:
Title
Duties \& Responsibilities
Qualification \& Skills
Location
Compensation, Perks \& Benefits

\section*{3. Talent Search}

Identifying the right talent, attracting them and motivating them to apply are the most important aspects of the recruitment process. The job listing should be advertised internally to generate referrals as well as externally on popular social networking sites and preferred job boards. Recruiters can also conduct job fairs and promote openings in leading industry publications to cast a wider net. Broadly, there are two sources of recruitment that can be tapped for a talent search:

\section*{4. Screening and Shortlisting}

A survey of recruiters revealed that while $46 \%$ struggle to attract top talent in the current candidate-driven market, $52 \%$ confirmed that the most challenging part of hiring was identifying the right candidates from a large pool of applicants.

In order to move forward with the recruitment process, you need to screen and shortlist applicants efficiently and accurately. This is where the recruitment process gets difficult and challenging. You can resolve this recruitment bottleneck by following these four steps:

\section*{Steps to Effectively Screen or Shortlist Candidates}
1. Screen applications on the basis of minimum qualifications.
2. Next, sort resumes that have the preferred credentials by looking at their certifications, relevant experience, domain expertise, technical competencies and other specific skills that are required for the role.
3. Then, shortlist candidates who have both the preferred credentials and the minimum qualifications.
4. Finally, flag any concerns or queries in the resume so they can be clarified during the interview.

No wonder, the most arduous task of the recruitment process is reviewing resumes. Fortunately, you can make this complicated, time-consuming task a total breeze with an applicant tracking system that is designed to screen resumes in a jiffy. Using an ATS will ensure that you have an
unbiased, objective filter that will smartly wade through the sea of resumes to narrow down your talent pool in no time!

\section*{5. Interviewing}

The shortlisted applications will now move through the interview process prior to receiving an offer letter or a rejection note. Depending on the size of the hiring team and their unique recruitment needs, several interviews may be scheduled for every candidate.

\section*{Telephonic Screening/Video Interviewing}

This is a quick, easy and convenient way to screen candidates and their capabilities. The telephonic or video interview is also your first opportunity to leave a lasting first impression on your potential employees. So, while you need to keep your very first interview short, make sure you also take the time to screen them against the knowledge, skills and experience mentioned in your job description, so you can eliminate the irrelevant profiles first.

\section*{Face-to-Face Interviewing}

Personal interviews can last longer because this is the last step before the recruiter does a final evaluation and makes the job offer. Final interviews may be conducted by the top management and are typically extended to a very small pool of standout candidates. The final choice should be agreed upon at this stage along with a backup candidate selection.

\section*{Interview Tips}
- Interviews are a two-way process. During the process, the potential candidate also assesses whether your company is the right fit or not. So, be courteous, respectful and sell the benefits of the job role and the organization.
- Prepare questions that give you deep insights into every job applicant's professional background to assess whether they might be a good fit for your open role.
- Refrain from asking abstract questions to check your candidate's reaction; Rather, keep your questions relevant to the role.

\section*{6. Evaluation and Offer of Employment}

Health systems management

This is the final stage of the recruitment process. You should never take it for granted that the candidate will accept your offer. However, if your candidate has patiently completed all the paperwork and waited through the selection process, the odds of accepting the offer are high.

\section*{7. Introduction and Induction of the New Employee}

When applicants accept the job offer, they officially become the employees of the company. The joining date and time is communicated to the employee. Once that's done, pre-employment screening that includes reference and background checks are conducted. Once the verification is done, the employees are then introduced to the organization. The induction process of the employees then begins. During the induction process, a welcome kit is usually given to the new employees, and then the employment contract is signed.

\section*{ORIENTATION OF EMPLOYEE}

An introductory stage in the process of new employee assimilation, and a part of his or her continuous socialization process in an organization.

Orientation is the planned introduction of new employees to their jobs, coworkers, and the organization. However, orientation should not be a mechanical, one-way process. Because all employees are different, orientation must incorporate a sensitive awareness of the anxieties, uncertainties, and needs of the individual.

Orientation in one form or another is offered by most employers. The orientation is meant to educate new employees about the goals and responsibilities of the position and company, as well as to answer any questions they may have about HR, benefits and payroll information.

\section*{Major objectives of orientation are to}
(1) gain employee commitment,
(2) reduce his or her anxiety,
(3) help him or her understand organization's expectations, and
(4) convey what he or she can expect from the job and the organization.

\section*{Purposes of Orientation}

Employers have to realize that orientation isn't just a nice gesture put on by the organization. It serves as an important element of the recruitment and retention process. Some key purposes are: To Reduce Startup Costs Proper orientation can help the employee get "up to speed" much more quickly, thereby reducing the costs associated with learning the job.

\section*{To Reduce Anxiety}

Any employee, when put into a new, strange situation, will experience anxiety that can impede his or her ability to learn to do the job. Proper orientation helps to reduce anxiety that results from entering into an unknown situation, and helps provide guidelines $f$ or behavior and conduct, so the employee doesn't have to experience the stress of guessing.

\section*{To Reduce Employee Turnover}

Employee turnover increases as employees feel they are not valued, or are put in positions where they can't possibly do their jobs. Orientation shows that the organization values the employee, and helps provide the tools necessary for succeeding in the job.

\section*{To Save Time For Supervisor \& Co-Workers}

Simply put, the better the initial orientation, the less likely supervisors and co-workers will have to spend time teaching the employee.

\section*{To Develop Realistic Job Expectations,}

Positive Attitudes and Job Satisfaction It is important that employees learn as soon as possible what is expected of them, and what to expect from others, in addition to learning about the values and attitudes of the organization. While people can learn from experience, they will make many mistakes that are unnecessary and potentially damaging.

\section*{Productivity enhancement}

Both employers and new employees want individuals starting jobs to become as productive as possible relatively quickly. Texas Instruments found that orientation helps new employees reach full productivity levels at least two months sooner than those without effective orientation experiences.

Some employers, including a large accounting firm, give new employees computer and intranet access upon acceptance of a job offer. That way new employees can become more familiar with the organization and its operations even before they go through a formal orientation program. This example illustrates that orientation to the organization really begins during the recruiting and selection processes, because the way individuals are treated and what they learn about the organization during the first contacts may shape how they approach new jobs.

\section*{Organizational Overview}

Another purpose of orientation is to inform new employees about the nature of the organization. A general organizational overview might include a brief review of the organization; the history, structure, key executives, purpose, products, and services of the organization; how the employee's job fits into the big picture; and other general information. If the employer prepares an annual report, a copy may be given to a new employee. Also, some organizations give new employees a list of terms that are used in the industry to help them learn regularly used vocabulary.

\section*{JOB DESCRIPTIONS}

Job description is all about the relative ranking of an individual job in relation to other jobs that exist within the group. This also refers to technique used in ranking of jobs in an organization. This is normally carried out on the basis of various responsibilities and duties that are assigned to the specific job or task. The results of the job description process include the job being assigned a specific range of payment.

The range normally includes a maximum pay rate that the specific job can attract and also the minimum rate of payment that can be given to a person holding such a position.

Job description as a management tool has been used by employers and managers for approximately more than seventy-five years. This management tool has been used both in the private and in the public sector. Basing on some generic factors, the value of each job is well defined in the job description process (Harzing and Ruysseveldt, 2004).

Job description is very important to employers and managers. The reason as to why job description as a management tool never goes out of fashion is because it plays a big role in
reducing employee turnover. One of the steps involved in job description is bench marking the jobs.

This is done in relation to the jobs that have been evaluated before. In this case the bench mark jobs are those that are commonly included in salary surveys found in most organizations. In this process the bench mark jobs of internal pay structures are related to the external structure's existing in the labor market.

This greatly helps in reducing employee turnover in the various organizations. This is because job description carried out will enable the organization's pay grades to be at per with competitor organizations. In this case employees will not see the need of looking for greener pastures since their pay grades will be similar to what their colleagues in the same positions are paid in other organizations. This is really important to employers and managers because they will not be worried about losing employees to better paying organization. This generally plays a big role to stability in the organization.

Job description process as management tool is very important to employers. This is because; research shows that job description helps in minimizing conflicts in the organization. Job description process results in the various jobs in an organization being given a pay rate. This is normally clear to employees in the organization. When job description is carried out in an organization, it results in fairness in terms of payment rates given to various jobs in the organization (Brewster, 1995).

Job descriptions help employers and managers to easily explain the reason as to why some employees earn more and others less. Job description helps in the lessening of employee grievances over relative wages. Managers and employees find it easier to solve any problems that arise concerning relative wages. This plays a big role in minimizing conflicts related to salary payment in the organization. This is because it plays a big role in establishing a grading and a basic pay structure which all employees will regard as fair. This explains why job description as a management tool refuses to go out of fashion.

The job description process as a management tool refuses to go out of fashion for so many reasons. According to research carried out in the private and public sector, employers say that this tool is very fundamental in management. This is because it helps them to come up with pay structures that are simple and very easy to understand. This is because most of the organizations have diverse classes of employees. Some are professionals while others are not. It makes it easy for employees who are not so learned to understand the different pay rates. It is less stressing to come up with pay rates for specific jobs using job description method than if other means are used.

According to employers and managers in both the private and public sector, job structures have made their work far much simpler. This is because, once an organization has carried out job description, it becomes simpler to fit new jobs into the previously set pay structures. It is understood that in every organization, new posts and vacancies always come up which were not existing in the organization.

\section*{PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL}

Performance Appraisal-Is a structural and systematic procedure to measure, assess and influence the attributes, behavior and results related to work, with the aim of discovering how productive an employee is, and if their future performance could be improved."

\section*{Why is a performance appraisal useful?}

The main aim of measuring employee performance is to assess and help them improve their performance and increase their potential, as well as the value they can bring to the company in the future. Even so, there are other objectives such as providing feedback, improving communication, understanding employees' needs, etc. Let's look at them one by one:
1.Offer feedback: give the employee objective information about their work over the last few months, as well as convey the company's expectations.
2.Decide on promotions: the appraisal process gives us objective data for making decisions about who is ready to take on new responsibilities.
3.Decide on dismissals: when you have to reduce the team, the appraisal can also be useful to detect profiles that are valuable, and those that could be let go.
4.Encourage performance: the performance analysis points out where each employee should improve to enhance their performance.
5.Boost motivation: all professionals want to be well-thought-of in their company. If you measure this and bear it in mind, you will have a more motivated workforce who will strive for better results.
6.Establish objectives: setting goals helps boost employee performance. The appraisal enables you to set objectives and measure achievements.
7.Reduce poor performance: this process also helps team managers to identify and help employees who are not meeting expectations to improve their results.
8.Determine compensation: this method is useful for companies that work with objectives as it offers a mechanism to determine who is rewarded for their work, and who isn't.
9.Promote training: where areas for improvement are detected, internal educational or training plans are the best course of action.
10.Improve resource management: performance reviews provide companies with the information they require to ensure they have the talent to meet their future needs.
11.Validate recruitment needs: the need for contracting new staff can only be ascertained by assessing your current workforce.
12.Improve the organization's general performance: the organization will improve it's operation and performance when the whole team is aware of its objectives and works towards them.

\section*{Advantages and disadvantages of appraisals}

Like any process, performance appraisals have both advantages and disadvantages. The latter can often raise issues with employees, so it's important to consider them and know how to spot them.

\section*{Advantages}

Improve the organization's general performance.
Increase employee motivation.
Strengthen commitment to the company.
Helps you to spot internal talent.
Improves communication.
Helps to design career paths and growth.
Enables the development of compensation policies.
Helps to identify personal needs.
Facilitates decision-making about promotions and dismissals.

\section*{Disadvantages}

Requires the investment of time and resources.
Can create a tense atmosphere among employees.
Biases may occur, which renders the objectives of the appraisal

\section*{COUNSELLING, COUCHING AND MOTIVATION OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS}

Counselling is a process where an individual, couple or family meet with a trained professional counsellor to talk about issues and problems that they are facing in their lives.

Couching is a form of development in which an experienced person, supports a learner or client in achieving a specific personal or professional goal by providing training and guidance.

Motivation is defined as the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviours. Motivation in management, is the process through which managers encourage employees to be productive and effective.

\section*{The aims of counselling}
1. Self-awareness - becoming more aware of thoughts and feelings that had been blocked off or denied, or developing a more accurate sense of how self is perceived by others.
2. Self-acceptance - the development of positive attitude towards self, marked by an ability to acknowledge areas of experience that had been the subject $f$ self-criticism and rejection
3. Self-actualisation or individualisation - moving in the direction of fulfilling potential or achieving an integration of previously conflicting parts of self.
4. Problem solving - finding a solution to a specific problem that the client has.
5. Psychological education - enabling the client to acquire ideas and techniques with which control behaviour.

\section*{The five stages/dimensions of the well-formed counselling.}
1. Initiating the session - Here we develop a supportive working relationship and develop a working model.
2. Gathering the data - drawing our stories, concerns, problems, or issues
3. Mutual goal settings - what does the client want to happen?
4. Working - exploring alternatives, confronting client incongruities and conflict, re-storying
5. Terminating - generalising and acting a new story

\section*{Why is motivation in the workplace important?}

As a team member or leader, motivating yourself and your co-workers can help drive your company toward success. Whether you're working remotely or in-person, there are several reasons to encourage your team. Here are some benefits of motivating in the workplace:

\section*{Increases productivity}

Being motivated to do your work can help you achieve a greater output. This is because motivation provides you with a clear focus and deters distraction from your daily responsibilities. Your increased productivity can also help the company achieve its goals.

\section*{Fosters innovation and creativity}

In a similar sense, your increased productivity can inspire you to expand your thought process. This can lead to new, innovative ideas and projects you may not have previously considered.

\section*{Improves employee satisfaction}

As an employee, it's important to be passionate about your job. When you're motivated to work, it can help create a positive emotional response to your work. It can also make you more committed to your work and your overall performance.

\section*{WORK CLIMATE.}

\section*{Improving work climate to strengthen performance.}
"The essential task of management is creating opportunities, releasing potential, removing obstacles, encouraging growth, and providing guidance." (Douglas Mcgregor).

When people work in a supportive environment, they strive to produce results. Such an environment is called a positive work climate. Work climate is the "weather of the workplace." Just as weather conditions can affect your daily activities, work climate influences your behavior at work.

\section*{Good work climate.}

A good work climate can improve an individual's work habits, while a poor climate can erode good work habits. Most importantly, a positive work climate leads to and sustains staff motivation and high performance (Litwin and Stringer.

To create and sustain a positive work climate for work groups, managers at all levels should:
1. Understand what makes a positive work climate and how it affects performance;
2. Improve work climate by motivating staff and providing challenge, clarity, and support;
3. Strengthen communication by listening, understanding, and responding constructively;
4. Sustain your group's commitment through your own commitment and supportive techniques;
5. Set the tone for the organization at the senior level.

\section*{Positive psychology on work climate management.}

According to Paul Wong, about the positive psychology of climate management, "Every office and health facility has a work climate". Some climates are positive and productive, while others tend to demotivate staff. Although the type of climate may be easy to recognize in some workplaces, it may be more subtle in others. To understand the climate of your workplace, begin by asking yourself what it feels like to work with your colleagues, including your manager and your staff. Think back over all your experiences as a member of a team, whether at work, in school, or in sports. Is there a team in which you shared a sense of excitement in working together?.

To improve a work climate, it helps to understand how climate affects people and how it develops. A positive work climate stimulates staff motivation because it provides conditions under which people can pursue their own goals while striving toward organizational objectives (Bennis and Schein). Everyone has motivators, impulses, needs, and energy reserves that can drive him or her to work more effectively. When staff feels motivated, they want to put their capabilities to work. They may even make efforts that exceed job expectations.

\section*{How to recognize a positive work climate.}

To recognize a positive work climate, think of a time when you were a member of a great team at work station, sports club, class, etc.
$>$ How did you feel?
$>$ Were you energized?
$>$ Empowered?
$>$ Excited?
$>$ Energetic?
$>$ High morale?
$>$ Looking forward to the next day at work?
$>$ Impatient to get started?
$>$ Motivated? Etc.
All these experiences indicate a positive work climate. If you experienced the opposite, it indicated a negative work climate.

It is important to know how you can influence work climate and distinguish between factors that are within your control and those that are not. On one hand, you can change a climate that undermines staff commitment and performance by managing and leading your team better. On the other hand, factors such as organizational history, culture, and management strategy and structure may be beyond your influence unless you hold a powerful position in your organization.

\section*{Developing a positive work climate.}

How successful you are in developing a positive work climate, as a manager will depend on how well you:
1. Know your staff,
2. Their motivations,
3. Work styles,
4. Interests;
5. Know what motivates you,
6. What you value,
7. What rouses your emotions;
8. Focus on providing challenge,
9. Clarity,
10. Give support to your group.
11. Know your staff.

The most important things you can do to develop a positive work climate are to know your staff and establish a good work relationship with them. Managers are the "human connectors" who make things happen (Kouzes and Posner). If you have a good work relationship with the individuals in your group, it will be much easier for you to align their efforts with yours and mobilize their energies to face a challenge. If you are a caring and supportive supervisor, your staff will also be more likely to stay with the organization.

\section*{Helping staff to grow.}

Look for ways to:
1. Challenge your staff to help them grow;
2. Ensure clarity about work roles and responsibilities;
3. Support staff by providing resources,
4. Making connections,
5. Understand their needs.

NB: You can challenge staff by offering assignments that stretch them beyond their current level of competence and confidence. Such assignments offer the possibility of doing something in a new way or starting something new. When staff members are not challenged, they do not grow or learn from mistakes and they become bored.

\section*{Managing practices.}

You will also improve work climate when you and your staff:
1. Plan regular meetings to exchange information on progress and share learning;
2. Organize management systems, especially systems that promote work efficiency and information flow;
3. Implement activities that move your group toward your shared goals;
4. Monitor progress and use mistakes as sources for learning.

\section*{Building and maintaining trust in good working climate.}

To ensure the building and maintaining trust, Bragar, who was able to influence colleagues effectively showed the following practices that build trust:
1. Agree on a code of conduct for your team.
2. Keep your promises.
3. Be clear about your intentions.
4. Avoid gossip.
5. Consider alternative viewpoints.
6. Draw on the expertise and abilities of others.
7. Be open to others' influence in making your decisions.
8. Be fair in your treatment of others.
9. Support staff in meeting standards and expectations.
10. Look for causes of problems in work processes, not individuals.
11. Increase your competence.
12. Trust others and accept the vulnerability that comes from relying on them.
13. Humbly and wisely admit mistakes, doubt, and uncertainty Practices that maintain trust.
14. Consistent messages.
15. Consistent standards and expectations.
16. Strong group performance.
17. Information for understanding organizational incidents.
18. Availability to staff.
19. Open discussion on large, disturbing issues.

\section*{MOTIVATION THEORIES.}

From the very beginning, when the human organizations were established, various thinkers have tried to find out the answer to what motivates people to work. Different approaches applied by them have resulted in a number of theories concerning motivation. Thus, we have;
1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Need theory.
2. Herzberg's Motivation Hygiene theory.
3. McClelland's Need theory.
4. McGregor's Participation theory.
5. Urwick's theory Z.
6. Argyris's theory (growth).
7. Vroom's Expectancy theory.
8. Porter and Lawler's Expectancy theory.

\section*{1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Need Theory:}

The most well-known theory of motivation is Maslow's hierarchy of need theory. It is based on the human needs. Maslow classified all human needs into a hierarchical manner from the lower to the higher order. He believed that once a given level of need is satisfied, it no longer serves to motivate man. The next higher level of need has to be activated in order to motivate the man. Maslow identified five levels in his hierarchy of need as shown-

\section*{- Physiological Needs:}

These needs are basic to human life and, hence, include food, clothing, shelter, air, water and necessities of life. These needs relate to the survival and maintenance of human life. They exert tremendous influence on human behavior. These needs are to be met first at least partly before higher level needs emerge. Once physiological needs are satisfied, they no longer motivate the man.

\section*{- Safety Needs:}

After satisfying the physiological needs, the next needs felt are called safety and security needs. These needs find expression in such desires as economic security and protection from physical dangers. Meeting these needs requires more money and, hence, the individual is prompted to work more. Like physiological needs, these become inactive once they are satisfied.

\section*{- Social Needs - (belongingness and love needs).}

Man is a social being. He is, therefore, interested in social interaction, companionship, belongingness, etc. It is this socializing and belongingness why individuals prefer to work in groups and especially older people go to work.

\section*{4. Esteem Needs:}

These needs refer to self-esteem and self-respect. They include such needs which indicate selfconfidence, achievement, competence, knowledge and independence. The fulfillment of esteem needs leads to self-confidence, strength and capability of being useful in the organization. However, inability to fulfill these needs results in feeling like inferiority, weakness and helplessness.

\section*{Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (original five-stage model)}

Belonginguess and Love needs
family, affection, relationships, work group, etc

\section*{Safety needs}
protection, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc

Biological and Physiological needs
basic life needs - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, etc.

\section*{- Self-Actualization Needs:}

This level represents the culmination of all the lower, intermediate, and higher needs of human beings. In other words, the final step under the hierarchy of need model is the need for selfactualization. This refers to fulfillment.

The term self-actualization was coined by Kurt Goldstein and means to become actualized in what one is potentially good at. Self- actualization is the person's motivation to transform perception of self into reality.

According to Maslow, the human needs follow a definite sequence of domination. The second need does not arise until the first is reasonably satisfied, and the third need does not emerge until the first two needs have been reasonably satisfied and it goes on. The other side of the hierarchy of need is that human needs are unlimited.

The main criticisms of the theory include the following:
The needs may or may not follow a definite hierarchical order. So to say, there may be overlapping in need hierarchy. For example, even if safety need is not satisfied, the social need may emerge. Researches show that man's behaviour at any time is mostly guided by multiplicity of behavior.

\section*{2. Herzberg's Motivation Hygiene Theory:}

The psychologist Frederick Herzberg extended the work of Maslow and proposed a new motivation theory popularly known as Herzberg's Motivation Hygiene Theory. The main use of his recommendations lies in planning and controlling of employees work.

According to Herzberg, the opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction. The underlying reason, he says, is that removal of dissatisfying characteristics from a job does not necessarily make the job satisfying. The opposite of 'satisfaction' is 'no satisfaction' and the opposite of 'dissatisfaction' is 'no dissatisfaction'.

The theory basically explains job satisfaction, not motivation and this theory neglects situational variable to motivate an individual.

\section*{3. McClelland's Need Theory:}

Another well-known need-based theory of motivation, as opposed to hierarchy of needs of satisfaction-dissatisfaction, is the theory developed by McClelland and his associates'.

McClelland's need-theory is closely associated with learning theory, because he believed that needs are learned or acquired by the kinds of events people experienced in their environment and
culture. He found that people who acquire a particular need behave differently from those who do not have. His theory focuses on Murray's three needs; achievement, power and affiliation.

\section*{4. McGregor's Participation Theory:}

Douglas McGregor formulated two distinct views of human being based on participation of workers. The first basically negative, labeled Theory X, and the other basically positive, labeled Theory Y.

\section*{Theory X is based on the following assumptions:}
- People are by nature indolent. That is, they like to work as little as possible.
- People lack ambition, dislike responsibility, and prefer to be directed by others.
- People are inherently self-centered and indifferent to organizational needs and goals.
- People are generally gullible and not very sharp and bright.

\section*{On the contrary, Theory $Y$ assumes that:}
- People are not by nature passive or resistant to organizational goals.
- They want to assume responsibility.
- They want their organization to succeed.
- People are capable of directing their own behavior.
- They have need for achievement.

\section*{5. Urwick's Theory Z:}

Much after the propositions of theories X and Y by McGregor, the three theorists Urwick, Rangnekar and Ouchi-propounded the third theory labeled as Z theory.

The two propositions in Urwicks's theory are that:
(i) Each individual should know the organizational goals precisely and the amount of contribution through his efforts towards these goals.
(ii) Each individual should also know that the relation of organizational goals is going to satisfy his/her needs positively.

In Urwick's view, the above two make people ready to behave positively to accomplish both organizational and individual goals.

Theory $\mathbf{Z}$ is based on the following four postulates:
- Strong Bond between Organization and Employees.
- Employee Participation and Involvement.
- No Formal Organization Structure.
- Human Resource Development.

\section*{6. Argyris's Theory:}

Argyris has developed his motivation theory based on proposition how management practices affect the individual behaviour and growth. In his view, the seven changes taking place in an individual personality make him/her a mature one. In other words, personality of individual develops

Argyris views that immaturity exists in individuals mainly because of organizational setting and management practices such as task specialization, chain of command, unity of direction, and span of management. In order to make individuals grow mature, he proposes gradual shift from the existing pyramidal organization structure to humanistic system; from existing management system to the more flexible and participative management.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Immaturity } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Maturity } \\
\hline Passivity & Activity \\
Dependence & Independence \\
Capable of behaving in & Capable of behaving in \\
a few ways & many ways \\
Shallow interest & Deep interest \\
Short-term perspective & Long-term perspective \\
Subordinate position & Superordinate position \\
Lack of self-awareness & Self-awareness and control \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{7. Vroom's Expectancy Theory:}

One of the most widely accepted explanations of motivation is offered by Victor Vroom in his Expectancy Theory" It is a cognitive process theory of motivation. The theory is founded on the basic notions that people will be motivated to exert a high level of effort when they believe there are relationships between the effort they put forth, the performance they achieve and the outcomes or rewards they receive.

The relationships between notions of effort, performance, and reward are depicted below;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_20d785f6e224ed7dff81g-079.jpg?height=647&width=1727&top_left_y=1563&top_left_x=264)

Fig 17.3: Vroom's Expectancy Model of Motivation

Thus, the key constructs in the expectancy theory of motivation are:
- Valence:

Valence, according to Vroom, means the value or strength one places on a particular outcome or reward.
- Expectancy:

It relates efforts to performance.
- Instrumentality:

By instrumentality, Vroom means, the belief that performance is related to rewards.
Thus, Vroom's motivation can also be expressed in the form of an equation as follows:
Motivation = Valence $\mathbf{x}$ Expectancy $\mathbf{x}$ Instrumentality.

\section*{8. Porter and Lawler's Expectancy Theory:}

Porter and Lawler's theory is an improvement over Vroom's expectancy theory. They posit that motivation does not equal satisfaction or performance. The model suggested by them encounters some of the simplistic traditional assumptions made about the positive relationship between satisfaction and performance. They proposed a multi-variety model to explain the complex relationship that exists between satisfaction and performance.

The main point in Porter and Lawler's model is that effort or motivation does not lead directly to performance. It is intact, mediated by abilities and traits and by role perceptions. Ultimately, performance leads to satisfaction.

There are three main elements in this model. Thus;

\section*{Effort:}

Effort refers to the amount of energy an employee exerts on a given task. How much effort an employee will put in a task is determined by two factors-
(i) Value of reward.
(ii) Perception of effort-(reward probability).

\section*{Performance:}

One's effort leads to his/her performance. Both may be equal or may not be. However the amount of performance is determined by the amount of labour and the ability and role perception of the employee.

\section*{Satisfaction:}

Performance leads to satisfaction. The level of satisfaction depends upon the amount of rewards one achieves. If the amount of actual rewards meet or exceed perceived equitable rewards, the employee will feel satisfied. On the country, if actual rewards fall short of perceived ones, he/she will be dissatisfied.

\section*{CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT IN AN ORGANIZATION}

Conflict is defined as a clash between individuals arising out of a difference in thought process, attitudes, understanding, interests, requirements and even sometimes perceptions.

Conflict resolution can be defined as the informal or formal process that two or more parties use to find a peaceful solution to their dispute.

\section*{Conflict is classified into the following four types:}

Interpersonal conflict refers to a conflict between two individuals. This occurs typically due to how people are different from one another. We have varied personalities which usually results to incompatible choices and opinions. Apparently, it is a natural occurrence which can eventually help in personal growth or developing your relationships with others. In addition, coming up with adjustments is necessary for managing this type of conflict. However, when interpersonal conflict gets too destructive, calling in a mediator would help so as to have it resolved.

Intrapersonal conflict occurs within an individual. The experience takes place in the person's mind. Hence, it is a type of conflict that is psychological involving the individual's thoughts, values, principles and emotions. Interpersonal conflict may come in different scales, from the simpler mundane ones like deciding whether or not to go organic for lunch to ones that can affect
major decisions such as choosing a career path. Furthermore, this type of conflict can be quite difficult to handle if you find it hard to decipher your inner struggles. It leads to restlessness and uneasiness, or can even cause depression. In such occasions, it would be best to seek a way to let go of the anxiety through communicating with other people. Eventually, when you find yourself out of the situation, you can become more empowered as a person. Thus, the experience evoked a positive change which will help you in your own personal growth.

Intragroup conflict is a type of conflict that happens among individuals within a team. The incompatibilities and misunderstandings among these individuals lead to an intragroup conflict. It is arises from interpersonal disagreements (e.g. team members have different personalities which may lead to tension) or differences in views and ideas (e.g. in a presentation, members of the team might find the notions presented by the one presiding to be erroneous due to their differences in opinion). Within a team, conflict can be helpful in coming up with decisions which will eventually allow them to reach their objectives as a team. However, if the degree of conflict disrupts harmony among the members, then some serious guidance from a different party will be needed for it to be settled.

Intergroup conflict takes place when a misunderstanding arises among different teams within an organization. For instance, the sales department of an organization can come in conflict with the customer support department. This is due to the varied sets of goals and interests of these different groups. In addition, competition also contributes for intergroup conflict to arise. There are other factors which fuel this type of conflict. Some of these factors may include a rivalry in resources or the boundaries set by a group to others which establishes their own identity as a team.

\section*{CONFLICT MANAGEMENT STYLES}

\section*{Accommodating}

Accommodation involves having to deal with the problem with an element of self-sacrifice; an individual sets aside his own concerns to maintain peace in the situation. Thus, the person yields to what the other wants, displaying a form of selflessness. It might come as an immediate solution to the issue; however, it also brings about a false manner of dealing with the problem.

This can be disruptive if there is a need to come up with a more sound and creative way out of the problem. This behaviour will be most efficient if the individual is in the wrong as it can come as a form of conciliation.

\section*{Avoiding}

In this approach, there is withdrawal from the conflict. The problem is being dealt with through a passive attitude. Avoiding is mostly used when the perceived negative end outweighs the positive outcome. In employing this, individuals end up ignoring the problem, thinking that the conflict will resolve itself. It might be applicable in certain situations but not in all. Avoidance would mean that you neglect the responsibility that comes with it. The other individuals involved might think that you are neglecting the problem. Thus, it is better to confront the problem before it gets worse.

\section*{Collaborating}

Collaborating aims to find a solution to the conflict through cooperating with other parties involved. Hence, communication is an important part of this strategy. In this mechanism, effort is exerted in digging into the issue to identify the needs of the individuals concerned without removing their respective interests from the picture. Collaborating individuals aim to come up with a successful resolution creatively, without compromising their own satisfactions.

\section*{Competing}

Competition involves authoritative and assertive behaviors. In this style, the aggressive individual aims to instil pressure on the other parties to achieve a goal. It includes the use of whatever means to attain what the individual thinks is right. It may be appropriate in some situations but it shouldn't come to a point wherein the aggressor becomes too unreasonable. Dealing with the conflict with an open mind is vital for a resolution to be met.

\section*{Compromising}

Compromising is about coming up with a resolution that would be acceptable to the parties involved. Thus, one party is willing to sacrifice their own sets of goals as long as the others will do the same. Hence, it can be viewed as a mutual give-and-take scenario where the parties submit the same amount of investment for the problem to be solved. A disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that since these parties find an easy way around the problem, the possibility of coming up with more creative ways for a solution would be neglected.

\section*{CONFLICT RESOLUTION SKILLS}

\section*{Active listening}

Active listening is a crucial part of conflict resolution. An employee might be approached by someone about a way in which their behavior is disruptive, and by actively listening, they can understand the origin of the complaint and what to do about it.

\section*{Bias for action}

Having a bias for action means assertively seeking out the next steps rather than waiting for someone else to do something. In conflict resolution, this could manifest as a coworker noticing they may have upset someone else and actively seeking to address that with them as soon as possible. A manager could also realize there is a conflict taking place and step in to resolve the conflict before too much time has passed.

\section*{Perspective taking}

Perspective-taking is the ability to understand someone else's point of view. You can ask yourself: "What are their thoughts, triggers and observations?" For example, a client may call customer service because they are confused about how to use the company's product. Even though the customer service agent who receives the call may understand clearly how to use the product, they can benefit from understanding the client's confusion. In fact, these conversations can help reveal potential improvements to product design or training.

\section*{Facilitation}

When there is conflict, you can arrange the environment around you to make resolution easier. For example, a manager who oversees two different groups might bring those groups together in a comfortable conference room to address points of disagreement on a joint project. Providing time and space for discussion can facilitate a speedy end to the conflict.

\section*{Mediation}

Mediation is when a neutral third party is involved in the resolution of a conflict. A mediator can be a trained professional, someone from an outside group (such as HR), or a person outside the conflict who can provide an objective perspective. In addition to all the other skills listed here, a successful mediator has the ability to summarize what they are hearing and observing to demonstrate progress and agreement.

\section*{Problem solving}

Problem-solving skills help you determine the source of a problem and find an effective solution. During conflict resolution, a manager might use their problem-solving skills to identify areas of compromise between two team members who disagree.

\section*{Responsibility}

The ability to hold people responsible for their actions is important in conflict resolution. For example, when an agreement is reached, an HR representative may need to check in a few days later to make sure everyone is still on the same page.

\section*{EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE}

Employee discipline is defined as the regulations or conditions that are imposed on employees by management in order to either correct or prevent behaviors that are detrimental to an organization.

\section*{The Importance of Discipline in an Organization}

Discipline in business is a type of training in which individuals are subject to particular regulations designed to mold behaviors. It is necessary to instill a disciplining program in your
small business in order to move forward. An effective regimen will help improve workplace performance, provide a safe and honest environment conducive to production.

\section*{Promotes Appropriate Behavior}

A disciplined environment helps put both management and employees on their best behavior. Managers must strictly adhere to the company's protocols in order to effectively lead those looking to them as examples. Employees who enter this type of administration know what the expectations are as well as the penalties for committing infractions. This knowledge promotes appropriate actions and conduct which are essential for a small company. Discipline should always be used as a means of ensuring that all employees adhere to a unified set of standards.

\section*{Efficiency}

Efficiency is tied to a disciplined organization. Staff members must discipline themselves in working in a timely manner to produce quality output. Small business owners must strive to cultivate a workplace in which standards are set which everyone in the organization is called upon to meet. This allows management and workers to get things done. Discipline requires concentration, time management, and orderliness, which all contribute to efficient labor.

\section*{Peaceful Environment}

Peacefulness ensues when you have a workplace that is committed to values of a concentrated regimen. The environment that exists in organizations which do not issue specific guidelines for behavior is frequently impulsive, erratic and uncertain. It is extremely difficult for management to effectively lead workers under these conditions. A disciplined facility, however, encourages a pleasant environment that promotes good management and employee relations.

\section*{Fairness}

Discipline helps to produce an honest environment in which everyone is treated fairly. An employee does not have to fear being shouldered with an unfair amount of tasks because set protocols are in place that call for workers to share the load. Managers are less likely to play favorites in a disciplined environment as well, as they are subject to the same conduct requirements as all others in the company. The compliance organization HR.BLR.com states that
employers can ensure fair treatment of all workers by uniformly following their performance discipline plans.

\section*{Ensures Safety}

Safety in your small company is of vital importance. You do not want any of your staff or customers to suffer preventable accidents from which personal harm occurs, which could also lead to possible legal action. You must abide by all occupational safety regulations and train your staff appropriately. Kelly Services' Smart Manager website says that a disciplined environment is necessary to provide a secure workplace. For this reason, it is necessary to train all employees on safety procedures. Employees who fail to follow safety directives are subject to disciplinary measures.

\section*{REASONS WHY PEOPLE RESIST CHANGE}

Leadership is about change, but what is a leader to do when faced with ubiquitous resistance? Resistance to change manifests itself in many ways, from foot-dragging and inertia to petty sabotage to outright rebellions. The best tool for leaders of change is to understand the predictable, universal sources of resistance in each situation and then strategize around them. Here are the ten I've found to be the most common.

Loss of control. Change interferes with autonomy and can make people feel that they've lost control over their territory. It's not just political, as in who has the power. Our sense of selfdetermination is often the first things to go when faced with a potential change coming from someone else. Smart leaders leave room for those affected by change to make choices. They invite others into the planning, giving them ownership.

Excess uncertainty. If change feels like walking off a cliff blindfolded, then people will reject it. People will often prefer to remain mired in misery than to head toward an unknown. As the saying goes, "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know." To overcome inertia requires a sense of safety as well as an inspiring vision. Leaders should create certainty of process, with clear, simple steps and timetables.

Surprise, surprise! Decisions imposed on people suddenly, with no time to get used to the idea or prepare for the consequences, are generally resisted. It's always easier to say No than to say Yes. Leaders should avoid the temptation to craft changes in secret and then announce them all at once. It's better to plant seeds - that is, to sprinkle hints of what might be coming and seek input.

Everything seems different. Change is meant to bring something different, but how different? We are creatures of habit. Routines become automatic, but change jolts us into consciousness, sometimes in uncomfortable ways. Too many differences can be distracting or confusing. Leaders should try to minimize the number of unrelated differences introduced by a central change. Wherever possible keep things familiar. Remain focused on the important things; avoid change for the sake of change.

Loss of face. By definition, change is a departure from the past. Those people associated with the last version - the one that didn't work, or the one that's being superseded - are likely to be defensive about it. When change involves a big shift of strategic direction, the people responsible for the previous direction dread the perception that they must have been wrong. Leaders can help people maintain dignity by celebrating those elements of the past that are worth honoring, and making it clear that the world has changed. That makes it easier to let go and move on.

Concerns about competence. Can I do it? Change is resisted when it makes people feel stupid. They might express skepticism about whether the new software version will work or whether digital journalism is really an improvement, but down deep they are worried that their skills will be obsolete. Leaders should over-invest in structural reassurance, providing abundant information, education, training, mentors, and support systems. A period of overlap, running two systems simultaneously, helps ease transitions.

More work. Here is a universal challenge. Change is indeed more work. Those closest to the change in terms of designing and testing it are often overloaded, in part because of the inevitable unanticipated glitches in the middle of change, per "Kanter's Law" that "everything can look like a failure in the middle." Leaders should acknowledge the hard work of change by allowing some people to focus exclusively on it, or adding extra perqs for participants (meals? valet parking? massages?). They should reward and recognize participants - and their families, too, who often make unseen sacrifices.

Ripple effects. Like tossing a pebble into a pond, change creates ripples, reaching distant spots in ever-widening circles. The ripples disrupt other departments, important customers, people well outside the venture or neighbourhood, and they start to push back, rebelling against changes they had nothing to do with that interfere with their own activities. Leaders should enlarge the circle of stakeholders. They must consider all affected parties, however distant, and work with them to minimize disruption.

Past resentments. The ghosts of the past are always lying-in wait to haunt us. As long as everything is steady state, they remain out of sight. But the minute you need cooperation for something new or different, the ghosts spring into action. Old wounds reopen, historic resentments are remembered - sometimes going back many generations. Leaders should consider gestures to heal the past before sailing into the future.

Sometimes the threat is real. Now we get to true pain and politics. Change is resisted because it can hurt. When new technologies displace old ones, jobs can be lost; prices can be cut; investments can be wiped out. The best thing leaders can do when the changes they seek pose significant threat is to be honest, transparent, fast, and fair. For example, one big layoff with strong transition assistance is better than successive waves of cuts.

Although leaders can't always make people feel comfortable with change, they can minimize discomfort. Diagnosing the sources of resistance is the first step toward good solutions. And feedback from resistors can even be helpful in improving the process of gaining acceptance for change.

\section*{HOW TO MANAGE CHANGE.}

\section*{1.Be persistent.}

Success is usually more to do with tenacity that genius. Persistence is only possible when you have clarified your values and when you are able to build on the bedrock of purpose. Successful people keep going in the face of change, finding new and creative ways to achieve a positive outcome.
2. Be flexible and creative.

Persistence does not mean pushing through by force. If you are unable to achieve success one way, try another, and then another. Keep looking for more creative solutions and innovative responses to problems.

\section*{3. Think outside the box.}

Read widely, and don't confine yourself to your own area of 'expertise.' Try to see links between apparently separate and diverse elements in your life and experience.

\section*{4. Accept uncertainty and be optimistic.}

Life is inherently uncertain, so don't waste your energy trying to predict the future. Of all the possible outcomes, focus on the most positive one. This is not to be a 'Pollyanna,' but to accept that if you respond well and work to the best of your ability, a good outcome is as likely as any other. Don't waste your energy being negative.

\section*{Benefits of Change Management}

\section*{for the Organization:}
- Change is a planned and managed process. The benefits of the change are known before implementation and serve as motivators and assessment of progress.
- The organization can respond faster to customer demands.
- Helps to align existing resources within the organization.
- Change management allows the organization to assess the overall impact of a change.
- Change can be implemented without negatively effecting the day to day running of business.
- Organizational effectiveness and efficiency is maintained or even improved by acknowledging the concerns of staff.
- The time needed to implement change is reduced.
- The possibility of unsuccessful change is reduced.
- Employee performance increases when staff feel supported and understand the change process.
- Increased customer service and effective service to clients from confident and knowledgeable employees.
- Change management provides a way to anticipate challenges and respond to these efficiently.
- An effective change management process lowers the risk associated with change.
- Managed costs of change: change management helps to contain costs associated with the change.
- Increased return on investment (ROI).
- Creates an opportunity for the development of "best practices", leadership development, and team development.

\section*{OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS}

Occupational hazards are risks of illnesses or accidents in the workplace. In other words, hazards that workers experience in their place of work. An occupational hazard is something unpleasant that a person experiences or suffers as a result of doing their job. Some dictionaries say that the term also includes hazards that people experience as a result of working on their hobbies.

A hazard is an undesirable, unpleasant event or danger. It can also mean 'risk.'

When talking specifically about workplace injuries, we use the term Occupational Injury.

\section*{Occupations hazards - several types}

There are many types of occupational hazards, such as biohazards, chemical hazards, physical hazards, and psychosocial hazards.

\section*{Biological hazards}

Biological hazards or biohazards refer to biological substances that threaten the health of human beings and other living organisms.

This type of hazard may include samples of a toxin of a biological source, a virus, or a microorganism. Specifically, samples that harm human health.

\section*{Chemical hazards}

Chemical hazards are occupational hazards that exposure to chemicals in the workplace may cause. Victims can suffer acute or long-term negative health effects.

There are hundreds of hazardous chemicals, including immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, neurotoxins, and reproductive toxins. Asthmagens, sensitizers, and systemic toxins are also hazardous chemicals.
"Long-term exposure to chemicals such as silica dust, engine exhausts, tobacco smoke, and lead (among others) have been shown to increase risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure."

\section*{Physical hazards}

Physical hazards may be factors, agents, or circumstances that can cause harm without or with contact. We classify them as either environmental or occupational hazards.

Radiation, heat and cold stress, vibrations, and noise, for example, are types of physical hazards.

Physical hazards cause injuries and illnesses in several industries. In some industries, such as mining and construction, they are unavoidable.

However, over time, we have developed safety procedures and methods to minimize the risks of physical danger in people's place of work.

\section*{Psychosocial hazards}

Psychosocial hazards are occupational hazards that affect employees' psychological health. These hazards affect their ability to take part in a work environment with other colleagues.

Psychosocial hazards are associated with how the work was designed, organized, and managed. They are also related to the social and economic contexts of the work. Patients suffer psychological or psychiatric injury or illness. Some also suffer physical injury or illness.

Workplace violence and occupational stress, for example, are psychosocial hazards.

\section*{CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD)}

Continuing professional development (CPD) encompasses experiences, activities and processes that contribute towards the development of a nurse or midwife as a health care professional. CPD is, therefore, a lifelong process of both structured and informal learning.

Benefits of professional development include:
1. Professional development expands your knowledge base. Professional development and continuing education opportunities can expose both young and experienced professionals to new ideas, solidify their knowledge, and increase their expertise in their field. Those who actively seek out these learning opportunities are those who will benefit most from them.
2. Professional development boosts confidence and credibility. By increasing professionals' expertise through professional development, their confidence in their work will increase as well. No one likes to think they're missing important skills in their industry. Professional development courses, continuing education, and training opportunities allow professionals to build confidence and credibility as they acquire new skill sets and professional designations.
3. Professional development increases earning potential and hireability. Professional development and continuing education offers both young and experienced professionals with opportunities to boost their earning potential and future hireability by increasing their knowledge and updating their skill sets. Professional credentials, certifications, and designations - most of which can be accessed and obtained online - also provide easy ways to increase a professional's value. Professionals with the right skill sets who seek out and take advantage of upskilling opportunities are certainly more bankable than those who don't.
4. Professional development can provide networking opportunities. Many professional development opportunities such as workshops, conferences, and other networking events
allow professionals to branch out and meet other people within their industry who may be able to help them with career opportunities in the future. When you decide you want a change or are ready to move up in your career, your professional network and the professional relationships you forged will come in handy.
5. Professional development keeps professionals current on industry
trends. Professional development and continuing education and learning opportunities are great ways to stay up-to-date on industry knowledge and trends. Every professional industry is constantly evolving, so employees should use professional development and training opportunities to expand their knowledge base, learn new practices and techniques, and embrace new technology.
6. Professional development can open the door to future career changes. For professionals who are looking to make a complete career change or to pivot within their industry, new skills acquired through professional development training could be critical to opening new doors within their field or to transition to a new industry.

Examples of professional development opportunities include:
- Attend a professional conference. Conferences are great opportunities to learn from experts in your field, network with like-minded professionals, and have a good time. If an out-oftown conference is not possible, there are still many online conferences and webinars professionals can register for.
- Participate in workshops. The purpose of workshops is to bring together professionals with specific expertise to discuss problems and offer solutions. Unlike most conferences, workshops require active participation from those attending. This hands-on experience can be especially useful in learning new skills.
- Complete your CE/CPE. Continuing education is required to maintain most professional licenses and designations. Some people view continuing education as a chore they have to get out of the way every year, but proactive professionals take advantage of their continuing education courses to hone their knowledge and update themselves on their industry.
- Take advantage of microlearning. Microlearning is an effective learning method especially useful for busy professionals. Also known as "bite-sized learning", microlearning
consists of brief learning units that give brief, focused bursts of content (usually between 1 and 10 minutes long) allowing professionals to fit short learning sessions into their busy schedules.
- Shadow a colleague. If opportunity presents itself, it may be useful to shadow a colleague or superior whose type of job or skills you're interested in. Shadowing another professional can be a positive learning experience that can offer a lot of clarity about your interest in that career.

Read a book that can help you in your field. There are going to be a lot of books out there, no matter what industry you're in. If you're unsure of what to read, ask your manager or mentor what they recommend.

\section*{TIME MANAGEMENT}

Time management is the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.

Time management refers to the judicious use of time for achieving success in life. Time Management helps an individual to make the best possible use of time. It is essential for individuals to value time and allocate the right time to the right activity.

Let us go through some Time Management Techniques:
- Set your Priorities. Know what all needs to be done on an urgent basis. Prepare a "TO DO" List or a "Task Plan" to jot down tasks you need to complete against the time slot assigned to each activity. High Priority Tasks must be written on top followed by tasks which can be done a little later. Make sure you stick to your Task List.
- Make sure you finish your assignments within the stipulated time frame. Tick the tasks you have already finished. Treat yourself with a chocolate if you finish your assignments ahead of deadlines.
- Understand the difference between urgent and important work. Manage your work well. Do not begin your day with something which is not so important and can be done a little later. First finish off what all is urgent and important. Do not wait for your Boss's reminders.
- Stay focused. Do not leave your work station if some urgent work needs to be done. Going for strolls in the middle of an urgent work breaks continuity and an individual tends to loose his focus. Individuals who kill time at work find it difficult to survive workplace stress.
- Do include time for your tea breaks, net surfing, personal calls and so on in your daily schedule. It is important. Human being is not a machine who can work at a stretch for eight to nine hours. Assign half an hour to fourty five minutes to check updates on social networking sites, call your friends or family or go for smoke breaks etc.
- Set realistic and achievable targets for yourself. Know what you need to achieve and in what duration? Do not lie to yourself. Assigning one hour to a task which you yourself know would require much more time does not make sense.
- Do not overburden yourself. Say a firm no to your boss if you feel you would not be able to complete a certain assignment within the assigned deadline. Don't worry, he will not feel bad. Probably he can assign the same to any of your fellow workers. Accept tasks which you are really confident about.
- Be disciplined and punctual. Avoid taking unnecessary leaves from work unless there is an emergency. Reach work on time as it helps you to plan your day better.
- Keep things at their proper places. Files must be kept at their respective drawers. Staple important documents and put them in a proper folder. Learn to be a little more organized. It will save your time which goes on unnecessary searching.
- Do not treat your organization as a mere source of money. Change your attitude. Avoid playing games on computer or cell phones during office hours. It is unprofessional. Do not work only when your boss is around. Taking ownership of work pays you in the long run.
- Develop the habit of using an organizer. It helps you plan things better. Keep a notepad and a pen handy. Do not write contact numbers or email ids on loose papers. You will
waste half of your time searching them. Manage your emails. Create separate folders for each client. Do not clutter your desktop.

\section*{CHAPTER 4: PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Healthcare financing}

Healthcare financing refers to the "function of a health system concerned with the mobilization, accumulation and allocation of money to cover the health needs of the people, individually and collectively, in the health system.

The purpose of health financing is to make funding available, as well as to set the right financial incentives to providers, to ensure that all individuals have access to effective public health and personal health care"

Health financing is fundamental to the ability of health systems to maintain and improve human welfare.

At the extreme, without the necessary funds no health workers would be employed, no medicines would be available and no health promotion or prevention would take place.

However, financing is much more than a simple generation of funds.
To understand the nature of indicators that can be used to monitor and evaluate health systems financing requires explicit assessment of what it is expected to achieve.

As a result, the financing system is often divided conceptually into three inter-related functions
(i) revenue collection,
(ii) fund pooling, and
(iii) purchasing/provision of services.

According to the WHO framework for health systems, a well-functioning health system ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines and technologies of assured quality, safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness, and their scientifically sound and cost-effective use.

To achieve these objectives, the following are needed:
- national policies, standards, guidelines and regulations that support policy;
- information on prices, the status of international trade agreements and the capacity to set and negotiate prices;
- reliable manufacturing practices when they exist in-country and quality assessment of priority products;
- procurement, supply and storage, and distribution systems that minimize leakage and other waste; and
- support for rational use of medicines, commodities and equipment, through guidelines and strategies to assure adherence, reduce resistance, maximize patient safety and training.

The purpose of health financing is to make funding available, as well as to set the right financial incentives to providers, to ensure that all individuals have access to effective public health and personal health care.

Different countries have adopted different health financing mechanisms depending on factors such as:
- the economic basis or policy of the country where high-income countries are more likely to have Social Health Insurance.
- Ideologies: neo-liberal ideologies tend to favour out of pocket spending
- International pressure also plays a significant role where for instance bodies such as the World Bank may advocate particular funding mechanisms.

Nonetheless, no country has a single funding mechanism and hence the overall health system is funded through a mixed approach. Where there is mandatory health insurance, there are also other funding mechanisms such as donor funding, general tax revenue, payroll deductions etcetera.

Kenya has a mixed health financing system consisting of revenue collected by government through taxes, mandatory health insurance (NHIF), private health insurance, out of pocket payments and donor funding.

\section*{SOURCES OF HEALTHCARE FINANCING}

\section*{Public Sources of healthcare financing.}

This is generally achieved either through tax-based funding or mandatory health insurance. The tax-based system is more common in high income countries where healthcare is funded through general tax revenue.

This ensures comprehensive cover for the general population since it includes even those not in the formal sector and equity is attained where progressive tax mechanisms are applied i.e. tax is paid according to income.

In Africa, the 2001 Abuja declaration urged African Union countries to allocate at least $15 \%$ of their national budgets to the health sector. However, most countries have less than $10 \%$ of total government expenditure devoted to healthcare with only 3 countries namely Tanzania, DRC and Mozambique having above $15 \%$ of government expenditure devoted to healthcare.

Mandatory health insurance refers to where there is a legal requirement for particular groups of the population to become members such as those in formal employment. In Africa, Kenya is one of the few countries that has implemented mandatory health insurance through the National Hospital Insurance Fund which was developed in 1966. Initially, it covered formal sector employees and their dependents only but it was expanded in 1998 to cover informal sector workers as well. Membership is mandatory to all formal sector workers and voluntary for informal sector workers. Those employed in the formal sector are subjected to income rated monthly contributions deducted from their income whereas those in the informal sector pay a flat rate contribution directly to NHIF.

\section*{Private sources of healthcare financing.}

This forms the largest proportion of health financing in most developing countries. Private health financing includes out of pocket spending by individuals and households, private health insurance, community-based insurance and donor funding.

Most health systems in Africa are funded primarily through out-of-pocket spending which can result into catastrophic health spending, i.e. a large proportion of the household income is spent seeking healthcare hence foregoing other goods and services. This impacts negatively on living standards where poor households are pushed further into poverty. Kenyans are becoming poorer due to high healthcare payments. Most households spend over a tenth of their budget on healthcare payments each year. The burden is highest among the poor who spent a third of their household hold expenditure on healthcare and studies report that about 1.48 million Kenyans are pushed below the national poverty line yearly as a result.

Private health insurance is where individuals arrange medical cover through insurance schemes and pay a regular premium based on different factors. There is a likelihood of a stratified healthcare system where the type of medical cover depends on ability to pay premiums with those who can afford to pay high premiums enjoying greater benefits. Most of these schemes are also tied to employment. Most developing countries including Kenya, rely heavily on donor funding in the form of grants, loans, either in kind or in cash, technical assistance, free drugs, etc.

\section*{User fees}

The term user fee relates to a charge made to the patient or user of the health service, tor treatment or service received. The fee might be for consultation, drugs and dressings, and diagnostic tests.

Fees are commonly charged for curative services since people are generally more willing to pay for a cure in the form of, say, drugs, than for promotive or preventive services.

\section*{Prepayment (insurance)}

Prepayment (insurance) schemes operate to provide health care only for people who are members of the scheme. In order to join, it is necessary to make regular payment of a predetermined sum, which means that people pay whether they are healthy or not.

This payment entitles a person to receive health care for little or no extra charge when it is required. A major advantage of such form of health care financing is that the costs are shared between sick and healthy people.

Direct transfers and grants refer to the provision of a quantity of resources, whether money or supplies, which does not have to be repaid. The quantity of the transfer or grant will usually have to be re-negotiated in advance and it might be a regular payment or a one-off gift. The choice of financing methods will depend upon what it is hoped to be achieved with the health programme

\section*{HEALTH PROPOSAL}

A health proposal is a plan which deals with information about a government or non-government agency's proposition on general health or specific health-related issues which is meant to be implemented later.

Healthcare is an important issue in these times and comprises one of the most debated topics in today's politics. Some private agencies also issue out their health proposal to study the effects of a particular illness and how it can be eliminated.

A health proposal must ensure proper representation of the pros and cons of the scheme and must be approved of by higher authorities.

\section*{BUDGETING}

\section*{What Is a Budget?}

A budget is a written projection of a particular department's financial performance, a specific project, a business unit, or an organization for the period under consideration.

Bbudgets for businesses or departments created for an accounting period, i.e., for one year.
However, the period could be less or more than a year.
Complete flexibility is there as the method remains the same, and the business can make or plan a budget for the period they want.

There are different types of budgets and, thus, budgeting methodologies.

\section*{What is Budgeting?}

Primarily, the activity of preparing a budget is called budgeting. In many organizations, it is a separate department taking care of only the preparation and implementation of budgets.

\section*{Importance of Budgeting}

In the business world, we can not afford to overstate the importance of a budget. At every stage of decision making, planning, and coordination budgets or plans are the essential tools for budgeting.

The benefits of budgeting should never be underestimated when running a business:
- budgeting estimates revenue, plans expenditure and restricts any spending that is not part of the plan
- budgeting ensures that money is allocated to those things that support the strategic objectives of the business
- a well communicated budget helps everyone understand the priorities of the business
- the process of creating a budget provides opportunities to involve staff, resulting in them sharing the organisation's vision; and
- engaging the team in reviewing and comparing the budget with actuals can provide information that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the business.

\section*{Types of Budgets}

\section*{Master Budget}

The master budget is the sum total of the company's budget that includes the allocation of funds to different activities of the business. It evaluates the cost centres within the organization and allocates funds by including different factors. The master budget is developed by including different factors like sales, working capital, operating expenses, income sources, etc. This budget ensures that the managers are working in line with the goals and objectives of the business.

\section*{Operating Budget}

Operating budget of the business involves costs related to the operational activities. The costs include production cost, overhead cost, manufacturing cost, labour cost, administrative cost, working capital, etc. The income flow includes the sales of the business.

Operating budgets are prepared considering all the above factors. This budget can be on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or even yearly basis. The operating budget ensures that the managers know their scope of work in proportion to the amount of funds allocated to the department. On this basis, the evaluation of a manager's performance is possible.

\section*{Financial Budget}

A business is always in need of short term, medium-term and long-term funds. The financial budget ensures that the right types of funds are available whenever they are required. The aim of this budget is to manage the outflows with the inflows. The outflow is in the form of expenses and inflow is in the form of sales. Decisions like mergers and acquisitions depend on the financial budgets of the organizations. If the business has the desire to take over any company, its financial budget shall determine the value up to which the business can quote for acquiring another organization. In simple words, the financial budget describes the financial health of the business.

\section*{Cash Flow Budget}

Cash flow budget is more about managing the cash of the business. The cash flow budget determines whether the accounts payable and accounts receivable are dealt with timely. It ensures that the inflow of the cash is regular and timely. This budget is important as it helps the managers to determine the period of cash shortage and accordingly take necessary action towards it. Cash flow budget also enables the business to know whether it would be able to handle new projects efficiently or not.

\section*{Static Budget}

A static budget is one that remains the same even after the change in the factors that affect the budget preparation. A company that is seeing a constant drop or rise in sales may not change its budget allocation as it follows a static budget. Static budget presumes the input, output values of
the future period and based on that allocation of resources is done. The results of the presumption of static budgets are very different from the actual outcome.

\section*{BUDGETING METHODS / TECHNIQUES}

Mostly, budget preparation follows one of these methods. Listed below are the most popular types of business budgeting methods.
1. Traditional
2. Incremental
3. Zero-Based
4. Activity-Based

\section*{What is Traditional Budgeting Method?}

Traditional budgeting is a budget preparation method that considers last year's budget as the base. The current year's budget is prepared by making changes to the previous year's budget by adjusting the expenses on the basis of the inflation rate, consumer demand, market situation, etc. The basis of the preparation of current year's budget is last year's revenues and costs. Only those items in traditional budgets need to be justified which are over and above the last year's budget. This technique is easy to prepare and implement, barring some amount of rigidity as budgets, once prepared, cannot change.

To have a detailed understanding of the method and its advantages and disadvantages, visit - Traditional Budgeting.

\section*{What is Incremental Budgeting Method?}

Incremental budgeting is a method where the executives prepare the current year's budget by making changes in the past year's budget. The changes are in the form of addition or reduction of expenses to last year's budget. In Incremental budgeting, the starting point for preparing a budget is the prior period's budget. The budgeting technique gives no priority to the vital activities of a business. We simply adjust last year's budget, considering the inflation factor. This is a quick and easy method of preparing budgets.

For a detailed understanding of the advantages and disadvantages visit - Incremental Budgeting,

\section*{What is Zero-Based Budgeting Method?}

Zero-based budgeting method is commonly in use by many organizations. In ZBB, the current year's budget preparation begins from scratch, without considering the budget of the previous year. For every financial period, a new budget is prepared to take the base as zero, and resources allocated to each department is justified according to the expenses of that particular period. The ranking for allocation of resources is on the basis of the priority of all the activities of the business. Though this method is time-consuming, it gives accurate results.

To have a detailed understanding of the method and its pros and cons visit - Zero Based Budgeting

\section*{What is Activity Based Budgeting Method?}

Activity-based budgeting is a method where the output or the budget targets or activity is decided first. In other words, here, the management adopts a top-down approach. After defining and determining the activities, what all cost drivers required to complete that activity, target, or output is analyzed. And then a budget is prepared after considering all those cost drivers.

It does not take into account last year's budget or expenses. This method does an in-depth analysis of all the activities that incur the cost. The outcome of the research determines the allocation of resources to an activity. This method aligns business activities with business goals. It helps in increasing the efficiency and profitability of a business.

To have a detailed understanding of the method and its advantages and disadvantages visit - Activity Based Budgeting

\section*{Choosing a Method of Budgeting}

All the above-stated budgeting methodologies or techniques are relevant and suitable for all kinds of businesses and can be used by all. However, to get the maximum advantage of the entire budgeting process, a company needs to compare and meticulously choose which budgeting technique will be most suitable or fits right into the organization.

\section*{Factors Responsible}

The decision to select a particular method depends on various factors like
- size of the business,
- area of operations of a company,
- the focus of the business,
- competition in the industry,
- market situation,
- complexity and
- availability of data for projections, etc.

\section*{FINANCIAL PROCEDURES AND MECHANISMS}

Financial procedures are a collection of statements that describe how to handle funds in a financial organization. Financial procedures outline how to handle financial practices for things like:
- Receiving and endorsing checks
- Documenting cash and preparing cash receipts
- Storing deposit and withdrawal slips
- Training staff and volunteers on following financial policies
- Authorizing people to open accounts, sign checks, etc.
- Borrowing funds and establishing lines of credit
- Detailing prohibited financial practices
- Handling online payments, petty cash, credit cards, and debit cards

A financial mechanism refers to the way in which a business, organization, or program receives the funding necessary for it to remain operational. Private companies, for example, typically receive such funding through a variety of means, including revenue generated from the sale of services and products as well as from loans or the sale of stock.

\section*{WHAT ARE FINANCIAL CONTROLS?}

Financial controls are the procedures, policies, and means by which an organization monitors and controls the direction, allocation, and usage of its financial resources

\section*{Importance of Financial Controls}

\section*{1. Cash flow maintenance}

Efficient financial control measures contribute significantly to the cash flow maintenance of an organization. When an effective control mechanism is in place, the overall cash inflows and outflows are monitored and planned, which results in efficient operations.

\section*{2. Resource management}

The financial resources of an organization are at the very core of any organization's operational efficiency. Financial resources make available all other resources needed for operating a business. Hence, financial resource management crucial in order to manage all other resources. Effective financial control measures hence are crucial to ensure resource management in an organization.

\section*{3. Operational efficiency}

An effective financial control mechanism ensures overall operational efficiency in an organization.

\section*{4. Profitability}

Ensuring an organization's overall operational efficiency leads to the smooth functioning of every organizational department. It, in turn, increases productivity. which comes with a direct, positive relationship with profitability. Hence, establishing effective financial control measures ensures improved profitability of any business.

\section*{5. Fraud prevention}

Financial control serves as a preventative measure against fraudulent activities in an organization. It can help prevent any undesirable activities such as employee fraud, online theft, and many others by monitoring the inflow and outflow of financial resources.

\section*{Examples of Financial Controls}

\section*{1. Overall financial management and implementation}
- Placing certain qualification restrictions and employing only certified, qualified financial managers and staff working with the formulation and implementation of financial management policies
- Establishing an efficient, direct chain of communication among the accounting staff, financial managers, and senior-level managers, including the CFO
- Periodic training sessions and information sessions among accounting staff, etc. to ensure being updated with the changing laws and evolving business environment concerning business finance
- Periodic, thorough financial analysis and evaluation of financial ratios and statements wherever fluctuations are significant
- Delegation of financial duties in a segregated and hierarchical fashion in order to establish a chain of operation and efficiency via specialization

\section*{2. Cash inflows}
- Stringent credit reporting policy for all customers before entering into a creditor-debtor relationship with them
- Periodic reconciliation of bank statements to the general ledger in addition to annual reporting for more efficient financial control
- Establishing a periodic review policy with all existing customers that the business establishes a creditor-debtor relationship with. It ensures the ongoing creditworthiness of customers and eliminates the probability of bad debts
- Support files and backups for all financial data in a separate secured database with access only permitted to senior management staff

\section*{3. Cash outflows}
- Automatic/subscription payments to be monitored and requiring proper authorization in order to control extravagant business expenditure
- Maintaining a vendor database with detailed purchase records with restricted access in order to monitor cash outflow efficiently
- Periodic reconciliation of bank statements to the general ledger
- Clear and precise expense reimbursement policy to be maintained, including detailed expense reports and receipt verifications in order to curb extravagant business expenses and employee fraud

\section*{COMPENSATION STRATEGIES}

Defining a compensation strategy is an important activity for all companies, including start-ups. The compensation strategy must be affordable, structured and reasonably competitive.

Your compensation strategy must be structured to best meet your unique business circumstances. As a start-up, you may not be able to compete with large companies on salary. Therefore, you should consider a combination of options to attract and retain key employees.

Do not underestimate the value of the advantages or perquisites that your company has to offer that may not be readily available in larger companies-opportunities for interesting work, lack of hierarchy, flexible environment, and so on.

Some people are motivated by the desire to be on the leading edge of scientific or technological advances. They may take less pay to work for a start-up if they believe in its future and the work it has to offer.

\section*{Salary and wages}

A salary (or wage) is a fixed amount paid in exchange for an employee's services. Ontario Employment Standards legislation entitles most employees to receive a "minimum wage" in exchange for the work they complete for a company.

For full-time employees, salary is generally described in annual, monthly, bi-weekly or weekly amounts. For part-time employees, it is generally described as an hourly amount.

To determine an appropriate salary and/or salary range that your company is willing to pay for a position, you must:
- Establish the value of the position based on your organizational requirements
- Understand what the market is paying for a similar position

\section*{Allowances}

An allowance is a fixed amount received by a salaried employee from his employer to meet specified needs or expense other than his/her basic salary. The allowance amount is calculated on the basic salary of the employee. According to the law, the basic pay will be $\mathbf{3 0 \%}$ to $\mathbf{6 0 \%}$ of the salary.

Resource mobilization Resource mobilization is the process by which an organization acquires and manages the financial, human and logistical resources it needs to fulfill its mission.

\section*{Why is resource mobilization so important?}

Resource mobilization is critical to any organization for the following reasons:
1. Ensures the continuation of your organization's service provision to clients
2. Supports organizational sustainability
3. Allows for improvement and scale-up of products and services the organization currently provides
4. Organizations, both in the public and private sector, must be in the business of generating new business to stay in business

\section*{What Is Resource Management?}

Resource management is the practice of planning, scheduling, and allocating people, money, and technology to a project or program. In essence, it is the process of allocating resources to achieve the greatest organizational value. Good resource management results in the right resources being available at the right time for the right work.

\section*{What are the advantages to resource management?}
1. Avoids unforeseen hiccups: By understanding your resources upfront and planning how to use them, you can troubleshoot gaps or problems before they happen.
2. Prevents burnout: Effective resource management allows you to avoid "overallocation" or "dependency" of resources by gaining insight into your team's workload.
3. Provides a safety net: Let's say the project was not successful due to lack of resources (it happens). Resource planning and management establishes that you did everything you could with what you had.
4. Builds transparency: Other teams can gain visibility into your team's bandwidth, and plan accordingly if your team is at maximum capacity or available to take on new projects.
5. Measures efficiency: With a high-level understanding of what's needed to manage and execute an upcoming project, you can effectively plan and measure ROI and utilization vs efficiency.
6. Minimize project resource costs significantly

With enterprise-wide visibility, resource managers can utilize cost-effective global resources from low-cost locations. Having the right mix of local and global resources helps in reducing project costs. Allocating the right resource for the right project enables
them to complete the delivery within time and budget. Resource managers can control costs by distributing key resources uniformly across all projects instead of a high-priority project.
7. Improving effective/billable resource utilization

Resource management software helps managers forecast the workforce's utilization in advance. Accordingly, resources can be mobilized from non-billable to billable and strategic work. Sometimes when resources are rolled off from projects, there isn't any suitable work to engage them. So, eventually, these resources end up on the bench. Resource managers can initially engage these resources in non-billable work before quickly assigning them to suitable billable/strategic projects
8. Use scarce resources effectively in a matrix organization
9. The resource management process brings transparency in communication and hence facilitates to effectively share highly skilled resources in a matrix organization. The scarce resources can be utilized across different projects rather than one high-priority project. The shared services model will also form teams cutting across multiple geographies for $24 * 7$ support operations.
10. Monitor and improve organization health index

Employees look up to their leaders for their professional development. Failing to motivate and provide career development opportunities will predominantly lead to reduced engagement, productivity, and unplanned attrition. Regular monitoring of their skills and performances is beneficial to help them improve and add more value to the organization. Let's dive deep into the major components and concepts of resource management,

\section*{ROLE OF PARLIAMENT IN FINANCIAL RESOURCE.}

In Kenya the Legislature (Parliament) has three critical functions with regard to Public Finance.
These are;
1. Revenue mobilization (imposition of taxes and borrowing).
2. Allocation of resources.
3. Supervisory function.

Under the Constitution, Exchequer and Audit Act, and respective tax laws, only Parliament can impose taxes and authorize public borrowing. However, in practice there are serious Constitutional restrictions on parliamentary ability to act. Parliament is further inhibited by other factors such as budgetary traditions and practices which allow for delegation of powers on taxation with very limited reporting. Other factors inhibiting the role of Parliament include lack of technical capacity to quickly scrutinize finance data, conduct analysis and make pertinent conclusions.

\section*{Tax Law.}

Once Parliament passes the tax law, the only time it ever gets involved again is when the Audit Report is filed, which can be as long as three years later. The debt situation is even worse since Parliament does not get involved at all in scrutinizing domestic borrowing. Indeed, there is no Constitutional or legal requirement for the local debt to finance approved expenditures or any expenditures. There is also no limit on how much the minister can borrow locally. It is up to the minister to decide how much to borrow, at what terms and for what purpose.

\section*{External borrowing.}

On external borrowing, there are only two soft conditions. First, there is a ceiling on how much government can borrow, which is a flat amount, and second, the external funds should be used to finance approved expenditures. However, here too there is no requirement to ensure productive investments or cost effectiveness in external borrowing. As the law stands, the minister can borrow and spend before seeking Parliamentary approval as long as he submits supplementary estimates later. Under the Constitution, Parliament is empowered to authorize spending public funds to meet various public purposes.

\section*{Supervisory function.}

As regards supervisory function, this is performed on the basis of audits and reports of the Controller and Auditor General. Looking at the records of deliberations of Parliament, it is obvious that the supervisory role is limited to linking Parliamentary approval to release of funds. It does not relate to quality of expenditure or realization of results. In other words, the audits
simply answer the question whether or not the money was spent for the purposes approved by Parliament and if the necessary procedures were followed in release and spending of funds.

As long as these two conditions are fulfilled, the expenditure is considered to be in order, whether the money could have been better used to e.g buy medical supplies instead of buying Mercedes Benz cars for the executive. As a result, the whole process of public finance management has not been managed in a manner which can enhance the public good.

\section*{Enhancing the role of Parliament in public finance.}

Parliament is one of the three branches of government, which include the executives and the Judiciary. Of these three, only Parliament is empowered to impose taxes or allocate public resources. All other persons and institutions with powers to collect taxes or spend public money do so on the basis of delegated authority.

To achieve national objectives, tax policies and tax administration should not serve vested interests. Writers on public finance have advocated for observations of principles of;
1. Efficiency.
2. Equity.
3. Stability.
4. Neutrality.
5. Predictability, in matters of taxation and public expenditure.

These principles are necessary to enable the public assess effectiveness of fiscal policies and also encourage managers of public affairs to be accountable, for what they do, how they do it, and finally ensure that they conduct public affairs transparently. Unfortunately, this is not the case with fiscal policies in Kenya, neither accountable nor transparent.

\section*{Taxation and other charges.}

Parliament imposes taxes and allocates money to benefit the public. If the tax is paid and the money spent but the desired results are not achieved, the responsibility should be on Parliament to find out why. Therefore, Parliament has to ensure proper collection of taxes and spending of public funds. It is therefore incumbent on Parliament to require that budget execution be monitored and performance audits conducted to assess achievement of results. On this matter, Parliament should face no hindrances.

\section*{Preparation of annual estimates.}

The Minister for finance is required to prepare annual estimates of revenue and expenditures and lay them before Parliament. The expenditures are required to be prepared in separate votes. But as regards revenues, the Constitution does not require any form of presentation, as to the source. Therefore, it cannot be over-emphasized that budget preparation and execution is solely a responsibility of the executive. Parliamentary role is confined to approval, monitoring, and evaluating results.

To ensure proper budgeting;
- The Constitution should ensure Parliament has enough time to consider budget proposals.
- Correct the current straightjacket arrangement which make complying with the timeframe (a formality), more important than Parliamentary input into the budget.

NB: It is essential to note that once the tax is imposed, the amount payable becomes public money. Any person who gives such money away dispenses public funds and needs to be accountable.

\section*{Corruption and protection of public property.}

Corruption and misuse of public property, especially money, causes underdevelopment and rising poverty. These types of instances are well documented in Parliamentary committee reports, where public money and other properties, have been converted into private property. To protect public resources, the Constitution should entrench and institutionalize modalities:
1. For fighting corruption.
2. Enjoin every Kenyan citizen to protect and preserve public property, including money.
3. Enjoin every Kenyan citizen to combat and expose corruption, misuse, theft and waste of public funds and other property.
4. Provide that any transfer of public funds to private ownership which does not follow the law and procedures to be null and void.

If this is done every Kenyan will have a duty and responsibility to protect public resources and where the situation warrants, go to court without hindrances.

Financial management concept for health care.
1. Health care must be safe - This means safety must be a property of the system. No one should ever be harmed by health care.
2. Health care must be effective - It should match science, with neither under use nor overuse of the best available techniques.
3. Health care should be patient centered - The individual patients culture, social, context and specific needs deserve respect and the patient should play an active role in making decisions about his or her own care.
4. Health care should be timely - Prompt attention benefits both the patient and care givers.
5. The health care system should be efficient, constantly seeking to reduce the waste This is cost of supplies, equipment, space, capital ideas, time and opportunities.
6. Health care should be equitable - Race, ethnicity, gender and income should not prevent anyone in the world from receiving high quality health care.

\section*{OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL.}

According to the Constitution of Kenya;
(1) There shall be an Auditor-General who shall be nominated by the President and, with the approval of the National Assembly, appointed by the President.
(2) To be qualified to be the Auditor-General, a person shall have extensive knowledge of public finance or at least ten years experience in auditing or public finance management.
(3) The Auditor-General holds office, subject to Article 251, for a term of eight years and shall not be eligible for re-appointment.

\section*{Roles.}

The Auditor-General's roles under the Kenyan constitution are:
Within six months after the end of each financial year, the Auditor-General shall audit and report, in respect of that financial year, on:
1. Accounts of the national and county governments.
2. Accounts of all funds and authorities of the national and county governments.
3. Accounts of all courts.
4. Accounts of every commission and independent office established by the Constitution.
5. The accounts of the National Assembly, the Senate and the county assemblies.
6. Accounts of political parties funded from public funds.
7. The public debt.
8. Accounts of any other entity that legislation requires the Auditor-General to audit.
9. The Auditor-General may audit and report on the accounts of any entity that is funded from public funds.
10. An audit report shall confirm whether or not public money has been applied lawfully and in an effective way.
11. Audit reports shall be submitted to Parliament or the relevant county assembly.
12. Within three months after receiving an audit report, Parliament or the county assembly shall debate and consider the report and take appropriate action.

\section*{HEALTH CARE FINANCING COMMITTEE (HCF).}

The health sector in Kenya relies on several sources of funding:
1. Public (government).
2. Private firms.
3. Households and donors (including faith based organizations and NGOs).
4. Health insurance schemes.

Unfortunately, limitations in implementing an overall healthcare financing strategy have hindered effective planning, budgeting and provision of health services.

\section*{Role of the HCF committee.}

To make the voice of the private sector present in the health and population policy making process in Kenya, through bringing providers together and enable them to speak with a unified voice on health financing issues.

\section*{HCF terms of reference (TORs).}
1. To engage the Government on Health care Financing Challenges.
2. To represent Kenya Health Financing (KHF) in public sector forums, I.e. Ministerial Stakeholders Forum (MSF) and Presidential Roundtable (PRT).

Currently the four healthcare issues that are priority in the PRT are;
- High Maternal and Infant mortality rates.
- High cost of healthcare access due to tax on medical equipment.
- Lack of a Comprehensive Health Financing Strategy.
- Shortage of Healthcare Personnel (HR development).
3. To engage relevant Stakeholders in issues Surrounding NHIF.
4. To engage regularly with the government in providing input to finalise the Healthcare Financing Strategy.
5. Engage on alternative models of Health care financing.
6. Review regulations appropriate with the healthcare financing environment including the possibility of establishing Health Basics Regulatory Authority (HBRA).
7. Engage the counties in Health care financing issues.

\section*{Financial Accounting systems and mechanisms}

Financial accounting is a branch of accounting that deals with the process of recording, summarizing and reporting of the entity's financial transactions.

The objective is to record, prepare and present financial information systematically to be able to ascertain the financial results of the entity for a given accounting period.

Thus, financial accounting involves the reporting of accurate, reliable and timely information of the entity's operating profit and financial position to its various stakeholders.

A financial mechanism refers to the way in which a business, organization, or program receives the funding necessary for it to remain operational. Private companies, for example, typically receive such funding through a variety of means, including revenue generated from the sale of services and products as well as from loans or the sale of stock.

\section*{Financial Accounting Objectives}

The main objectives of Financial Accounting are to:
- Keep a systematic record of financial transactions
- Protect business properties from unjustified and unwarranted use
- Ascertain the net profit earned or net loss incurred on account of carrying out business operations during a particular accounting period
- Determine what the business owns, what it owes and whether it will be able to meet its obligations in the near future
- Provide systematized information to the stakeholders
- Facilitate both the internal as well as the external stakeholders in making rational decisions

\section*{1. Cash Memo:}

Sales and purchases are the main features of any business enterprise. For recording cash sales and cash purchases, cash memos serve as source documents. Cash memo is a source document in which all transactions pertaining to cash sales or purchases are to be recorded.

When goods are purchased by a business enterprise on cash basis then the firm receives cash memo and when a business enterprise sells goods, it gives cash memo, in which all details of the transaction relating to the purchase or sales viz. number or quantity purchased/sold, price, discount received or allowed and sales tax collected or deposited are provided. On the basis of cash memos, these transactions are then recorded in the book of accounts. In audit, the foremost duty of the auditor is to verify the cash book with reference to the cash vouchers.

\section*{2. Invoice and Bill:}

Invoice or bill records the credit transactions related to sale or purchase. This is prepared when a firm purchases or sells the goods on credit. At the time, when the goods are sold by the business enterprise on credit, sales invoice is prepared in which all details of the credit sales viz. the quantity, rate and total amount etc. are mentioned.

Usually, invoices are made in duplicate, the main copy (original) is sent to the purchaser and the another is kept by the business enterprise for record and future reference. Similarly, when goods
are purchased on credit, the supplier prepares the invoice in duplicate. When the main copy is received by the purchaser, it becomes a bill.

\section*{3. Receipt:}

Receipt is an evidence of making the payment on account of any business transaction. This source document is prepared for showing the proof of giving any cash to the party (who receives the cash) on account of any business transaction. At least two copies are made of any receipt.

The original copy is prepared for giving it to the party who makes the payment and another copy is kept for record. The details about the business transaction on account of which the cash is received viz. date, amount, name of the party and the nature of payment etc. are given in this source document.

\section*{4. Pay in Slip:}

This document serves the purpose of providing an evidence that on particular date, a specific amount has been deposited in the bank. When a depositor deposits money in the bank account, he fills up a form provided by the bank containing the information about the date, amount to be deposited and the name of the depositor etc.

The bank clerk signs, stamps the counterfoil of the pay in slip and returns it to the depositor. Usually, the large business enterprises obtain the complete bunch of pay-in-slips and get them all bound in a book. The counterfoil of the pay in slip becomes a source document, which acts as an evidence for the customer to record this transaction in the books of accounts.

\section*{5. Cheque:}

A cheque in an unconditional order, drawn upon a specified hanker, signed by the maker, directing the banker to pay on demand a certain sum of money only to the order of a person or the bearer of the instrument. -Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881

A cheque is an instrument drawn upon a banker and payable on demand. The bank issues a booklet containing cheque forms to its account holders. Digits mentioned on the bottom of the cheques denote code of 'State', 'Bank', 'Branch', ‘Cheque' and 'Type of Account' respectively.

Through cheques, payment can be made to a specific person by writing the name of the party after the words 'Pay' and by striking off the word 'bearer' with a line printed on the cheque. In this case cheque is called an order cheque. To avoid any fraud, cheques are crossed by drawing two parallel transverse lines across the cheque. Sometimes the words '\& Co', 'A/C Payee Only', 'Not Negotiable' or 'Name of the Bank' is written within these lines.

In that case, cheque becomes a crossed cheque. Payment against crossed cheque cannot be received simply by producing the cheque. Crossed cheque has to be first deposited in the bank account of the account-holder in whose favour cheque is drawn and only through his account, payment can be withdrawn.

Payment can also be made to any person who bears and presents the cheque. In that case, cheque is called a bearer cheque. A cheque is signed by the drawer mentioning the amount and name of the party to whom payment is to be made. Concerned person can get it encashed directly. The account-holder can also withdraw the money from his account-by writing the word 'Self'.

\section*{6. Debit Note:}

A debit note is a document which shows that the business enterprise has raised debit against the party to whom this document is sent in respect of any business transaction other than the credit sale. Business enterprise may make a debit note against the supplier for an amount which is to be recovered from him, when the business enterprise returns some goods which are defective in nature or not as per specifications.

A debit note can also be prepared in case of overpayment to any party. In this document, all details about the date and amount of transaction, the name of the party whose account is debited along with reason for debiting his account are mentioned.

\section*{7. Credit Note:}

A credit note is a document which shows that the business enterprise has given the credit to the party to whom this document is sent in respect of any business transaction other than credit purchase. When a business enterprise receives back the goods sold earlier then it makes a credit note in favour of the purchaser showing that his account has been credited in the books of business enterprise.

A credit note can also be prepared in case of less payment to any party. In this document, all details about the date and amount of transaction, the name of the party whose account is credited along with reason for crediting his account are mentioned. To distinguish it from a debit note, it is commonly prepared in red ink.

\section*{8. Vouchers:}

The documents prepared for the purpose of recording business transactions in the books of accounts are known as vouchers. Voucher is prepared on the basis of source documents. For recording business transactions in the books of accounts, source documents are further analyzed and conclusion is drawn as to which account is to be debited and which account is to be credited. The document on which this conclusion is written is known as voucher or accounting voucher.

\section*{CHAPTER FIVE: COMMODITIES AND SUPPLIES MANAGEMENT}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Material management is a scientific technique, concerned with planning, organizing and controlling the flow of materials from their initial purchase through internal operations to the service point through distribution.
- The material management in the health care system is concerned with providing the drugs, supplies and equipment needed by health personnel to deliver health services..
- About 40 percent of the funds in the health care system are used up for providing materials.
- It is of great importance that materials of right quality are supplied to the consumers

\section*{OBJECTIVES OF PROCUREMENT SYSTEM}

Acquire needed supplies as inexpensively as possible
Obtain high quality supplies
Assure prompt and dependable delivery
Distribute the procurement workload to avoid period of idleness and overwork
Optimize inventory management through scientific procurement procedures
Supply chain management is the handling of the entire production flow of a good or service, starting from the raw components all the way to delivering the final product to the consumer.
- Supply Chain management is the act of identifying, acquiring, and managing resources and suppliers that are essential to the operations of an organization.
- It includes the purchase of physical goods, information, services, and any other necessary resources that enable a company to continue operating and growing.
- The main goals of supply management are cost control, the efficient allocation of resources, risk management, and the effective gathering of information for business decisions.

Supply chain refers to the processes that are involved in moving the products from the supplier to consumers. It is a network of organizations, people, resources, activities and information involved in upstream and downstream. Supply chain management (SCM) is the process of handling the flow of goods or services. The activities involved from acquiring raw materials to the final delivery of the product to consumers come under SCM. Supply chain
management minimize the waste, cost and time consumed in the production process.

\section*{Principles of supply chain management}

\section*{1. Adapt Supply Chain to Customer's Needs}

The businesses and supply chain professionals understand customer's needs. Customers are divided into different groups called 'segments' in order to understand them better. On the basis of sales volume or profitability, the primitive way to segment customer is ABC analysis. It can also be done by product, trade channel and industry. Anticipating the customer's needs is also very important. Once the needs of the customers are anticipated, the supply chain should be aligned to cater to the needs.

\section*{2. Customize Logistics Network}

After the segmentation of the customers based on different requirements, SCM managers have to tailor logistics networks to serve different segments. The SCM manager has to prioritize the deliveries and make suitable provisions to quickly distribute those goods that are marked as urgent.

\section*{3. Align Demand Planning Across Supply Chain}

Supply chain professionals are trained to share data with trading partners in order to avoid the unnecessary stock. The demand data must be used wisely by the SCM managers.

\section*{4. Differentiate Products Close to Customers}

Standardization and differentiation are two completely opposite things. Some cosmetic companies manufacture only item that can be sold throughout Asia country. Due to the economy of the sales, standardization can drastically bring down the cost.

\section*{5. Outsources Strategically}

Though outsourcing is all the rage, the managers must outsource strategically. The core expertise should not be outsourced ever. This principle stands the test of time.

\section*{6. Develop IT that Support Multi-Level Decision Making}

The IT projects should not be done in isolation and before IT projects, the business process reengineering should be done. This provides a proper understanding of process insufficiencies and helps to determine the kind of innovation needed.

\section*{7. Adapt Both Services and Financial Metrics}

The activity-based costing ( ABC ) is applied to determine the customer's profitability. It is even better to exploit Time Driven Activity Based Costing in order to understand changes in activities, process, product and customers.

\section*{WHAT IS THE PROCUREMENT CYCLE?}

The procurement cycle (or procurement process) is the transition of events that make up the process of procuring goods. An efficient procurement process is critical to the financial efficiency of any business as it aids in paying the right price for goods and services, minimises delivery times, and helps you choose the best partners to work with your business.

Whether you're initiating a new process from scratch, or you feel that you need to reassess existing procurement procedures, below are seven crucial steps in the procurement life cycle.

\section*{1. Identify required goods or services}

The procurement process starts with the need to obtain goods or services from an outsourced company. These goods or services can be internal (meaning any materials required to run the business) or external (materials that the business will eventually sell). This stage, therefore, involves assessing the needs of each department and setting a budget.

For example, if a clothing manufacturer were starting out, they'd use this stage to outline how many and what type of embroidery machines they'd need. Or, if a larger clothing company were expanding, they'd return to this stage to determine what equipment they required to meet customer demand.

\section*{2. Consider a list of suppliers}

This stage involves sourcing suppliers and determining their ability to provide the best quality and value for goods or services. While this stage seems straightforward, it is vital to find reputable vendors with which whom you can develop a long-term bilateral partnership.

Best practice in this area is known as strategic procurement, which is a less responsive procurement approach as the preferred supplier for most key purchase requirements will already be in place.

When considering vendors, it's a good idea to compare all the different options on offer in depth. Generally, ideal traits for a reputable supplier are accountability, production capacity, strong ethics, and free-flowing communication.

For example, an embroidery machine, whether it's your first one or an upgrade, is a considerable investment. It's not only the most expensive cost, but it's also your most crucial commodity because, without it, you cannot produce your products. Therefore, you should conduct thorough market research, comparing machines from several suppliers to ensure you find a high-value device that will cope with your customers' needs.

\section*{3. Negotiate contract terms with selected suppliers}

After choosing your preferred suppliers, the next step in the process is to negotiate contract terms with them. This stage is crucial in reaching a price that's fair for both parties and is an opportunity to build any additional payment term features that you want to take advantage of (like dynamic discounting or supply chain finance) into the contract.

Before entering negotiations, analyze any previous contracts to identify opportunities that will enable you to streamline costs and save money. If your previous agreements were expensive or had unrealistic terms, use this knowledge to iron out the finer details of prospective deals in the future.

For instance, a clothing company may have contracts with several suppliers, as they require a steady stream - and replenishment - of stock and materials. So, rather than ordering them each time manually, consider proposing a rolling contract that will save time, and possibly incur discounts, too.

\section*{4. Finalize the purchase order}

Once a contract is submitted to a supplier and both parties are happy with the small print, the next step is to start preparing, finalizing, and sending purchase orders.

A purchase order is a document that outlines:
- A description of the goods or service
- Total costs
- Quantity
- Approval of workflow

When a purchase order is approved, it signals to the relevant finance team to release the details to the supplier, affording them access to the critical information they need, such as:
- A reference number
- Payment terms agreement
- Any other essential information they require

Typically sent via email, a purchase order contains a further agreement between the two parties. While a contract sets out agreements about the whole collaboration, purchase orders tend to agree to individual jobs contractually.

If the clothing company in our example required a machine upgrade, they would need to obtain internal approval. If approved, the internal team will prepare a purchase order, including a description of the new machine, pricing, and any other relevant details. Once approved, the finance team will share the purchase order with the supplier who'll begin to prepare the order and organize payment details.

\section*{5. Receive invoice and process payment}

Once a supplier receives a purchase order, the purchase order sender will receive an invoice from them stating the agreed price and instructions on how to pay. This should contain details of the order on the invoice. It's worth noting that this part of the procurement process is now often done automatically through invoice automation.

Depending on what's outlined in the contract, the invoice will include details of the period allowed to make the payment. Many businesses offer a thirty-day credit notice, which gives you leeway to make the payment if you cannot fulfil it at the time of the order. However, payment terms will always depend on the specific contractual agreement, as well as the strength of the relationship between both parties.
6. Delivery and audit

All things going well, the delivery of ordered goods should arrive soon after the supplier receives a purchase order. At this stage of the process, it's common for businesses to make a record of when the order arrived as well as double-checking the order contents. If something is missing, this is the opportunity to contact the supplier and rectify the problem to reduce potential downtime.

For example, if a clothing manufacturer ordered a machine upgrade to cope with increased customer demand, but it arrived with a missing part, profound implications could ensue. Production could be affected, and orders could be delayed, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential losses for refunds and compensation.
7. Maintain accurate invoices for future audits

It's an essential part of the process to keep up to date records of all invoices and payments. Then, when it's time for a cash flow audit, you can precisely calculate what you've spent throughout the contract and identify areas where you can further analyze your spending.

Maintaining accurate invoices is also key to working out whether you're overspending or sticking to your budget. For example, if our clothing company looks over their records and realize that they're overspending on materials, they could act and look for a new supplier. Or, if the spending review concluded that they're overspending on machinery and equipment, this could indicate that the brand they're using isn't suitable for their needs.

Is the procurement cycle the same for every business?
The seven main steps that make up the procurement life cycle are by no means exhaustive - the process varies depending on a huge range of factors. However, the process outlined above is generally the foundation of any supplier-purchaser relationship.

While the details will change from vendor relationship to vendor relationship, the fundamentals of identifying requirements, finding suppliers, negotiating contract terms, and placing/receiving orders is fairly constant.

\section*{ROLE OF A NURSE IN PROCUREMENT}

Managing supplies and equipment involves much more than keeping the storage area neat. The first priority in supply and equipment management is knowing how to procure the things that are needed.

The procurement process involves several steps. First, requirements must be established.
1.The practical nurse manager must maintain ward, clinic, or area readiness by knowing what supplies and equipment are needed for daily operations (to accomplish the mission).
2.Requisition of the supplies and equipment through the proper channels. In order to do this, the manager must have a working knowledge of the basics of the supply system. This does not mean you must be a logistics expert, but you do need to know where to look for information and whom to see for assistance.
3.When the requested items arrive in the work place, they ensure are properly received, inspected, and stored.
4. They ensures, supplies and equipment are properly safeguarded against damage and loss, periodically inventoried and inspected, and properly issued for use.
5.Another part of supply and equipment management is maintaining the associated paperwork and records.

Hand receipts must be kept up to date, budgets controlled, and supply documents noted and filed. Equipment found to be unserviceable must be turned in or sent for repair.
6. As the manager, the practical nurse is responsible for accountability of supplies and equipment, whether used, disposed of, or sent for repair

Maintenance and serviceability of equipment are also management responsibilities. Equipment must be checked for proper function, inspected for damage or leaks, calibrated, and tested on a regular basis.
7.Much supply and equipment maintenance is done on the "user" level and, again, it is the responsibility of the enlisted manager to be certain that the individuals using the equipment are familiar with the correct procedures for its operation and maintenance.

\section*{ETHICAL AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS IN COMMODITY AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT}

Opportunities for unethical financial behavior can present themselves throughout the procurement cycle.

For example, when preparing documents for tender, unethical procurement professionals can tailor bidding documents or skew prequalification criteria in a preferred supplier's favor. Invoices can also be tampered with or certified for incomplete work that does not meet the required standard.

To avoid these issues, organizations must employ stringent procurement ethics rules and systems.

Poor procurement ethics practices not only affect the internal organization but can also impact customers and suppliers. There can be reduced profitability and tarnished reputations for both the organization and the supplier. On the customers' end, they may receive goods that do not meet target specifications.

\section*{Procurement Ethics Concepts}

To guide decision making and help to avoid unethical practices, keep the following fundamental principles in mind:
- Loyalty and Respect for Rules and Regulations - Typically, officers sign an oath vowing to conduct themselves per the organization's rules, acting in its best interest, and not allowing outside influences into any decision-making process.
- Transparency - All information related to procurement processes should be made available to all parties involved, including the general public unless there are legal restrictions in place. Tender announcements are required to contain sufficient information to inform the supplier of capability in bidding. Tender documents must be concise, detailing expectations, evaluation criteria, and dates.
- Integrity - Strong moral principles and honesty are the pillars of integrity. The company's moral values should always be upheld; employees should not act with selfish motives or with the end objective of personal gain. When employees see evidence of unethical behavior, they should submit a report.
- Unbiasedness - To achieve fairness in operations, bias should not be shown to specific suppliers or coworkers. Decisions should be made with impartiality, and changes to any document or specifications should be distributed to all suppliers.
- Confidentiality - In any business, information related to financials and personal information is protected and not made public as its release can jeopardize operations. Companies often have employees sign confidentiality agreements to ensure this remains intact.
- Avoiding the Appearance of Impropriety - Officers should be aware of outside perceptions of behavior deemed to constitute a conflict of interest. Circumstances involving improper contact should be identified beforehand and avoided as major scandals can erupt based only on assumptions.
- Due Diligence - Duties should be undertaken with the utmost care to follow all company regulations and standards while avoiding shortcuts.
- Accountability - Persons should be held responsible for any decisions made during the procurement process. Any actions contrary to the organization's rules should be investigated and the required steps taken.

\section*{CHAPTER SIX: HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM.}

Health information management (HIM) is the collection, analysis, storage, and protection of patient health information and medical records.

It is a multidisciplinary field composed of technology, research, and health care experts. Although this field doesn't involve direct patient care, it is undeniably vital to the industry because health care systems rely heavily on the data innovation this expertise generates and oversees.

A health information system (HIS) refers to a system designed to includes systems that collect, store, manage and transmit a patient's electronic medical record (EMR), a hospital's operational management or a system supporting healthcare policy decisions.

Health information systems also include those systems that handle data related to the activities of providers and health organizations. As an integrated effort, these may be leveraged to improve patient outcomes, inform research, and influence policy-making and decision-making. Because health information systems commonly access, process, or maintain large volumes of sensitive data, security is a primary concern.

Health information technology (HIT) involves the development of health information systems.

\section*{EXAMPLES OF HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS}

Health information systems can be used by everyone in healthcare from patients to clinicians to public health officials. They collect data and compile it in a way that can be used to make healthcare decisions.

Examples of health information systems include:

\section*{Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and Electronic Health Record (EHR)}

These two terms are almost used interchangeably. The electronic medical record replaces the paper version of a patient's medical history. The electronic health record includes more health data, test results, and treatments. It also is designed to share data with other electronic health records so other healthcare providers can access a patient's healthcare data.

\section*{Practice Management Software}

Practice management software helps healthcare providers manage daily operations such as scheduling and billing. Healthcare providers, from small practices to hospitals, use practice management systems to automate many of the administrative tasks.

\section*{Master Patient Index (MPI)}

A master patient index connects separate patient records across databases. The index has a record for each patient that is registered at a healthcare organization and indexes all other records for that patient. MPIs are used to reduce duplicate patient records and inaccurate patient information that can lead to claim denials.

\section*{Patient Portals}

Patient portals allow patients to access their personal health data such as appointment information, medications and lab results over an internet connection. Some patient portals allow active communication with their physicians, prescription refill requests, and the ability to schedule appointments.

\section*{Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)}

Also known as telehealth, remote patient monitoring allows medical sensors to send patient data to healthcare professionals. It frequently monitors blood glucose levels and blood pressure for patients with chronic conditions. The data is used to detect medical events that require intervention and can possibly become part of a larger population health study.

\section*{Clinical Decision Support (CDS)}

Clinical decision support systems analyse data from various clinical and administrative systems to help healthcare providers make clinical decisions.The data can help prepare diagnoses or predict medical events such as drug interactions. These tools filter data and information to help clinicians care for individual patients.

\section*{DATA COLLECTION}

In Statistics, data collection is a process of gathering information from all the relevant sources to find a solution to the research problem. It helps to evaluate the outcome of the problem. The data collection methods allow a person to conclude an answer to the relevant question. Most of the organizations use data collection methods to make assumptions about future probabilities and trends. Once the data is collected, it is necessary to undergo the data organization process.

\section*{TYPES OF DATA}

\section*{Quantitative Data}
- Quantitative data is measurable, often used for comparisons, and involves counting of people, behaviours, conditions, or other discrete events (Wang, 2013).
- Quantitative data uses numbers to determine the what, who, when, and where of healthrelated events (Wang, 2013).
- Examples of quantitative data include: age, weight, temperature, or the number of people suffering from diabetes.

\section*{Qualitative Data}
- Qualitative data is a broad category of data that can include almost any non-numerical data.
- Qualitative data uses words to describe a particular health-related event (Romano).
- This data can be observed, but not measured.
- Involves observing people in selected places and listening to discover how they feel and why they might feel that way.
- Examples of qualitative data include: male/female, smoker/non-smoker, or questionnaire response (agree, disagree, neutral).

\section*{SOURCES OF HEATH DATA}

\section*{Surveys}

Surveys are an important means of collecting health and social science information from a sample of people in a standardized way to better understand a larger population. There are many methods used to conduct surveys, including questionnaires and in-depth interviews via phone, mail, email, and in-person.

Survey research allows researchers to collect empirical data in a relatively short period of time. Depending on the design and scope, surveys can collect data on a representative sample of people, particularly when samples are randomized or purposive nonprobability sampling is used.

\section*{Medical Records}

Medical records are used to track events and transactions between patients and health care providers. They offer information on diagnoses, procedures, lab tests, and other services. Medical records help us measure and analyse trends in health care use, patient characteristics, and quality of care.

Medical records are usually accurate and detailed because they come from health care providers. The data are automatically collected, including information that patients might not think to add or feel comfortable sharing through other data sources like surveys.

\section*{Claims Data}

Claims data, also known as administrative data, are another sort of electronic record, but on a much bigger scale. Claims databases collect information on millions of doctors' appointments, bills, insurance information, and other patient-provider communications.

The good thing about claims data is that, like other medical records, they come directly from notes made by the health care provider, and the information is recorded at the time patient sees the doctor.

\section*{Vital Records}

Vital records are collected by the National Vital Statistics System, and are maintained by state and local governments. Vital records include births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and fetal deaths. They also record information about the cause of death, or details of the birth.

Vital records are useful because they offer very detailed information and include information about rare disorders that end in death. Unfortunately, because there are so many state and local governments collecting this information, records can be inconsistent. Also, vital records only provide information on diseases and illnesses that end in death.

\section*{Surveillance}

Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for preventing and controlling disease and injury.

Surveillance activities are usually associated with the study of infectious diseases.

\section*{METHODS OF DATA COLLECION.}

Observation method is used when the study relates to behavioural science. This method is planned systematically. It is subject to many controls and checks. The different types of observations are:
- Structured and unstructured observation
- Controlled and uncontrolled observation
- Participant, non-participant and disguised observation

\section*{Interview Method}

The method of collecting data in terms of oral or verbal responses. It is achieved in two ways, such as
- Personal Interview - In this method, a person known as an interviewer is required to ask questions face to face to the other person. The personal interview can be structured or unstructured, direct investigation, focused conversation, etc.
- Telephonic Interview - In this method, an interviewer obtains information by contacting people on the telephone to ask the questions or views orally.

\section*{Questionnaire Method}

In this method, the set of questions are mailed to the respondent. They should read, reply and subsequently return the questionnaire. The questions are printed in the definite order on the form. A good survey should have the following features:
- Short and simple
- Should follow a logical sequence
- Provide adequate space for answers
- Avoid technical terms
- Should have good physical appearance such as colour, quality of the paper to attract the attention of the respondent

\section*{Schedules}

This method is similar to the questionnaire method with a slight difference. The enumerations are specially appointed for the purpose of filling the schedules. It explains the aims and objects of the investigation and may remove misunderstandings, if any have come up. Enumerators should be trained to perform their job with hard work and patience.

\section*{DATA STORAGE}

Data storage refers to magnetic, optical or mechanical media that records and preserves digital information for ongoing or future operations.

\section*{Onsite data storage}

Healthcare facilities and hospitals overwhelmingly prefer on-premises data storage to store and manage patient data for greater control over internal data. The idea that healthcare providers can access data at any time from a secure, native data centre appeals to most, making onsite data storage a generally popular choice.

\section*{Public cloud data storage}

With cloud-based data storage, the process of delivering patient data can be simplified, making it quick and easy without compromising security. Cloud storage is more scalable, requiring less capital investment for implementation and maintenance. Data accessibility also improves dramatically. Healthcare organisations can start with a smaller space and eventually increase cloud space as the amount of data increases.

\section*{Hybrid cloud data storage solution}

A hybrid cloud data storage solution includes on-premises data storage, public cloud storage and the services needed to share data and orchestrate workloads between these environments. Most organisations choose a form of hybrid data storage when scaling up or implementing a more
advanced storage solution. Organisations may choose to store more bandwidth-intensive data, such as images, on a local server so that it can be accessed quickly.

\section*{DATA ANALYSIS}

Data analysis is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modelling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.

A simple example of Data analysis is whenever we take any decision in our day-to-day life is by thinking about what happened last time or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. This is nothing but analysing our past or future and making decisions based on it. For that, we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing but data analysis. Now same thing analyst does for business purposes, is called Data Analysis.

\section*{Types of data analysis methods}

\section*{1. Cluster analysis}

The action of grouping a set of data elements in a way that said elements are more similar (in a particular sense) to each other than to those in other groups - hence the term 'cluster.' Since there is no target variable when clustering, the method is often used to find hidden patterns in the data. The approach is also used to provide additional context to a trend or dataset.

By grouping customers into clusters based on demographics, purchasing behaviours, monetary value, or any other factor that might be relevant for your company, you will be able to immediately optimize your efforts and give your customers the best experience based on their needs.

\section*{2. Cohort analysis}

This type of data analysis method uses historical data to examine and compare a determined segment of users' behaviour, which can then be grouped with others with similar characteristics. By using this data analysis methodology, it's possible to gain a wealth of insight into consumer needs or a firm understanding of a broader target group.

Cohort analysis can be really useful to perform analysis in marketing as it will allow you to understand the impact of your campaigns on specific groups of customers.

\section*{3. Regression analysis}

The regression analysis uses historical data to understand how a dependent variable's value is affected when one (linear regression) or more independent variables (multiple regression) change or stay the same. By understanding each variable's relationship and how they developed in the past, you can anticipate possible outcomes and make better business decisions in the future.

\section*{4. Neural networks}

The neural network forms the basis for the intelligent algorithms of machine learning. It is a form of data-driven analytics that attempts, with minimal intervention, to understand how the human brain would process insights and predict values. Neural networks learn from each and every data transaction, meaning that they evolve and advance over time.

A typical area of application for neural networks is predictive data analysis.

\section*{5. Factor analysis}

The factor analysis, also called "dimension reduction," is a type of data analysis used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. The aim here is to uncover independent latent variables, an ideal analysis method for streamlining specific data segments.

\section*{6. Data mining}

A method of analysis that is the umbrella term for engineering metrics and insights for additional value, direction, and context. By using exploratory statistical evaluation, data mining aims to identify dependencies, relations, data patterns, and trends to generate and advanced knowledge. When considering how to analyse data, adopting a data mining mindset is essential to success as such, it's an area that is worth exploring in greater detail.

\section*{7. Text analysis}

Text analysis, also known in the industry as text mining, is the process of taking large sets of textual data and arranging it in a way that makes it easier to manage. By working through this
cleansing process in stringent detail, you will be able to extract the data that is truly relevant to your business and use it to develop actionable insights that will propel you forward.

\section*{DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_20d785f6e224ed7dff81g-142.jpg?height=841&width=1584&top_left_y=1406&top_left_x=238)
1. Collaborate your needs

Before you begin analysing your data or drill down into any analysis techniques, it's crucial to sit down collaboratively with all key stakeholders within your organization, decide on your primary campaign or strategic goals, and gain a fundamental understanding of the types of insights that will best benefit your progress or provide you with the level of vision you need to evolve your organization.

\section*{2. Establish your questions}

Once you've outlined your core objectives, you should consider which questions will need answering to help you achieve your mission. This is one of the most important data analytics techniques as it will shape the very foundations of your success.

To help you ask the right things and ensure your data works for you, you have to ask the right data analysis questions.

\section*{3. Data democratization}

After giving your data analytics methodology some real direction, and knowing which questions need answering to extract optimum value from the information available to your organization, you should continue with data democratization.

Data democratization is a process that aims to connect data from various sources efficiently and quickly so that anyone in your organization can access it at any given moment. You can extract data in text, images, videos, numbers, or any other format. And then perform cross-database analysis to achieve more advanced insights to share with the rest of the company interactively.

Once you have decided on your most valuable data sources, you need to take all of this information into a structured format to start collecting your insights. For this purpose, data pine offers an easy all-in-one data connectors feature to integrate all your internal and external data sources and manage them at your will. Additionally, data pine's end-to-end solution automatically updates your data, allowing you to save time and focus on performing the right analysis to grow your business.

\section*{4. Clean your data}

After harvesting from so many sources you will be left with a vast amount of information that can be overwhelming to deal with. At the same time, you can be faced with incorrect data that

\section*{Health systems management}
can be misleading to your analysis. The smartest thing you can do to avoid dealing with this in the future is to clean the data. This process is fundamental before visualizing it, as it will ensure that the insights you extract from it are correct.

There are many things that you need to look for while cleaning your data. The most important one is to eliminate any duplicate observations; this usually appears when using multiple internal and external sources of data. You can also add any missing codes, fix empty fields, and eliminate incorrectly formatted data.

\section*{5. Set your KPIs}

Once you've set your data sources, cleaned your data, and established clear-cut questions you want your insights to answer, you need to set a host of key performance indicators (KPIs) that will help you track, measure, and shape your progress in a number of key areas.

KPIs are critical to both analysis methods in qualitative and quantitative research. This is one of the primary methods of data analysis you certainly shouldn't overlook.

To help you set the best possible KPIs for your initiatives and activities, here is an example of a relevant logistics KPI: transportation-related costs. If you want to see more go explore our collection of key performance indicator examples.

\section*{6. Omit useless data}

Having bestowed your data analysis techniques and methods with true purpose and defined your mission, you should explore the raw data you've collected from all sources and use your KPIs as a reference for chopping out any information you deem to be useless.

Trimming the informational fat is one of the most crucial methods of analysis as it will allow you to focus your analytical efforts and squeeze every drop of value from the remaining 'lean' information.

Any stats, facts, figures, or metrics that don't align with your business goals or fit with your KPI management strategies should be eliminated from the equation.

\section*{7. Build a data management roadmap}

While, at this point, this particular step is optional (you will have already gained a wealth of insight and formed a fairly sound strategy by now), creating a data governance roadmap will help your data analysis methods and techniques become successful on a more sustainable basis. These roadmaps, if developed properly, are also built so they can be tweaked and scaled over time.

Invest ample time in developing a roadmap that will help you store, manage, and handle your data internally, and you will make your analysis techniques all the more fluid and functional one of the most powerful types of data analysis methods available today.

\section*{8. Integrate technology}

There are many ways to analyse data, but one of the most vital aspects of analytical success in a business context is integrating the right decision support software and technology.

Robust analysis platforms will not only allow you to pull critical data from your most valuable sources while working with dynamic KPIs that will offer you actionable insights; it will also present the information in a digestible, visual, interactive format from one central, live dashboard. A data analytics methodology you can count on.

By integrating the right technology for your statistical method data analysis and core data analytics methodology, you'll avoid fragmenting your insights, saving you time and effort while allowing you to enjoy the maximum value from your business's most valuable insights.

For a look at the power of software for the purpose of analysis and to enhance your methods of analysing data, glance over our selection of dashboard examples.

\section*{9. Answer your questions}

By considering each of the above efforts, working with the right technology, and fostering a cohesive internal culture where everyone buys into the different ways to analyze data as well as the power of digital intelligence, you will swiftly start to answer your most burning business questions. Arguably, the best way to make your data concepts accessible across the organization is through data visualization.

\section*{10. Visualize your data}

Online data visualization is a powerful tool as it lets you tell a story with your metrics, allowing users across the business to extract meaningful insights that aid business evolution - and it covers all the different ways to analyse data.

The purpose of analysing your data is to make your entire organization more informed and intelligent, and with the right platform or dashboard, this is simpler than you think, as demonstrated by our marketing dashboard.

\section*{11. Interpretation of data}

We already dedicated an entire post to data interpretation as it is a fundamental part of the data analysis process. It gives meaning to the analytical information and aims to drive a concise conclusion from the analysis results. Since most of the time companies are dealing with data from many different sources, the interpretation stage needs to be done carefully and properly in order to avoid misinterpretations.

\section*{12. Build a narrative}

Now that we've discussed and explored the technical applications of data-driven analysis, we're going to look at how you can bring all of these elements together in a way that will benefit your business - starting with a little something called data storytelling.

The human brain responds incredibly well to strong stories or narratives. Once you've cleansed, shaped, and visualized your most invaluable data using various BI dashboard tools, you should strive to tell a story - one with a clear-cut beginning, middle, and end.

By doing so, you will make your analytical efforts more accessible, digestible, and universal, empowering more people within your organization to use your discoveries to their actionable advantage.

\section*{13. Consider autonomous technology}

Autonomous technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), play a significant role in the advancement of understanding how to analyse data more effectively.

Gartner predicts that by the end of this year, $80 \%$ of emerging technologies will be developed with AI foundations. This is a testament to the ever-growing power and value of autonomous technologies.

At the moment, these technologies are revolutionizing the data analysis industry. Some examples that we mentioned earlier are neural networks, intelligent alarms, and sentiment analysis.

\section*{14. Share the load}

If you work with the right tools and dashboards, you will be able to present your metrics in a digestible, value-driven format, allowing almost everyone in the organization to connect with and use relevant data to their advantage.

Modern data dashboards consolidate data from various sources, providing access to a wealth of insights in one centralized location, no matter if you need to monitor recruitment metrics or generate reports that need to be sent across numerous departments. Moreover, these cutting-edge tools offer access to dashboards from a multitude of devices, meaning that everyone within the business can connect with practical insights remotely - and share the load.

Once everyone is able to work with a data-driven mindset, you will catalyse the success of your business in ways you never thought possible. And when it comes to knowing how to analyse data, this kind of collaborative approach is essential.

\section*{15. Data analysis tools}

In order to perform high-quality data analysis, it is fundamental to use tools and softwares that will ensure the best results. As the analysis industry grows, so does the offer for services and features that you can exploit. Here we leave you a small summary of four fundamental categories of data analysis tools for your organization.

\section*{BENEFITS OF HEALTH DATA}

\section*{Benefits for...}
... Patients
- When health providers have access to a patient's up-to-date health data, they can provide more efficient, higher quality, safer and more personalised care and care coordination.

\section*{PUBLIC HEALTH ACT ON FOOD, DRUGS AND CHEMICALS.}

This Act provides rules for the placing on the market of food, drugs for man and animal and chemical substances, establishes the Public Health (Standards) Board and makes otherwise provision for the control of the quality and safety of food, drugs and chemical substances to be placed on the market of Kenya.

The Act prohibits the labelling, packaging, sale, treatment and processing of food that is presented to the public in a false or deceptive manner or that does not meet a prescribed standard and handling of food in unsanitary conditions.

Similar rules are prescribed for drugs and chemical substances. Disposal of any chemical substance in a manner likely to cause contamination of food or water for human consumption or in a manner liable to be injurious or dangerous to the health of any person is declared to be an offence. "Food", "drugs" and chemical "substances" are defined in section

The Public Health (Standards) Board shall advise the Minister on Regulations to be adopted under this Act.

The Act defines powers of authorized officers, including the power to inspect any animal intended for slaughter and to seize and examine any meat which he or she considers to be unfit for consumption.

The Act also confers powers on the Director of Agriculture to request sampling of any products covered by this Act appearing to him or her to affect the general interests of agriculture in Kenya. Other powers of control are conferred upon the Minister and the municipal councils.

\section*{NURSES ACT}

\section*{Application for a practising licence}

\section*{WORKMAN'S COMPENSATION}

The Employee's Compensation Act, 2010 is a social security/welfare scheme that provides comprehensive compensation to employees who suffer from occupational diseases or sustain injuries arising from accidents at workplace or in the course of employment.

The basis or justification for 'compensation' is the employer's duty of care.
The idea of compensation suggests that someone has suffered a wrong for which he has to be compensated monetarily.

This implies that another person has a duty to prevent the occurrence of the wrong suffered. Payment of compensation by the employer to the employee is rooted in the accepted principle that the employer has a duty of care, a duty to protect the health, welfare and safety of workers at work. Where the worker sustains injuries, gets ill or dies in work-related circumstances, the employer is liable to pay compensation to the worker or to his dependents, in the event of death. This article is intended to examine the issues, prospects and challenges of the Employee's Compensation Act, 2010.

\section*{CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSON'S ACT}

\section*{Survival and best interests of the child}

\section*{SUCCESSION ACT}

This act is the general law of succession in the country. The law of succession rules vary for estate and testate successions. Here is the procedure in the law of succession in Kenya for the different types of succession.

\section*{Testate succession}

Under testate succession, the disposal of the property of the deceased person is carried out according to the will or testament.

In the context of the law of succession, the will is a record of a deceased person's wishes and intentions pertaining to the devolution of his property upon his death.

The owner of the property arranges to ensure that upon his death, the property passes to a person or persons of his choice through a valid will. Image: instagram.com,

It is important to note that the will has no legal effect until the maker dies. While he is alive, it neither limits his rights of ownership nor confers any benefits to anyone.

Beneficiaries under a will do not acquire an interest in the property before the testator's death.

\section*{Intestate succession}

In the case of intestate succession, the deceased person does not leave behind a will spelling out how the estate should be distributed to the people entitled to it.

Under the law, the nature of the devolution of the property upon intestacy depends on whether the deceased was polygamous or monogamous.

The Law of Succession Act makes provision for both monogamous and polygamous situations. Provisions relating to intestacy are contained in Part V of the Act from Section 32 to Section 42. The rules of this act only benefit the people who have a direct blood link with the intestate. Under Section 35 and 37 of this act, immediate family members, including the spouse and children, are given priority to inherit the estate.

The surviving spouse is entitled to the personal and household effects of the deceased. $\mathrm{He} /$ she is required to hold the estate in trust for the children and to divide it to the children in equal shares in the future. If there is no surviving spouse, the net intestate estate devolves upon the child or children of the deceased.

The personal and household effects of the deceased absolutely, The first Kshs.10, 000.00 out of the residue of the net intestate estate $20 \%$ of the residue of the net intestate whichever is greater, and A life interest in the whole of the remainder

Section 40 addresses the case of the polygamous intestate. In such a case, his/her personal and household effects and the residue of the net intestate estate should in the first place be divided among the houses according to the number of children in each house.

If there are no immediate family members, distant relatives are allowed to inherit it. There are no benefits conferred on categories such as the parents-in-law and unmarried partners except in the case where the deceased left a will. In the case where there are no blood relatives, the estate or property devolves to the state.

Importance of law of succession Image
The succession law forms the basis for the resolution of all the succession cases in Kenya.
Here are the most important reasons why this law is important:
It provides the mechanisms for the transmission of property from the deceased person to the heirs.

It identifies the legal/rightful claimants of the property of the deceased.
This law spells out the procedures to be taken by the claimants to enable them to acquire the property of the deceased.

It provides tools for dispute resolution to resolve any encounters between persons claiming to be the rightful claimants.

\section*{MENTAL HEALTH ACT}
(1) Any person who has attained the apparent age of sixteen years, who desires to voluntarily submit himself to treatment for mental disorder and who makes to the person in charge a written application in duplicate in the form prescribed, may be received as a voluntary patient into a mental hospital.
(2) Any person who has not attained the apparent age of sixteen years and whose parent or guardian desires to submit him to treatment for mental disorder may, if the parent or guardian makes to the person in charge of a mental hospital a written application in duplicate in the prescribed form, be received as a voluntary patient.
(3) Any person received as a voluntary patient under this section may leave the mental hospital, upon giving to the person in charge seventy-two hours' notice in writing of his intention to leave
and if he is a person who has not attained the apparent age of sixteen years, upon such notice being given by his parent or guardian, and the release shall be at the discretion of the person in charge of the mental hospital concerned after becoming incapable of expressing himself
4) A voluntary patient received into a mental hospital under section 10 who at any time becomes incapable of expressing himself as willing or unwilling to continue to receive treatment, shall not be retained as a voluntary patient for more than forty-two days thereafter, and shall be discharged on or before the expiration of that period unless, in the meantime he has again become capable of so expressing himself and the person in charge, in consultation with the district mental health council, considers that his continued stay in the mental hospital may be of benefit to the voluntary patient and the person in charge of the patient shall subject to sections 15 and 22, retain the person in the mental hospital until an order for discharge can be made under section

\section*{CRIMINAL PENAL CODE}

(a) any person whom he suspects upon reasonable grounds of having committed an indictable offence;
(b) any person who commits in his presence any offence punishable by
imprisonment;
(c) any person who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty, or who has escaped, or attempts to escape, from lawful custody;
(d) any person in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be stolen property, or who may reasonably be suspected of committing, or having committed, an offence with reference to such thing;
(e) any person whom he suspects upon reasonable grounds of having in his
possession, without lawful excuse, any implement of housebreaking;

\section*{CHAPTER EIGHT: PROJECT PLANING AND MANAGEMENT.}

Project management is the application of processes, methods, skills, knowledge and experience to achieve specific project objectives according to the project acceptance criteria within agreed parameters. Project management has final deliverables that are constrained to a finite timescale and budget.

Project planning is a discipline addressing how to complete a project in a certain timeframe, usually with defined stages and designated resources.

\section*{Importance of Planning}

Planning is definitely significant as it directs us where to go, it furnishes direction and decreases the danger of risk by making predictions.

Planning helps an organization chart a course for the achievement of its goals. The process begins with reviewing the current operations of the organization and identifying what needs to be improved operationally in the upcoming year. From there, planning involves envisioning the results the organization wants to achieve, and determining the steps necessary to arrive at the intended destination - success, whether that is measured in financial terms, or goals that include being the highest-rated organization in customer satisfaction.

\section*{Efficient Use of Resources}

All organizations, large and small, have limited resources. The planning process provides the information top management needs to make effective decisions about how to allocate the resources in a way that will enable the organization to reach its objectives. Productivity is maximized and resources are not wasted on projects with little chance of success.

\section*{Establishing Organizational Goals}

Setting goals that challenge everyone in the organization to strive for better performance is one of the key aspects of the planning process. Goals must be aggressive, but realistic.

Organizations cannot allow themselves to become too satisfied with how they are currently doing - or they are likely to lose ground to competitors.

The goal setting process can be a wake-up call for managers that have become complacent. The other benefit of goal setting comes when forecast results are compared to actual results. Organizations analyze significant variances from forecast and take action to remedy situations where revenues were lower than plan or expenses higher.

\section*{Managing Risk and Uncertainty}

Managing risk is essential to an organization's success. Even the largest corporations cannot control the economic and competitive environment around them. Unforeseen events occur that must be dealt with quickly, before negative financial consequences from these events become severe.

Planning encourages the development of "what-if" scenarios, where managers attempt to envision possible risk factors and develop contingency plans to deal with them. The pace of change in business is rapid, and organizations must be able to rapidly adjust their strategies to these changing conditions.

\section*{Team Building and Cooperation}

Planning promotes team building and a spirit of cooperation. When the plan is completed and communicated to members of the organization, everyone knows what their responsibilities are, and how other areas of the organization need their assistance and expertise in order to complete assigned tasks. They see how their work contributes to the success of the organization as a whole and can take pride in their contributions.

Potential conflict can be reduced when top management solicits department or division managers' input during the goal setting process. Individuals are less likely to resent budgetary targets when they had a say in their creation.

\section*{Creating Competitive Advantages}

Planning helps organizations get a realistic view of their current strengths and weaknesses relative to major competitors. The management team sees areas where competitors may be vulnerable and then crafts marketing strategies to take advantage of these weaknesses.

Observing competitors' actions can also help organizations identify opportunities they may have overlooked, such as emerging international markets or opportunities to market products to completely different customer groups.

\section*{Types of Plans}

\section*{Operational Planning}
"Operational plans are about how things need to happen," motivational leadership speaker Mack Story said at LinkedIn. "Guidelines of how to accomplish the mission are set."

This type of planning typically describes the day-to-day running of the company. Operational plans are often described as single use plans or ongoing plans. Single use plans are created for events and activities with a single occurrence (such as a single marketing campaign). Ongoing plans include policies for approaching problems, rules for specific regulations and procedures for a step-by-step process for accomplishing particular objectives.

\section*{Strategic Planning}
"Strategic plans are all about why things need to happen," Story said. "It's big picture, long-term thinking. It starts at the highest level with defining a mission and casting a vision."

Strategic planning includes a high-level overview of the entire business. It's the foundational basis of the organization and will dictate long-term decisions. The scope of strategic planning can be anywhere from the next two years to the next 10 years. Important components of a strategic plan are vision, mission and values.

\section*{Tactical Planning}
"Tactical plans are about what is going to happen," Story said. "Basically at the tactical level, there are many focused, specific, and short-term plans, where the actual work is being done, that support the high-level strategic plans."

Tactical planning supports strategic planning. It includes tactics that the organization plans to use to achieve what's outlined in the strategic plan. Often, the scope is less than one year and breaks down the strategic plan into actionable chunks. Tactical planning is different from operational planning in that tactical plans ask specific questions about what needs to happen to accomplish a strategic goal; operational plans ask how the organization will generally do something to accomplish the company's mission.

\section*{Contingency Planning}

Contingency plans are made when something unexpected happens or when something needs to be changed. Business experts sometimes refer to these plans as a special type of planning.

Contingency planning can be helpful in circumstances that call for a change. Although managers should anticipate changes when engaged in any of the primary types of planning, contingency planning is essential in moments when changes can't be foreseen. As the business world becomes more complicated, contingency planning becomes more important to engage in and understand.

\section*{PHASES OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Phase 1: Project initiation}

The project initiation phase is the first stage of turning an abstract idea into a meaningful goal. In this stage, you need to develop a business case and define the project on a broad level. In order to do that, you have to determine the need for the project and create a project charter.

The project charter is an important document consisting of details like the project constraints, goals, appointment of the project manager, budget, expected timeline, etc.

Once you have the project goals and project scope, identify key project stakeholders-the people who are to be involved in the project. Create a stakeholder register with the roles, designation, communication requirements, and influence.

While a clear goal of the project is established in this phase, a project charter does not contain any technical details that happen in the planning stage.

Phase 2: Project planning

The project planning stage requires complete diligence as it lays out the project's roadmap. Unless you are using a modern project management methodology like agile project management, the second phase of project management is expected to take almost half of the entire project's timespan.

In this phase, the primary tasks are identifying technical requirements, developing a detailed project schedule, creating a communication plan, and setting up goals/deliverables.

During the planning stage, the scope of the project is defined. There is a possibility of changing the scope of the project demands it but the project manager must approve the change. Project managers also develop a work breakdown structure (WBS), which clearly visualizes the entire project in different sections for the team management.

Risk mitigation is another important aspect of project management that is a part of the planning stage. The project manager is responsible for extrapolating past data to identify potential project management risks and develop a strategy to minimize them.

An important element that professionals often overlook is an effective change management plan. As a project manager, you must be ready to incorporate a few changes in the project to avoid bottlenecks and project delays.

In the absence of a working change management plan, scope creep happens and causes huge problems for the project team in the later stages of the project. So, it's best to reduce the possibility of unforeseen changes as much as possible.

Phase 3: Project execution
The project execution stage is where your team does the actual work. As a project manager, your job is to establish efficient workflows and carefully monitor the progress of your team.

Another responsibility of the project manager during this phase is to consistently maintain effective collaboration between project stakeholders. This ensures that everyone stays on the same page and the project runs smoothly without any issues.

You can take help from the best project collaboration tools that are available in the market. They'll not only make your life easier but also improve efficiency and increase the productivity of your team.

Phase 4: Project monitoring and controlling
In the project management process, the third and fourth phases are not sequential in nature. The project monitoring and controlling phase run simultaneously with project execution, thereby ensuring that objectives and project deliverables are met.

As a project manager, you can make sure that no one deviates from the original plan by establishing Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

During the monitoring phase of project management, the manager is also responsible for quantitatively tracking the effort and cost during the process. This tracking not only ensures that the project remains within the budget but also is important for future projects.

\section*{Phase 5: Project closing}

This is the final phase of the project management process. The project closure stage indicates the end of the project after the final delivery. There are times when external talent is hired specifically for the project on contract. Terminating these contracts and completing the necessary paperwork is also the responsibility of the project manager.

Most teams hold a reflection meeting after the completion of the project in order to contemplate their successes and failures during the project. This is an effective method to ensure continuous improvement within the company to enhance the overall productivity of the team in the future.

\section*{COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT}
community development as "a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems.

\section*{TYPES OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS}

Income Generating Activities (IGAs) consist of small businesses managed by a group of people to increase their household income through livelihood diversification.

Income-generating activities are activities that have the potential to generate revenue and nonincome generating activities are activities that do not. No matter who you are or what field you work in, every business activity can be clearly delineated as one or the other.
'Income-generating activities' refers to activities focused on creating opportunities for communities to productively use locally-available resources in order to develop less state dependent and more self-reliant households and communities that are able to take care of themselves. Thus, income-generating activities focus on productively using locally-available resources as a means of benefitting the entire community.

\section*{Income Generating Projects}

For income generating projects the two key factors are the quantity that can be sold (i.e. that will be purchased), and the price that the buyer will pay. For some products, such as grains, construction blocks or cooking oil, demand is rarely a limiting factor; the market is large and the sort of projects supported by RuralInvest are unlikely to meet more than a small fraction of total consumption. Furthermore, as the products are not readily perishable, they can be made available year round, and prices tend to change only gradually, reflecting variations in raw material and storage costs. Thus determining volumes and prices for these products is a matter of project output, and predominant market price (less transport costs to the market).

Perishable products, however, are a different story. Here available volumes, and therefore prices, can vary enormously, as the product is expensive if not impossible to keep for another day. Fresh vegetables may be very abundant and cheap in the winter, for example, when rainfall is adequate and temperatures moderate, but may be very scarce and expensive in the summer when irrigation and even shade netting may be required. For perishable products, therefore, it is critical to consider the seasonality of production for the proposed project, and relate that seasonality to the prices likely to be encountered.

Specialized products (including many processed foods, clothing and services) are the most difficult categories for which to determine market demand and prices. Prices are not standard for all goods or services of one type, but vary according to ingredients, quality, and the perceptions
of the buyer. Prices may be estimated on the basis of the closest comparable product, although if no distinct and obvious difference exists which will attract the buyer, a significant price reduction may be necessary at the beginning to persuade purchasers to shift from the existing alternatives to the new product or service offered by the project. Sales volumes can be equally hard to estimate, especially if the product or service is new, or is entering a very limited market. In such cases, investment plans should not be over ambitious, and the minimum scale of production that is compatible with cost considerations is recommended, at least for start-up. Where services are concerned, it must be remembered that a service not sold during a particular time period (e.g. the use of a tractor for land preparation) is lost forever, so variations in demand according to season are critical.

\section*{Non Income Generating Projects}

Although it may be difficult to estimate demand for a marketed product, where there is no market at all, estimating demand can be even harder. What will be the demand for an investment in watershed protection, or for a new primary school? The starting point in the absence of markets must be to identify who are the expected beneficiaries, both direct and indirect. Normally one thinks of beneficiaries in terms of families, so for every school child or patient at a medical clinic, there is a family which benefits.

Perhaps the best way to try and identify potential direct beneficiaries is to ask: "What are people doing in the absence of this product or service? Would they change over to become users (i.e. beneficiaries) of the new project?". Another key question is: "How many new users might be created if the project goes ahead?".

Perhaps only a few children in the area currently go to school, as the only existing facility is some kilometres away in the nearest town. But how many might be tempted if the school was now within walking distance? It should not be forgotten that suppliers and workers are also direct beneficiaries, and should be included in the estimation.

An erosion control project might have few direct beneficiaries (e.g. farmers and householders directly affected by the erosion), but a considerable number of indirect beneficiaries (e.g. all those using the river or streams that would be protected). In fact, indirect beneficiaries often
include the entire population of the area served by the project, whether it be a bridge, potable water, or a day care facility, so this number is often quite large in comparison with the number of direct beneficiaries.

\section*{The four core functions of community health nursing practices are described below:}
1. Identification of community culture and resources that lead as a key factor in the community health care delivery system.
2. Evaluate community health conditions, health risks, and problems to identify the healthcare demands of the people.
3. Plan and implementation of comprehensive community health interventions, care, services, and programs.
4. Develop health policy at the local community level to drive policies/agreements at the state and national levels for collaborative endeavors and actions.

\section*{COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES}

Multidisciplinary approach

A multidisciplinary approach involves drawing appropriately from multiple disciplines to redefine problems outside of normal boundaries and reach solutions based on a new understanding of complex situations. Multidisciplinary working is often seen as revolutionary by skill-centred specialists but it is simply a fundamental expression of being guided by holism rather than reductionism, as described by Jan Smuts in his 1926 book Holism and Evolution. One of the major barriers to the multidisciplinary approach is the long established tradition of highly focused professional practitioners cultivating a protective boundary around their area of expertise.

Directive Approach
- The directive approach is more common.

\section*{- Directive approach itself decides}
- The decision of directive approach makes decision of which is for the betterment of people itself.
- The agencies will then provide whatever staff equipment, premises and programs are needed to meet the needs and interest of people.
- It wish to help themselves whenever some activities are provided.
- It is the essence of this approach that the agency and it's worker think, decide, pan, organize, administer and provide for people. "Always the initiative and the final say, remain them."
- Many of those who are attracted to these kind of program they may not only recent but even welcome directive advice and guidance from someone who have learned to like, respect and accept as their leaders.
- Most of effective in meeting people short term needs and less effective for the long term goal of helping them to realize their full potentialities as person.

\section*{Non-Directive Approach}

The worker who uses non-directive approach does not attempt to decide people or to lead, guide and pursue them any of the specific conclusion about what is good for them.
- He/She tries to get them to decide for themselves what their needs are what if anything they are willing to do meet the goal and how they can best organize, plan and act to carry their project through.
- $\mathrm{He} /$ She aims at stimulating a process, a self-determination and self-help, she/she values it for all the potential experience which participation provides in the process.

\section*{CHAPTER NINE: QUALITY ASSURANCE, MONITORING AND EVALUATION}

Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements.

\section*{Quality Management}

The act of overseeing different activities and tasks within an organization to ensure consistent delivery of products and services

\section*{What is Quality Management?}

Quality management is the act of overseeing different activities and tasks within an organization to ensure that products and services offered, as well as the means used to provide them, are consistent. It helps to achieve and maintain a desired level of quality within the organization.

Quality management consists of four key components, which include the following:
- Quality Planning - The process of identifying the quality standards relevant to the project and deciding how to meet them.
- Quality Improvement - The purposeful change of a process to improve the confidence or reliability of the outcome.
- Quality Control - The continuing effort to uphold a process's integrity and reliability in achieving an outcome.
- Quality Assurance - The systematic or planned actions necessary to offer sufficient reliability so that a particular service or product will meet the specified requirements.

The aim of quality management is to ensure that all the organization's stakeholders work together to improve the company's processes, products, services, and culture to achieve the longterm success that stems from customer satisfaction.

The process of quality management involves a collection of guidelines that are developed by a team to ensure that the products and services that they produce are of the right standards or fit for a specified purpose.
- The process starts when the organization sets quality targets to be met and which are agreed upon with the customer.
- The organization then defines how the targets will be measured. It takes the actions that are required to measure quality. It then identifies any quality issues that arise and initiates improvements.
- The final step involves reporting the overall level of the quality achieved.

\section*{Principles of Quality Management}

There are several principles of quality management that the International Standard for Quality Management adopts. These principles are used by top management to guide an organization's processes towards improved performance. They include:

\section*{1. Customer Focus}

The primary focus of any organization should be to meet and exceed the customers' expectations and needs. When an organization can understand the customers' current and future needs and cater to them, that results in customer loyalty, which in turn increases revenue. The business is also able to identify new customer opportunities and satisfy them. When business processes are more efficient, quality is higher and more customers can be satisfied.

\section*{2. Leadership}

Good leadership results in an organization's success. Great leadership establishes unity and purpose among the workforce and shareholders. Creating a thriving company culture provides an internal environment that allows employees to fully realize their potential and get actively involved in achieving company objectives. Leaders should involve the employees in setting clear organizational goals and objectives. This motivates employees, who may significantly improve their productivity and loyalty.

\section*{3. Engagement of People}

Staff involvement is another fundamental principle. The management engages staff in creating and delivering value whether they are full-time, part-time, outsourced, or in-house. An organization should encourage the employees to constantly improve their skills and maintain consistency. This principle also involves empowering the employees, involving them in decision making and recognizing their achievements. When people are valued, they work to their best
potential because it boosts their confidence and motivation. When employees are wholly involved, it makes them feel empowered and accountable for their actions.

\section*{4. Process Approach}

The performance of an organization is crucial according to the process approach principle. The approach principle emphasizes achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the organizational processes. The approach entails an understanding that good processes result in improved consistency, quicker activities, reduced costs, waste removal, and continuous improvement. An organization is enhanced when leaders can manage and control the inputs and the outputs of an organization, as well as the processes used to produce the outputs.

\section*{5. Continuous Improvement}

Every organization should come up with an objective to be actively involved in continuous improvement. Businesses that improve continually experience improved performance, organizational flexibility, and increased ability to embrace new opportunities. Businesses should be able to create new processes continually and adapt to new market situations.

\section*{6. Evidence-based Decision Making}

Businesses should adopt a factual approach to decision-making. Businesses that make decisions based on verified and analyzed data have an improved understanding of the marketplace. They are able to perform tasks that produce desired results and justify their past decisions. Factual decision making is vital to help understand the cause-and-effect relationships of different things and explain potential unintended results and consequences.

\section*{7. Relationship Management}

Relationship management is about creating mutually beneficial relations with suppliers and retailers. Different interested parties can impact a company's performance. The organization should manage the supply chain process well and promote the relationship between the organization and its suppliers to optimize their impact on the company's performance. When an organization manages its relationship with interested parties well, it is more likely to achieve sustained business collaboration and success.

\section*{Benefits of Quality Management}
- It helps an organization achieve greater consistency in tasks and activities that are involved in the production of products and services.
- It increases efficiency in processes, reduces wastage, and improves the use of time and other resources.
- It helps improve customer satisfaction.
- It enables businesses to market their business effectively and exploit new markets.
- It makes it easier for businesses to integrate new employees, and thus helps businesses manage growth more seamlessly.
- It enables a business to continuously improve their products, processes, and systems.

\section*{METHODS FOR MEASURING SERVICE QUALITY}

\section*{1.Post-service ratings}

This is the practice of asking customers to rate the service right after it's been delivered. This is our favorite approach, because the memory of the service is still fresh and undiluted.

\section*{2.Follow-up surveys}

With this method, you ask your customers to rate your service quality through an email survey for example via Google Forms . It has advantages and disadvantages compared to the postservice rating.

One advantage is that it gives your customer the time and space for more detailed responses.
It also provides a more holistic overview of your service. Instead of a case-by-case assessment, the follow-up survey measures your customers' overall opinion of your service.

But there are downsides as well. Such as the fact that the average person's inbox already looks more like a jungle than a French garden. Nobody's waiting for more emails especially those that don't promise any benefit for the recipient.

With a follow-up survey, the service experience will also be less fresh in mind. Your customers might have forgotten about the experience entirely, or they could confuse it with another experience.

\section*{3.In-app surveys}

With an in-app survey, the questions are asked while the visitor is on the website or in the app, instead of after the service or via email. It can be one simple question - e.g. "How would you rate our service?" - or it could be a couple of questions.

\section*{4.Documentation analysis}

With this qualitative approach you read through/listen to your written/recorded service records. Those doing this quality assurance then check whether the support agents took the right actions or not. They can then process this into constructive feedback, or follow up with the customer for damage control if necessary.

You'll definitely want to go through the transcripts of low-rated service deliveries, but it can also be interesting to read through the documentation of service agents that always rank high.

\section*{5.First contact resolution ratio}

First contact resolution takes place when a customer reaches out to support with a question or issue, and they receive a resolution in that first session. So no follow-up emails, call-backs, etc.

\section*{TOOLS OF MEASURING QUALITY.}

\section*{1. Stratification}

Stratification analysis is a quality assurance tool used to sort data, objects, and people into separate and distinct groups. Separating your data using stratification can help you determine its meaning, revealing patterns that might not otherwise be visible when it's been lumped together. Whether you're looking at equipment, products, shifts, materials, or even days of the week, stratification analysis lets you make sense of your data before, during, and after its collection.

\section*{2. Histogram}

Quality professionals are often tasked with analyzing and interpreting the behavior of different groups of data in an effort to manage quality. This is where quality control tools like the histogram come into play.

The histogram can help you represent frequency distribution of data clearly and concisely amongst different groups of a sample, allowing you to quickly and easily identify areas of improvement within your processes. With a structure similar to a bar graph, each bar within a histogram represents a group, while the height of the bar represents the frequency of data within that group.

Histograms are particularly helpful when breaking down the frequency of your data into categories such as age, days of the week, physical measurements, or any other category that can be listed in chronological or numerical order.

\section*{3. Check sheet (or tally sheet)}

Check sheets can be used to collect quantitative or qualitative data. When used to collect quantitative data, they can be called a tally sheet. A check sheet collects data in the form of check or tally marks that indicate how many times a particular value has occurred, allowing you to quickly zero in on defects or errors within your process or product, defect patterns, and even causes of specific defects.

With its simple setup and easy-to-read graphics, check sheets make it easy to record preliminary frequency distribution data when measuring out processes. This particular graphic can be used as a preliminary data collection tool when creating histograms, bar graphs, and other quality tools.

\section*{4. Cause-and-effect diagram (also known as a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram)}

Introduced by Kaoru Ishikawa, the fishbone diagram helps users identify the various factors (or causes) leading to an effect, usually depicted as a problem to be solved. Named for its resemblance to a fishbone, this quality management tool works by defining a quality-related problem on the right-hand side of the diagram, with individual root causes and sub causes branching off to its left.

A fishbone diagram's causes and subcauses are usually grouped into six main groups, including measurements, materials, personnel, environment, methods, and machines. These categories can help you identify the probable source of your problem while keeping your diagram structured and orderly.

\section*{5. Pareto chart (80-20 rule)}

As a quality control tool, the Pareto chart operates according to the $80-20$ rule. This rule assumes that in any process, $80 \%$ of a process's or system's problems are caused by $20 \%$ of major factors, often referred to as the "vital few." The remaining $20 \%$ of problems are caused by $80 \%$ of minor factors.

A combination of a bar and line graph, the Pareto chart depicts individual values in descending order using bars, while the cumulative total is represented by the line.

The goal of the Pareto chart is to highlight the relative importance of a variety of parameters, allowing you to identify and focus your efforts on the factors with the biggest impact on a specific part of a process or system.

\section*{6. Scatter diagram}

Out of the seven quality tools, the scatter diagram is most useful in depicting the relationship between two variables, which is ideal for quality assurance professionals trying to identify cause and effect relationships.

With dependent values on the diagram's Y -axis and independent values on the X -axis, each dot represents a common intersection point. When joined, these dots can highlight the relationship between the two variables. The stronger the correlation in your diagram, the stronger the relationship between variables.

Scatter diagrams can prove useful as a quality control tool when used to define relationships between quality defects and possible causes such as environment, activity, personnel, and other variables. Once the relationship between a particular defect and its cause has been established, you can implement focused solutions with (hopefully) better outcomes.

\section*{7. Control chart (also called a Shewhart chart)}

Named after Walter A. Shewhart, this quality improvement tool can help quality assurance professionals determine whether or not a process is stable and predictable, making it easy for you to identify factors that might lead to variations or defects.

Control charts use a central line to depict an average or mean, as well as an upper and lower line to depict upper and lower control limits based on historical data. By comparing historical data to data collected from your current process, you can determine whether your current process is controlled or affected by specific variations.

Using a control chart can save your organization time and money by predicting process performance, particularly in terms of what your customer or organization expects in your final product.

\section*{STANDARDS OF CARE IN NURSING}

Standards of care in nursing are important because they recognize the trusted role that a nurse plays. These standards are considered the baseline for quality care. They must be developed while assessing the state and federal rules, regulations and laws that govern the practice of nursing. Other agencies and organizations may also assist in the development of these standards. Standards of care apply equally to nurses in various settings. They govern the nurse's practice at every level of practice.

Often, standards of care are established at the national level so that care will be the same regardless of the venue. However, states and local areas may also establish their own set of standards of care.

\section*{Importance of Standards}

Nursing standards of care are important for a number of reasons.

They outline professional expectations of nurses.
Additionally, they guide nurses on proper protocol and give them an objective standard to evaluate other nurses with.

They provide consistency throughout the profession so that patients receive quality care.
Ultimately, standards give nurses the necessary information that they need to know the quality of care that they must provide to patients and establish measures in which to evaluate the care provided.

Generally, nurses are expected to be in compliance with these standards and to ensure that their own underlings are in compliance. It is critical that they comply with these standards in order to protect the public whom they treat.

\section*{Policies and Procedures in Nursing Practice}

Policies and procedures in nursing practice are important for nurses to perform and to deliver quality of care and patient safety.

Policies and procedures help nurses to prevent errors and carry out procedures safely to the patients. It also brings uniformity in following organizational guidelines.

Policies and procedures are designed to influence and determine major decisions and actions, and activities that take place within the boundaries set by them.

Procedures are the specific methods employed to express policies in action in day to day operations.

Policies and procedures are made for the users easily understandable, well organized, and easily accessible.

\section*{MONITORING AND EVALUATION}

Monitoring is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing and using information to track a programme's progress toward reaching its objectives and to guide management decisions. Monitoring usually focuses on processes, such as when and where activities occur, who delivers them and how many people or entities they reach.

Monitoring is the systematic and routine collection of information from projects and programmes for four main purposes:
- To learn from experiences to improve practices and activities in the future;
- To have internal and external accountability of the resources used and the results obtained;
- To take informed decisions on the future of the initiative;
- To promote empowerment of beneficiaries of the initiative.

Monitoring allows results, processes and experiences to be documented and used as a basis to steer decision-making and learning processes. Monitoring is checking progress against plans. The data acquired through monitoring is used for evaluation.

Evaluation is assessing, as systematically and objectively as possible, a completed project or programme (or a phase of an ongoing project or programme that has been completed).

Evaluations appraise data and information that inform strategic decisions, thus improving the project or programme in the future.

Evaluations should help to draw conclusions about five main aspects of the intervention:
- relevance
- effectiveness
- efficiency
- impact
- sustainability

Information gathered in relation to these aspects during the monitoring process provides the basis for the evaluative analysis.

In general, monitoring is integral to evaluation. During an evaluation, information from previous monitoring processes is used to understand the ways in which the project or programme developed and stimulated change. Monitoring focuses on the measurement of the following aspects of an intervention:
- On quantity and quality of the implemented activities (outputs: What do we do? How do we manage our activities?)
- On processes inherent to a project or programme (outcomes: What were the effects /changes that occurred as a result of your intervention?)
- On processes external to an intervention (impact: Which broader, long-term effects were triggered by the implemented activities in combination with other environmental factors?)

The evaluation process is an analysis or interpretation of the collected data which delves deeper into the relationships between the results of the project/programme, the effects produced by the project/programme and the overall impact of the project/programme.

\section*{Evaluation Criteria}

Evaluations are typically carried out using the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria. Grantees will be expected to plan for, and conduct evaluations that assess their project against the following criteria.
- Relevance: The extent to which the aid activity is suited to the priorities and policies of the target group, recipient and donor.
- Effectiveness: A measure of the extent to which an aid activity attains its objectives.
- Efficiency: Efficiency measures the outputs -- qualitative and quantitative -- in relation to the inputs. It is an economic term, which signifies that the aid uses the least costly resources possible in order to achieve the desired results.
- Impact: The positive and negative changes produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended. This involves the main impacts and effects resulting from the activity on the local social, economic, environmental and other development indicators. The examination should be concerned with both intended and unintended results and must also include the positive and negative impact of external factors, such as changes in terms of trade and financial conditions.
- Sustainability: Sustainability is concerned with measuring whether the benefits of an activity are likely to continue after donor funding has been withdrawn. Projects need to be environmentally as well as financially sustainable.

\section*{MONITORING TOOLS}

\section*{1. Employee Monitoring Software}

Whether you want to keep track of your in-office or remote team, online employee monitoring technology may be the solution.

Employee monitoring and productivity software is the most widely used method to keep track of your employees today. This is probably because employee tracking software provides the most direct employee monitoring experience compared to the other methods we'll discuss here.

They're also the least invasive way to monitor your employees - and can be used by inoffice and remote work teams!

An excellent employee monitoring tool should offer various functionalities like time tracking, distraction management, and features to differentiate between productive and unproductive activities.

\section*{2. Video Surveillance}

CCTV cameras are part of the most common surveillance technology you'll find in almost every workplace today. Many employers use this method of employee surveillance to prevent misbehavior and for safety reasons.

While CCTV cameras can show you whether your employees are at their workstations, it doesn't help you recognize if they're productive or not.

However, it's important to note that some countries require businesses to install video surveillance systems to assist their workplace safety measures better.

\section*{3. Network and Email Monitoring}

Network and email monitoring is a more direct way of monitoring employees.
Here's how they help you keep tabs on your employees:

\section*{A. Network Monitoring}

Network monitoring is a process that involves analyzing all the incoming and outgoing traffic from your office network.

A network monitoring system can monitor malicious programs, infected workstations, and even unusual internet usage in your organization. You can also check if your employees are accessing unproductive sites, like social media, during work.

\section*{B. Email Monitoring}

Work email addresses are meant only for official or work-related purposes.

If you're an employee, your office IT team/administrator usually has complete control over your email inbox. That's why employees are heavily discouraged from using their work email account for personal purposes.

The only valid reason to use email monitoring at work is to check if employees are using their official email IDs to send out private email messages.

However, there are better ways to prevent workers from misusing an employee's email address. For example, instead of monitoring all employee communication, you could use a filter to block non-work emails from reaching the staff's inboxes.

\section*{4. Keycards and Biometric Terminals}

Here's how keycards and biometric terminals can help monitor employees:

\section*{A. Keycards}

Keycards are used by many companies, especially those with high security levels, to protect trade secrets.

Each keycard is linked to its owner, which means you can set individual security settings for each employee.

Keycards are mostly used to restrict employees from accessing unauthorized locations within the office. For example, every access point in your office will have a keycard sensor that only allows people carrying authorized keycards to enter.

You can also use keycards to monitor employee attendance and track the physical location of employees within the office premises.

However, keycards can't show you whether your employees are actually tending to their work or just idling at their workstations. Additionally, it doesn't help with remote work monitoring.

\section*{B. Biometric Terminals}

Biometric terminals are great for companies that demand very high levels of security. These systems either have fingerprint or iris scanners on doors that lead to restricted areas.

They're better than keycards at security since they're less susceptible to data breaches and theft. However, you can only use them to keep employees out of restricted areas.

\section*{5. GPS Tracking}

GPS tracking helps businesses keep track of employees who are always out on the field, like construction engineers or delivery drivers.

But there are certain limitations when it comes to GPS tracking.

For example, while you can always fit a tracker to a company vehicle to see its location in realtime, you can't always force employees to download tracking apps on their personal smartphones.

\section*{KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORGANIZATION}

\section*{1. Customer satisfaction}

Our service at the end of the day is to serve our customers and clients. So, the ultimate measure of success in a project is customer satisfaction. Surveys are carried out to get their feedback.

\section*{2. Productivity}

Productivity measures the output of a resource as compared to its input. For every unit of input, what is the output? One way to measure this would be revenue per employee; the ratio of revenue per employee to the average salary per employee gives a productivity ratio for the organization. We could measure the number of projects done per employee or the number of lines of code per employee as well.

\section*{3. Cost efficiency}

Cost Performance Index is the ratio of the value earned and the cost incurred to obtain that value. This helps organizations reduce financial risk by keeping the capital cost in check and allocating the capital wisely.

\section*{4. Time}

The time taken from the beginning to the end of a project is referred to as the cycle time. Similar schemes can have a standard benchmark of cycle time to measure against. A shorter cycle time means a faster return on investment to the organization. Also, giving time for more projects to be taken up.

\section*{5. Return on investment (ROI)}

ROI can be calculated as the total benefit divided by the total cost, expressed as a percentage (multiply by 100). It measures the returns for every dollar invested. Benefits can include the profits, cost savings, increased outputs expressed as a dollar amount while costs can consist of the cost of resources, travel expenses, cost of design and maintenance of a project, etc.

\section*{6. Alignment with goals of the organization}

You also need to measure if the projects you are doing are right for you keeping in mind the purposes of the organization as a whole. Surveys can be conducted along with alignment ratings where the business managers, leaders and project managers are the participants.

With these KPIs in mind, you are on your way to effectively manage any project that serves the goals of your organization.

\section*{SETTING TARGETS FOR YOUR COMPANY}

Setting performance targets can help you deliver the strategic changes that many growing businesses need to make. The top-level objectives of your strategic plan can be implemented through departmental goals, and setting targets based on KPIs is an ideal way of doing this.

For example, a company seeking to expand on the basis of its product design capabilities might target year-on-year increases in the number of patents it secures, new product launches, or licensing income. The specifics will depend on which KPIs best capture the dynamics in the market.

\section*{Setting SMART targets}

Your targets should be SMART - specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound:
- Using KPIs ensures your targets will meet the first two criteria, as all KPIs should, by definition, be specificand measurable.
- Achievable- you need to set ambitious targets that will motivate and inspire your employees. Look back at your recent performance to get a sense of what is feasible.
- Realistic- setting realistic targets means being fair on the people who will have to reach them. Make sure you only ask for performance improvements in areas that your staff can actually influence.
- Time-bound- people's progress towards a goal will be more rapid if they have a clear sense of the deadlines against which their progress will be assessed.

\section*{WORK PLAN}

A work plan is a set of goals and processes by which a team can accomplish those goals. It can be used in professional or private life and help you stay organized while working on projects.

A work plan is an important tool that helps a project to assign tasks, manage workflow and track the various components and milestone deadlines. A work plan often has a duration of six to 12 months, but it can be adjusted, based on a specific need within the company. Implementing work plans helps articulate strategies to employees in a way to improve team member focus and drive. Businesses use a work plan to organize large projects. A work plan gives everyone on the team the project framework and the background, goals and timelines are defined for the overall project. A work plan then breaks down the tasks, and assigns different items to different project members, giving them individual timelines.

A well-written work plan enables a project manager to oversee the big picture while managing smaller project components. When creating a work plan for your next big project, incorporate common sections.

\section*{Introduction and Background}

Introduce your project by explaining its purpose, and the key reasons why it is necessary. Also provide a background of historical and statistical data as it relates to the project's objective, so that it supports why the project will resolve a specific problem or issue. This doesn't need to be a long section, but it must define concisely what the project is about.

\section*{Project Scope and Team}

Elaborate on the purpose of the project by defining the project's entire scope. Explain the problem and how the project delivers the needed solution. Break things down, and define the departments or who are the key players and what are their assignments.

For example, a mortgage company needs a new secured server that has upgraded client data security. The company project lead or an internet tech-company consultant creates a work plan that explains how the company and its team will work with existing key mortgage company personnel who will develop a new server system, and will have a strategic plan to migrate the data in a seamless fashion.

\section*{Schedule and Timelines}

Time is money, and business owners can't have projects that drag on. A well-written work plan sets a deadline for the project's completion and establishes timelines for the key project deliverables. Specific teams or specific individuals are assigned tasks, including notifying a new department when the task is completed, which triggers a new deliverable timeline.

You might find that some tasks on a project operate simultaneously while other tasks cannot start until someone else delivers his part of the project. For example, with the IT secured server, the data cannot migrate until the security protocol is complete. But a compilation of client data and key company information can be compiled while the security protocol is being created so that the data is prepared when the server is ready.

\section*{Budget Planning and Monitoring}

Every work plan needs to establish a budget. Budgets are often defined by a project's total cost and are then further broken down into department or subcontractor costs. Some project managers account for hourly wages and the necessary overtime so they can implement final components during a large project.

Project managers must continuously monitor the budget on the project, especially if hourly wages and overtime are part of the budget. Underestimating the amount of time that employees devote to a project can quickly lead to overspending and running out of money before the project is complete. Keep the team moving quickly and efficiently to stay on budget.

\section*{Quality Control and Continuity Plan}

Project managers must review the deliverables and monitor its progress, making sure that things are done properly. When a big project is done, two courses of action result. The first is to implement and move on. The second is to implement and maintain.

With the example of the IT server creation for the mortgage company, the project manager should have the ability to make sure that the correct data is being compiled for migration to test deliverables at various times to make certain that things are working properly.

\section*{Secondary Plans for Some Projects}

This type of project needs maintenance. Establish a secondary plan that has a budget to review, and to troubleshoot and maintain the server. The continuity plan might move some outside contractors to internal maintenance or might contract the vendor to periodically work on the system to upgrade items and troubleshoot problems. A work plan should look beyond the main project completion so that it is a comprehensive plan.

\section*{REPORT WRITING}

A report is a specific form of writing that is organised to identify and examine issues, events, or findings that have happened in a physical sense, within an organisation, or findings from a research investigation.

\section*{FORMAT OF A REPORT}

\section*{1. Title Section}

The format of the title section of your report would depend on the length of the said document. Short reports may include just the author, date prepared, and other information deemed necessary. Long reports, on the other hand, may require designated pages for its table of contents and definition of terms as well.

\section*{2. Summary}

A summary is an essential part of any lengthy document. It should provide an overview of the report's content for readers to refer to. Since some people choose to skim through the summary rather than read the whole report, this section must consist of the key points, conclusion, and
recommendations. Relevant information must be presented accordingly for the audience to comprehend. It would be best to write this portion by the very end of the writing process to ensure that every major detail is included in the report.

\section*{3. Introduction}

The introduction of your report should explain the problem at hand along with the purpose of preparing the report. You may also insert the definition of terms in this part if you have failed to include it in the title section. An explanation about how the details of the report are arranged must also be presented to provide a general overview for readers.

\section*{4. Body}

The body of your report typically consists of the most number of pages. It may also be broken down into subparts with subtitles that support and expound the major points stated in the report. These subparts may vary depending on the type of report you are creating as well. Information is typically arranged according to its level of importance, with the most significant data coming first.

\section*{5. Conclusion}

This part connects everything together. Similar to the summary, most people read this section to study the data and results gathered in the report. For this reason alone, crafting a conclusion that is free of jargon is important. Instead of repeating everything you have mentioned in your report, you must present your final thoughts or statement on the subject at hand.

\section*{6. Recommendations}

Any suggestions or additional actions that need to be taken are discussed in this part of the report. Any limitations or concerns that you have failed to tackle in your report must be stated for future reference as well. In most cases, recommendations are presented in order of priority.

\section*{7. Appendices}

Technical details of your report are usually found in this section. Experts in the given field usually consider this section critical for further studies. This may either be in a statistical, explanatory or bibliographical nature.

\section*{TYPES OF REPORTS}

\section*{Long Report and Short Reports:}

These kinds of reports are quite clear, as the name suggests. A two-page report or sometimes referred to as a memorandum is short, and a thirty-page report is absolutely long. But what makes a clear division of short reports or long reports? Well, usually, notice that longer reports are generally written in a formal manner.

\section*{Internal and External Reports:}

As the name suggests, an internal report stays within a certain organization or group of people. In the case of office settings, internal reports are for within the organization.

We prepare external reports, such as a news report in the newspaper about an incident or the annual reports of companies for distribution outside the organization. We call these as public reports.

\section*{Vertical and Lateral Reports:}

This is about the hierarchy of the reports' ultimate target. If the report is for your management or for your mentees, it's a vertical report. Wherever a direction of upwards or downwards comes into motion, we call it a vertical report.

Lateral reports, on the other hand, assist in coordination in the organization. A report traveling between units of the same organization level (for example, a report among the administration and finance departments) is lateral.

\section*{Periodic Reports:}

Periodic reports are sent out on regularly pre-scheduled dates. In most cases, their direction is upward and serves as management control. Some, like annual reports, is not vertical but is a Government mandate to be periodic in nature.

That is why we have annual or quarterly or half-yearly reports. If they are this frequent, it only makes sense to pre-set the structure of these reports and just fill in the data every period. That's exactly what happens in most cases too.

\section*{Formal and Informal Reports:}

Formal reports are meticulously structured. They focus on objectivity and organization, contain deeper detail, and the writer must write them in a style that eliminates factors like personal pronouns.

Informal reports are usually short messages with free-flowing, casual use of language. We generally describe the internal report/memorandum as an informal report. For example, a report among your peers, or a report for your small group or team, etc.

\section*{Informational and Analytical Reports:}

Informational reports (attendance reports, annual budget reports, monthly financial reports, and such) carry objective information from one area of an organization to maybe a larger system.

Analytical reports (scientific research, feasibility reports, and employee appraisals) show attempts to solve actual problems. These analytical reports usually require suggestions at the end.

\section*{Proposal Reports:}

These kinds of reports are like an extension to the analytical/problem-solving reports. A proposal is a document one prepares to describe how one organization can provide a solution to a problem they are facing.

There's usually always a need to prepare a report in a business set-up. The end goal is usually very solution-oriented. We call such kinds of reports as proposal reports.

\section*{Functional Reports:}

These kinds of reports include marketing reports, financial reports, accounting reports, and a spectrum of other reports that provide a function specifically. By and large, we can include almost all reports in most of these categories. Furthermore, we can include a single report in several kinds of reports.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD REPORT}

\section*{1. Precision}

In a good report, the report writer is very clear about the exact and definite purpose of writing the
report. His investigation, analysis, recommendations and others are directed by this central purpose.

Precision of a report provides the unity to the report and makes it a valuable document for best usage.

\section*{2. Accuracy of Facts}

Information contained in a report must be based on accurate facts.
Since decisions are taken based on report information, any inaccurate information or statistics will lead to a wrong decision. It will hamper to ensure the achievement of the organizational goal.

If a report is not accurate grammatically, then it will have lost its usefulness to its users.
So, while writing a report, a reporter should keep in head about the grammatical accuracy of his writing.

\section*{8. Unbiased Recommendation}

Recommendation on report usually make effect on the reader mind.
So if recommendations are made at the end of a report, they must be impartial and objective.
They should come as logical conclusion for investigation and analysis.
A reporter should try to use universal and proven truth in his report rather than using the concept which is not yet established or completed.

\section*{9. Clarity}

Clarity depends on proper arrangement of facts. A good report is absolutely clear.
Reporter should make his purpose clear, define his sources, state his findings and finally make necessary recommendation.

To be an effective communication through report, A report must be clear to understand for making communication success.

\section*{10. Attractive Presentation}

Presentation of a report is also a factor which should be consider for a good report. A good report provides a catchy and smart look and creates attention of the reader.

Structure, content, language, typing and presentation style of a good report should be attractive to make a clear impression in the mind of its reader.

\section*{11. Complete Information}

A good report shown important information. Most of these information is analyzed as the basis of importancy. A good reporter has to show the skill in such cases efficiently.

A good reporter should have shown information as importance and not much so that the report become useless or vague but it should give the read a completeness feeling.

\section*{12. Positivity}

A good report should have the positivity. It should narrate the positive statement instead of showing negative one. Showing positivity in report helps to observe the issue positively which is covered in a report.

\section*{13. Summary}

A good report should have a summary by which the reader of the report can take a decision at all or stand on a decision what to do next in such condition.

A summary can reflect the whole picture at a glance. So, it has a large impact.
So, writing a summary is an important feature of a good report. A good reporter should not forget this.
