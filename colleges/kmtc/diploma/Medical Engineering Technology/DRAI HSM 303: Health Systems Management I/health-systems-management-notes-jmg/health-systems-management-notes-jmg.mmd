\section*{MANAGEMENT CODE:HSM 222}

\section*{LECTURE 1}

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH SYSTEM MANAGEMENT}

\section*{What is Health system Management?}
\& HSM describes the leadership and general management of hospitals, their networks and other health delivery establishments

A health service manager is responsible for the provision of local healthcare through the management of hospital, general practitioner (GP) and community health services.
- © Managers liaise with clinical and non-clinical staf and other partner organisations, whilst considering the demands of political policy and local circumstances.
- There is a huge range of managerial roles within health services: finance, human resources, clinical management, staf management, project management and procurement, information management, facilities management, and operational management.

\section*{Basic concepts}
- System: A collection of components that work together to achieve a common objective
- Information System : A system that provides information support to the decisionmaking process at each level of an organization
- Health Information System: A system that integrates data collection, processing, reporting, and use of the information necessary for improving health service efectiveness and efficiency through better management at all levels of health services
- Health Management Information System: An information system specially designed to assist in the management and planning of health programmes, as opposed to delivery of care.
- World Health Organization (WHO) defines a health system as the sum of the organizations, institutions, and resources whose shared primary purpose is to improve health.
The broad health system includes everyone responsible for good health, from the family in a rural village to the surgeon in a hospital in the capital city.
It encompasses sanitation and nutrition, involves all branches of government, and operates within the public sector, civil society, and for-profit entities

Six building blocks constitute the overarching WHO health systems framework.
1. Service delivery

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
2. Health workforce
3. Information
4. Medical products, vaccines, and technologies
5. Financing
6. Leadership and governance (stewardship)

\section*{How do we to strengthen them so they are aligned to achieve positive health outcomes.}
1. Leadership and governance procedures and practices including planning that engenderommitment and accountability
2. Human resource policies and procedures that produce a supported and motivated workforce
3. Financial management, which is concerned with accounting and budgeting, along with the related reporting and analysis that make it possible to ensure that the organization's resources are used in the service of its mission, for maximum impact, in compliance with laws and donor requirements, and in accordance with ethical standards and sound operational practices
4. Management of medicines and medical supplies so that the right products are delivered in the right quantities, at the right time, and in the right place and then used appropriately
5. Health information and associated monitoring and evaluation practices that facilitate efective problem solving, informed decision-making, and the formulation of policy based on evidence.
6. Health service delivery that is supported by quality management processes and that addresses the basic health needs of the populations to be served.

\section*{Providing quality health care}

On one side

Nurses, doctors, community health workers, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, midwives, and health facility administrators who lead and govern, manage human resources, financial resources, supplies, and information; and deliver health services.

On the other side

People in the cities, towns, and rural areas who need information and community support to engage in healthseeking behaviors.

\section*{Who are the people at the center of health system?}
- Health managers and administrators who have the knowledge, skills, responsibility, and authority to build and maintain the management systems needed to deliver health services
- Personnel at all levels, including health care providers and administrators, who use the management systems to address challenges and achieve results;
- Communities and families that are educated and empowered to promote their own health and demand quality services;
- Clients who have adequate information to use health services appropriately .

\section*{Millennium development goals}

Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger
Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education
Goal 3. Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women
Goals 4 and 5: Reduce Child Mortality and Improve Maternal Health
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDs, Malaria and Other diseases
Goal 7: Ensure Environmental sustainability
Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for development

\section*{Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality}

\section*{Target:}
- Reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate

\section*{Indicators for Monitoring Progress:}
- Under-five mortality rate
- Infant mortality rate
- Proportion of 1-year old children immunized against measles

\section*{Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health}

\section*{Target 5A:}
- Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio Indicators for Monitoring Progress:
- Maternal mortality ratio

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel

Target 5b:
- Achieve by 2015, universal access to reproductive health

\section*{Indicators for Monitoring Progress:}
- Contraceptive prevalence rate
- Adolescent birth rate
- Antenatal care coverage (at least one visit and at least four visits)
- Unmet need for family planning

\section*{Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other Diseases.}

\section*{Target 6 A:}

Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDs
Indicators for Monitoring Progress:
- HIV prevalence among population aged 15-24 years
- Condom use at last high-risk sex
- Proportion of population aged 15-24 years with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS
- Ratio of school attendance of orphans to school attendance of non-orphans aged 10-14 years

\section*{Target 6 B:}

Achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDs for all those who need it

\section*{Indicator for Monitoring Progress:}
- Proportion of population with advanced HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs

\section*{Target 6 C:}

Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases Indicators for Monitoring Progress:
- Incidence and death rates associated with malaria
- Proportion of children under five sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN)
- Proportion of children under 5 with fever who are treated with appropriate antimalaria drugs
- Incidence, prevalence and death rates associated with tuberculosis
- Proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under directly observed treatment short (DOTS) course

\section*{CHALLENGES FACING THE HEALTH SECTOR}
- Insufficient skilled human resources. Moreover, there is mal-distribution of the available health personnel, with some rural dispensaries being unmanned.
- Inadequate budgetary allocations, poor infrastructure, materials and high prevalence of poverty prevents targeted populations from accessing services such as ITNs and inadequate emergency facilities. Eg. The health sector received $8.4 \%$ of the total Government budgetary allocation in 2008/09 financial year, which is lower than the Abuja Declaration target of $15 \%$.
- The lack of national policy framework and identification of specific programmes to enable accessibility of reproductive services by young People.
- Slow reduction in maternal mortality rates, which have a direct relationship with the health of the children.
- The low cost and apparent improved service provision has increased utilization of services in public health facilities, which has had a negative impact on services ofered by other service providers, especially the Faith Based Organizations. This is inspite of the fact that a total of 70 doctors and 379 nurses have been seconded to the Faith Based Organizations.
- Assessment of some of the performance targets and indicators such as infant and under-five mortality through field surveys are conducted several years apart
- Weak management systems including strengthening of decentralization of healthcare systems.
- Sustained availability of required supplies and equipment.
- Establishment of a viable and sustainable national health insurance system to improve access to healthcare services, particularly for the poor and vulnerable.

\section*{LECTURE 2:}

\section*{CONCEPTS OF MANAGEMENT}

What is management? According to Harold Koontz "Management is an art of getting things done through and with the people in formally organized groups.

It is an art of creating an environment in which people can perform and individuals and can cooperate towards attainment of group goals"

\section*{There are three levels of management:}
- Top
- Middle
- Lower
1. Top management level

It consists of board of: directors, chief executive or managing director. The top management is the ultimate source of authority and it manages goals and policies for an enterprise. It devotes more time on planning and coordinating functions.

2. Mid level management

The branch managers and departmental managers constitute middle level They devote more time to organizational and directional functions. In small organization, there is only one layer of middle level of management but in big enterprises, there may be senior and junior middle level management

\section*{Roles of mid level mangaement}

\section*{Henry Fayol's 14 Principles of Management}
1. Division of work: Division of work or specialization alone can give maximum productivity and efficiency. Both technical and managerial activities can be performed in the best manner only through division of labour and specialization.
2. Authority and Responsibility: The right to give order is called authority. The obligation to accomplish is called responsibility. Authority and Responsibility are the two sides of the management coin. They exist together. They are complementary and mutually interdependent.
3. Discipline: The objectives, rules and regulations, the policies and procedures must be honoured by each member of an organization. There must be clear and fair agreement on the rules and objectives, on the policies and procedures. There must be penalties (punishment) for non-obedience or indiscipline. No organization can work smoothly without discipline preferably voluntary discipline.
4. Equity: An organization consists of a group of people involved in joint efort. Hence, equity must be there. Without equity- no sustained and adequate joint collaboration
5. Unity of Command: In order to avoid any possible confusion and conflict, each member of an organization must receive orders and instructions only from one superior (boss).
6. Unity of Direction: All members of an organization must work together to accomplish common objectives.
7. Emphasis on Subordination: This is also called principle of co-operation. Each shall work for all and all for each. General or common interest must be supreme in any joint enterprise.
8. Order: Fayol suggested that there is a place for everything. Order or system alone can create a sound organization and efficient management. \& Equity: An organization consists of a group of people involved in joint efort. Hence, equity must be there. Without equity- no sustained and adequate joint collaboration
9. Remuneration: Fair pay with non-financial rewards can act as the best incentive or motivator for good performance. Exploitation of employees in any manner must be eliminated. Sound scheme of remuneration includes adequate financial and nonfinancial incentives.
10. Centralization: There must be a good balance between centralization and decentralization of authority and power. Extreme centralization and decentralization must be avoided.
11.Scalar Chain: The unity of command brings about a chain or hierarchy of command linking all members of the organization from the top to the bottom. Scalar denotes steps.
12. Stability of Tenure: A person needs time to adjust himself with the new work and demonstrate efficiency in due course. Hence, employees and managers must have job security. Security of income and employment is a pre-requisite of sound organization and management.
13. Esprit of Co-operation: Esprit de corps is the foundation of a sound organization. Union is strength. But unity demands cooperation. Pride, loyalty and sense of belonging are responsible for good performance.
14. Initiative: Creative thinking and capacity to take initiative can give us sound managerial planning and execution of predetermined plan

\section*{Planning as a tool of management}

According to Koontz O'Donnel - "Planning is an intellectual process, the conscious determination of courses of action, the basing of decisions on purpose, acts and considered estimates.

\section*{Purpose of Planning}
- As a managerial function planning is important due to
- To manage by objectives: All the activities of an organization are designed to achieve certain specified objectives. However, planning makes the objectives more concrete by focusing attention on them.
- To offset uncertainty and change: Future is always full of uncertainties and changes. Planning foresees the future and makes the necessary provisions for it.
- To secure economy in operation: Planning involves, the selection of most profitable course of action that would lead to the best result at the minimum costs.
- To help in co-ordination: Co-ordination is the essence of management, the planning is the base of it. Without planning it is not possible to coordinate the diferent activities of an organization.
- To make control effective: The controlling function of management relates to the comparison of the planned performance with the actual performance. In the absence of plans, a management will have no standards for controlling other's performance.
- To increase organizational effectiveness: efficiency should lead to productivity and efectiveness. Planning enables the manager to measure the organizational efectiveness in the context of the stated objectives and take further actions in this direction.

\section*{Features of Planning}
- It is primary function of management.
- It is an intellectual process
- Focuses on determining the objectives
- Involves choice and decision making
- It is a continuous process

\section*{Classification of}

\section*{Planning On the basis}
of content
1. Strategic Planning. It is the process of deciding on Long-term objectives of the organization. It encompasses all the functional areas of business
2. Tactical Planning .It involves conversion of detailed and specific plans into detailed and specific action plans. It is the blue print for current action and it supports the strategic plans.

\section*{On the basis of time period}
1. Long term planning -Time frame beyond five years. -It specifies what the organization wants to become in long run.
2. Intermediate term planning .Time frame between two and five years. It is designed to implement long term plans.
3. Short term planning .Time frame of one year or less. It provide basis for day to day operations.

\section*{Planning Terminologies}

\section*{- Vision}

Nonspecific directional and motivational guidance for the entire organization. Top managers normally provide a vision for the business. It is the most emotional of the four levels in the hierarchy of purposes.
- Mission

An organization's reason for being. It is concerned with the scope of the business and what distinguishes this business from similar businesses. Mission reflects the culture and values of top management.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Objectives

Objectives refine the mission and address key issues within the organization such as market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and
financial resources, profitability, management and worker performance and efficiency. They are expected to be general, observable, challenging, and untimed.
- Goals

Goals are specific statements of anticipated results that further define the organization's objectives. They are expected to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Rewarding, and Timed.
- Development of tactics is a fifth level of planning. Tactics, the most specific and narrow plans, describe who, what, when, where and how activities will take place to accomplish a goal.

\section*{Strategic Planning}
- Strategic planning is one specific type of planning. Strategies are the outcome of strategic planning.
- An organization's strategies define the business the organization is in, the criteria for entering the business, and the basic actions the organization will follow in conducting its business.
- Strategies are major plans that commit large amounts of the organization's resources to proposed actions, designed to achieve its major objectives and goals. Strategic planning is the process by which the organization's strategies are determined. In the process, three questions are answered:
1. Where are we now?
2. Where do we want to be?
3. How do we get there?
- The "where are we now?" question is answered through the first three steps of the strategy formulation process: (1) perform internal and external environmental analyses, (2) review vision, mission and objectives, and (3) determine SWOT: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. SWOT analysis requires managers to be honest, self-disciplined, and thorough.
- Strengths and weaknesses come from the internal environment of the firm. Strengths can be exploited, built upon, and made key to the accomplishment of mission and objectives. Strengths reflect past accomplishments in production, financial, marketing, and human resource management.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
I. Weaknesses are internal characteristics that have the potential to limit the accomplishment of mission and objectives. Weaknesses may be so important that they need to be addressed before any further strategic planning steps are taken.
Opportunities and threats are uncontrollable by management because they are external to the firm. Opportunities provide the firm with the possibility of a major improvement. Threats may stand in the way of a firm reaching its mission and objectives.

\section*{LECTURE 6}

\section*{DELEGATION. \\ DEF:}
- Passing down of authority from a superior to a subordinate.
- Process of entrusting authority and responsibility from a manager or a supervisor to a subordinate.
- The one to whom authority is delegated becomes responsible to the superior for doing the job, but the superior remains responsible for getting the job done.
- The best way for a manager to effectively concentrate on their responsibilities is by unloading as much of their work as possible.
- Delegation can take place at the individual or organizational level.

\section*{1. Organizational level.}
- The structure of the organization as depicted in the organization chart is itself a reserve of delegation.
- It relates to the position of decision-making in the organization.
- It involves passing down of authority and responsibility to various levels throughout the organization with consideration of centralization, decentralization, provincial levels, district levels, etc., to be established on the basis of tasks or elements of function.

\section*{2. Individual level.}
- It will involve the various activities that have to be undertaken.
- Must be distributed among individual members of the workforce by entrusting authority and responsibility to others.
- Delegation is founded on the concept of:
- Authority.
- Responsibility.
- Accountability.

\section*{Authority.}
- The right to take action or make decisions that the manager would otherwise have done.
- Legitimizes the exercise of power within the structures and rules of the organization.
- Enables the subordinate to issue valued instructions for others to follow.

\section*{Responsibility.}
- Work assigned to a position.
- Involves an obligation by the subordinate to perform certain duties or make certain decisions and having to accept the possible reprimand from the manager or the superior for unsatisfactory performance.

\section*{Accountability.}
- Any means of ensuring that the person who is supposed to do a task actually performs it and does so correctly.
- It requires certain conditions to be established, i.e.,
- Must be thoroughly and clearly understood.
- The person must be qualified and capable of fulfilling the obligation.
- Sufficient authority to accomplish the task must be delegated.
- You cannot delegate authority without responsibility and vice versa.

\section*{EFFECTIVE DELEGATION PROCESS.}

\section*{1. Grant appropriate authority}
- Responsibility should not be less than the authority delegated.
- Enough authority should always be delegated to achieve desired results.
2. Consider the capabilities of the subordinate.
- Authority should be delegated to those who are competent and willing to accept delegation.
- Consider the job to be done, knowledge, experience, intelligence, and limitations of the person(s).
3. Make sure the authority is clearly stated.
- Should be clearly defined not only to the subordinate but to all the others.
- Everyone should know who is in charge and where authority resides.
4. Modify the authority whenever necessary.
- Maintain a flexible attitude about what kind of and how much authority to delegate.
- Because the environment of business is dynamic, authority relationships may need to be altered from time to time.
- Authority is revocable-it can be modified by increasing it, decreasing it, or withdrawing it altogether.
5. Follow unity of command and chain of command.
- There should be clear reporting arrangements.
- Each individual reports to one supervisor.
- Follow the chain of command.
6. Develop willingness to delegate.
- No organization can function without delegation.
- Some obstacles are psychological, e.g., lack of confidence in the staff, fear of losing control, etc.
- The manager should be willing to let go.

\section*{7. Create a supportive climate.}
- Moral and material support should be available, i.e., adequate resources (staff, equipment, expenses, time).
- Advice and encouragement.

\section*{8. Develop an effective communication system.}
- Flow of information between superiors and subordinates.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Enables superiors to give clear instructions and subordinates to seek clarification and guidance.

\section*{9. Establish an effective control system.}
- To ensure authority delegated is properly used.
- Set the standards of performance.
- Evaluate performance.

\section*{10. Give incentives.}
- Financial and non-financial incentives-reward for successful assumption of authority.

\section*{11. Define the results expected.}
- Avoid ambiguous instructions.
- Clearly define expectations.

\section*{RULES OF THUMB OF DELEGATING}

\section*{Rules for the manager}
1. Know the employees' strengths and weaknesses.
2. State tasks clearly-what is to be done, but not how to do it.
3. Delegate a little at a time-break up large projects.
4. Ask for feedback-to ensure the employee understands.
5. Grant enough authority to do the job.
6. Let go and trust the employee to do the job.
7. Provide support only after the employee has had a chance to work out problems.
8. Do not expect the job to be done as you would do it.
9. Evaluate-Is it acceptable or perfect?
10. Provide rewards consistent with the result and level of responsibility.

\section*{Rules for the subordinate.}
1. Recognize assignment and opportunities.
2. Be realistic about what you are able to do.
3. Ask for clarification.
4. Determine the resources available before accepting the assignment.
5. Report progress periodically.
6. Request support or advice if needed.
7. Be creative in solving problems.
8. Use feedback.

\section*{Advantages of delegation.}
1. Extra time for supervisors or managers.
2. Improves morale and productivity.
3. A means of training to assess a person's likely performance at a higher level of authority and responsibility.
4. Recognition for supervisor and subordinate.
5. Decrease in stress.
6. Planning the future, rather than organizing the present.

\section*{Barriers to effective delegation.}
- Managers' perception of subordinate and vice versa.

Manager may fear that the subordinate is not capable or may do too good a job and show the manager in bad light.

\section*{Supervisors' reasons for avoiding delegation.}
a) Lack of trust.
b) Loss of control.
c) Shared recognition, i.e., "someone else may get the credit I deserve."
d) Fear for his or her position. This document is available on

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
e) Lack of time.
f) Lack of incentives.

\section*{Subordinates' reasons for avoiding delegation.}
a) They find it easier to ask the boss to make decisions.
b) Fear of criticism.
c) Believe they lack the necessary information and resources to do the job.
d) Subordinate may already have too much to do.
e) Lack of confidence.
f) Lack of incentives.

\section*{Factors affecting delegation.}
1. Nature of the task:
- Is it appropriate for the employee?
2. Organizational culture:
- Does the employee know organizational goals and policies?
- Do they encourage delegation?
3. Experience of the employee:
- How familiar is the employee with the job?
4. Supervisors' ability:
- Capability of selecting and motivating employees.
5. Employees' knowledge of the job.
6. Willingness of the employee.

\section*{Stages in systematic approach to delegation.}
1. Clarification of policy and procedures.
- Establish and define policies and procedures to provide a framework for the exercise of authority and the acceptance of responsibility.
- Managers must be clear.
- Chain of command with effective communication and coordination between various levels of authority within the organizational structure.
2. Agreement on terms of reference.
- Identify and discuss areas of work the subordinate is to be responsible for.
- Subordinate should understand reasons for delegation, the nature of work, and limitations imposed.
- This involves the acceptance theory:
"Although the authority gives people power to act officially within the scope of their delegation, this power becomes somewhat meaningless unless those affected accept it and respond to it. In most cases, when delegation is made, a subordinate is left free to choose a response within a certain range of behavior. But even then an employee still has the choice of doing it or not doing it and taking the consequences. Therefore, the subordinates control the response to authority. Managers cannot afford to overlook the human part when they use authority."
3. Briefing, guidance, and training.
- Once delegation is accepted, give guidance, briefing, and training.
- Advice on where and to whom to seek help or advice.
4. Review and monitoring.
- Set time limits for delegation.
- Give target dates for the completion of tasks.
- Set the performance standards.
5. Freedom of action.
- Leave the subordinate alone to get on with the job.

\section*{PROBLEM SOLVING}
- A scientific process provides a theoretical framework utilized in attaining solutions to simple or complex problems.
- It is a systematic procedure with a moderate systematic progression.
- You need to gather information about the problem and then identify and state the problem.
- Then start discussing the possible solutions to implement.
- The problem-solving process can be used by anybody to solve day-to-day problems. It requires experience in application.
- The process has 8 phases:
1. Define the problem.
2. Gather the information.
3. Analyze the information.
4. Develop the solutions.
5. Consider the consequences.
6. Make the decisions.
7. Implement decisions.
8. Evaluate the solution.

\section*{LECTURE 7}

\section*{DECISION MAKING}

Decision making is an everyday activity that may be on the spur of the moment or may involve much thought and consultation. It may be emotional or reasoned.

\section*{Definition}

It is the process through which a course of action is selected as a solution to a specific problem.
Or
A choice of option or alternatives.

Steps in decision making i. Define the problem.
ii. Collect relevant data.
iii. Develop alternative solutions.
iv. Assess the consequences.
v. Select the best solution.
vi. Implement solution.
vii. Measure results.

\section*{Problem finding.}
- This refers to a process of identifying problems and making decisions and attempts to solve them.
- It also involves activities with existing problems.
- A problem exists when there is a gap between a given situation and objective.

\section*{Why make decisions.}

We make decisions in order to solve problems and initiate action which will hopefully solve the problem.

\section*{When is it required.}
1. When choosing a particular remedy for solving the problem, e.g., outbreak of cholera, serious accidents, etc.
2. When sorting out objectives, e.g., the policies of the ministry of health.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_4464c451a67c79fba166g-40.jpg?height=91&width=1183&top_left_y=2600&top_left_x=254)

\section*{Stages or requirements in decision making.}
1. Facts - All facts that have an influence on the decision should be known.
2. Analysis - Analyze the facts to weigh the pros and cons.
3. Authority - Formal authority permitting decisions at that level.
4. Action - Takes the decision and implements it.
5. Follow-up - Ensure the decisions are carried out.

\section*{Types of decisions.}
1. Emergency decisions

In a crisis such as accidents, or an issue that calls for immediate action.
2. Routine decisions

Everyday decisions, e.g., reporting time for duty, budget speech, etc.
3. Debatable decisions

These are tough decisions that involve more thought and discussion. They usually bring changes, e.g., constitutional review, salary review, etc.
(Decisions can also be categorized into strategic, operating, and administrative decisions.)

\section*{Kinds of action when making a decision.}
1. Interim action

When one buys time on finding the cause of the problem.
2. Adaptive action

You adapt to the problem so that you live with it, e.g., a disabled man using a wooden leg.
3. Corrective action

When one gets rid of the known cause of the problem, e.g., repairing a leak, performing an operation, etc.
4. Preventive action

When the action taken makes the problem less likely to occur, e.g., putting up a strong roof.
5. Contingency action

Provides standby arrangements to minimize the effects of a serious problem, e.g., generator to cater for power failures or gas.
- Monitor the results of your decision.
- Your decision may be wrong; it is better to admit the fact and change the decision. You will be respected more if you change than to persist in carrying out something that is wrong.

\section*{SUPERVISION}

\section*{DEF:}

- Lack of teamwork leads to incomplete jobs or poor performance. Group values, pride, and purpose cannot be found.

\section*{DEF.}

A team is a group of people who are interdependent and who recognize that the success of each one of them depends on the success of the group.
It is a group in which contributions of individuals are seen as complementary. There should be cohesion, much interaction, mutual support, and a shared perception of issues within a team.

Before forming a team, the following issues should be addressed:
- Size of the team
- Nature of the project
- Requirements of the group
- Roles of members of the team
- Abilities of group members
- Norms of the group

A strong team has a sense of purpose, clear objectives, and goals. Within the group, there should be norms, attitudes, behavior, and discipline. Individual team members should be open about their views, be prepared to confront where necessary, but cooperate with the decisions made by the group.

2. Reduction at source----ways to lessen the amount of material
() Segregation - keeping noninfectious waste out of the infectious waste stream
() Minimization - reduce or eliminate waste at the source
() Engineering controls - methods to reduce quantity of waste(smaller containers)
3. Segregation of hospital waste.
4. Collection \& Categorization of waste.
5. Storage of waste.
6. Transportation of waste.
7. Treatment of waste.

\section*{Steps to Manage Hazardous Wastes before Disposal}
1. Know what hazards you have.
2. Purchase smallest quantity needed, and don't purchase hazardous materials if safe alternative exists (use mercury free thermometer)
3. Limit use and access to trained persons with personal protective gear
4. Use Engineering Controls such as Ventilation, Hoods for Select Hazards.
5. Get Rid of Unnecessary Stuf.
$\bullet$ Don't accumulate unneeded products
() Don't let peroxides and oxidising agents turn into bombs
6. Label of Hazard Warnings.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
inflammable toxic Gas bottle explosive Radiation
7. Communicate about Work -place Hazards
- Job description
- Posters on doors
- Labels on hazards
- Give feedback on use of PPE and disposal in evaluation
- Role model safe use and disposal
- Contact point who is responsible
8. Recycle Products When Possible

\section*{Segregation of waste}
- At the point of generation
- In a color coded leak-proof container
- Container should bear 'Biohazard' symbol and appropriate wording
- Container should never be completely filled

\section*{Segregation of waste should be observed strictly}
- To avoid mixing of general (non-infectious) waste into infectious waste. Once mixed, becomes infectious and should not be removed.
- To reduce infectious waste
- To decrease expenditure on disposal of infectious waste

Wastes requiring pretreatment before disposal
- Microbiological waste

Autoclaving
Final disposal as a general waste- Black Bag
- Tubes used for serum separation, centrifugation of samples, preparation of dilutions etc. sample cups, Tips, Caps. Any other contaminated plastic wares. Use chemical sodium hypochlorite for disinfection. Final Disposal- Blue bag

\section*{Collection, transportation, storage (within the hospital)}
- Waste collected and stored in thick non-corrosive disposable plastic bags or containers of specific colour code.
- The waste in bags or containers should be stored in a separate area, room, or building of a size appropriate to the quantities of waste produced and the frequency of collection.
- Health care waste should be transported within the hospital or other facility by means of hand cart wheeled trolley
