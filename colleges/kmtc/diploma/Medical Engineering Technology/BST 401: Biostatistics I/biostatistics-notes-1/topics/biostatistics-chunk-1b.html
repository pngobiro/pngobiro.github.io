                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i. Nominal scale</h3>
                        <p>Two or more categories eg. male, female or other.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii. Ordinal scale</h3>
                        <p>Groups data into a ranking order eg. good and better.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">iii. Interval scale</h3>
                        <p>Distance between one score to the other. There is some rank but there is no zero eg. 45 and 60 marks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">iv. Ratio scale</h3>
                        <p>There is an absolute zero point eg. <span class="math-inline">$0 \mathrm{~kg}, 60 \mathrm{~kg}$</span>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">V. Binary scale</h3>
                        <p>Divides the score into two eg. married and unmarried.</p>
                        <p>In imperical studies, the data is usually quantitative and can only be analysed quantitatively. In such studies, statistical procedures can be used to analyse the data. The choice of statistical procedure to be applied is determined by the type of measurement scale used in operationalisation of the variable.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">i. Nominal</h4>
                        <p>Its considered the lowest level of measurement. It groups subjects or cases from a sample into categories. Subjects or cases in each have a common set of characteristics. Examples of variables; sex, race, marital status, employment status, language, religion, color, ethnicity.</p>
                        <p>The researcher may include marital status in the study, will then operationalise this variable as; married, single, divorced, separated. We'll then find out from the sample the number that will fall into each category eg. for a sample of subjects, 42 are married, 23 are single, 10 are divorced and 5 are separated. Numbers are assigned to various categories for the purpose of identification eg 1-married, 2-single, 3-divorced, 4separated. The numerals assigned to various categories don't represent the quantity or order hence one can't perform mathematical operations ie. division or subtraction.</p>
                        <p>Dichotomous variable has only 2 categories eg. gender; male or female.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">ii. Ordinal scale</h4>
                        <p>Groups subjects into groups and ranks them into same order, could be increasing order. Numerals are used to represent relative position or order among the values of the variable. However, order indicated in the scale does not imply a quantitative diction. For example, a researcher may want to measure the hardness of materials and use variables hardest, medium, soft.</p>
                        <p>The researcher defines the criteria for measuring different levels of hardness then assign numerical values; 3-hardest category, 2-medium category and 1-soft category. There is no way of knowing the difference in hardness between group 3 and 2 is the same as difference in hardness group 2 and 1.</p>
                        <p>Groups are ranked into increasing order but the interval between groups are not necessarily equal. Ordinal scale doesn't give level of crisition required in a research study, mathematical operation on numerals would yield meaningless values.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">iii. Interval scale</h4>
                        <p>Numerals assigned to each measure are ranked in order and interval between numerals are equal, hence numerals used to represent quantities and mathematical operations on numerals would yield meaningful values. However mathematical operations are limited to additions and deductions while multiplication and division are nor applicable. There is no zero point. example include temperature measurement, test scores.</p>
                        <p>For example if a student scores 60 points and another 30 points, the one who has 60 has twice as many points as the one with 30 points. however, we cants say that the one with 60 points knows twice exactly as much as the one with 30 points. For the student who scores 0 would not imply absolute absence of knowledge.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">iv. Ratio scale</h4>
                        <p>Its the highest level of measurement and most precise method of measuring variables. Would have all characteristics of other scales. The only additional characteristic in this scale is that it has a true zero point and all mathematical operations can be applied and yield meaningful values.</p>
                        <p>Example, height, weight, distance, age, are, blood pressure,. Intervals between numerals are equal. For example a building that is 60 m tall is as twice as tall as a building that's 30 m tall. The difference between 80 kg and 60 kg is the same difference between 60 kg and 40 kg . 0 m indicates absence of height and 0 kg indicates absence of weight.</p>
                        <p>When variables are measured to this scale, powerful statistical procedures can be applied which improves research findings quality from studies and generalisation can be made to a wider population.</p>
