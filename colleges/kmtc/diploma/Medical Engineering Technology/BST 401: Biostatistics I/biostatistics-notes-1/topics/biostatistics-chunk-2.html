                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Graphs can also be used to report and compare measure of central tendency. It can be used to report the sample mean and sample median but rarely do they show mode.</p>
                        <p>Values of graphs can allow several values of mean or mode to be shown simultaneously, therefore is possible to make quick comparison between groups or treatment conditions.</p>
                        <p>When preparing the graph, the values of independent variables are plotted on the horizontal axis and those of dependent variables are plotted on vertical axis.</p>
                        <p>Means or modes are displayed using bar graphs, line graphs or histograms, depending on the scale of measurement used for independent variable.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Line graph</h3>
                        <p>A line graph is used when different values of independent variables are measured on an interval or ratio scale.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/image-02.jpg" alt="Line graph showing relationship between drug dose and food consumption" class="content-image">
                        <p>The figure above shows the relationship between an independent variable (drug dose) and dependent variable (food consumption). Because drug consumption is a continuous variable, a continuous line is used to connect them.</p>
                        <p>The data in the above line graph can be represented in a histogram.</p>
                        <p>To construct a histogram, you first draw a bar graph above each of the drug dose values so that the height of the bar corresponds to mean or median. Its drawn so that there are no gaps between the bars showing the intervals were measured in ratio scale.</p>
                        <p>Bar graphs are used to present mean or median when the independent variable is measured in an ordinal or nominal scale</p>
                        <p>Draw a bar graph above each group or treatment so that the height of bar corresponds to mean or median for the group or treatment. For a bar graph a space is left between adjacent bars to indicate scale of measurement is ordinal or nominal.</p>
                        <p>Height of the graph should be <span class="math-inline">$2 / 3$</span> to <span class="math-inline">$3 / 4$</span> of its length. When numbering start from 0 at the point where the two axes intersect. However, when value 0 is part of the data, you move it away from intersection so that the graph does not overlap axes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Symmetrical distribution.</h3>
                        <p>The right hand side of the graph will be a mirror of the left hand side and median will be at center of symmetrical distribution, mean will be at center of symmetrical distribution.</p>
                        <p>For any symmetrical distribution, mean and median will be the same. If it only has one mode, then it must be exactly at the center, so that all 3 measures of tendency will have the same class.</p>

                        <p>A rectangular distribution has no mode since all values occur with the same frequency therefore, mean and median will be at the center of the distribution.</p>

                        <p>The peak frequency is on the left side, this ps the position of the mode. A vertical line drawn at the mode doesn't divide the distribution into two equal parts.</p>
                        <p>In order to have exactly <span class="math-inline">$50 \%$</span> of the distribution on either side, median has to be to the right of the mode. Mean will be to the right of the median.</p>
                        <p>In a positively skewed distribution, mean will have the greatest value followed by median then mode.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(a) Range.</h4>
                        <p>Its the simplest and most common measure of dispersion. Its the difference between the smallest and the largest value in a distribution.</p>
                        <p>Range=Item max- Item least</p>
                        <p>Its affected by extreme cases. It gives no indication of what lies between the highest and lowest score. Can be used with ordinal, intrval and ratio scale.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(b) Interquartile range.</h4>
                        <p>Its the difference between the 3rd quartile and 1st quartile. They are values that divide the list of numbers into quarters.</p>
                        <p>For ungrouped data, put the numbers into an array or order.</p>
                        <p>Cut the list into 4 equal parts.</p>
                        <p>For grouped data, construct a cumulative frequency distribution.</p>
                        <p>decide the class that contains 1st and 3rd quartile.</p>
                        <p>1st quartile(Q1) class is thr class with value of cumulative frequency equal to at least <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{4}$</span>; <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{n}$</span> is the total frequency.</p>
                        <p>3rd quartile( <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{Q3}$</span> ) class is that with cumulative frequency equal to at least <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{3*} \mathbf{n} / \mathbf{4}$</span>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(c) Semi-interquartile range</h4>
                        <p>Its one half of interquartile range.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(d) Variance</h4>
                        <p>Its the measure of how spread out a data set is.</p>
                        <p>For ungrouped data, its calculated by taking the difference of each number in the data set and the mean, then squaring the difference to make them positive, finally, dividing the sum of all square by the number of observations in the data set.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ \text{Variance } (S^{2}) = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \bar{x})^{2}}{n} $$</div>

                        <p>For grouped data, the formula is;</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ \text{Variance } (S^{2}) = \frac{\Sigma f_i(x_i - \bar{x})^{2}}{n-1} $$</div>

                        <p><span class="math-inline">$f_i$</span>- All and every frequency</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(e) Standard deviation.</h4>
                        <p>Its the extent to which scores in a distribution deviate from their mean. It involves subtracting the mean from each score to obtain the deviation.</p>
                        <p>By taking the square-root of variance one gets the standard deviation.</p>
                        <p>The bigger the value of standard deviation, the greater the variable. A large deviation from the mean denotes a large variability and vice versa.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$ \text{Standard deviation } (S) = \sqrt{\text{Variance}} $$</div>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Advantages</h4>
                        <p>It takes into account all scores and respond to the exact position of every score relative to the mean of the distribution.</p>
                        <p>It's very sensitive to extreme scores.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(f) Skewness</h4>
                        <p>It's the measure of horizontal departure from a normal distribution.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Kurtosis</h4>
                        <p>It's the measure of vertical departure from a normal distribution.</p>
                        <p>A normal distribution has 0 skewness. Any distribution with skewness <span class="math-inline">$>0$</span> or <span class="math-inline">$<0$</span> is said to be skewed.</p>
                        <p>For a normal distribution, kurtosis will be equal to 3 . Departure from this value indicate a peaked distribution or a flat distribution.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">(g) Percentile.</h4>
                        <p>It's the percentage of individuals in a distribution with scores at or below the particular value.</p>
                        <p>Percentile rank refers to the percentage while percentile refers to the score.</p>
