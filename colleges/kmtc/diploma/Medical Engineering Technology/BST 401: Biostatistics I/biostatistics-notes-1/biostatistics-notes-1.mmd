\section*{BIOSTATISTICS}

Its the art and science of collecting, summarising, analysing, organising, interpreting and presenting data.

Different types of data collected will require different statistics.

\section*{Importance of statistics}
i. To be able to conduct research.
ii. To be able to understand published research.
iii. Helps in decision making.
iv. Enhances critical thinking.
v. Helps improve teaching and learning.

\section*{Characteristics of statistics}
i. Has an aggregate of facts.
ii. Data is collected in a systematic order.
iii. Data should be collected for a planned purpose.
iv. It should be comparable to each other.
v. Statistics are numerically expressed.
vi. Its affected to a marked extent by multiplicity of choices.
vii. They are predetermined for a purpose.
viii. Its estimated or enumerated according to reasonable standards of accuracy.
ix. Capable of being placed in relation to each other.

\section*{Definition of terms.}

Data is a number of figure that result from taking measurements or counting. ie nominal, ordinal, continuous, discrete.

Variable is a characteristic or condition that can take or change into different values ie independent, dependent, confounding, intervening, nominal, discrete, continuous and ordinal.

Population is the entire group of individuals.
Sample is a representative of a population.
Parameter is a value, usually unknown and therefore has to be estimated.

Statistic is a single measurement of a characteristic in a sample.
Vital statistic is quantitative data concerning a population eg data of maternal death. It provides statistical information for the general public.

Descriptive statistics is a method of data collection that describes and summarizes data.
Inferential statistics is statistics that uses sample data to make conclusion about the population study at hand.

Inductive reasoning begins from specific to general assumption.
Deductive reasoning is procedure from general assumption that is considered a true assumption.

\section*{Types of statistics}
i. Descriptive statistics describes and summarizes data. It converts and condenses a collection of data into an organized, visual representation or picture in a variety of ways so that the data has some meaning for the readers of a research report. Descriptive statistics employs measures such as frequency distribution, measure of central tendency and dispersion or variability, measure of relationship.
ii. Inferential statistics uses sample data to make an inference about a population of study at hand. Permits researcher to infer (generalize) that a particular characteristic in a sample exists in a larger population. They help the researcher to determine whether the difference found between two groups ie. an experimental and a control group is a genuine difference or whether it is merely a chance difference. In an inferential approach $p$ values ie. probability the outcome is owing to chance are used to communicate significance or lack there of the data ( p value should be as low as possible). It facilitates influence of hypothesis ie chi-square test, t-test, analysis of variance, analysis of co-variance, factor analysis, multi-variant analysis.

\section*{Scales of measurement}
i. Nominal scale

Two or more categories eg. male, female or other.
ii. Ordinal scale

Groups data into a ranking order eg. good and better.
iii. Interval scale

Distance between one score to the other. There is some rank but there is no zero eg. 45 and 60 marks.
iv. Ratio scale

There is an absolute zero point eg. $0 \mathrm{~kg}, 60 \mathrm{~kg}$.

\section*{V. Binary scale}

Divides the score into two eg. married and unmarried.
In imperical studies, the data is usually quantitative and can only be analysed quantitatively. In such studies, statistical procedures can be used to analyse the data. The choice of statistical procedure to be applied is determined by the type of measurement scale used in operationalisation of the variable.
i. Nominal

Its considered the lowest level of measurement. It groups subjects or cases from a sample into categories. Subjects or cases in each have a common set of characteristics. Examples of variables; sex, race, marital status, employment status, language, religion, color, ethnicity.
The researcher may include marital status in the study, will then operationalise this variable as; married, single, divorced, separated. We'll then find out from the sample the number that will fall into each category eg. for a sample of subjects, 42 are married, 23 are single, 10 are divorced and 5 are separated. Numbers are assigned to various categories for the purpose of identification eg 1-married, 2-single, 3-divorced, 4separated. The numerals assigned to various categories don't represent the quantity or order hence one can't perform mathematical operations ie. division or subtraction.
Dichotomous variable has only 2 categories eg. gender; male or female.

\section*{ii. Ordinal scale}

Groups subjects into groups and ranks them into same order, could be increasing order. Numerals are used to represent relative position or order among the values of the variable. However, order indicated in the scale does not imply a quantitative diction. For example, a researcher may want to measure the hardness of materials and use variables hardest, medium, soft.
The researcher defines the criteria for measuring different levels of hardness then assign numerical values; 3-hardest category, 2-medium category and 1-soft category. There is no way of knowing the difference in hardness between group 3 and 2 is the same as difference in hardness group 2 and 1.
Groups are ranked into increasing order but the interval between groups are not necessarily equal. Ordinal scale doesn't give level of crisition required in a research study, mathematical operation on numerals would yield meaningless values.

\section*{iii. Interval scale}

Numerals assigned to each measure are ranked in order and interval between numerals are equal, hence numerals used to represent quantities and mathematical operations on numerals would yield meaningful values. However mathematical operations are limited to additions and deductions while multiplication and division are nor applicable. There is no zero point. example include temperature measurement, test scores.
For example if a student scores 60 points and another 30 points, the one who has 60 has twice as many points as the one with 30 points. however, we cants say that the one with 60 points knows twice exactly as much as the one with 30 points. For the student who scores 0 would not imply absolute absence of knowledge.

iv. Ratio scale

Its the highest level of measurement and most precise method of measuring variables. Would have all characteristics of other scales. The only additional characteristic in this scale is that it has a true zero point and all mathematical operations can be applied and yield meaningful values.
Example, height, weight, distance, age, are, blood pressure,. Intervals between numerals are equal. For example a building that is 60 m tall is as twice as tall as a building that's 30 m tall. The difference between 80 kg and 60 kg is the same difference between 60 kg and 40 kg . 0 m indicates absence of height and 0 kg indicates absence of weight.
When variables are measured to this scale, powerful statistical procedures can be applied which improves research findings quality from studies and generalisation can be made to a wider population.

\section*{MEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDENCY AND CHARACTERISTICS}

Statistics or numbers expressing the most typical or average scores in a distribution.

\section*{i. Mode}

Its the most commonly attained measurement or value. The measurement that appears most in a particular variable among the different subject.

Value or score that occurs most frequently in a distribution
Example using ungrouped data
Number of people in a family: 3,4,5,6,6,6,7,9.10,12
6 is the mode because it occurs most frequently.
When using grouped data, mode is the class with the highest frequency.
Mode $=\operatorname{LMo}(\Delta 1 / \Delta 1+\Delta 2) \mathrm{i}$
LMo- lower class boundary of modal class
$\Delta 1$ - difference between frequency of class mode and frequency of class before modal class.
$\Delta 2$ - difference between frequency of class mode and frequency of class after modal class.
i- class interval
When you have two modes, calculate each separately.
ii. Median

Its the middle value is number ranked from lowest to highest. In grouped data, its the 50th percentile
When using ungrouped data, half the values are above the median and the other half are below median when the number of scores are odd.
If the number of scores id even, median is the midpoint between 2 middle values (by averaging the 2 middle value).
When using grouped data, the formula is; Median $=\mathrm{Lm}+((\mathrm{n} / 2-\mathrm{cf}) / \mathrm{fm}) \mathrm{i}$
Lm- lower boundary of median class.
n - total frequency of observation.
cf- cumulative frequency before median class.
fm - frequency of median class.
i- class interval
iii. Mean

Its the average of all scores in a distribution.
In ungrouped data, the researcher would add all scores and divide the total by the total number of scores.
In grouped data, the formula is;
Mean $=\Sigma \mathrm{fx} / \Sigma \mathrm{f}$
f - frequency
$x$ - class of midpoint

\section*{Advantages of using mean}
a. Its a concept familiar to many people.
b. Every data set has only one mean.
c. Its useful for comparison.
d. Uses the whole data set.
e. Its a good representative value.
f. Its closely related to variance and standard deviation.

\section*{Disadvantages of using mean.}
a. Its affected by extreme values.
b. Its tedious to calculate mean for a large data set.
c. It cannot be calculated for grouped data with an open ended class.

\section*{Advantages of median.}
a. Its not affected by extreme values.
b. Its appropriate for qualitative data.

\section*{Disadvantages of median.}
a. Its not good for representation of data because it doesn't take into account all values.
b. Its slow in calculation of a large data set.

\section*{Advantages of mode.}
a. Its easy to compute.
b. It can be used with any scale of measurement.
c. its not affected by extreme values

\section*{GRAPHS.}

Graphs can also be used to report and compare measure of central tendency. It can be used to report the sample mean and sample median but rarely do they show mode.

Values of graphs can allow several values of mean or mode to be shown simultaneously, therefore is possible to make quick comparison between groups or treatment conditions.

When preparing the graph, the values of independent variables are plotted on the horizontal axis and those of dependent variables are plotted on vertical axis.

Means or modes are displayed using bar graphs, line graphs or histograms, depending on the scale of measurement used for independent variable.

\section*{Line graph}

A line graph is used when different values of independent variables are measured on an interval or ratio scale.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-08.jpg?height=727&width=936&top_left_y=149&top_left_x=402)

The figure above shows the relationship between an independent variable (drug dose) and dependent variable (food consumption). Because drug consumption is a continuous variable, a continuous line is used to connect them.

The data in the above line graph can be represented in a histogram.
To construct a histogram, you first draw a bar graph above each of the drug dose values so that the height of the bar corresponds to mean or median. Its drawn so that there are no gaps between the bars showing the intervals were measured in ratio scale.

Bar graphs are used to present mean or median when the independent variable is measured in an ordinal or nominal scale

Draw a bar graph above each group or treatment so that the height of bar corresponds to mean or median for the group or treatment. For a bar graph a space is left between adjacent bars to indicate scale of measurement is ordinal or nominal.

Height of the graph should be $2 / 3$ to $3 / 4$ of its length. When numbering start from 0 at the point where the two axes intersect. However, when value 0 is part of the data, you move it away from intersection so that the graph does not overlap axes.

\section*{Symmetrical distribution.}

The right hand side of the graph will be a mirror of the left hand side and median will be at center of symmetrical distribution, mean will be at center of symmetrical distribution.

For any symmetrical distribution, mean and median will be the same. If it only has one mode, then it must be exactly at the center, so that all 3 measures of tendency will have the same class.

Symmetrical distribution

For a bimodal symmetrical distribution, mean and median at the center wit modes on each side.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-09.jpg?height=709&width=1069&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=300)

Bimodal symmetrical distribution

A rectangular distribution has no mode since all values occur with the same frequency therefore, mean and median will be at the center of the distribution.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-09.jpg?height=665&width=983&top_left_y=1950&top_left_x=365)

Rectangular distribution

\section*{Skewed distribution/ Asymmetrical distribution.}
i. Positively skewed

The peak frequency is on the left side, this ps the position of the mode. A vertical line drawn at the mode doesn't divide the distribution into two equal parts.
In order to have exactly $50 \%$ of the distribution on either side, median has to be to the right of the mode. Mean will be to the right of the median.
In a positively skewed distribution, mean will have the greatest value followed by median then mode.

\section*{ii) Negatively skewed}

Peak is toward the right while tail is to the left.
Mode is on the right (peak), mean is to the left by the extreme scores and median is between mode and mean.
Mean is the lowest value and mode is the highest.

Negatively skewed distribution

\section*{MEASURE OF DISPERSION.}

\section*{Variability}

Range
Interquartile
Variance
Mean deviation
Standard deviation
(a) Range.

Its the simplest and most common measure of dispersion. Its the difference between the smallest and the largest value in a distribution.

Range=Item max- Item least
Its affected by extreme cases. It gives no indication of what lies between the highest and lowest score. Can be used with ordinal, intrval and ratio scale.
(b) Interquartile range.

Its the difference between the 3rd quartile and 1st quartile. They are values that divide the list of numbers into quarters.
For ungrouped data, put the numbers into an array or order.
Cut the list into 4 equal parts.
For grouped data, construct a cumulative frequency distribution.
decide the class that contains 1st and 3rd quartile.
1st quartile(Q1) class is thr class with value of cumulative frequency equal to at least $\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{4}$; $\mathbf{n}$ is the total frequency.
3rd quartile( $\mathbf{Q 3}$ ) class is that with cumulative frequency equal to at least $\mathbf{3 *} \mathbf{n} / \mathbf{4}$.

\section*{(c) Semi-interquartile range}

Its one half of interquartile range.

\section*{(d) Variance}

Its the measure of how spread out a data set is.
For ungrouped data, its calculated by taking the difference of each number in the data set and the mean, then squaring the difference to make them positive, finally, dividing the sum of all square by the number of observations in the data set.
Variance $\left(\mathrm{S}^{2}\right)=\Sigma(\mathrm{xi}-\mathrm{x})^{2} / \mathrm{n}$
$\mathrm{S}^{2}$-Sample variance xi- Each value or score
x - Mean $\quad \mathrm{n}$ - sample size
For grouped data, the formula is;
Variance $\left(\mathrm{S}^{2}\right)=\Sigma \mathrm{fi}(\mathrm{xi}-\mathrm{x})^{2} / \mathrm{n}-1$
$\mathrm{S}^{2}$-Sample variance $\quad$ xi- Midpoint of class
x - Mean $\quad \mathrm{n}$ - sample size
fi- All and every frequency
(e) Standard deviation.

Its the extent to which scores in a distribution deviate from their mean. It involves subtracting the mean from each score to obtain the deviation.

By taking the square-root of variance one gets the standard deviation.
The bigger the value of standard deviation, the greater the variable. A large deviation from the mean denotes a large variability and vice versa.

Standard deviation $(S)=\sqrt{ }$ Variance

\section*{Advantages}

It takes into account all scores and respond to the exact position of every score relative to the mean of the distribution.

It's very sensitive to extreme scores.

\section*{(f) Skewness}

It's the measure of horizontal departure from a normal distribution.

\section*{Kurtosis}

It's the measure of vertical departure from a normal distribution.
A normal distribution has 0 skewness. Any distribution with skewness $>0$ or $<0$ is said to be skewed.

For a normal distribution, kurtosis will be equal to 3 . Departure from this value indicate a peaked distribution or a flat distribution.

\section*{(g) Percentile.}

It's the percentage of individuals in a distribution with scores at or below the particular value.

Percentile rank refers to the percentage while percentile refers to the score.

\section*{Sampling and sample size.}

Sampling refers to researcher's process of selecting the sample for a population in order to obtain information.

Sample is a fraction or a part of a whole.
Factors to consider when choosing a sample.
a) Variance or heterogeneity of the population.
b) Degree of acceptable error.

Generally one needs to make a judgment on all facts.

\section*{Fischer's etal formula}

It's appropriate for population size $\geq 10,000$.
$n=z^{2} p q / d^{2} \quad n=$ desired sample.
$\mathrm{z}=$ standard normal deviate(1.96)
$\mathrm{p}=$ portion of the population estimated to have a certain characteristic.(if there is no reasonable estimate, use $50 \%$ which is 0.5 ).
$\mathrm{q}=$ portion of population with no desired characteristic.
$\mathrm{D}=$ degree of accuracy, usually 0.05 .
For a sample size $\leq 10,000$
$\mathrm{nf}=\mathrm{n} / 1+\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{N} \quad \mathrm{nf}=$ desired sample size
$\mathrm{N}=$ estimated population $<10,000$
$\mathrm{n}=$ estimated sample when N is greater or equal to 10,000 .
For population size of upto 30, use the able population.
Calculation of demographic rates.

\section*{a) Incidence rate.}

The incidence rate of a disease is ad follows;
Number of new cases over the period
Population at risk

\section*{b) Prevalence rate.}

The prevalence rate of a disease at a time is;

Total number of cases of the disease at the time
Population at risk

\section*{c) Mortality rate.}

It's the;
Number of deaths recorded $\quad *$ the percentage $(100,1000,10000)$
Number of people in the population
d) Morbidity rate.

Number of deaths in a given time $*$ the percentage $(100,1000,10000)$

\section*{Total population}

\section*{DATA REPRESENTATION}

\section*{Graphical presentation}

A graph enables the researcher to see the trend in the distribution easily than looking at numbers in a frequency distribution.

A graph has two axes, the horizontal axis and the vertical axis. Its customary to present frequency along the vertical axis and scores along the horizontal axis.

Avoid too steep or too flat graphs.
The width of the graph should be $1 / 3$ to $2 / 3$ its height.
A graph should be well labeled on both axes, should have a title.
The three types of graphs include;
(a) Histogram.

Comprises of a series of vertical bars. The y axis represent number of subjects obtaining a particular score.

Exact limits are used to construct a histogram and therefore its used with continuous data.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-14.jpg?height=678&width=1088&top_left_y=2011&top_left_x=448)

\section*{(b) Bar chart.}

Preferred with discrete or categorical data or when the scale is nominal; has no order.
Spaces are left between the bars to signify the lack of continuity between the categories.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-15.jpg?height=771&width=1142&top_left_y=620&top_left_x=364)
(c) Frequency polygon.

A polygon is a many sided figure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_08_3f78a5ebb84ce84901eag-15.jpg?height=687&width=1245&top_left_y=1597&top_left_x=451)

One must establish midpoint of class interval when plotting a frequency polygon.
It's a closed figure and the end meets the x axis.

\section*{Frequency distribution table.}

It shows the distribution of scores in a sample for a specific variable. It gives a record of the number of times a score or response occurs.

\section*{Ungrouped data}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Score & Frequency \\
\hline 40 & 2 \\
\hline 50 & 10 \\
\hline 60 & 5 \\
\hline 70 & 3 \\
\hline & 20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Grouped data}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Score & Frequency \\
\hline $31-40$ & 2 \\
\hline $41-50$ & 10 \\
\hline $51-60$ & 5 \\
\hline $61-70$ & 3 \\
\hline & 20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Percentage frequency}

Its the portion of a subgroup to the total group or sample and it ranges from 0 to 100 .
It's important especially when there is need to compare groups that differ in size.

\section*{Correlation coefficients}

A correlation used to analyze the degree of relationship between two variables.
A correlation coefficient is a number that expresses the magnitude and direction of the association between two variables.

In order to demonstrate that 2 variables are related, the researcher has to obtain values or measurements on both variables for the same event.

Example; A researcher obtains weight and intake of calories by diabetic patients over a period of time then compares the relationship.

\section*{Types of correlation coefficients.}
a) Phi $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ - Its when variables are measured in a nominal scale
b) Spearman's rank/ Rho $\mathbf{P}$ - is when both variables are measured in ordinal scale.
c) Pearson's correlation coefficients $\mathbf{r}$ - when both variables are measured in on an interval or ratio scale.

To obtain a visual representation of the relationship between two variables, the researcher plots values on a scattergram.

Scattergram is a graphic representation of the paired score for each subject on the two variables.
Pairs of dots are plotted on the graph, placing them to indicate where x and y intersect.
If the pattern of dots extend from lower left corner to upper right corner, positive correlation is indicated.

If the dots are distributed from upper left corner to lower right corner, a negative correlation exists.

When dots are scattered all over, no relation exists between the two variables.
NB - A positive correlation means that two variables tend to increase and decrease together.
- A negative correlation denotes inverse relations, when one increases, the other decreases.

Values in a correlation coefficient range from +1 to -1 , where +1 implies a perfect positive correlation, 0 implies no correlation and -1 implies a perfect negative correlation.

No correlation

\section*{Contingency table/ cross tabulation table.}

Displays the relationship between sets of nominal data.
Example; A researcher wants to determine whether or not there is a relationship between gender and smoking.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Gender & Smoke & Don't smoke & Total \\
\hline Male & 30 & 20 & 50 \\
\hline Female & 25 & 25 & 50 \\
\hline Total & 55 & 45 & 100 \\
