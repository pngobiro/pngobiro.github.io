                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Vital statistics are data derived from the registration of vital events (births, deaths, marriages, divorces).</p>
                        <p>They are essential for understanding population dynamics and health status.</p>
                        <p>Common measures derived from vital statistics include rates, ratios, and proportions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ratio</h3>
                        <p>A ratio expresses the relationship between two numbers, where the numerator is not necessarily included in the denominator. It is often expressed as $a:b$ or $a/b$.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sex ratio = (Number of males / Number of females) * 100. If there are 1050 males and 1000 females, the sex ratio is (1050/1000)*100 = 105 males per 100 females.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Doctor-population ratio = Number of doctors / Total population.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proportion</h3>
                        <p>A proportion is a type of ratio where the numerator is included in the denominator. It expresses a part of a whole. It is often expressed as a percentage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Proportion of deaths due to malaria = (Number of deaths from malaria / Total number of deaths) * 100.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Rate</h3>
                        <p>A rate measures the occurrence of an event in a population over a specified period of time. The numerator is the number of events occurring during the period, and the denominator is the population at risk of experiencing the event during that period (often approximated by the mid-year population).</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of events in a time period}}{\text{Population at risk during the time period}} \times k $$
                        </div>
                        <p>Where $k$ is a multiplier (e.g., 1000, 100,000) used to express the rate per standard population size.</p>
                        <p>Rates are crucial for comparing health events across different populations or time periods.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">4.6 Measures of Fertility</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Fertility refers to the actual reproductive performance of a population.</p>
                        <p>Common measures include:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Crude Birth Rate (CBR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of live births per 1000 population in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ CBR = \frac{\text{Total live births in a year}}{\text{Mid-year population}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy to calculate and understand.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Crude measure, affected by the age-sex structure of the population. Not suitable for comparing fertility between populations with different structures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General Fertility Rate (GFR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of live births per 1000 women of reproductive age (usually 15-49 years) in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ GFR = \frac{\text{Total live births in a year}}{\text{Number of women aged 15-49 at mid-year}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> More refined than CBR as it relates births to the population actually at risk (women of reproductive age).</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Still affected by the age distribution within the reproductive age group.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of live births per 1000 women in a specific age group (e.g., 20-24, 25-29) in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ ASFR_a = \frac{\text{Live births to women in age group 'a' in a year}}{\text{Number of women in age group 'a' at mid-year}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides detailed information on fertility patterns by age. Not affected by the overall age structure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requires detailed data on births and population by age group.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</h3>
                        <p>The average number of children a woman would have by the end of her reproductive life if she experienced the current age-specific fertility rates throughout her childbearing years.</p>
                        <p>It is calculated by summing the ASFRs (usually in 5-year age groups) and multiplying by the width of the age interval (usually 5).</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ TFR = 5 \times \sum (\text{ASFR}_a / 1000) $$
                        </div>
                        <p>(The division by 1000 converts ASFR from per 1000 women to per woman).</p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Summary measure of current fertility levels, independent of age structure. Easy to interpret (average number of children per woman).</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Hypothetical measure based on current rates; actual cohort fertility may differ.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR)</h3>
                        <p>The average number of daughters a woman would have by the end of her reproductive life if she experienced current age-specific fertility rates, assuming no mortality.</p>
                        <p>It is similar to TFR but considers only female births.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ GRR = TFR \times (\text{Proportion of births that are female}) $$
                        </div>
                        <p>(Proportion of female births is often around 0.488 or approximated as 100/205 if sex ratio at birth is 105 males per 100 females).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Net Reproduction Rate (NRR)</h3>
                        <p>The average number of daughters a woman would have who survive to reproductive age, considering both current fertility and mortality rates.</p>
                        <p>NRR = 1 indicates replacement level fertility (each generation exactly replaces itself).</p>
                        <p>NRR > 1 indicates population growth.</p>
                        <p>NRR < 1 indicates population decline.</p>
                        <p>Calculation involves multiplying ASFRs by survival probabilities for females.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Mortality refers to deaths occurring in a population.</p>
                        <p>Common measures include:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Crude Death Rate (CDR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of deaths per 1000 population in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ CDR = \frac{\text{Total deaths in a year}}{\text{Mid-year population}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy to calculate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Crude measure, heavily influenced by the age structure of the population (older populations naturally have higher CDRs). Not suitable for comparing mortality between populations with different age structures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Age-Specific Death Rate (ASDR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of deaths per 1000 population in a specific age group in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ ASDR_a = \frac{\text{Deaths in age group 'a' in a year}}{\text{Mid-year population in age group 'a'}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides detailed mortality patterns by age. Essential for comparing mortality between populations after adjusting for age differences (standardization).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1000 live births in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ IMR = \frac{\text{Deaths of infants (<1 year) in a year}}{\text{Total live births in the same year}} \times 1000 $$
                        </div>
                        <p>IMR is a sensitive indicator of the overall health status of a population, reflecting socioeconomic conditions, healthcare access, and environmental factors.</p>
                        <p>It can be further divided into:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR)</h3>
                        <p>The probability of dying between birth and exactly five years of age, expressed per 1000 live births.</p>
                        <p>Often calculated using life table methods or estimated from survey data.</p>
                        <p>A key indicator of child health and overall development.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)</h3>
                        <p>The number of maternal deaths (deaths related to pregnancy or childbirth) per 100,000 live births in a given year.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ MMR = \frac{\text{Number of maternal deaths in a year}}{\text{Total live births in the same year}} \times 100,000 $$

                        <p>(Note: Sometimes referred to as Maternal Mortality Rate when the denominator is women of reproductive age, but Ratio using live births is more common).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cause-Specific Death Rate</h3>
                        <p>The number of deaths due to a specific cause per 100,000 population in a given year.</p>
