                        <p>Data collection techniques allow us to systematically collect data about our objects of study (people, objects, and phenomena) and about the setting in which they occur. In the collection of data we have to be systematic. If data are collected haphazardly, it will be difficult to answer our research questions in a conclusive way.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Various data collection techniques can be used such as:</h3>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Observation</h3>
                        <p>Observation is a technique that involves systematically selecting, watching and recoding behaviors of people or other phenomena and aspects of the setting in which they occur, for the purpose of getting (gaining) specified information. It includes all methods from simple visual observations to the use of high level machines and measurements, sophisticated equipment or facilities, such as radiographic, biochemical, X-ray machines, microscope, clinical examinations, and microbiological examinations.</p>
                        <p>Outline the guidelines for the observations prior to actual data collection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Gives relatively more accurate data on behavior and activities</p>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Investigators or observer's own biases, prejudice, desires, and etc. and needs more resources and skilled human power during the use of high level machines.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Interviews and self-administered questionnaire</h3>
                        <p>Interviews and self-administered questionnaires are probably the most commonly used research data collection techniques. Therefore, designing good "questioning tools" forms an important and time consuming phase in the development of most research proposals.</p>
                        <p>Once the decision has been made to use these techniques, the following questions should be considered before designing our tools:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">What exactly do we want to know, according to the objectives and variables we identified earlier? Is questioning the right technique to obtain all answers, or do we need additional techniques, such as observations or analysis of records?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Of whom will we ask questions and what techniques will we use? Do we understand the topic sufficiently to design a questionnaire, or do we need some loosely structured interviews with key informants or a focus group discussion first to orient ourselves?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Are our informants mainly literate or illiterate? If illiterate, the use of self-administered questionnaires is not an option.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">How large is the sample that will be interviewed? Studies with many respondents often use shorter, highly structured questionnaires, whereas smaller studies allow more flexibility and may use questionnaires with a number of open-ended questions.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the decision has been made Interviews may be less or more structured. Unstructured interview is flexible, the content wording and order of the questions vary from interview to interview. The investigators only have idea of what they want to learn but do not decide in advance exactly what questions will be asked, or in what order.</p>
                        <p>In other situations, a more standardized technique may be used, the wording and order of the questions being decided in advance. This may take the form of a highly structured interview, in which the questions are asked orderly, or a self administered questionnaire, in which case the respondent reads the questions and fill in the answers by himself (sometimes in the presence of an interviewer who 'stands by' to give assistance if necessary).</p>
                        <p>Standardized methods of asking questions are usually preferred in community medicine research, since they provide more assurance that the data will be reproducible. Less structured interviews may be useful in a preliminary survey, where the purpose is to obtain information to help in the subsequent planning of a study rather than factors for analysis, and in intensive studies of perceptions, attitudes, motivation and affective reactions. Unstructured interviews are characteristic of qualitative (non-quantitative) research.</p>
                        <p>The use of self-administered questionnaires is simpler and cheaper; such questionnaires can be administered to many persons simultaneously (e.g. to a class of students), and unlike interviews, can be sent by post. On the other hand, they demand a certain level of education and skill on the part of the respondents; people of a low socio-economic status are less likely to respond to a mailed questionnaire.</p>
                        <p>In interviewing using questionnaire, the investigator appoints agents known as enumerators, who go to the respondents personally with the questionnaire, ask them the questions given there in, and record their replies. They can be either face-to-face or telephone interviews.</p>
                        <p>Face-to-face and telephone interviews have many advantages. A good interviewer can stimulate and maintain the respondent's interest, and can create a rapport (understanding, concord) and atmosphere conducive to the answering of questions. If anxiety aroused, the interviewer can allay it. If a question is not understood an interviewer can repeat it and if necessary (and in accordance with guidelines decided in advance) provide an explanation or alternative wording. Optional follow-up or probing questions that are to be asked only if prior responses are inconclusive or inconsistent cannot easily be built into self-administered questionnaires. In face-to-face interviews, observations can be made as well.</p>
                        <p>In general, apart from their expenses, interviews are preferable to self-administered questionnaire, with the important proviso that they are conducted by skilled interviewers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mailed Questionnaire Method:</strong> Under this method, the investigator prepares a questionnaire containing a number of questions pertaining the field of inquiry. The questionnaires are sent by post to the informants together with a polite covering letter explaining the detail, the aims and objectives of collecting the information, and requesting the respondents to cooperate by furnishing the correct replies and returning the questionnaire duly filled in. In order to ensure quick response, the return postage expenses are usually borne by the investigator.</p>
                        <p>The main problems with postal questionnaire are that response rates tend to be relatively low, and that there may be under representation of less literate subjects.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Use of documentary sources</h3>
                        <p>Clinical and other personal records, death certificates, published mortality statistics, census publications, etc. Examples include:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Official publications of Central Statistical Authority</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Publication of Ministry of Health and Other Ministries</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">News Papers and Journals.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text">International Publications like Publications by WHO, World Bank, UNICEF</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">5.</span><span class="item-text">Records of hospitals or any Health Institutions.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>During the use of data from documents, though they are less time consuming and relatively have low cost, care should be taken on the quality and completeness of the data. There could be differences in objectives between the primary author of the data and the user.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Problems in gathering data</h3>
                        <p>It is important to recognize some of the main problems that may be faced when collecting data so that they can be addressed in the selection of appropriate collection methods and in the training of the staff involved.</p>
                        <p><strong>Common problems might include:</strong></p>
