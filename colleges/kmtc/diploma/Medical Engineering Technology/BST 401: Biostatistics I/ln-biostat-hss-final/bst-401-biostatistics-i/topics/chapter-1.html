                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The term statistics is used to mean either statistical data or statistical methods.</p>
                        <p><strong>Statistical data:</strong> When it means statistical data it refers to numerical descriptions of things. These descriptions may take the form of counts or measurements. Thus statistics of malaria cases in one of malaria detection and treatment posts of Ethiopia include fever cases, number of positives obtained, sex and age distribution of positive cases, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>NB</strong> Even though statistical data always denote figures (numerical descriptions) it must be remembered that all 'numerical descriptions' are not statistical data.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Characteristics of statistical data</h3>
                        <p>In order that numerical descriptions may be called statistics they must possess the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i)</span><span class="item-text">They must be in aggregates - This means that statistics are 'number of facts.' A single fact, even though numerically stated, cannot be called statistics.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">They must be affected to a marked extent by a multiplicity of causes. This means that statistics are aggregates of such facts only as grow out of a ' variety of circumstances'. Thus the explosion of outbreak is attributable to a number of factors, Viz., Human factors, parasite factors, mosquito and environmental factors. All these factors acting jointly determine the severity of the outbreak and it is very difficult to assess the individual contribution of any one of these factors.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii)</span><span class="item-text">They must be enumerated or estimated according to a reasonable standard of accuracy - Statistics must be enumerated or estimated according to reasonable standards of accuracy. This means that if aggregates of numerical facts are to be called 'statistics' they must be reasonably accurate. This is necessary because statistical data are to serve as a basis for statistical investigations. If the basis happens to be incorrect the results are bound to be misleading.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iv)</span><span class="item-text">They must have been collected in a systematic manner for a predetermined purpose. Numerical data can be called statistics only if they have been compiled in a properly planned manner and for a purpose about which the enumerator had a definite idea. Facts collected in an unsystematic manner and without a complete awareness of the object, will be confusing and cannot be made the basis of valid conclusions.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">v)</span><span class="item-text">They must be placed in relation to each other. That is, they must be comparable. Numerical facts may be placed in relation to each other either in point of time, space or condition. The phrase, 'placed in relation to each other' suggests that the facts should be comparable.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also included in this view are the techniques for tabular and graphical presentation of data as well as the methods used to summarize a body of data with one or two meaningful figures. This aspect of organization, presentation and summarization of data are labelled as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>.</p>
                        <p>One branch of descriptive statistics of special relevance in medicine is that of <strong>vital statistics</strong> - vital events: birth, death, marriage, divorce, and the occurrence of particular disease. They are used to characterize the health status of a population. Coupled with results of periodic censuses and other special enumeration of populations, the data on vital events relate to an underlying population and yield descriptive measures such as birth rates, morbidity rates, mortality rates, life expectancies, and disease incidence and prevalence rates that pervade both medical and lay literature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Statistical methods:</strong> When the term 'statistics' is used to mean 'statistical methods' it refers to a body of methods that are used for collecting, organising, analyzing and interpreting numerical data for understanding a phenomenon or making wise decisions. In this sense it is a branch of scientific method and helps us to know in a better way the object under study.</p>
                        <p>The branch of modern statistics that is most relevant to public health and clinical medicine is <strong>statistical inference</strong>. This branch of statistics deals with techniques of making conclusions about the population. Inferential statistics builds upon descriptive statistics. The inferences are drawn from particular properties of sample to particular properties of population. These are the types of statistics most commonly found in research publications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When the different statistical methods are applied in biological, medical and public health data they constitute the discipline of <strong>Biostatistics</strong>.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Any aspect of an individual that is measured and take any value for different individuals or cases, like blood pressure, or records, like age, sex is called a <strong>variable</strong>.</p>
                        <p>It is helpful to divide variables into different types, as different statistical methods are applicable to each. The main division is into <strong>qualitative</strong> (or categorical) or <strong>quantitative</strong> (or numerical variables).</p>
                        <p><strong>Qualitative variable:</strong> a variable or characteristic which cannot be measured in quantitative form but can only be identified by name or categories, for instance place of birth, ethnic group, type of drug, stages of breast cancer (I, II, III, or IV), degree of pain (minimal, moderate, severe or unbearable).</p>
                        <p><strong>Quantitative variable:</strong> A quantitative variable is one that can be measured and expressed numerically and they can be of two types (discrete or continuous). The values of a <strong>discrete</strong> variable are usually whole numbers, such as the number of episodes of diarrhoea in the first five years of life. A <strong>continuous</strong> variable is a measurement on a continuous scale. Examples include weight, height, blood pressure, age, etc.</p>
                        <p>Although the types of variables could be broadly divided into categorical (qualitative) and quantitative, it has been a common practice to see four basic types of data (scales of measurement).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nominal data</h3>
                        <p>Data that represent categories or names. There is no implied order to the categories of nominal data. In these types of data, individuals are simply placed in the proper category or group, and the number in each category is counted. Each item must fit into exactly one category.</p>
                        <p>The simplest data consist of unordered, dichotomous, or "either - or" types of observations, i.e., either the patient lives or the patient dies, either he has some particular attribute or he does not.</p>
                        <p>eg. Nominal scale data: survival status of propanolol - treated and control patients with myocardial infarction</p>

                        <p>The above table presents data from a clinical trial of the drug propranolol in the treatment of myocardial infarction. There were two group of myocardial infarction. There were two group of patients with MI . One group received propranolol; the other did not and was the control. For each patient the response was dichotomous; either he survived the first 28 days after hospital admission or he succumbed (died) sometime within this time period.</p>
                        <p>With nominal scale data the obvious and intuitive descriptive summary measure is the proportion or percentage of subjects who exhibit the attribute. Thus, we can see from the above table that 84 percent of the patients treated with propranolol survived, in contrast with only <span class="math-inline">63\%</span> of the control group.</p>

                        <p>In interval data the intervals between values are the same. For example, in the Fahrenheit temperature scale, the difference between 70 degrees and 71 degrees is the same as the difference between 32 and 33 degrees. But the scale is not a RATIO Scale. 40 degrees Fahrenheit is not twice as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ratio Data</h3>
                        <p>The data values in ratio data do have meaningful ratios, for example, age is a ratio data, some one who is 40 is twice as old as someone who is 20.</p>
                        <p>Both interval and ratio data involve measurement. Most data analysis techniques that apply to ratio data also apply to interval data. Therefore, in most practical aspects, these types of data (interval and ratio) are grouped under <strong>metric data</strong>. In some other instances, these type of data are also known as <strong>numerical discrete</strong> and <strong>numerical continuous</strong>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Numerical discrete</h3>
                        <p>Numerical discrete data occur when the observations are integers that correspond with a count of some sort. Some common examples are: the number of bacteria colonies on a plate, the number of cells within a prescribed area upon microscopic examination, the number of heart beats within a specified time interval, a mother's history of number of births ( parity) and pregnancies (gravidity), the number of episodes of illness a patient experiences during some time period, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Numerical continuous</h3>
                        <p>The scale with the greatest degree of quantification is a numerical continuous scale. Each observation theoretically falls somewhere along a continuum. One is not restricted, in principle, to particular values such as the integers of the discrete scale. The restricting factor is the degree of accuracy of the measuring instrument most clinical measurements, such as blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, height, weight, age etc. are on a numerical continuous scale.</p>
