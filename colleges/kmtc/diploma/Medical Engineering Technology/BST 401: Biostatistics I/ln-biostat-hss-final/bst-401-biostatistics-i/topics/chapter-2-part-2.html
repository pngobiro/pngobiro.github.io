                        <p>Decision-makers need information that is relevant, timely, accurate and usable. The cost of obtaining, processing and analyzing these data is high. The challenge is to find ways, which lead to information that is cost-effective, relevant, timely and important for immediate use. Some methods pay attention to timeliness and reduction in cost. Others pay attention to accuracy and the strength of the method in using scientific approaches.</p>
                        <p>The statistical data may be classified under two categories, depending upon the sources.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1)</span><span class="item-text">Primary data</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2)</span><span class="item-text">Secondary data</span></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Primary Data</h3>
                        <p>Are those data, which are collected by the investigator himself for the purpose of a specific inquiry or study. Such data are original in character and are mostly generated by surveys conducted by individuals or research institutions.</p>
                        <p>The first hand information obtained by the investigator is more reliable and accurate since the investigator can extract the correct information by removing doubts, if any, in the minds of the respondents regarding certain questions. High response rates might be obtained since the answers to various questions are obtained on the spot. It permits explanation of questions concerning difficult subject matter.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Secondary Data</h3>
                        <p>When an investigator uses data, which have already been collected by others, such data are called "Secondary Data". Such data are primary data for the agency that collected them, and become secondary for someone else who uses these data for his own purposes.</p>
                        <p>The secondary data can be obtained from journals, reports, government publications, publications of professionals and research organizations.</p>
                        <p>Secondary data are less expensive to collect both in money and time. These data can also be better utilized and sometimes the quality of such data may be better because these might have been collected by persons who were specially trained for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, such data must be used with great care, because such data may also be full of errors due to the fact that the purpose of the collection of the data by the primary agency may have been different from the purpose of the user of these secondary data. Secondly, there may have been bias introduced, the size of the sample may have been inadequate, or there may have been arithmetic or definition errors, hence, it is necessary to critically investigate the validity of the secondary data.</p>
                        <p>In general, the choice of methods of data collection is largely based on the accuracy of the information they yield. In this context, 'accuracy' refers not only to correspondence between the information and objective reality - although this certainly enters into the concept but also to the information's relevance. This issue is the extent to which the method will provide a precise measure of the variable the investigator wishes to study.</p>
                        <p>The selection of the method of data collection is also based on practical considerations, such as:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1)</span><span class="item-text">The need for personnel, skills, equipment, etc. in relation to what is available and the urgency with which results are needed.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2)</span><span class="item-text">The acceptability of the procedures to the subjects - the absence of inconvenience, unpleasantness, or untoward consequences.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3)</span><span class="item-text">The probability that the method will provide a good coverage, i.e. will supply the required information about all or almost all members of the population or sample. If many people will not know the answer to the question, the question is not an appropriate one.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The investigator's familiarity with a study procedure may be a valid consideration. It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is specially skilled.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Before examining the steps in designing a questionnaire, we need to review the types of questions used in questionnaires. Depending on how questions are asked and recorded we can distinguish two major possibilities - Open -ended questions, and closed questions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Open-ended questions</h3>
                        <p>Open-ended questions permit free responses that should be recorded in the respondent's own words. The respondent is not given any possible answers to choose from.</p>
                        <p>Such questions are useful to obtain information on:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Facts with which the researcher is not very familiar,</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Opinions, attitudes, and suggestions of informants, or</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Sensitive issues.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
                        <blockquote><p>"Can you describe exactly what the traditional birth attendant did when your labor started?"</p></blockquote>
                        <blockquote><p>"What do you think are the reasons for a high drop-out rate of village health committee members?"</p></blockquote>
                        <blockquote><p>"What would you do if you noticed that your daughter (school girl) had a relationship with a teacher?"</p></blockquote>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Closed Questions</h3>
                        <p>Closed questions offer a list of possible options or answers from which the respondents must choose. When designing closed questions one should try to:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Offer a list of options that are exhaustive and mutually exclusive</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Keep the number of options as few as possible.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Closed questions are useful if the range of possible responses is known.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
                        <p>"What is your marital status?</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Single</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Married/living together</span></li>
                            <!-- Assuming 0 O O Ethin was OCR noise -->
                        </ol>
                        <p>"Have your every gone to the local village health worker for treatment?</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Yes</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">No</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <img src="../assets/images/chapter-2-icon-1.jpg" alt="Yes/No icon" class="content-image" style="max-width: 63px; margin: 1rem 0;"> <!-- Smaller image -->

                        <p>Closed questions may also be used if one is only interested in certain aspects of an issue and does not want to waste the time of the respondent and interviewer by obtaining more information than one needs.</p>
                        <p>For example, a researcher who is only interested in the protein content of a family diet may ask:</p>
                        <p>"Did you eat any of the following foods yesterday? (Circle yes or no for each set of items)</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Peas, bean, lentils Yes / No</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Fish or meat Yes / No</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Eggs Yes / No</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Milk or Cheese Yes / No</span></li>
                             <!-- Assuming II was OCR noise -->
                        </ul>

                        <p>Closed questions may be used as well to get the respondents to express their opinions by choosing rating points on a scale.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
                        <p>"How useful would you say the activities of the Village Health Committee have been in the development of this village?"</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Extremely useful</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Very useful</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Useful</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text">Not very useful</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">5.</span><span class="item-text">Not useful at all</span></li>
                        </ol>
                         <img src="../assets/images/chapter-2-rating-scale.jpg" alt="Rating scale example" class="content-image" style="max-width: 325px; margin: 1rem 0;"> <!-- Smaller image -->

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Requirements of questions</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Must have face validity</strong> - that is the question that we design should be one that give an obviously valid and relevant measurement for the variable. For example, it may be self-evident that records kept in an obstetrics ward will provide a more valid indication of birth weights than information obtained by questioning mothers.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Must be clear and unambiguous</strong> - the way in which questions are worded can 'make or break' a questionnaire. Questions must be clear and unambiguous. They must be phrased in language that it is believed the respondent will understand, and that all respondents will understand in the same way. To ensure clarity, each question should contain only one idea; 'double-barrelled‚Äô questions like 'Do you take your child to a doctor when he has a cold or has diarrhoea?' are difficult to answer, and the answers are difficult to interpret.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Must not be offensive</strong> - whenever possible it is wise to avoid questions that may offend the respondent, for example those that deal with intimate matters, those which may seem to expose the respondent's ignorance, and those requiring him to give a socially unacceptable answer.</span></li>

                        <p>Designing a good questionnaire always takes several drafts. In the first draft we should concentrate on the content. In the second, we should look critically at the formulation and sequencing of the questions. Then we should scrutinize the format of the questionnaire. Finally, we should do a test-run to check whether the questionnaire gives us the information we require and whether both the respondents and we feel at ease with it. Usually the questionnaire will need some further adaptation before we can use it for actual data collection.</p>
