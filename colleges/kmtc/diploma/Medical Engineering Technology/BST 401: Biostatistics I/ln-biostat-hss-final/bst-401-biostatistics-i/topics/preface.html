                        <p>This lecture note is primarily for Health officer and Medical students who need to understand the principles of data collection, presentation, analysis and interpretation. It is also valuable to diploma students of environmental health, nursing and laboratory technology although some of the topics covered are beyond their requirements. The material could also be of paramount importance for an individual who is interested in medical or public health research.</p>
                        <p>It has been a usual practice for a health science student in Ethiopia to spend much of his/her time in search of reference materials on Biostatistics. Unfortunately, there are no textbooks which could appropriately fulfill the requirements of the Biostatistics course at the undergraduate level for Health officer and Medical students. We firmly believe that this lecture note will fill that gap.</p>
                        <p>The first three chapters cover basic concepts of Statistics focusing on the collection, presentation and summarization of data. Chapter four deals with the basic demographic methods and health service statistics giving greater emphasis to indices relating to the hospital. In chapters five and six elementary probability and sampling methods are presented with practical examples. A relatively comprehensive description of statistical inference on means and proportions is given in chapters seven and eight. The last chapter of this lecture note is about linear correlation and regression.</p>
                        <p>General learning objectives followed by introductory sections which are specific to each chapter are placed at the beginning of each chapter. The lecture note also includes many problems for the student, most of them based on real data, the majority with detailed solutions. A few reference materials are also given at the end of the lecture note for further reading.</p>
