                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Simple Random Sampling (SRS):</strong> Every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being selected. Requires a complete sampling frame. Selection can be done using lottery method or random number tables/generators.
                                <br><em>Advantages:</em> Simple concept, allows easy calculation of sampling error.
                                <br><em>Disadvantages:</em> Requires a complete sampling frame, can be inefficient if population is large or dispersed, may not ensure representation of subgroups.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Systematic Random Sampling:</strong> Selects units at regular intervals from the sampling frame after a random start. Calculate sampling interval $k = N/n$ (N=population size, n=sample size). Randomly select a starting point between 1 and k. Select every k-th unit thereafter.
                                <br><em>Advantages:</em> Easier to implement than SRS, often provides a representative sample if the list is randomly ordered.
                                <br><em>Disadvantages:</em> Requires a sampling frame, potential for bias if there is periodicity in the list that matches the sampling interval.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Stratified Random Sampling:</strong> Divides the population into mutually exclusive subgroups (strata) based on relevant characteristics (e.g., age, sex, region). Then, a simple random or systematic sample is drawn from each stratum. Can be proportionate (sample size in stratum proportional to population size in stratum) or disproportionate.
                                <br><em>Advantages:</em> Ensures representation of key subgroups, can provide more precise estimates for each stratum and overall population compared to SRS of the same size.
                                <br><em>Disadvantages:</em> Requires knowledge of stratum characteristics for all units in the frame, more complex to implement and analyze.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">d)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Cluster (Area) Sampling:</strong> Divides the population into clusters (often geographic areas like villages or enumeration areas). A random sample of clusters is selected. All units within the selected clusters are included in the sample (one-stage cluster sampling).
                                <br><em>Advantages:</em> Does not require a complete list of all individual units (only clusters), reduces travel costs if clusters are geographic areas.
                                <br><em>Disadvantages:</em> Less precise than SRS or stratified sampling of the same size (units within a cluster tend to be similar), requires larger sample size to achieve same precision, complex analysis.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">e)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Multi-Stage Sampling:</strong> Involves sampling in two or more stages. Example: First stage - randomly select regions; Second stage - randomly select kebeles within selected regions; Third stage - randomly select households within selected kebeles. Combines different methods (e.g., cluster sampling followed by SRS).
                                <br><em>Advantages:</em> Flexible, practical for large and dispersed populations, reduces costs.
                                <br><em>Disadvantages:</em> More complex design and analysis, potentially less precise than simpler methods.</span></li>
