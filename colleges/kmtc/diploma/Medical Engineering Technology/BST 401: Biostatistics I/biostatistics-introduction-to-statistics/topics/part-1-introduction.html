                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Broadly speaking, statistics may be divided into two categories, i.e. descriptive and inferential statistics.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1) Descriptive Statistics</h3>
                        <p>Descriptive statistics is the term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way such that, for example, patterns might emerge from the data.</p>
                        <p>Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analyzed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data.</p>
                        <p>Descriptive statistics are very important, as if we simply presented our raw data it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing, especially if there was a lot of it. Descriptive statistics therefore allow us to present the data in a more meaningful way which allows simpler interpretation of the data. For example, if we had the results of 100 pieces of students' coursework, we may be interested in the overall performance of those students. We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks. Descriptive statistics allow us to do this.</p>
                        <p>When we use descriptive statistics it is useful to summarize our group of data using a combination of tabulated description (i.e. tables), graphical description (i.e. graphs and charts) and statistical commentary (i.e. a discussion of the results).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2) Inferential Statistics</h3>
                        <p>Whilst descriptive statistics examine our immediate group of data (for example, the 100 students' marks), inferential statistics aim to make inferences from this data in order to make conclusions that go beyond this data. In other words, inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population from a sample in order to generalize (make assumptions about this wider population) and/or make predictions about the future</p>
                        <p>For example, a Board of Examiners may want to compare the performance of 1000 students that completed an examination. Of these, 500 students are girls and 500 students are boys. The 1000 students represent our "population". Whilst we are interested in the performance of all 1000 students, girls and boys, it may be impractical to examine the marks of all of these students because of the time and cost required to collate all of their marks. Instead, we can choose to examine a "sample" of these students and then use the results to make generalizations about the performance of all 1000 students. For the purpose of our example, we may choose a sample size of 200 students. Since we are looking to compare boys and girls, we may randomly select 100 girls and 100 boys in our sample. We could then use this, for example, to see if there are any statistically significant differences in the mean mark between boys and girls, even though we have not measured all 1000 students.</p>

                        <p>It is often said by people that, "statistics can prove anything." There are three types of lies lies, demand lies and statistics - wicked in the order of their naming. A Paris banker said, "Statistics is like a miniskirt, it covers up essentials but gives you the ideas."</p>
                        <p>Thus by "distrust of statistics" we mean lack of confidence in statistical statements and methods.</p>
                        <p>The following reasons account for such views about statistics.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">

                                <span class="item-text">Figures are convincing and, therefore people easily believe them.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text">The wrong representation of even correct figures can mislead a reader. For example, John earned Ksh 400,000 in 1990-1991 and Jane earned Ksh 500,000. Reading this one would form the opinion that Jane is decidedly a better worker than John. However if we carefully examine the statement, we might reach a different conclusion as Jane's earning period is unknown to us. Thus while working with statistics one should not only avoid outright falsehoods but be alert to detect possible distortion of the truth.</span>
