\section*{PART 1: INTRODUCTION}

\section*{What is Statistics?}

This is the collection, presentation, analysis and interpretation of the numerical data. This definition clearly points out four stages in a statistical investigation, namely:
1. Collection of data
2. Presentation of data
3. Analysis of data
4. Interpretation of data

\section*{Importance of statistics}
a) To present the data in a concise and definite form: Statistics helps in classifying and tabulating raw data for processing and further tabulation for end users.
b) To make it easy to understand complex and large data: This is done by presenting the data in the form of tables, graphs, diagrams etc., or by condensing the data with the help of means, dispersion etc.
c) For comparison: Tables, measures of means and dispersion can help in comparing different sets of data.

d) Informing policies: It helps in forming policies like a production schedule, based on the relevant sales figures. It is used in forecasting future demands.
e) Enlarging individual experiences: Complex problems can be well understood by statistics, as the conclusions drawn by an individual are more definite and precise than mere statements on facts.
f) In measuring the magnitude of a phenomenon: Statistics has made it possible to count the population of a country, the industrial growth, the agricultural growth, the educational level (of course in numbers)

\section*{Limitations of Statistics}
1. Statistics does not deal with individual measurements. Since statistics deals with aggregates of facts, it cannot be used to study the changes that have taken place in individual cases. For example, the wages earned by a single industry worker at any time, taken by itself is not a statistical datum. But the wages of workers of that industry can be used statistically. Similarly the marks obtained by sahra of your class or the height of omar (also of your class) are not the subject matter of statistical study. But the average marks or the average height of your class has statistical relevance.
2. Statistics cannot be used to study qualitative phenomenon like morality, intelligence, beauty etc. as these cannot be quantified. However, it may be possible to analyse such problems statistically by expressing them numerically. For example we may study the intelligence of boys on the basis of the marks obtained by them in an examination.
3. Statistical results are true only on an average: The conclusions obtained statistically are not universal truths. They are true only under certain conditions. This is because statistics as a science is less exact as compared to the natural science.
4. Statistical data, being approximations, are mathematically incorrect. Therefore, they can be used only if mathematical accuracy is not needed.
5. Statistics, being dependent on figures, can be manipulated and therefore can be used only when the authenticity of the figures has been proved beyond doubt

\section*{Types of Statistics}

Broadly speaking, statistics may be divided into two categories, i.e. descriptive and inferential statistics.

\section*{1) Descriptive Statistics}

Descriptive statistics is the term given to the analysis of data that helps describe, show or summarize data in a meaningful way such that, for example, patterns might emerge from the data.

Descriptive statistics do not, however, allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have analyzed or reach conclusions regarding any hypotheses we might have made. They are simply a way to describe our data.

Descriptive statistics are very important, as if we simply presented our raw data it would be hard to visualize what the data was showing, especially if there was a lot of it. Descriptive statistics therefore allow us to present the data in a more meaningful way which allows simpler interpretation of the data. For example, if we had the results of 100 pieces of students' coursework, we may be interested in the overall performance of those students. We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks. Descriptive statistics allow us to do this.

When we use descriptive statistics it is useful to summarize our group of data using a combination of tabulated description (i.e. tables), graphical description (i.e. graphs and charts) and statistical commentary (i.e. a discussion of the results).

\section*{2) Inferential Statistics}

Whilst descriptive statistics examine our immediate group of data (for example, the 100 students' marks), inferential statistics aim to make inferences from this data in order to make conclusions that go beyond this data. In other words, inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population from a sample in order to generalize (make assumptions about this wider population) and/or make predictions about the future

For example, a Board of Examiners may want to compare the performance of 1000 students that completed an examination. Of these, 500 students are girls and 500 students are boys. The 1000 students represent our "population". Whilst we are interested in the performance of all 1000
students, girls and boys, it may be impractical to examine the marks of all of these students because of the time and cost required to collate all of their marks. Instead, we can choose to examine a "sample" of these students and then use the results to make generalizations about the performance of all 1000 students. For the purpose of our example, we may choose a sample size of 200 students. Since we are looking to compare boys and girls, we may randomly select 100 girls and 100 boys in our sample. We could then use this, for example, to see if there are any statistically significant differences in the mean mark between boys and girls, even though we have not measured all 1000 students.

\section*{Definition of Basic Statistical Terms}
;Data - facts, observations, and information that come from investigations.
- Measurement data sometimes called quantitative data - the result of using some instrument to measure something (e.g., test score, weight);
- Categorical data also referred to as frequency or qualitative data. Things are grouped according to some common property (i.e.) and the number of members of the group are recorded (e.g., males/females, vehicle type).

Variable - property of an object or event that can take on different values
- Discrete Variable - a variable with a limited number of values (e.g., gender (male/female), college class (freshman/junior/senior).
- Continuous Variable - a variable that can take on many different values, in theory, any value between the lowest and highest points on the measurement scale.
- Independent Variable - a variable that is manipulated, measured, or selected by the researcher as an antecedent condition to an observed behaviour. In a hypothesized cause-

and-effect relationship, the independent variable is the cause and the dependent variable is the outcome or effect
- Dependent Variable - a variable that is not under the experimenter's control -- the data.

It is the variable that is observed and measured in response to the independent variable.
- Qualitative Variable - a variable based on categorical data.
- Quantitative Variable - a variable based on quantitative data.
1. Population- includes all of the elements from a set of data.
2. Sample - consists of one or more observations from the population

\section*{Common Mistakes Committed In Interpretation of Statistics}
1. Bias: - Bias means prejudice or preference of the investigator, which creeps in consciously and unconsciously in proving a particular point.
2. Generalization:- Some times on the basis of little data available one could jump to a conclusion, which leads to erroneous results.
3. Wrong conclusion:- The characteristics of a group if attached to an individual member of that group, may lead us to draw absurd conclusions.
4. Incomplete classification:- If we fail to give a complete classification, the influence of various factors may not be properly understood.
5. There may be a wrong use of percentages.
6. Technical mistakes may also occur.
7. An inconsistency in definition can even exist.

\section*{Distrust of Statistics}

It is often said by people that, "statistics can prove anything." There are three types of lies lies, demand lies and statistics - wicked in the order of their naming. A Paris banker said, "Statistics is like a miniskirt, it covers up essentials but gives you the ideas."

Thus by "distrust of statistics" we mean lack of confidence in statistical statements and methods.

The following reasons account for such views about statistics.
1. Figures are convincing and, therefore people easily believe them.
2. They can be manipulated in such a manner as to establish foregone conclusions.
3. The wrong representation of even correct figures can mislead a reader. For example, John earned Ksh 400,000 in 1990-1991 and Jane earned Ksh 500,000. Reading this one would form the opinion that Jane is decidedly a better worker than John. However if we carefully examine the statement, we might reach a different conclusion as Jane's earning period is unknown to us. Thus while working with statistics one should not only avoid outright falsehoods but be alert to detect possible distortion of the truth.

\section*{DATA COLLECTION METHODS}
- Primary Data collection Methods

Primary data is data that you collect yourself using such methods as: direct observation, surveys and interviews.
- Methods of collecting primary data

\section*{1. Questionnaires}

Questionnaires are a popular means of collecting data, but are difficult to design and often require many rewrites before an acceptable questionnaire is produced.

Advantages:
- Can be used as a method in its own right or as a basis for interviewing or a telephone survey.
- Can be posted, e-mailed or faxed.
- Can cover a large number of people or organizations.
- Wide geographic coverage.
- Relatively cheap.
- No prior arrangements are needed.
- Avoids embarrassment on the part of the respondent.
- Respondent can consider responses.
- No interviewer bias

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Design problems.
- Questions have to be relatively simple.
- Historically low response rate (although inducements may help).
- Time delay whilst waiting for responses to be returned.
- Require a return deadline.
- Several reminders may be required.
- Assumes no literacy problems.
- No control over who completes it.
- Not possible to give assistance if required.
- Problems with incomplete questionnaires.
- Replies not spontaneous and independent of each other.
- Respondent can read all questions beforehand and then decide whether to complete or not. For example, perhaps because it is too long, too complex, uninteresting, or too personal

\section*{2. Interviews}

Interviewing is a technique that is primarily used to gain an understanding of the underlying reasons and motivations for people's attitudes, preferences or behavior. Interviews can be undertaken on a personal one-to-one basis or in a group. They can be conducted at work, at home, in the street or in a shopping centre, or some other agreed location.

Advantages:
- Serious approach by respondent resulting in accurate information. Good response rate.
- Completed and immediate.
- Possible in-depth questions
- Interviewer in control and can give help if there is a problem.
- Can investigate motives and feelings.
- Can use recording equipment.
- Characteristics of respondent assessed - tone of voice, facial expression, hesitation, etc.
- Can use props.
- one interviewer used, uniformity of approach. Used to pilot other methods.

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Need to set up interviews.
- Time consuming.
- Geographic limitations.
- Can be expensive.
- Normally need a set of questions.
- Respondent bias - tendency to please or impress, create false personal image, or end interview quickly.
- Embarrassment possible if personal questions.
- Transcription and analysis can present problems - subjectivity.
- If many interviewers, training required

\section*{Observation}

In the method of data collection called observation, the researcher observes participants in natural and/or structured environments.

It is important to collect observational data because what people say is not always what they do!

Observation can be carried out in two types of environments:
1. Laboratory observation (which is done in a lab set up by the researcher).
2. Naturalistic observation (which is done in real-world settings).

\section*{Advantages}
- Allows one to directly see what people do without having to rely on what they say they do.
- Provides first-hand experience, especially if the observer participates in activities.
- Can provide relatively objective measurement of behavior (especially for standardized observations).
- Observer can determine what does not occur.
- Observer may see things that escape the awareness of people in the setting.
- Excellent way to discover what is occurring in a setting.
- Helps in understanding importance of contextual factors.
- Can be used with participants with weak verbal skills.
- May provide information on things people would otherwise be unwilling to talk about.
- Observer may move beyond selective perceptions of people in the setting.
- Good for description.
- Provides moderate degree of realism (when done outside of the laboratory).

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Reasons for observed behaviour may be unclear.
- Reactive effects may occur when respondents know they are being observed (e.g., people being observed may behave in atypical ways).
- Investigator effects (e.g., personal biases and selective perception of observers)
- Observer may "go native" (i.e., over-identifying with the group being studied).
- Sampling of observed people and settings may be limited.
- Cannot observe large or dispersed populations.
- Some settings and content of interest cannot be observed.
- Collection of unimportant material may be moderately high.
- More expensive to conduct than questionnaires and tests.
- Data analysis can be time consuming.

\section*{Secondary/Existing Data}

Secondary data (i.e., data originally used for a different purpose) are contrasted with primary data (i.e., original data collected for the new research study).

The most commonly used secondary data are documents, physical data, and archived research data.
- Documents

There are two main kinds of documents.
I. Personal documents (i.e., things written or recorded for private purposes), Letters, diaries, family pictures.
II. Official documents (i.e., things written or recorded for public or private organizations). Newspapers, annual reports, yearbooks, minutes.

Physical data (are any material thing created or left by humans that might provide information about a phenomenon of interest to a researcher).

Archived research data (i.e., research data collected by other researchers for other purposes, and these data are save often in tape form or cd form so that others might later use the data).

\section*{Advantages documents and physical data}
- Can provide insight into what people think and what they do.
- Unobtrusive, making reactive and investigator effects very unlikely.
- Can be collected for time periods occurring in the past (e.g., historical data).
- Provides useful background and historical data on people, groups, and organizations.
- Useful for corroboration.
- Grounded in local setting.
- Useful for exploration.

\section*{Advantages of archived research data}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Archived research data are available on a wide variety of topics.
- Inexpensive.
- Often are reliable and valid (high measurement validity).
- Can study trends. - Ease of data analysis.
- Often based on high quality or large probability samples.

\section*{Disadvantages of documents and physical data}
- May be incomplete.
- May be representative only of one perspective.
- Access to some types of content is limited.
- May not provide insight into participants' personal thinking for physical data.
- May not apply to general populations.

\section*{Disadvantages of archived research data}
- May not be available for the population of interest to you.
- May not be available for the research questions of interest to you.
- Data may be dated.
- Open-ended or qualitative data usually not available.
- Many of the most important findings have already been mined from the data.

\section*{Steps in a statistical enquiry.}

\section*{1. Problem statement:}

State the problem clearly. Suppose the problem concerns wages in a factory or teachers. Is it wages earned or wage rates? Must the statistics concern all employees or separate grade?

\section*{2. Sample Selection}

A sample is a group of items selected from the population for study, i.e. identify a group of objects drawn from a population of size N where $\mathrm{n}>\mathrm{N}$. Population refers to the aggregate of all individual items, people, objects, etc about which information is required. That is a set of all possible observations or measurements that are under consideration. Individual items in the population are called elementary limits.

\section*{Population can be classified into;}

Finite population - Those, which contain precise and definite number of elementary units or items, e.g. population of University of somalia students in 2018.

Infinite Population - one, which contains an infinity large number of elementary units, e.g. population of ocean fish. For infinite population, complete information cannot be obtained and therefore any study for such a population must be based on the study of a sample. Note that If it's not possible to have a complete coverage (population) of information being sought, then one needs to determine the size of the sample and the method of sampling. This depends on
$>$ Kind of information wanted
$>$ Cost
$>$ The degree of accuracy required

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Reasons why one would study a sample and not the entire population:
> Population may be infinitely large and may not be possible to study at all, or if population is finite it might be too large for all items to be examined
$>$ Financial and time constraints: Study of entire population may not be feasible.
$>$ Entire population might not be accessible, e.g. in time scores analysis, only recent data may be available

\section*{3. Drafting the Questionnaire}

Questions should be drafted to give the exact information wanted. A pilot survey is useful to enable a satisfactory questionnaire to be obtained.

\section*{4. Collection of Data}

By use of enumerators, ask questions and fill in the questionnaire
$>$ Secondary - already published
> Primary - raw from field for specific purpose

\section*{5. Editing the Schedules}

Questionnaires require to be checked sometimes coded and calculations made before tabulation can be done.

\section*{6. Organization of Data}

For example, counting items, summing values, categorizing values, etc.

\section*{7. Analysis and Interpretation of information}

This requires sound knowledge of statistical methods and secondary sound knowledge of the subject for which statistical evidence has been obtained.

\section*{8. Presentation}

May be in form of tables, charts, and graphs.
9. Writing of the report
$>$ Gives the results of investigation
$>$ Makes recommendations where necessary
N/B: For data collection, it can either be primary or secondary. Data can be collected from published sources (secondary) designing and experiment, conducting a survey.
