\section*{PHARMACOLOGY NOTES}

KMTC KABARNET
BY: I.S KIMOSOP

\section*{Pharmacology:}

\section*{I. Introduction}

Pharmacology is a medical science that forms a backbone of the medical profession as drugs
Form the corner stone of therapy in human diseases. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to
Describe the pharmacological basis of therapeutics in order to maximize the benefits and
Minimize the risks of drugs to recipients.

\section*{A. Definitions of terms:}
1. Pharmacology: Pharmacology is the study of interaction of drugs with living organisms.
It also includes history, source, physicochemical properties, dosage forms, methods of
Administration, absorption, distribution mechanism of action, biotransformation,
Excretion, clinical uses and adverse effects of drugs.
2. Clinical Pharmacology: It evaluate the pharmacological action of drug, preferred route
Of administration and safe dosage range in human by clinical trials.
3. Drugs: Drugs are chemicals that alter functions of living organisms. Drugs are generally
Given for the diagnosis, prevention, control or cure of disease.
4. Pharmacy: It is the science of identification, selection, preservation, standardization,
Compounding and dispensing of medical substances.
2
5. Pharmacodynamics: The study of the biological and therapeutic effects of drugs (i.e,
"What the drug does to the body").
6. Pharmacokinetics: Study of the absorption, distribution metabolism and excretion
(ADME) of drugs ("i.e what the body does to the drug").
7. Pharmacotherapeutics: It deals with the proper selection and use of drugs for the
Prevention and treatment of disease.
8. Toxicology: It's the science of poisons. Many drugs in larger doses may act as poisons.
Poisons are substances that cause harmful, dangerous or fatal symptoms in living
substances.
9. Chemotherapy: It's the effect of drugs upon microorganisms, parasites and neoplastic
cells living and multiplying in living organisms.
10. Pharmacopoeia: An official code containing a selected list of the established drugs and
medical preparations with descriptions of their physical properties and tests for their
identity, purity and potency e.g. Indian Pharmacopoeia (I.P), British
Pharmacopoeia
(B.P).
11. Clearance of a drug: It is the volume of plasma cleared of the drug by metabolism (hepatic) and excretion (renal) and other organs.
12. Teratogenicity: means congenital malformation
B. Drugs are obtained from:
1. Minerals: Liquid paraffin, magnesium sulfate, magnesium trisilicate, kaolin, etc.
2. Animals: Insulin, thyroid extract, heparin and antitoxin sera, etc.
3. Plants: Morphine, digoxin, atropine, castor oil, etc.
4. Synthetic source: Aspirin, sulphonamides, paracetamol, zidovudine, etc.
5. Microorganisms: Penicillin, streptomycin and many other antibiotics.
6. Genetic engineering: Human insulin, human growth hormone etc.

Out of all the above sources, majority of the drugs currently used in
therapeutics are from
Synthetic source.

\section*{II. PHARMACODYNAMICS}

Definition: Pharmacodynamics is the study of effects of drugs on biological processes.
Involves how the drugs act on target cells to alter cellular function.
A. Receptor and non-receptor mechanisms: Most of the drugs act by interacting with a
Cellular component called receptor. Some drugs act through simple physical or chemical
Reactions without interacting with any receptor.
- Receptors are protein molecules present either on the cell surface or within the cell
e.g. adrenergic receptors, cholinoceptors, insulin receptors, etc.
- The endogenous neurotransmitters, hormones, autacoids (act like local hormones) and most of the drugs produce their effects by binding with their specific receptors.
- Aluminum hydroxide and magnesium trisilicate, which are used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease act by non-receptor mechanism by neutralizing the gastric acid.

Many drugs are similar to or have similar chemical groups to the naturally occurring chemical
and have the ability to bind onto a receptor where one of two things can happen- either the
receptor will respond or it will be blocked.
A drug, which is able to fit onto a receptor, is said to have affinity for that receptor.
Efficacy is the ability of a drug to produce an effect at a receptor.
An agonist has both an affinity and efficacy whereas antagonist has affinity but not efficacy or intrinsic activity.
When a drug is able to stimulate a receptor, it is known as an agonist and therefore mimics the
Endogenous transmitter.
When the drug blocks a receptor, it is known as antagonist and therefore blocks the action of
the endogenous transmitter (i.e. it will prevent the natural chemical from acting on the receptor).

\section*{Agonists and Antagonists}
- Def: Agonists are drugs that bind to and thereby activate receptor proteins.
- Def: Antagonists are drugs that bind to and thereby reduce the activity of receptor proteins.
- Eg.
- Muscarine is an agonist of muscarinic ACh receptors, whereas atropine is an antagonist of muscarinic receptors.
- Nicotine is an agonist for nicotinic ACh receptors; antagonists include a-bungarotoxin (neurotoxin produced by venom of a Taiwanese snake) and curare ( alkaloid family of organic cpd drug used as skeletal muscle relaxant).

\section*{B. Site of drug action:}
- A drug may act:
(i) Extracellularly e.g: osmotic diuretics, plasma expanders.
(ii) On the cell surface e.g.: digitalis, penicillin, catecholamines
(iii) Inside the cell e.g.: anti-cancer drugs, steroid hormones.

\section*{C. Dose Response relationship}

The exact relationship between the dose and the response depends on the biological object
Under observation and the drug employed.
The lowest concentration of a drug that elicits a response is referred as the minimal dose, and the largest concentration after which further increase in concentration will not change the response is the maximal dose.

\section*{D. Structural activity relationship}

The activity of a drug is intimately related to its chemical structure. Knowledge about the chemical structure of a drug is useful for:
(i) Synthesis of new compounds with more specific actions and fewer adverse
Reactions
(ii) Synthesis of competitive antagonist and
(iii) Understanding the mechanism of drug action.

Slight modification of structure of the compound can change the effect completely.

\section*{III. PHARMACOKINETICS}

\section*{Overview of pharmacokinetics}

Pharmacokinetics deals with the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs in the body.
- The goal of drug therapy is to prevent, cure, or control various disease states.
- To achieve this goal, adequate drug doses must be delivered to the target tissues so that therapeutic yet nontoxic levels are obtained.
- Pharmacokinetics examines the movement of a drug over time through the body.
- Pharmacological as well as toxicological actions of drugs are primarily related to the plasma concentrations of drugs. Thus, the clinician must recognize that the speed of onset of drug action, the intensity of the drug's effect, and the duration of drug action are controlled by four fundamental pathways of drug movement and modification in the body; namely:
i) Absorption: - drug absorption from the site of administration permits entry of the therapeutic agent (either directly or indirectly) into plasma.
ii) Distribution: - the drug may then reversibly leave the bloodstream and distribute into the interstitial and intracellular fluids.
iii) Metabolism: - the drug may be metabolized by the liver, kidney, or other tissues.
iv) Excretion/elimination:- the drug and its metabolites are removed from the body in urine, bile, or feces.
NOTE: Knowledge of these four processes (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination/Excretion) influences the clinician's decision of the route of administration for a specific drug, the amount and frequency of each dose, and the dosing intervals

\section*{A. Biotransport of drug:}

It refers to translocation of a solute from one side of the biological barrier to the other.

\section*{1. Structure of biological membrane:}

The outer surface of the cell is covered by a very thin structure known as plasma membrane which is composed of lipid and protein molecules. The membrane proteins have many functions like;
a) contributing structure to the membrane
b) acting as enzyme
c) acting as carrier for transport of substances
d) Acting as receptors.

The plasma membrane is a semipermeable membrane allowing certain chemical substances to pass freely e.g. it allows water, glucose, etc. but it won't allow sucrose until it is converted into glucose and fructose.
2. Passage of drug across membrane:
(a) Passive transfer:
i. Simple diffusion
ii. Filtration
(b) Specialized transport
i. Facilitated diffusion
ii. Active transport
iii. Endocytosis.
(a) i) Simple diffusion: Refers to the movement of a solute through a biological barrier from the phase of higher concentration to phase of lower concentration. No need of energy e.g. highly lipid soluble drugs. ii) Filtration: Is the process by which water soluble drug of relatively low molecular weight crosses the plasma membrane through pores as a result of hydrodynamic pressure gradient across the membrane e.g. urea and ethylene glycol.
(b)i) Facilitated diffusion: It means the passage of drug across the biological membrane along the concentration gradient by the protein carrier mediated system also called as carrier mediated diffusion. It depends on number of carrier e.g. tetracycline, pyrimidine.
ii) Active transport: The process by which drugs pass across the biological membrane most often against their concentration gradient with the help of carriers along with the expenditure of energy e.g. alpha methyl dopa, levodopa, 5 -fluoro-uracil, 5 bromouracil.
iii) Endocytosis: It is the process by which the large molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane and releases them intracellularly e.g. protein, toxins (botulinum, diphtheria)

B. Drug absorption: Absorption is the process by which the drug enters into the systemic
Circulation from the site of administration through biological barrier. In case of intravenous or
Intra-arterial administration the drug bypasses absorption processes and it enters into the
Circulation directly.

\section*{1. Routes of drug administration:}
a) From the alimentary tract:
(i) Buccal cavity: e.g. nitrates
(ii) Stomach: e.g. aspirin, alcohol
(iii) Intestine: e.g. most of non-ionized and ionized drugs.
(iv) Rectum: e.g. rectal suppositories, bisacodyl laxatives.

Advantages of oral route: This route is safe, convenient and economical. Disadvantages of oral route: Onset of drug action is slow, irritant drugs cannot be
Administered and it is not useful in vomiting and severe diarrhea, gastric acid and digestive
Enzymes may destroy some drugs, and water soluble drugs are absorbed poorly.

\section*{b) From the parenteral route:}
(i) Intradermal: This is given into the layers of the skin e.g. B.C.G. vaccine
(ii) Subcutaneous: Non-irritant substances are given into subcutaneous tissue
e.g. insulin
(iii) Intramuscular: Soluble substances, mild irritants, suspensions and colloids can be
Injected by this route. These injections can be given to deltoid or gluteal muscle. This
route is one of the more common routes e.g. multivitamins, streptomycin, etc.
Advantages: rate of absorption is uniform, onset of action is faster than oral and
it can be given in diarrhoea or vomiting.
Disadvantages: Pain at local site of injection, the volume of injection should not
exceed 10 ml .
(iv) Intravenous: Drugs directly given into a vein, produce rapid action, no need of
absorption as they enter directly into blood, can be given as bolus e.g. furosemide,
morphine, dopamine or as continous infusion e.g. fluids during shock or dehydration.
Advantages: It can be given in large volumes, production of desired blood concentration can be obtained with a well designed dose.
Disadvantages: Drug effect cannot be halted if once the drug is injected. Expertise is needed to give injection.
(v) Intrathecal: Injected into subarachnoid space of spinal cord e.g. spinal anaesthetics.
(vi) Intraperitonial: Injections given into the abdominal cavity e.g. infant saline, glucose.
(vii) Intra-articular: Injected directly into a joint e.g. hydrocortisone.
c) Transcutaneous route:
i) Iontophoresis: Galvanic current is used for bringing about the penetration of drugs into deeper tissue e.g. salicylates.
ii) Inunctions: Absorbed when rubbed in to the skin e.g. nitroglycerin ointment in angina Pectoris.
iii) Jet injection: With help of high velocity jet produced is through a micro fine orifice; No
need of needle and therefore painless. e.g. mass inoculation programmes. iv)Adhesive units: A transdermal therapeutic system which produce prolonged
Systemic effect e.g. scopolamine for motion sickness.

\section*{d) Topical/ local route:}

The absorption through skin is a passive process.
The absorption occurs more easily through the cell lining e.g. dusting powder, paste, lotion, drops, ointment, suppository for vagina and Rectum.

\section*{e) Inhalation:}

Drugs may be administered as dry powders, and nebulized particles when sprayed as fine
Droplets get deposited over the mucous membrane producing local effects and may be
Absorbed for systemic effects e.g. salbutamol spray used in bronchial asthma and volatile General anesthetics.

\section*{2. Bioavailability:}

It is the rate and amount of drug that is absorbed from a given dosage form and reaches the

Systemic circulation following non-vascular administration. When the drug is given IV, the
Bioavailability is $100 \%$. It is important to know the manner in which a drug is absorbed. The
Route of administration largely determines the latent period between administration and onset of action. However, drugs are often administered by other routes, such as orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, rectally, sublingually, or directly into desired sites of action. With these other routes, the amount of drug actually entering the systemic circulation may be less than with the intravenous route.
Drugs given by mouth may be inactive for the following reasons:
i. Enzymatic degradation of polypeptides within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract e.g.insulin, ACTH.
ii. Poor absorption through gastrointestinal tract e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotic.
iii. Inactivation by liver e.g. testosterone during first passage through the liver before it reaches systemic circulation.

\section*{3. Factors affecting drug absorption and bioavailability:}
(a) Physico-chemical properties of drug
(b) Nature of the dosage form
(c) Physiological factors
(d) Pharmacogenetic factors
(e) Disease states.
a) Physico-chemical properties of drug:
i) Physical state: Liquids are absorbed better than solids and crystalloids absorbed better than colloids.
ii) Lipid or water solubility: Drugs in aqueous solution mix more readily than those in oily solution. However at the cell surface, the lipid soluble drugs penetrate into the cell more rapidly than the water soluble drugs.
iii) Ionization: Most of the drugs are organic compounds. Unlike inorganic compounds, the organic drugs are not completely ionized in the fluid.
Unionized component is predominantly lipid soluble and is absorbed rapidly and an ionized is often water soluble component which is absorbed poorly. Most of the drugs are weak acids or weak bases.
It may be assumed for all practical purposes that the mucosal lining of the G.I.T is

Impermeable to the ionized form of a weak organic acid or a weak organic base. These drugs exist in two forms.
Acidic drugs: rapidly absorbed from the stomach e.g. salicylates and barbiturates.
Basic drugs: Not absorbed until they reach to the alkaline environment i.e. small
Intestine when administered orally e.g. pethidine and ephedrine.
b) Dosage forms:
i) Particle size: Small particle size is important for drug absorption. Drugs given in a dispersed or emulsified state are absorbed better e.g. vitamin $D$ and Vitamin A.
ii) Disintegration time and dissolution rate.

Disintegration time: The rate of breakup of the tablet or capsule into the drug granules.
Dissolution rate: The rate at which the drug goes into solution.
iii) Formulation: Usually substances like lactose, sucrose, starch and calcium phosphate are used as inert diluents in formulating powders or tablets. Fillers may not be totally inert but may affect the absorption as well as stability of the medicament. Thus a faulty formulation can render a useful drug totally useless therapeutically.
c) Physiological factors:
i) Gastrointestinal transit time: Rapid absorption occurs when the drug is given on empty stomach. However certain irritant drugs like salicylates and iron preparations are deliberately administered after food to minimize the gastrointestinal irritation. But sometimes the presence of food in the G.I tract aids the absorption of certain drugs e.g.
griseofulvin, propranolol and riboflavin.
ii) Presence of other agents: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron from the G.I.T.
Calcium present in milk and in antacids forms insoluble complexes with the tetracycline antibiotics and reduces their absorption.
iii) Area of the absorbing surface and local circulation: Drugs can be absorbed better from the small intestine than from the stomach because of the larger surface area of the former. Increased vascular supply can increase the absorption.
iv) Enterohepatic cycling: Some drugs move in between intestines and liver before they reach the site of action. This increases the bioavailability e.g. phenolphthalein.
v) Metabolism of drug/first pass effect: Rapid degradation of a drug by the liver during the
First pass (propranolol) or by the gut wall (isoprenaline) also affects the bioavailability.
Thus a drug though absorbed well when given orally may not be effective because of its
Extensive first pass metabolism.
11
d) Pharmacogenetic factors:

Individual variations occur due to the genetically mediated reason in drug absorption and
response.

\section*{e) Disease states:}

Absorption and first pass metabolism may be affected in conditions like malabsorption,
thyrotoxicosis, achlorhydria and liver cirrhosis.

\section*{C) Distribution of drugs}
1. Definition: Drug distribution is the process by which a drug reversibly leaves the bloodstream and enters the interstitium (extracellular fluid) and/or the cells of the tissues. Drugs distribute through various body fluid compartments such as; plasma interstitial fluid compartment trans-cellular compartment.

\section*{Factors affecting delivery or distributions of drugs from the plasma to the} interstitium
They include:
i. Blood Flow
ii. Capillary permeability
iii. The degree of binding of the drug to plasma and tissue proteins, and
iv. The relative hydrophobicity of the drug.

\section*{i) Blood flow}

The rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely as a result of the unequal distribution of cardiac output to the various organs.
Blood flow to the brain, liver, and kidney is greater than that to the skeletal muscles; adipose tissue has a still lower rate of blood flow.
This differential blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by a bolus IV injection of thiopental.
The high blood flow, together with the superior lipid solubility of thiopental, permit it to rapidly move into the central nervous system (CNS) and produce anesthesia. Slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers the plasma concentration sufficiently so that the higher concentrations within the CNS decrease, and consciousness is regained.

\section*{ii) Capillary permeability}

Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug. Capillary structure: Capillary structure varies widely in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane that is exposed by slit junctions between endothelial cells. In the brain, the capillary structure is continuous, and there are no slit junctions.
This contrasts with the liver and spleen, where a large part of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous capillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass.
Blood-brain barrier: To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the CNS or be actively transported. For example, a specific transporter for the large neutral amino acid transporter carries levodopa into the brain.
By contrast, lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate into the CNS because they can dissolve in the membrane of the endothelial cells.
Ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they are unable to pass through the endothelial cells of the CNS, which have no slit junctions. These tightly juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that constitute the so-called blood-brain barrier.
Drug structure: The chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Hydrophobic drugs, which have a uniform distribution of electrons and no net charge, readily move across most biologic membranes.
These drugs can dissolve in the lipid membranes and, therefore, permeate the entire cell's surface.

The major factor influencing the hydrophobic drug's distribution is the blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic drugs, which have either a nonuniform distribution of electrons or a positive or negative charge, do not readily penetrate cell membranes, and therefore, must go through the slit junctions.
iii) Binding of drugs to plasma proteins

Reversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows their transfer out of the vascular compartment.
Binding is relatively nonselective as to chemical structure and takes place at sites on the protein to which endogenous compounds, such as bilirubin, normally attach.
Plasma albumin is the major drug-binding protein and may act as a drug reservoir; that is, as the concentration of the free drug decreases due to elimination by metabolism or excretion, the bound drug dissociates from the protein. This maintains the free-drug concentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.

\section*{D. Metabolism of drugs:}

Def: drug metabolism or biotransformation refers to the process by which the body brings about changes in drug molecule
Drugs are chemical substances, which interact with living organisms and produce some pharmacological effects and therefore, they should be eliminated from the body unchanged or by changing to some easily excretable molecules.

\section*{E. Excretion of drugs:}

Excretion of drugs means the transportation of unaltered or altered form of drug out of the body. The major processes of excretion include renal excretion, hepatobiliary excretion and pulmonary excretion. The minor routes of excretion are saliva, sweat, tears, breast milk, vaginal fluid, nails and hair.
The rate of excretion influences the duration of action of drug. The drug that is excreted slowly, the concentration of drug in the body is maintained and the effects of the drug will continue for longer period.

\section*{Different routes of drug excretion:}
a).Renal excretion: A major part of excretion of chemicals is metabolically unchanged or changed.

The excretion of drug by the kidney involves.
i) Glomerular filtration
ii) Active tubular secretion
iii) Passive tubular reabsorption.

The function of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is to remove drug out of the body, while tubular reabsorption tends to retain the drug.
i) Glomerular filtration: It is a process, which depends on:
1. the concentration of drug in the plasma
2. molecular size, shape and charge of drug
3. Glomerular filtration rate.

Only the drug which is not bound with the plasma proteins can pass through glomerulus. All the drugs which have low molecular weight can pass through glomerulus e.g. digoxin, ethambutol, etc. In congestive cardiac failure, the glomerular filtration rate is reduced due to decrease in renal blood flow.
ii) Active tubular secretion: The cells of the proximal convoluted tubule actively transport drugs from the plasma into the lumen of the tubule e.g. acetazolamide, benzyl penicillin, dopamine, pethidine, thiazides, histamine.
iv) Tubular reabsorption: The reabsorption of drug from the lumen of the distal convoluted tubules into plasma occurs either by simple diffusion or by active transport. When the urine is acidic, the degree of ionization of basic drug increase and their reabsorption decreases. Conversely, when the urine is more alkaline, the degree of ionization of acidic drug increases and the reabsorption decreases.
b) Hepatobiliary excretion: the conjugated drugs are excreted by hepatocytes in the bile. Molecular weight more than 300 daltons and polar drugs are excreted in the bile. Excretion of drugs through bile provides a back up pathway when renal function is impaired. After excretion of drug through bile into intestine, certain amount of drug is reabsorbed into portal vein leading to an enterohepatic cycling which can prolong the action of drug e.g. chloramphenicol, oral estrogen are secreted into bile and largely reabsorbed and have long duration of action. Tetracylines which are excreted by biliary tract can be used for treatment of biliary tract infection. c) Gastrointestinal excretion: When a drug is administered orally, a part of the drug is not absorbed and excreted in the faeces. The drugs which do not undergo enterohepatic cycle after excretion into the bile are subsequently passed with stool e.g. aluminium hydroxide changes the stool into white colour, ferrous sulfate changes the stool into black and rifampicin into orange red.
d) Pulmonary excretion: Drugs that are readily vaporized, such as many inhalation anaesthetics and alcohols are excreted through lungs. The rate of drug excretion through lung depends on the volume of air exchange, depth of respiration, rate of pulmonary blood flow and the drug concentration gradient.
e) Sweat: A number of drugs are excreted into the sweat either by simple diffusion or active secretion e.g. rifampicin, metalloids like arsenic and other heavy metals.
f) Mammary excretion: Many drugs mostly weak basic drugs are accumulated into the milk. Therefore lactating mothers should be cautious about the intake of these drugs because they may enter into baby through breast milk and produce harmful effects in the baby e.g. ampicillin, aspirin, chlordiazepoxide, coffee, diazepam, furosemide, morphine, streptomycin etc.

\section*{Half-life:}

Def: Half-life (t1/2) of a drug is the time taken for the concentration of drug in the blood or plasma to decline to half of original value or the amount of drug in the body to be reduced by $50 \%$.
It has two phases:
i. half-life of distribution
ii. Half-life of elimination.

A half-life value can be readily determined for most drugs by administering a dose of the drug to a subject, taking blood samples at various time intervals and then assaying the samples., For example if a blood level of drug A is 8.6 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ at 10 minutes and $4.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ at 60 minutes, so the half - life of that drug is 50 minutes.

\section*{DRUG SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS:}

\section*{A. Factors modifying the dosage and action of drugs:}

Individuals differ both in the degree and the character of the response that a drug may elicit and
Therefore the optimum dose of a drug which produces the desired therapeutic effect varies from person to person.
The important factors which influence the effect of a drug are:

\section*{1. Drug intolerance:}

It is a quantitative deviation from the anticipated response to a given dose of a drug. Thus drug intolerance is inability of the individual to tolerate a drug. It is also called as hypersusceptibility.

\section*{2. Sex difference:}

Special care should be exercised when drugs are administrated during Menstruation, pregnancy and lactation.
a) Menstruation: Drugs producing pelvic congestion should be avoided during menstruation
e.g. drastic purgatives.
b) Pregnancy: During pregnancy, the use of all drugs except those essential to maintain pregnancy should be used with caution.
Drugs which may stimulate the uterine smooth muscle, are contraindicated during pregnancy. Further, many drugs administered to mother are capable of crossing the placenta and affecting the foetus. Most of drugs can produce teratogenicity when they are used in pregnancy. Teratogenicity means congenital malformation.
iv) Drugs known to produce teratogenicity e.g thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, tetracyclines, phenytoin, carbamazepine and progestogens.
v) drugs may be teratogenic e.g Warfarin, lithium, quinine, primaquine, trimethoprim, rifampicin, anaesthetic agents.
c) Breast feeding: Nearly all agents received by mother are likely to be found in her milk
and could theoretically harm the infant.
Most of the lipid soluble drugs get into breast milk
Therefore the drugs, which are excreted in the milk and harm the infant health should be, avoided by breast-feeding mothers e.g. sulphonamides, tetracyclines, nalidixic acid, isoniazid, diazepam, lithium, Indomethacin, aspirin, etc.

\section*{3 Body Weight:}

The average dose is mentioned either in terms of mg per kg body weight or as the total single dose for an adult weighing between $50-100 \mathrm{~kg}$. However, dose expressed in this fashion may not apply in cases of excessively obese individuals or those suffering from edema, or dehydration nutritional factors can sometimes alter drug metabolizing capacity and this should be kept in mind in malnourished patients.

\section*{4. Age:}

The pharmacokinetics of many drugs changes with age. Thus gastric emptying is
prolonged and the gastric pH fluctuates in neonates and infant, further the liver capacity to
metabolize drugs is low, renal function is less developed and the proportion of body water is
higher in the newborn and the neonates. Hence children may not react to all drugs in the
same fashion as young adults. With a few exceptions, drugs are more active and more toxic
in the new born than the adults.
The paediatric doses are expressed in terms of body weight ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose or day) or in terms
of body surface area ( $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ per day). The body surface area can be calculated from the height
and weight of the child.
Like children, old people also present problems in dosage adjustment and this may vary widely
with different people. The metabolism of drugs may diminish in the elderly and the renal function
declines with age. Elderly are sensitive to the drugs like hypnotics, tranquilizers,
phenylbutazone, diazepam, pethidine, etc.

\section*{Paediatric Drug Calculations:}
i) Dose adjustment on the basis of age (young's formula) [For 1 year -12 years of age]

Age in years $\mathbf{X}$ adult dose
Age in years +12
ii) Dose adjustment on basis of body weight (Clark's formula) ( $1 \mathrm{~kg}=2.2$ pound)

\section*{Weight of child in pounds X Adult dose \\ 150}
iii) Fried's rule (for infants upto 2 years old):

Age (months) $X$ Adult dose
150

\section*{5. Disease state:}

Some antimicrobial agents penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid well across the normal meninges while other antimicrobials penetrate well only when the meninges are inflammed (meningitis). Examples:- sulphonamides, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, isoniazid and rifampicin penetrate well through the normal meninges whereas; antimicrobial agents like benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin and cephalosporin
penetrate only when the meninges are inflammed.
Acute or chronic liver diseases markedly modify the rate and extent of biotransformation of
drugs. The tl/2 of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in patients with liver cirrhosis is greatly
increased with corresponding prolongation of their effects.
Cardiac disease by limiting blood flow to the liver may impair disposition of those drugs whose
biotransformation is flow limited e.g. imipramine, isoniazid, lignocaine, morphine and
propranolol.
Similarly renal and pulmonary diseases may modify the biotransformation of drugs like insulin or
isoprenaline. Excretion of drug is impaired in chronic renal disease.

\section*{6. Pharmacogenetics:}

The science pharmacogenetics is concerned with the geneticallymediated variations in drug responses.

\section*{7. Drug interactions:}

It is usual for patients to receive a number of drugs at the same time.
It is a phenomenon which occurs when the effects of one drug are modified by the prior or concurrent administration of another drug(s). A drug interaction may result in beneficial or harmful effects and may be classified into:
Pharmaceutical drug interactions
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

\section*{a) Pharmaceutical drug interactions:}

Serious loss of potency can occur from incompatibility between an infusion fluid and a drug that is added to it.
For example diazepam if added to infusion fluid there will be a precipitate formation $\rightarrow$ loss of therapeutic effect.

\section*{b) Pharmacokinetic drug interactions:}

Interaction of drugs happens at absorption, distribution, metabolism or biotransformation, and during excretion.

\section*{8. Repeated Administration And Drug Cumulation}

If a drug is excreted slowly, its administration may build up a sufficiently high concentration in the body to produce toxicity. e.g. digitalis, emetine. To avoid cumulation:-
$\checkmark$ One must know if a drug is eliminated slowly or rapidly,
$\checkmark$ Stop the drug administration at the appearance of the first warning symptoms
$\checkmark$ Carefully select the form in which the drug is to be administered.
$\checkmark$ Check liver and kidney function before and during drug administration, as even an otherwise non-cumulative drug would produce cumulation in the presence of hepatic and renal damage.

\section*{9. Drug tolerance:}

It refers to when an unusually large dose of a drug is required to elicit an effect ordinarily produced by the normal therapeutic dose of the drug.
Tachyphylaxis: Refers to rapid development of tolerance on repeated administration of a drug eg Ephedrine, amphetamine and nitroglycerine which produce tachyphylaxis on repeated administration.

\section*{10. Emotional factors.}
eg. Placebo response.
Placebo: It is a Latin word meaning" I shall please" and it is a tablet looking exactly like the
Active treatment but containing no active component. It refers originally to substances merely to Please the patient when no specific treatment was available.

\section*{B) Adverse drug reactions:}

Def: An adverse drug reaction is defined as any response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy (WHO).

The drugs that produce useful therapeutic effect may also produce unwanted or toxic effects.
About $0.5 \%$ of patients who die in hospitals do so as a result of their Treatment rather than the condition for which they were treated.
Serious systemic drug toxicity may result from overdoses.
If is always an exaggeration of its pharmacological actions and sometimes it is predictable.
e.g. Hypotension following antihypertensive drugs, Hypoglycaemia following insulin.

The adverse effects are:
1) Side Effects
2) Untoward Effects
3) Allergic Reactions
4) Idiosyncratic Reactions
5) Teratogenic Effects.

\section*{1) Side effects:}

Side effects are in fact pharmacological effects produced when normal therapeutic dose of the drug was administered e.g: Dryness of mouth with atropine which is troublesome in peptic ulcer patients and useful when used as a pre-anesthetic medication.

\section*{2) Untoward effects:}

Untoward effects develop with therapeutic dose of a drug. They are undesirable and if very severe, may necessitate the cessation of treatment. e.g: Diarrhoea with ampicillin and potassium loss with diuretics.
3) Allergic reactions:

Most of the drugs and sera used in therapeutics are capable of causing allergic or hypersensitive reactions.

These reactions may be mild or very severe like anaphylaxis. When an individual has been sensitized to an antigen (allergen) further contact with that antigen can sometimes lead to tissue damaging reactions. These allergic reactionsare 4 types:
i. Type-I reactions or anaphylactic reactions (Immediate hypersensitive reaction).
ii. Type-II reactions or cytotoxic reactions.
iii. Type-III reactions or immune complex mediated reactions.
iv. Type-IV reactions or cell mediated reactions (Delayed hypersensitive reactions).
4) Idiosyncratic reactions: The term idiosyncrasy means one's peculiar response to drugs.
With the increasing knowledge of pharmacogenetics, many idiosyncratic reactions have
been found to be genetically determined.
e.g: Drugs like primaquine, sulfonamides and dapsone may cause haemolysis in patients with glucose -6 phosphate dehydrogenase defeciency.
5) Teratogenic effect: Some drugs given in the first three months of pregnancy may cause
congenital abnormalities and are said to be teratogenic. The best known example is
thalidomide which results in early easily recognizable abnormalities such as absent or
grossly abnormal limbs.
Other drugs with teratogenic potential are androgens, steroids, anti convulsants, anti neoplastic
drugs, cortisone, lithium, pencillamine, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin.
