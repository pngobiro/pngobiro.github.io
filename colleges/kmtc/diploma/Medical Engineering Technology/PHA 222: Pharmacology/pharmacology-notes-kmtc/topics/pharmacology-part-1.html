                        <p>Most of the drugs act by interacting with a Cellular component called receptor. Some drugs act through simple physical or chemical Reactions without interacting with any receptor.</p>

                        <p>Many drugs are similar to or have similar chemical groups to the naturally occurring chemical and have the ability to bind onto a receptor where one of two things can happen- either the receptor will respond or it will be blocked.</p>
                        <p>A drug, which is able to fit onto a receptor, is said to have affinity for that receptor.</p>
                        <p>Efficacy is the ability of a drug to produce an effect at a receptor.</p>
                        <p>An agonist has both an affinity and efficacy whereas antagonist has affinity but not efficacy or intrinsic activity.</p>
                        <p>When a drug is able to stimulate a receptor, it is known as an agonist and therefore mimics the Endogenous transmitter.</p>
                        <p>When the drug blocks a receptor, it is known as antagonist and therefore blocks the action of the endogenous transmitter (i.e. it will prevent the natural chemical from acting on the receptor).</p>

                         <p>Absorption is the process by which the drug enters into the systemic Circulation from the site of administration through biological barrier. In case of intravenous or Intra-arterial administration the drug bypasses absorption processes and it enters into the Circulation directly.</p>
