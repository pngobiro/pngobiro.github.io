                        <p><strong>a) From the alimentary tract:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(i)</span><span class="item-text">Buccal cavity: e.g. nitrates</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Advantages of oral route: This route is safe, convenient and economical.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages of oral route: Onset of drug action is slow, irritant drugs cannot be Administered and it is not useful in vomiting and severe diarrhea, gastric acid and digestive Enzymes may destroy some drugs, and water soluble drugs are absorbed poorly.</p>

                        <p><strong>b) From the parenteral route:</strong></p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(iii)</span><span class="item-text">Intramuscular: Soluble substances, mild irritants, suspensions and colloids can be Injected by this route. These injections can be given to deltoid or gluteal muscle. This route is one of the more common routes e.g. multivitamins, streptomycin, etc.<br>
                                Advantages: rate of absorption is uniform, onset of action is faster than oral and it can be given in diarrhoea or vomiting.<br>
                                Disadvantages: Pain at local site of injection, the volume of injection should not exceed 10 ml .</span></li>

                                Advantages: It can be given in large volumes, production of desired blood concentration can be obtained with a well designed dose.<br>
                                Disadvantages: Drug effect cannot be halted if once the drug is injected. Expertise is needed to give injection.</span></li>

                        <p>The absorption through skin is a passive process.</p>
                        <p>The absorption occurs more easily through the cell lining e.g. dusting powder, paste, lotion, drops, ointment, suppository for vagina and Rectum.</p>

                        <p><strong>e) Inhalation:</strong></p>
                        <p>Drugs may be administered as dry powders, and nebulized particles when sprayed as fine Droplets get deposited over the mucous membrane producing local effects and may be Absorbed for systemic effects e.g. salbutamol spray used in bronchial asthma and volatile General anesthetics.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">2. Bioavailability:</h4>
                        <p>It is the rate and amount of drug that is absorbed from a given dosage form and reaches the Systemic circulation following non-vascular administration. When the drug is given IV, the Bioavailability is $100\%$. It is important to know the manner in which a drug is absorbed. The Route of administration largely determines the latent period between administration and onset of action. However, drugs are often administered by other routes, such as orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, rectally, sublingually, or directly into desired sites of action. With these other routes, the amount of drug actually entering the systemic circulation may be less than with the intravenous route.</p>
                        <p>Drugs given by mouth may be inactive for the following reasons:</p>

Unlike inorganic compounds, the organic drugs are not completely ionized in the fluid. Unionized component is predominantly lipid soluble and is absorbed rapidly and an ionized is often water soluble component which is absorbed poorly. Most of the drugs are weak acids or weak bases.<br>
                            It may be assumed for all practical purposes that the mucosal lining of the G.I.T is Impermeable to the ionized form of a weak organic acid or a weak organic base. These drugs exist in two forms.<br>
                            Acidic drugs: rapidly absorbed from the stomach e.g. salicylates and barbiturates.<br>
                            Basic drugs: Not absorbed until they reach to the alkaline environment i.e. small Intestine when administered orally e.g. pethidine and ephedrine.</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">Presence of other agents: Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron from the G.I.T.

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">C) Distribution of drugs</h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>1. Definition: Drug distribution is the process by which a drug reversibly leaves the bloodstream and enters the interstitium (extracellular fluid) and/or the cells of the tissues. Drugs distribute through various body fluid compartments such as; plasma interstitial fluid compartment trans-cellular compartment.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Factors affecting delivery or distributions of drugs from the plasma to the interstitium</h4>
                        <p>They include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">Blood Flow</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Capillary permeability</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii.</span><span class="item-text">The degree of binding of the drug to plasma and tissue proteins, and</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">i) Blood flow</h4>
                        <p>The rate of blood flow to the tissue capillaries varies widely as a result of the unequal distribution of cardiac output to the various organs.</p>
                        <p>Blood flow to the brain, liver, and kidney is greater than that to the skeletal muscles; adipose tissue has a still lower rate of blood flow.</p>
                        <p>This differential blood flow partly explains the short duration of hypnosis produced by a bolus IV injection of thiopental.</p>
                        <p>The high blood flow, together with the superior lipid solubility of thiopental, permit it to rapidly move into the central nervous system (CNS) and produce anesthesia. Slower distribution to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue lowers the plasma concentration sufficiently so that the higher concentrations within the CNS decrease, and consciousness is regained.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">ii) Capillary permeability</h4>
                        <p>Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug.</p>
                        <p><strong>Capillary structure:</strong> Capillary structure varies widely in terms of the fraction of the basement membrane that is exposed by slit junctions between endothelial cells. In the brain, the capillary structure is continuous, and there are no slit junctions.</p>
                        <p>This contrasts with the liver and spleen, where a large part of the basement membrane is exposed due to large, discontinuous capillaries through which large plasma proteins can pass.</p>
                        <p><strong>Blood-brain barrier:</strong> To enter the brain, drugs must pass through the endothelial cells of the capillaries of the CNS or be actively transported. For example, a specific transporter for the large neutral amino acid transporter carries levodopa into the brain.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, lipid-soluble drugs readily penetrate into the CNS because they can dissolve in the membrane of the endothelial cells.</p>
                        <p>Ionized or polar drugs generally fail to enter the CNS because they are unable to pass through the endothelial cells of the CNS, which have no slit junctions. These tightly juxtaposed cells form tight junctions that constitute the so-called blood-brain barrier.</p>
                        <p><strong>Drug structure:</strong> The chemical nature of a drug strongly influences its ability to cross cell membranes. Hydrophobic drugs, which have a uniform distribution of electrons and no net charge, readily move across most biologic membranes.</p>
                        <p>These drugs can dissolve in the lipid membranes and, therefore, permeate the entire cell's surface.</p>
                        <p>The major factor influencing the hydrophobic drug's distribution is the blood flow to the area. By contrast, hydrophilic drugs, which have either a nonuniform distribution of electrons or a positive or negative charge, do not readily penetrate cell membranes, and therefore, must go through the slit junctions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">iii) Binding of drugs to plasma proteins</h4>
                        <p>Reversible binding to plasma proteins sequesters drugs in a nondiffusible form and slows their transfer out of the vascular compartment.</p>
                        <p>Binding is relatively nonselective as to chemical structure and takes place at sites on the protein to which endogenous compounds, such as bilirubin, normally attach.</p>
                        <p>Plasma albumin is the major drug-binding protein and may act as a drug reservoir; that is, as the concentration of the free drug decreases due to elimination by metabolism or excretion, the bound drug dissociates from the protein. This maintains the free-drug concentration as a constant fraction of the total drug in the plasma.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Excretion of drugs means the transportation of unaltered or altered form of drug out of the body. The major processes of excretion include renal excretion, hepatobiliary excretion and pulmonary excretion. The minor routes of excretion are saliva, sweat, tears, breast milk, vaginal fluid, nails and hair.</p>
                        <p>The rate of excretion influences the duration of action of drug. The drug that is excreted slowly, the concentration of drug in the body is maintained and the effects of the drug will continue for longer period.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Different routes of drug excretion:</h4>
                        <p><strong>a).Renal excretion:</strong> A major part of excretion of chemicals is metabolically unchanged or changed.</p>
                        <p>The excretion of drug by the kidney involves.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i)</span><span class="item-text">Glomerular filtration</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text">Active tubular secretion</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii)</span><span class="item-text">Passive tubular reabsorption.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The function of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is to remove drug out of the body, while tubular reabsorption tends to retain the drug.</p>
                        <p><strong>i) Glomerular filtration:</strong> It is a process, which depends on:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">the concentration of drug in the plasma</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">molecular size, shape and charge of drug</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Glomerular filtration rate.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Only the drug which is not bound with the plasma proteins can pass through glomerulus. All the drugs which have low molecular weight can pass through glomerulus e.g. digoxin, ethambutol, etc. In congestive cardiac failure, the glomerular filtration rate is reduced due to decrease in renal blood flow.</p>
                        <p><strong>ii) Active tubular secretion:</strong> The cells of the proximal convoluted tubule actively transport drugs from the plasma into the lumen of the tubule e.g. acetazolamide, benzyl penicillin, dopamine, pethidine, thiazides, histamine.</p>
                        <p><strong>iv) Tubular reabsorption:</strong> The reabsorption of drug from the lumen of the distal convoluted tubules into plasma occurs either by simple diffusion or by active transport. When the urine is acidic, the degree of ionization of basic drug increase and their reabsorption decreases. Conversely, when the urine is more alkaline, the degree of ionization of acidic drug increases and the reabsorption decreases.</p>

                        <p><strong>b) Hepatobiliary excretion:</strong> the conjugated drugs are excreted by hepatocytes in the bile. Molecular weight more than 300 daltons and polar drugs are excreted in the bile. Excretion of drugs through bile provides a back up pathway when renal function is impaired. After excretion of drug through bile into intestine, certain amount of drug is reabsorbed into portal vein leading to an enterohepatic cycling which can prolong the action of drug e.g. chloramphenicol, oral estrogen are secreted into bile and largely reabsorbed and have long duration of action. Tetracylines which are excreted by biliary tract can be used for treatment of biliary tract infection.</p>
                        <p><strong>c) Gastrointestinal excretion:</strong> When a drug is administered orally, a part of the drug is not absorbed and excreted in the faeces. The drugs which do not undergo enterohepatic cycle after excretion into the bile are subsequently passed with stool e.g. aluminium hydroxide changes the stool into white colour, ferrous sulfate changes the stool into black and rifampicin into orange red.</p>
                        <p><strong>d) Pulmonary excretion:</strong> Drugs that are readily vaporized, such as many inhalation anaesthetics and alcohols are excreted through lungs. The rate of drug excretion through lung depends on the volume of air exchange, depth of respiration, rate of pulmonary blood flow and the drug concentration gradient.</p>
                        <p><strong>e) Sweat:</strong> A number of drugs are excreted into the sweat either by simple diffusion or active secretion e.g. rifampicin, metalloids like arsenic and other heavy metals.</p>
                        <p><strong>f) Mammary excretion:</strong> Many drugs mostly weak basic drugs are accumulated into the milk. Therefore lactating mothers should be cautious about the intake of these drugs because they may enter into baby through breast milk and produce harmful effects in the baby e.g. ampicillin, aspirin, chlordiazepoxide, coffee, diazepam, furosemide, morphine, streptomycin etc.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Half-life:</h4>
                        <p>Def: Half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of a drug is the time taken for the concentration of drug in the blood or plasma to decline to half of original value or the amount of drug in the body to be reduced by $50\%$.</p>
                        <p>It has two phases:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">half-life of distribution</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Half-life of elimination.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A half-life value can be readily determined for most drugs by administering a dose of the drug to a subject, taking blood samples at various time intervals and then assaying the samples., For example if a blood level of drug A is 8.6 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ at 10 minutes and $4.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ at 60 minutes, so the half - life of that drug is 50 minutes.</p>
