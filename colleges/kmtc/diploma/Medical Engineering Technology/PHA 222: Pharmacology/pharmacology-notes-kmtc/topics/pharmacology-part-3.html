                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">A. Factors modifying the dosage and action of drugs:</h3>
                        <p>Individuals differ both in the degree and the character of the response that a drug may elicit and Therefore the optimum dose of a drug which produces the desired therapeutic effect varies from person to person.</p>
                        <p>The important factors which influence the effect of a drug are:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1. Drug intolerance:</h4>
                        <p>It is a quantitative deviation from the anticipated response to a given dose of a drug. Thus drug intolerance is inability of the individual to tolerate a drug. It is also called as hypersusceptibility.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">2. Sex difference:</h4>
                        <p>Special care should be exercised when drugs are administrated during Menstruation, pregnancy and lactation.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a)</span><span class="item-text">Menstruation: Drugs producing pelvic congestion should be avoided during menstruation e.g. drastic purgatives.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text">Pregnancy: During pregnancy, the use of all drugs except those essential to maintain pregnancy should be used with caution.<br>
                            Drugs which may stimulate the uterine smooth muscle, are contraindicated during pregnancy. Further, many drugs administered to mother are capable of crossing the placenta and affecting the foetus. Most of drugs can produce teratogenicity when they are used in pregnancy. Teratogenicity means congenital malformation.<br>
                            iv) Drugs known to produce teratogenicity e.g thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, tetracyclines, phenytoin, carbamazepine and progestogens.<br> <!-- Note: numbering starts from iv -->
                            v) drugs may be teratogenic e.g Warfarin, lithium, quinine, primaquine, trimethoprim, rifampicin, anaesthetic agents.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c)</span><span class="item-text">Breast feeding: Nearly all agents received by mother are likely to be found in her milk and could theoretically harm the infant.<br>
                            Most of the lipid soluble drugs get into breast milk<br>
                            Therefore the drugs, which are excreted in the milk and harm the infant health should be, avoided by breast-feeding mothers e.g. sulphonamides, tetracyclines, nalidixic acid, isoniazid, diazepam, lithium, Indomethacin, aspirin, etc.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">3 Body Weight:</h4>
                        <p>The average dose is mentioned either in terms of mg per kg body weight or as the total single dose for an adult weighing between $50-100 \mathrm{~kg}$. However, dose expressed in this fashion may not apply in cases of excessively obese individuals or those suffering from edema, or dehydration nutritional factors can sometimes alter drug metabolizing capacity and this should be kept in mind in malnourished patients.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">4. Age:</h4>
                        <p>The pharmacokinetics of many drugs changes with age. Thus gastric emptying is prolonged and the gastric pH fluctuates in neonates and infant, further the liver capacity to metabolize drugs is low, renal function is less developed and the proportion of body water is higher in the newborn and the neonates. Hence children may not react to all drugs in the same fashion as young adults. With a few exceptions, drugs are more active and more toxic in the new born than the adults.</p>
                        <p>The paediatric doses are expressed in terms of body weight ($\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ per dose or day) or in terms of body surface area ($\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^2$ per day). The body surface area can be calculated from the height and weight of the child.</p>
                        <p>Like children, old people also present problems in dosage adjustment and this may vary widely with different people. The metabolism of drugs may diminish in the elderly and the renal function declines with age. Elderly are sensitive to the drugs like hypnotics, tranquilizers, phenylbutazone, diazepam, pethidine, etc.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">5. Disease state:</h4>
                        <p>Some antimicrobial agents penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid well across the normal meninges while other antimicrobials penetrate well only when the meninges are inflammed (meningitis). Examples:- sulphonamides, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, isoniazid and rifampicin penetrate well through the normal meninges whereas; antimicrobial agents like benzyl penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin and cephalosporin penetrate only when the meninges are inflammed.</p>
                        <p>Acute or chronic liver diseases markedly modify the rate and extent of biotransformation of drugs. The t$_{1/2}$ of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam in patients with liver cirrhosis is greatly increased with corresponding prolongation of their effects.</p>
                        <p>Cardiac disease by limiting blood flow to the liver may impair disposition of those drugs whose biotransformation is flow limited e.g. imipramine, isoniazid, lignocaine, morphine and propranolol.</p>
                        <p>Similarly renal and pulmonary diseases may modify the biotransformation of drugs like insulin or isoprenaline. Excretion of drug is impaired in chronic renal disease.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">6. Pharmacogenetics:</h4>
                        <p>The science pharmacogenetics is concerned with the geneticallymediated variations in drug responses.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">7. Drug interactions:</h4>
                        <p>It is usual for patients to receive a number of drugs at the same time.</p>
                        <p>It is a phenomenon which occurs when the effects of one drug are modified by the prior or concurrent administration of another drug(s). A drug interaction may result in beneficial or harmful effects and may be classified into:</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>a) Pharmaceutical drug interactions:</strong></p>
                        <p>Serious loss of potency can occur from incompatibility between an infusion fluid and a drug that is added to it.</p>
                        <p>For example diazepam if added to infusion fluid there will be a precipitate formation ‚Üí loss of therapeutic effect.</p>

                        <p><strong>b) Pharmacokinetic drug interactions:</strong></p>
                        <p>Interaction of drugs happens at absorption, distribution, metabolism or biotransformation, and during excretion.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">8. Repeated Administration And Drug Cumulation</h4>
                        <p>If a drug is excreted slowly, its administration may build up a sufficiently high concentration in the body to produce toxicity. e.g. digitalis, emetine. To avoid cumulation:-</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚úì</span><span class="item-text">One must know if a drug is eliminated slowly or rapidly,</span></li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">9. Drug tolerance:</h4>
                        <p>It refers to when an unusually large dose of a drug is required to elicit an effect ordinarily produced by the normal therapeutic dose of the drug.</p>
                        <p>Tachyphylaxis: Refers to rapid development of tolerance on repeated administration of a drug eg Ephedrine, amphetamine and nitroglycerine which produce tachyphylaxis on repeated administration.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">10. Emotional factors.</h4>
                        <p>eg. Placebo response.</p>
                        <p>Placebo: It is a Latin word meaning" I shall please" and it is a tablet looking exactly like the Active treatment but containing no active component. It refers originally to substances merely to Please the patient when no specific treatment was available.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">B) Adverse drug reactions:</h3>
                        <p>Def: An adverse drug reaction is defined as any response to a drug that is noxious and unintended and that occurs at doses used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy (WHO).</p>
                        <p>The drugs that produce useful therapeutic effect may also produce unwanted or toxic effects.</p>
                        <p>About $0.5\%$ of patients who die in hospitals do so as a result of their Treatment rather than the condition for which they were treated.</p>
                        <p>Serious systemic drug toxicity may result from overdoses.</p>
                        <p>If is always an exaggeration of its pharmacological actions and sometimes it is predictable.</p>
                        <p>e.g. Hypotension following antihypertensive drugs, Hypoglycaemia following insulin.</p>
                        <p>The adverse effects are:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1) Side effects:</h4>
                        <p>Side effects are in fact pharmacological effects produced when normal therapeutic dose of the drug was administered e.g: Dryness of mouth with atropine which is troublesome in peptic ulcer patients and useful when used as a pre-anesthetic medication.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">2) Untoward effects:</h4>
                        <p>Untoward effects develop with therapeutic dose of a drug. They are undesirable and if very severe, may necessitate the cessation of treatment. e.g: Diarrhoea with ampicillin and potassium loss with diuretics.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">3) Allergic reactions:</h4>
                        <p>Most of the drugs and sera used in therapeutics are capable of causing allergic or hypersensitive reactions.</p>
                        <p>These reactions may be mild or very severe like anaphylaxis. When an individual has been sensitized to an antigen (allergen) further contact with that antigen can sometimes lead to tissue damaging reactions. These allergic reactionsare 4 types:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list" style="margin-left: 2em;">

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">4) Idiosyncratic reactions:</h4>
                        <p>The term idiosyncrasy means one's peculiar response to drugs.</p>
                        <p>With the increasing knowledge of pharmacogenetics, many idiosyncratic reactions have been found to be genetically determined.</p>
                        <p>e.g: Drugs like primaquine, sulfonamides and dapsone may cause haemolysis in patients with glucose -6 phosphate dehydrogenase defeciency.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">5) Teratogenic effect:</h4>
                        <p>Some drugs given in the first three months of pregnancy may cause congenital abnormalities and are said to be teratogenic. The best known example is thalidomide which results in early easily recognizable abnormalities such as absent or grossly abnormal limbs.</p>
                        <p>Other drugs with teratogenic potential are androgens, steroids, anti convulsants, anti neoplastic drugs, cortisone, lithium, pencillamine, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin.</p>
