   - Exclusion of metadata/noise (Lines 1-11, 18, 45, 301, 540)
   - Correct MathJax rendering
   ```

5. **Repeat Section 4 for Each Chunk**
   (Sections added above)

6. **Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning**:
   ```
   Navigation Structure:
   - index.html links to part-1, part-2, part-3
   - part-1 links to index.html (ToC) and part-2 (Next)
   - part-2 links to index.html (ToC), part-1 (Prev), and part-3 (Next)
   - part-3 links to index.html (ToC) and part-2 (Prev)
   - Breadcrumbs needed within each part (e.g., Home > Part 1 > Pharmacodynamics)

   Cross-References:
   - None explicitly identified in MMD requiring inter-chunk linking.
   ```

7. **Issues & Resolutions Log**:
   ```
   - [CHUNK/SECTION] [DESCRIPTION] - [STATUS]
   - General: Need to handle MMD `\section*{}` conversion to appropriate HTML headings (h1, h2, h3...).
   - General: Need to convert MMD lists (numbered, lettered) to HTML `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
   - General: Need to handle MMD bold/italics if present (none obvious in scan).
   - General: Need to wrap content sections as per template (`<section>`, `<div class="content-card">`).
   ```
