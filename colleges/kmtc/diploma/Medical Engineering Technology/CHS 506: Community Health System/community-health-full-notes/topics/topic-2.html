Germs are so small and sneaky that they creep into our body without being noticed. In fact, germs are so tiny that you need to use a microscope to see them. We don't know what hit us until we have symptoms (runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, etc.)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Germs are microbes. A microbe is a tiny living organism that can only be seen with a microscope. Microbes are the smallest form of life on Earth. Although some microbes can make you sick or may even kill you, most are harmless, and some are extremely helpful. Microbes can be found virtually anywhere - in air, water, plants, animals and humans. A Germ is a microorganism that causes disease. Germs are also known as pathogens.</span></li>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Bacteria -are everywhere. They live in sub-freezing cold temperatures and boiling hot temperatures. They live up high in the sky and down deep below the ocean. In fact scientists have found colonies of bacteria thriving 1,600 feet below sea level without oxygen or sunlight. Scientists also think there are signs of microbial life on Mars! Some bacteria are harmful but most are harmless or even helpful.<br>
                            Viruses - depend upon a host to survive, grow, and reproduce. A host is the plant or animal on which or in in which another organism lives. Viruses can't live outside of other living cells. Once they are inside the body, viruses can spread and make people sick. They reproduce by injecting their genes into a cell to produce thousands of new viruses. Viruses cause chicken pox, measles, flu, and many other diseases.<br>
                            Fungi - are multi-celled plant-like organisms. Unlike other plants, fungi aren't able to produce their own food from soil, water, and air. Instead, fungi get their nutrition from plants, food, and animals. Fungi thrive in warm, damp environments. Most fungi are not dangerous. An example of something caused by fungi is athlete's foot - that itchy rash that teens and adults sometimes get between their toes.<br>
                            Protozoa - are one-celled organisms like bacteria. Protozoa also love moisture and often spread diseases through contaminated water. Some protozoa cause intestinal infections.</p>

This is in contrast of instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host. When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of direct transmission is called a biologic transmission</span></li>

NCDs are often associated with older age groups, but evidence shows that 16 million of all deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases occur before the age of 70 . Of these "premature" deaths, $82\%$ occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors that contribute to non-communicable diseases, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke or the effects of the harmful use of alcohol.</p>
                        <p>These diseases are driven by forces that include ageing, rapid unplanned urbanization, and the globalization of unhealthy lifestyles. For example, globalization of unhealthy lifestyles like unhealthy diets may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids, and obesity. These are called 'intermediate risk factors' which can lead to cardiovascular disease, a NCD.</p>
                        <p>A risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury. The following are risk factors:</p>
