                        <p>Although plans can be adapted to various health problems and communities, the phases of the process remain the same. Thus, once the mechanisms of the planning process are in place, only a few modifications are needed to address additional health issues. Phases can be repeated as new health priorities are identified, new target groups are selected, or new interventions are developed. The activities within phases may overlap as the process is carried out. Each of the five phases that constitute plan is described hereafter.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step I: Mobilizing the community</h3>
                        <p>Mobilizing the community is an ongoing process that starts in step I as a community organizes to begin planning and continues throughout the process. In phase I:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step II: Collecting and organizing data</h3>
                        <p>Step II begins when the community members form working groups to obtain and analyze data on mortality, morbidity, community opinion, and behaviors. These data, obtained from various sources, include quantitative data (e.g., vital statistics and survey) and qualitative data (e.g., opinions of community leaders).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step III: Choosing health priorities</h3>
                        <p>During this phase, objectives related to the health priorities are set. The health priorities to be addressed initially are selected.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step IV: Developing a comprehensive intervention plan</h3>
                        <p>Using information generated during steps II and III, the community group chooses, designs, and conducts interventions during phase.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step V. Build on existing services</h3>
                        <p>In order to prevent duplication and to integrate the existing services, the community group identifies and assesses resources, policies, environmental measures, and programs already focused on the risk behavior and to the target group.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step VI: Evaluating plans</h3>
                        <p>Evaluation is an integral part of the planning process. It is ongoing and serves two purposes: to monitor and assess progress during the five phases of planning and to evaluate interventions. The community sets criteria for determining success and identifies data to be collected.</p>

                        <p>This Concept Guide presents an overview of plans, followed by separate chapters on each phase of the planning process. The guide includes tools, or forms, for planning and conducting various activities. It also provides background information on topics important to managing plans, such as group dynamics and statistical analysis, as well as practical information and suggestions for tailoring the process to the needs of your community. Develop a one-page tip sheet that relate to the management of plan and group dynamics. You are encouraged to copy and share the tip sheets with group facilitators and working group chairpersons.</p>

                        <p>The Meeting Guide is intended for use when planning and conducting meetings. It contains an introduction, followed by a separate section for each phase of the planning process. For each phase, it includes meeting objectives, recommends an agenda, and suggests specific activities that can be incorporated with your own ideas.</p>

                        <p>The packet of Visual Aids includes camera, ready copy for overheads and reproducible text for handouts. Some of these materials are intended to serve as models for overheads and handouts you will need to develop to present data and other information for your own community.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Design</h4>
                        <p>A design evaluation is conducted early in the planning stages or implementation of a program. It helps to define the scope of a program or project and to identify appropriate goals and objectives. Design evaluations can also be used to pre-test ideas and strategies.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Impact</h4>
                        <p>An impact evaluation is a subset of an outcome evaluation. It assesses the causal links between program activities and outcomes. This is achieved by comparing the observed outcomes with an estimate of what would have happened if the program had not existed (e.g., would the water be swimmable if the program had not been instituted).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Cost-effectiveness</h4>
                        <p>Cost-effectiveness evaluations identify program benefits, outputs or outcomes and compare them with the internal and external costs of the program. Cost-effectiveness evaluations identify program benefits, outputs or outcomes and compare them with the internal and external costs of the program. The impact evaluation determines the causal effects of the program. This involves trying to measure if the program has achieved its intended outcomes, i.e. program outcomes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Measures of success</h3>
                        <p>There are 4 essential key success measures and one auxiliary measure that are all of great value. The 4 essential key measures are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Financial viability - Example: profitability.</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>These measures are important because:</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Employee satisfaction is important because over the long term it is impossible to have an organization with unhappy employees that has happy customers</span></li>

An organization in which greed is a core value will ultimately devour itself.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Key operational results are not considered an essential key success measure on the order of the first 4 and therefore are viewed as serving an auxiliary function.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Outcome evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Outcome indicators - are long terms effects as a result of the outputs. Outcome evaluations examine the results of a program (intended or unintended) to determine the reasons why there are differences between the outcomes and the program's stated goals and objectives. Outcome measurement is a systematic way to assess the extent to which a program has achieved its intended outcomes. It helps understand whether the program is effective or not.</p>
