In many cases PHC became a jargon term used as a slogan, and little else. The rhetoric was not backed with the necessary reforms. Agencies were content if countries adopted PHC as a policy, and did not assess actual practice. Politicians saw PHC as a way to reduce expenditure in health and lacked the political will to ensure that services were equitably shared and distributed. Most healthcare resources continue to be directed to the large urban-based hospitals.</span></li>
