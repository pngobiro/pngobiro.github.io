                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most communities do not have the resources to address all of their health problems and target groups at once. They must set priorities and plan to address some problems initially and others over time. We recommend that the community group select only one or a limited number of health problems to better focus resources in a comprehensive manner. The following are priority setting techniques:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Problem/Preference Ranking - is a participatory technique that allows analyzing and identifying problems or preferences stakeholder share in order to implement adequate improvements and solutions in their community and area. First, the stakeholders have to decide which the most important problems they face in their community are. Afterwards, the participants have to rank these problems/preferences in regards to their importance. The result of this method provides the starting base for discussions on possible solutions to the priority problems.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">A more systematic technique is called "pairwise ranking" and uses cards to represent the different problems. The facilitator shows the "problem cards", two at a time, each time asking, "Which is the bigger problem?" As the participants make the comparisons, the results are recorded in a matrix.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The criteria attached to make up a choice are used to consider in the community action plan. Community action plans are developed on the basis of people's preferences. The problems, solutions technical inputs are arranged on the interests of the users.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Advantages</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Preference/Problem ranking is probably the easiest method to use and to learn more about commonly shared problems and priorities</span></li>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">It requires time and some logistic efforts to bring all relevant stakeholders together in order to rank the preferences and problems</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>As the community group works to set priorities, it must examine the intervention focus and its capacity to address one or more problems and agree on which problem or problems to address first.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Identifying which problem(s) to address first</h3>
                        <p>When examining priority behavioral risk factors, you might consider the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Importance-evidence that the behavior change will make a difference.....eg. How widespread is the behavior? - How serious are the health consequences? How close is the connection between the behavior and the health problem?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Changeability-evidence that the behavior is amenable to change ......e.g. Is the behavior still in developmental stages? Is the behavior only superficially tied to lifestyle? Has the behavior been successfully changed in other programs? Does the literature suggest that the behavior can be changed?</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many community groups find it helpful to use the nominal group process or other techniques to identify the top three to five health problems. These three to five problems are then analyzed further to determine which to address first. Some issues to consider when ranking problems include:</p>

                        <p>For example:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Objectives are active, working tools and not merely academic exercises. An objective:</p>

                        <p>Community health planning uses two types of objectives to clarify community goals:</p>
