                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 1 - Problem Definition</h3>
                        <p>Before you are ready to take any steps to solve the problem, you first have to be sure that you are clear about what the problem really is. It can be easy to get distracted by solving a different problem than what is actually causing distress if it is easier than dealing with the real problem. This step involves thinking about the following questions:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">How is the current situation different from what I actually want it to be?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">What do I actually want, or how do I actually want things to be?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">What is preventing me from achieving my goals, or from things being the way I want them to be?</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Step 2 - Problem Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Once you have defined the problem, you need to think about it from different perspectives to insure that you understand all the dimensions of the problem.</p>
                        <p>The following questions can be useful to help you analyze the problem.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">How is this problem affecting me?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">How is this problem affecting other people?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">Who else is experiencing this problem?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text">How do other people deal with this problem?</span></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">STEP 3 - Establish your goals</h3>
                        <p>Once you have looked at the problem from different perspectives, you can decide what you want to achieve and establish your goals. You need to answer the very specific question - "What is my immediate goal?"</p>
                        <p>Examples:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Improve my time management skills</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Complete assignments on time</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Improve my grades</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">STEP 4 - Generate possible solutions</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">During this stage the goal is to generate as many possible solutions as you can.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Do not worry about whether or not they are realistic, practical, or effective.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Be sure to write down all the possibilities you generate so that you can approach this task systematically.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">STEP 5 - Analyze the solutions</h3>
                        <p>During this stage, you will examine each alternative and write down both the advantages and disadvantages to each. Some considerations to keep in mind include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Is it relevant to my situation?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Is it realistic?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Is it manageable?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">What are the consequences - both good and bad?</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">What is the likelihood that it is going to help me reach my goal?</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">STEP 6 - Implementation</h3>
                        <p>The last step is to implement the solution you have chosen. This step involves identification of all the steps necessary to implement it, and also on-going monitoring of the effectiveness of the solution to make sure that it actually solved the problem. During this stage of the process, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">How effective is the solution?</span></li>
