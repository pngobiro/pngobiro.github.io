                        </ul>
                        <p>Nutrition - Nutrition is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. Good nutrition is an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity. It is the cornerstone of good health. Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity. Eating well is important for everyone's health and wellbeing and is vital for preventing chronic disease in later life.</p>
                        <p>Community nutrition - is the nutrition in the context of community. In order for nutrition to have impact on human health and well-being, it must be applied to human populations through community and population based intervention and education programs.</p>
                        <p>Malnutrition - Malnutrition is the condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It is a cause and consequence of ill health across many groups; however, older people tend to be more vulnerable to this condition, which can severely impact on health outcomes and quality of life.</p>
                        <p>Basic nutrition - Basic nutrition is the food intake, dietary nutrients required during our phases of life</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Food intake - An average person takes at least 3 meals in a day (breakfast, lunch and supper). People tend to have supplementary feeds in between the main meals. Children are required to be fed every time according to their demand. Food intake is influenced by income, appetite, exposure to food and social status.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Dietary nutrients - Our body requires essential dietary nutrients for its normal function. The nutrient requirements are: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Water, Vitamins, and Minerals. Essential nutrient are substance that must be obtained from the diet because the body cannot make it in sufficient quantity to meet its needs. In establishing dietary requirements the goal is to determine what amount is high enough, if ingested routinely, to prevent impairment of health even if intake becomes inadequate for a short period</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Nutrition during phases of life - This is the nutrition required during: Pregnancy and early childhood; Childhood and adolescent; School going age; Adults; and Older age.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Pregnancy and early childhood - Starting early with breastfeeding and providing good nutrition for children gives the best start to a healthy life. Good nutrition in pregnancy is essential for keeping a developing baby and mother healthy. Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed babies. Breastfeeding is extremely important for the health outcomes of infants and their mother. Not breastfeeding is associated with adverse health outcomes for both mothers and infants, ranging from infectious illness to chronic diseases later in life. Solids should be introduced at around six months of age when the infant is developmentally ready. For young children, a healthy diet is required for optimal growth and development. It can also help to improve concentration, fight illnesses, and prevent long term health complications.<br>
                            Children and Adolescents - Children and adolescents need sufficient foods to grow and develop normally. Growth should be checked regularly for young children. Physical activity is important for children and adolescents. Many infants suffer and die because of ignorance, meanness of parents and inability to understand the infant communication language<br>
                            School aged children - Childhood is an important period when children develop the knowledge, skills and behaviors for lifelong health and wellbeing. We know that education and health are inseparable and that a healthy child learns well.<br>
                            Adults - Healthy eating during adulthood is vital for effective functioning of body systems and immunity, maintaining a healthy weight, and preventing and managing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.<br>
                            Older people - Good nutrition is important for older people to help promote independence and to reduce illness and premature death. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition, plays an important role in ensuring older people can live well at home for longer.</p>

Because orphaned and institutionalized children may experience one or several macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, they are at risk for a variety of short-term and long-term complications:</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Short-Term Implications - Because so much development occurs in the first few years of life, nutrient deficiencies can have major short-term implications in young children.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Immune Implications - Malnourishment can greatly compromise a child's immune system, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Particularly in institutions where there are poor sanitary practices, children are vulnerable to infections from other children or caregivers.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Growth Implications - A child may contract an infection due to poor nutritional status. In turn, a gastrointestinal infection places the child at even greater risk for nutrient deficiencies because nutrients are unable to be absorbed properly. Consequently, nutrient deficiency combined with infection can cause growth retardation.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Additionally, a deficiency in one nutrient may lead to a deficiency in another nutrient. For example, deficiencies in iron, magnesium and zinc can cause anorexia and thereby result in reduced intake of other important nutrients such as protein. Low lipid intake can also affect the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A and Zinc and protein deficiencies can retard bone growth and development, putting a child at risk for long-term complications.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Long-Term Implications - The short-term implications of malnutrition eventually give way to long-term complications, such as growth and cognitive delays:</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Growth Implications - Malnutrition not only impacts growth in the short term, but can also limit total bone growth. Additionally, children classified as low height-for-age (stunted) may never be able to regain lost growth potential if they continue to live in a nutritionally deprived situation.</span></li>
