                            This means that there should no sex for the couples who are using this method between day 8(eight) and day 20 (twenty) of a woman's circle i.e. a total of 12 days without sex in a month.<br>
                            Have you ever seen a cow on heat? Unfortunately this is the period at which women folks are on heat so this method like the withdrawal method require highly motivated couples</p>

                            Check the temperature five minutes before waking up and enter in ascertain chart after woman's eggs are released (ovulation) temperature rises by ( $0.2-0.6$ ) C intercourse should be avoided when the temperature is low and resumed when the temperature has risen up next period.<br>
                            like you might have noticed this method is very unreliable form of family planning, what if one gets sick an the temperature rises, what if one fails to record the temperature.<br>
                            This method can be easily manipulated by women folk to deny men folks there conjugal rights by just manipulating the temperatures.</p>
