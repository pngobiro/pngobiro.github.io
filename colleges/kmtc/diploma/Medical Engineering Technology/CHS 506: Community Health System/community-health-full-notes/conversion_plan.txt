3.  **Special Elements Inventory**:
    ```
    Special Elements:
    - Equations: 0 explicitly marked, potential formulas need review (e.g., line 1979)
    - Tables: 9 identified (Lines 632-647, 972-994, 995-1028, 1121-1156, 1933-1948, 1949-1962, 2449-2457, 2509-2533, 2549-2574)
    - Figures (Images): 6 identified (Lines 18, 233, 255, 344, 618, 648)
    - Code Blocks: 0 identified
    - Complex Lists: Numerous bulleted/numbered lists throughout.
    - Text Blocks: 1 identified (Lines 1559-1582) - Requires <pre> formatting.

    Critical Sections (requiring special attention):
    - Tables: Ensure proper HTML table structure and rendering.
    - Images: Download and correctly link local paths.
    - Text Block (Lines 1559-1582): Preserve formatting using <pre>.
    - Group Work Sections (e.g., Lines 2233-2267): Format clearly, perhaps as distinct sections or callouts.
    ```

4.  **Chunk-by-Chunk Tracking**: (Template - To be filled during conversion)
    ```
    # Chunk 1: Topic 1 - Intro, Determinants, etc.
    MMD Lines: 14-181
    HTML File: topics/topic-1.html
    Estimated Line Count (HTML): ~200-240
    Status: [NOT STARTED]

    ## Content Extraction
    [ ] MMD section copied
    [ ] HTML template applied
    [ ] Main content populated
    [ ] Special elements handled:
        [ ] Equations (0)
        [ ] Tables (0)
        [ ] Figures (1 - QR Code)
        [ ] Code blocks (0)

    ## Sections (Example)
    - Section: Introduction and concepts
      - Lines: 32-54
      - Status: [NOT STARTED]
      - Special elements: None
      - Notes: Standard text conversion.
    - Section: Determinants of health
      - Lines: 55-60
      - Status: [NOT STARTED]
      - Special elements: None
      - Notes: Standard text conversion.
    ... (Repeat for all sections within chunk)

    ## Verification
    [ ] Line-by-line content verification vs MMD
    [ ] Images properly extracted & referenced
    [ ] Equations render correctly (N/A)
    [ ] Navigation links working (Placeholder initially)
    [ ] Visual enhancements applied (Later step)
    [ ] Accessibility checks passed (Later step)
    [ ] Line count confirmed below 300

    --- (Repeat Section 4 for Each Chunk: topic-2 to topic-14) ---
    ```

5.  **Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning**:
    ```
    Navigation Structure:
    - Previous/Next Chunk links required on each topic page.
    - Table of Contents (index.html) links to all topic pages.
    - Breadcrumb navigation (Optional, based on final structure).

    Cross-References:
    - (To be identified during detailed content transfer) - Scan for phrases like "see section X", "refer to chapter Y".
    ```

6.  **Issues & Resolutions Log**: (Template - To be filled during conversion)
    ```
    - [CHUNK/SECTION] [DESCRIPTION] - [STATUS]
    - Example: topic-4 / Table Lines 632-647: Complex table structure needs careful HTML conversion - PENDING
