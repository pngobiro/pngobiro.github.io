\section*{UNIT ONE: INTRODUCTION TO HEALTH RESEARCH}

\section*{Research:-}

The word research means "to search again" or to "to examine carefully".
Research is a diligent, systemic inquiry or study to validate and refine existing knowledge and develop new knowledge

Research - is a scientific process that validates and refines existing knowledge and generates new knowledge that directly and indirectly influences community health practice.

\section*{Purpose of Research:-}

\section*{Broad:-}
$>$ To improve the practice of its members so that the services provided to clientele will have the greatest impact.

\section*{Specific:-}
> Develop scientific, evidence based reasons for community health activities.
$>$ Finding ways of increasing the cost - effectiveness of community health activities.
$>$ Providing the basis for standards setting and quality assurance.
$>$ Providing evidence in support of demands for resources in community health.
$>$ Defending a professional status for community health.
$>$ Focusing on priority problems that affect the community health profession.

\section*{Note:-}
* The ability to conduct research is becoming an ever important skill
* Clinical practice without research is practice based on tradition without validation
* Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of community health treatment to determine the impact of community health care on the health of the patients or the test out theory
* Community health practice is undergoing tremendous challenges. In order to meet social challenges and needs, community health practice must be research based
* Research in community health evolved predominantly when community health education became a part of higher education and was seeking its own body of knowledge, different from that of medicine. Community health is first researchers were being prepared in fields other than community health and have brought to community health the various paradigms from those fields.

\subsection*{1.1 DEFINITION OF RESEARCH TERMINOLOGIES}
1. Research: Is a systematic inquiry or critical examination of a given phenomenon which is reported in a form that allows the research methods and outcomes to be accessible to others.
2. Phenomenon: An event or a situation that can be seen to happen or exist.
3. Research: Can also be defined as a process of arriving at effective solution to problems through systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of data
4. Conceptual definition : Refers to definition of terms in terms of dictionary definition
5. Operational definition: Operational definition or variables refers to definition of terms in a way that the explanation used in the study that helps in defining variables is measurable and quantifiable terms
6. Population: It's the entire group of persons or objects that is of interest to the investigator
7. Sample: Is a subject of the population selected by investigation to participate in a research study
8. Variable: Is a measurable characteristics that assumes different values among subjects
9. Validity in relation to Research design: There can be two kinds of validity related to research design, internal and external validity.
a. Internal validity -Refers to whether the independent variable actually made difference and results are not due to extraneous factors
b. External validity -Refers to the extent to which the results of the study can be generalized
10. Feasibility: Refers to the ease with which when the particular study can be completed
11. Purpose of the study: It describes why the study has been designed. The purpose reflects the intern of the investigations and use of the knowledge derived
12. Deductive reasoning: Is a method of thinking that begins with a general statement of belief and moves to obtain specific observation
a. Reasoning moves from the general to the specific
13. Inductive reasoning: Involves the collection of observations related to a particular event. From these observations, a theory or general explanation regarding the event can evolve, reasoning moves from specific to the general
14. Bias: Is a feeling or influence that strongly favours the outcome of a particular finding in a research project
When the chance of bias is not addressed, the reliability of the scientific findings is considered to be highly questionable.
15. The problem statement: It presents the topic under study providing a rationale for the choice of topic, represents a synthesis of fact and theory and directs the selection of the design

\section*{16. Qualitative and quantitative variables:}
a. Quantitative variable is one whose values or categories consists of numbers and if differences between its categories can be expressed numerically (age, income, size, etc)
b. The qualitative variable is one which consists of discrete categories rather than numerical(sex, religion, etc)
Relationship among quantitative variables may be positive or negative
A positive relationship exists if an increase in the value of one variable is accompanied by an increase in the value of other or decrease in one is accompanied by other.
The negative relationship between variables exists if the decrease in the value of one variable is accompanied by an increase in the value of others.
17. Scholarly publication: Are the documents that serve to communicate to other professionals the methods and achievements produced through academic study and research investigation
Scholarly publications are used to disseminate scholarly work within discipline, which is crucial for the growth of its members
18. Delimitation and limitation:
a. Delimitations indicate the cut off points beyond which the researcher does not intend to probe.
It includes those restrictions the researcher placed in the study prior to gathering data
b. Limitations indicate the weakness of the entire study as the researcher perceives them
Delimitations are set during the planning stage, whereas limitations are experienced during implementation stage, and these uncontrollable elements are research report.

\section*{19. Dependent and independent variables}
a. Independent variable is an antecedent to other variables. In an experiment or quasi-experiment, it's the variable that is manipulated and its effect on the dependent variable is observed
b. Dependent variable-Represents the area of interest under investigation reflects the effect of or the response to the independent variables
20. Data: Pieces of information obtained in the course of the study
21. Hypothesis: Is a statement of the expectations of the researcher concerning the relationship of the variables under study
22. Abstract: An abbreviated summary of the research problem, methodology, findings and significance
23. Parameter: Is a measurable characteristics and assumes different values in the population
24. Statistics: Is the science of organizing, describing and analyzing quantitative data It's also used to indices which are derived from data through statistical procedures. Indices include means, standard, deviation e.t.c.

\subsection*{1.2 CONCEPTS OF RESEARCH}

\subsection*{1.2. 1 CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH}
$>$ Is always directed towards the solution of a problem
$>$ Always based on empirical and observational evidence
$>$ Research involves precise observation and accurate description
$>$ It emphasis the development of theories, principles and generalizations
$>$ It is characterized by systematic, objective and logical procedures
$>$ It is marked by patience, courage and unhurried activities
$>$ It requires that the researcher has full experience of the problem being studied
$>$ It is replicable
$>$ It uses systematic method of problem solving
$>$ In research the factors which are not under study are controlled
$>$ It requires full skill of writing report

\subsection*{1.2.2 PURPOSE OF RESEARCH}

\subsection*{1.3.1 Exploratory}
$>$ To generate many ideas/new knowledge
$>$ To develop tentative theories and conjectures
$>$ To formulate questions
$>$ To refine issues for future research

\subsection*{1.3.2 Description}
$>$ Describes a process, mechanism or relationship or a phenomenon
$>$ Involves thorough description e.g in terms of size, age, shape, weight, colour e.t.c.
$>$ Presents basic background information or a content
$>$ Often uses a survey research

\subsection*{1.3.3 Prediction}
> Enables prediction i.e. ability to estimate an event or a situation e.g. knowledge about the relative movement of the moon, earth and sun helps us predict the accuracy, the occurrence of lunar eclipse.

\subsection*{1.3.4 Analytical (or explanatory)}
$>$ Goes beyond simple description. It involves accurate observation and measurement of a given phenomenon
$>$ Involves theory testing on elaboration of a theory
$>$ Used mostly in basic research

\subsection*{1.3.5 Evaluation}
> Characterized by the focus on collecting data to ascertain the efforts of same of planned change
> Used in applied research to evaluate a policy in initiative or social programme to determine if its working
$>$ Can be small or large scale e.g. effectiveness of a crime prevention programme in a local housing estate.

\subsection*{1.3.6 Control}
> It enables control i.e. the ability to regulate the phenomenon under study
$>$ Many scientific experiments are designed to achieve this objectives

\subsection*{1.3.7 Theory development}
> Involves formulating concepts, law and generalizations about a given phenomenon

\subsection*{1.2.3 IMPORTANCE/GOALS OF HEALTH RESEARCH}

\section*{Evidence based practice}
$>$ The aim of evidence based practice is to provide the best possible care based on the best available research care given to patients and communities is based on accurate and current information

\section*{Accountability for medical practice}
> To be accountable for medical practice, health care workers must have sound rationale for their actions based on knowledge that is gained through scientific research. Health care workers have the responsibility of keeping current their knowledge base and are of the best sources of current knowledge is the research literate

\section*{Documentation of the cost- effectiveness of health care}
$>$ Consumers have become more aware of the cost of health care and are asking for explanations of services they receive these consumers need to be made aware of the importance of health care in relation to maintain the health of clients and in promoting the recovery and rehabilitation of ill clients.
$>$ Health services consume a large percentage of a government's budget, and if it is demonstrated to be cost effective, hospitals will be looked to other areas to cut costs.

Providing basis for standard setting and quality assurance

\subsection*{1.2.4 SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE}

\section*{Previous research}
$\checkmark$ It is an important source because its objective and involves systematic process

\section*{Experience}
$\checkmark$ Human beings learn through their experiences in life. However, no two human beings have the same experience. Two people may have different interpretations of the same situation

\section*{Through tradition}
$\checkmark$ All human beings inherit culture, the socio-cultural system involves accepting knowledge of how things are or should be
$\checkmark$ This knowledge is required through indoctrination and socialization transmitted by parents, adults, teachers and the clergy

\section*{From authority}
$\checkmark$ This is from experts in a specialized area giving opinion on a given issue
$\checkmark$ We may be misled when we depend on the authority of persons speaking outside their team of experience

From intuition : Intuition is the perception or explanation or insight into phenomena by instinct. i.e. ability to gain new knowledge without conscious reasoning or rational process
$\checkmark$ However, throughout history, intuition has remained a mystery.

\subsection*{2.0 TYPES OF RESEARCH}

Research can be classified in different ways. This can be;
1. By purpose of research e.g. basic and applied
2. By method of analysis e.g. descriptive and correlation
3. Types e.g. survey, observational, historical
4. Broad classification i.e. qualitative and quantitative

\subsection*{2.1 BROAD CLASSIFICATION}

\subsection*{2.1.1 Qualitative research}
$\checkmark$ This includes designs, techniques and measures that do not produce discrete numerical data. More often data is in words and usually in categories
$\checkmark$ Data is usually collected by:
a) Direct observation where the required behavior is observed in a particular setting
b) Participant observation where the researcher who is a regular, full time participant in the activities being observed
c) Interview method: it is a face to face interaction between the researcher and the subjects. The researcher uses an interview schedule

\subsection*{2.1.1.1 Qualitative research has advantages such as;}
1. Allows the researcher direct participation to go beyond the statistical results usually reported in quantitative research
2. Participant observation -where the research who is a regular full time participant in the activities observed
3. Interview method-it is a face to face interaction between the researcher and the subjects. The researcher uses an interview schedule.

\section*{Advantages of qualitative research}
1) Allows the researcher to go beyond the statistical results usually reported in quantitative research
2) Human behavior is explained best by using qualitative research behavior such as emotions and attitudes that cannot be studied by direct observation are best studied by qualitative method

\subsection*{2.1.2 Quantitative Research}
$\checkmark$ This includes designs, techniques that produce discrete numerical or quantifiable data
$\checkmark$ Random sampling is used to ensure representative of the sample
$\checkmark$ Some of the research designs that can be categorized as qualitative researchers or experimental and co relational research
$\checkmark$ Any research that yields quantifiable data is a quantitative study

\subsection*{2.2 CLASSIFICATION BY PURPOSE}

\subsection*{2.2.1 Basic Research}
$\checkmark$ Refers to those studies that are designed to seek knowledge for its own sale and does not therefore specify an application of the findings
$\checkmark$ Basic research is conducted in order to understand the relationship among phenomena

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
$\checkmark$ Basic research is not aimed toward the solution of problems or the facilitation of decision making
$\checkmark$ Basic researchers are normally motivated by intellectual curiosity
$\checkmark$ The research is usually but not always in controlled laboratory situations and uses animals as subjects e.g. The relationship between alcohol intake and increase in road traffic accident among matatu drivers

\subsection*{2.2.2 Applied Research}
$\checkmark$ Applied research is research that is designed to produce findings that can be used to remediate or modify a given situation
$\checkmark$ The term refers to those that have their purpose an identified practical use or application
$\checkmark$ It provides data to support theory, guide theory revision
$\checkmark$ A problem is investigated and some resolution is sought by way of research findings

\subsection*{2.3 CLASSIFICATION BY METHOD OF ANALYSIS}

\subsection*{2.3.1 Descriptive research}
$\checkmark$ This is the process of collecting data in order to test hypotheses or to answer questions concerning the current status in the study
$\checkmark$ It determines and reports things the way they are at a particular time
$\checkmark$ It gives accurate profile of the research group

\subsection*{2.3.2 Cause comparative research}
$\checkmark$ This is used to explore relationships between variables. This is used to determine the reasons or causes for the current status of a phenomenon
$\checkmark$ This is used where experimental research is not possible
$\checkmark$ This is different from experimental in that the researcher is not able to manipulate the variables to determine the effect of one on the other. E.g. study weight gain among infants breastfed

\subsection*{2.4 CLASSIFICATION BY TYPE OF RESEARCH}

\subsection*{2.4.1 Survey research}
$\checkmark \quad$ A survey is an attempt to collect data from members of a population in order to determine the current status of the population with one or more variables
$\checkmark$ It is therefore a self report study which requires the collection of quantifiable information from the sample.
$\checkmark$ Survey study could be descriptive, explanatory e.t.c
$\checkmark$ Survey generally ask subjects to report their attitude, opinions, perceptions or bahaviour

\subsection*{2.4.2 Historical research}
$\checkmark$ This requires collecting data from the past
$\checkmark$ Research instruments are not administered to individuals
$\checkmark$ Sources of data/information include;
Eye witness reports, original documents as examples of primary sources
Second hand information i.e. other people's account (secondary sources)

\subsection*{2.4.3 Retrospective studies}
$\checkmark$ This begins with a phenomenon of interest (dependable variable) in the present and examines the relationship to other variables in the past. E.g. case studies, causes of heart attack and the investigating the associated factors e.g. contraceptive use, activity, childhood infections, atherosclerosis

\subsection*{2.4.4 Experimental methods}
$\checkmark$ This involves manipulation of independent variables to determine their effect on dependent variable
$\checkmark$ It is characterized by 3 properties
a) Manipulation
$\checkmark$ A process in which the researcher manages the independent variable in order to study the effect on dependent variable e.g. relationship between day of removal of stitches and post operative infection. Day of removal is manipulated. Some in $5^{\text {th }}$ day and another group day on $7^{\text {th }}$ day and see effect. Be removed in the $5^{\text {th }}$ day and the other the $7^{\text {th }}$ day.
b) Randomization
$\checkmark$ Ensures every unit in the target in the population has an equal chance of being chosen to the sample. Then after that each unit in the sample has an equal
c) Control
$\checkmark$ This is where comparison group(s) is used. One has an equal chance of being in either experimental or control group.

Experimental designs are divided into;

\subsection*{2.4.4.1 True or classical}
$\checkmark$ This is where the researcher has a great deal of control over the research situation. Examples include
$\checkmark$ One group pre-test-post-test design. i.e first measure the dependent variable give experimental treatment or independent variable then do a post test 0x0
$\checkmark$ Pre-test post test control group this is where there are two groups one experimental (given Rx ) and another control group (no Rx given ). A pre-test is done to both groups, treatment is given only to experiment group and then a post test to both groups
One short case study. This is where there is only the experimental group which is given treatment and then a post-test is done to test the effect of the treatment

\subsection*{2.4.4.2 Quasi-experimental design}
$\checkmark$ This is where full experimental control is not possible randomization not possible. These involve implementing a specific treatment and later examining the effects of this treatment
$\checkmark$ Is a type of intervention study

\section*{Examples}
A. Non-equivalent control group design

This is similar to pre-test -post test control group design except that there is no random assignment of subject to the experimental and comparison group.

\section*{B. Time-series design}

In this study, the researcher periodically observes or measures the subjects. The experimental is administered between two of the observations e.g. researcher assesses the level of pain in patients with low back pain weekly and then gives treatment after the third week. He then continues weekly assessment for another 3 weeks to see the effect of the treatment.

\subsection*{2.5 CLASSIFICATION BASED ON TIME DIMENTION IN RESEARCH}

\section*{Research types under this classification include;}

\subsection*{2.5.1 Cross-sectional research}
$\checkmark$ Used when all the information on a specific topic is collected at the same time
$\checkmark$ It is non-recurrent in nature and done at specific point in time
$\checkmark$ It concentrates only on here and now
$\checkmark$ It is cost effective than longitudinal

\subsection*{2.5.2 Longitudinal research}
$\checkmark$ Two or more studies are done on a specific topic or phenomenon over a longer period of time
$\checkmark$ The instruments used must be standardized as far as possible. Research determines if there are changes over a given period of time
$\checkmark$ It is predominantly descriptive and explanatory in nature
$\checkmark$ It is more complex and more expensive

\subsection*{2.5.2.1 Sub types of longitudinal Research}
a) Panel study-the same people, group or organization is investigated over various periods of time
b) Cohort -cohorts is a group of individuals with similar characteristics and are treated as one for the purposes of research
c) Time series- the research is on what happened to people over a period of time. Information is collected at a specific point in time.

\subsection*{2.5.3 Case study}
$\checkmark$ It entails an in depth investigation into various characteristics of a small number of cases over a specific period of time.
$\checkmark$ Data collected is more detailed, comprehensive and varied in nature
$\checkmark$ A phenomenon is studied in entirely
$\checkmark$ It contains an in depth investigation into interaction among factors influencing explanations or change which are then analyzed

\subsection*{3.0 RESEARCH PROCESS}

7. Pilot study/pretest
8. Data collection and presentation
9. Data analysis and interpretation
10. Communicating the research findings/report writing

\section*{UNIT TWO: RESEARCH PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT}

Proposal - Is a document which details an intended activity e.g. a research or project
> Once a proposal has been accepted by an institution, or a funding agency, the writer of the proposal is obliged to follow the steps outlined in the proposal.
$>$ A proposal demonstrates the researcher's ability to think clearly about the intended research or project
$>$ It should be straight forward document, uncluttered with extraneous and irrelevant information
$>$ It should also be clearly organized, simple and presented in a logical form
> The researcher proposes to undertake a piece of research on some pertinent issue
> Research proposals may be academic oriented but are still aimed at undertaking research to solve a problem. i.e. action oriented research
> Though most components found in an academic research proposal would also be relevant in one which is not, some section may not be relevant and could be left out without affecting the quality of the proposal e.g. not all action oriented research proposals will require hypotheses or theoretical backgrounds

\section*{QUALITIES OF A GOOD RESEARCH PROPOSAL}

\section*{Identifying Research Problems}

\section*{Steps}
i. Identify the broad area of interest
$\checkmark$ The area should be relevant to the profession and goals of the researcher e.g. HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, FP, breastfeeding
ii. Identify a specific problem within broad area e.g. in HIV/AIDS
$\checkmark$ Prevention of new infections
$\checkmark$ Circumcision
$\checkmark$ Needle prick injuries to nurses
$\checkmark$ Breastfeeding or not of infected
$\checkmark$ Management (HAART/ARV Rx)
$\checkmark$ Compliance
$\checkmark$ HAART in mother to child transmission
$\checkmark$ Health workers handling
$\checkmark$ Perceptions

\subsection*{3.3.2 What is a Researchable problem?}

It should be an important problem i.e.
i. Lead to findings that have wide spread implication to a particular area
ii. Challenge some commonly held altruism
iii. Reviews the inadequacies of existing laws, policies, theories, views e.t.c.
iv. Cover a reasonable scope i.e. not too narrow or general

\subsection*{3.3.3 Certain factors determine the scope of a research study}

These factors include:
i. The time available to carry it out
ii. The money available to carry out-type print and bind reports
iii. The availability of equipments needed to carry out the research
iv. The availability of subjects or units of study

\subsection*{3.3.4 Ways of identifying a specific research problem}

A research problem can be identified by several ways from the broad area

\section*{a) Existing literature}
$\checkmark$ By doing systematic reading of broad area of interest. This gives a good background of the basic information and insight into various issues that could be studied
b) Existing theories
$\checkmark$ Existing theories in an area contain generalization and hypotheses and principles which can be scientifically tested
$\checkmark$ This leads to validation or otherwise invalidate of an existing generalization or principles
c) Discussion with experts
$\checkmark$ Discussion with subject authorities in seminars, class, workshop, conferences e.t.c. are a source of current problems that could be researched include experienced researchers
d) Replication
$\checkmark$ This involves carrying out a research that has been done previously
$\checkmark$ The problem and methods are identical to the previous study

\section*{e) Previous research studies}
$\checkmark$ These usually indicate areas of further research or knowledge gaps in previous studies
$\checkmark$ This helps in building up knowledge from previous researchers
f) Media
$\checkmark$ Frequently reported issues in the media can form the basis of research problem such issues are usually discussed in a public and hence important to majority
Examples
$\checkmark$ Prostitutions-discordant couples, HIV/AIDS orphans, both injuries related to fuel tanker accidents, husband battering, drug peddling and abuse e.t.c.

\section*{g) Personal experiences}
* First hand observations and reflection experiences could be sources of research problems ie. Experiences usually lead and vivid images, a hunch or an intuition on the part of a serious researcher e.g
* Post surgical infections, maternal death, and neonatal death

\subsection*{3.3.5 Stating the problem}
* The researcher usually starts with a brief introductory section of the general study area. Then the researcher narrows down to the specific area of study

\subsection*{3.3.6 Characteristics of a good problem statement}
i. It is clearly written that it captures the readers interest
ii. Should be objectively researchable
iii. It indicates the scope of the specific research
iv. The significance of the study is clearly stated i.e. how study will add new knowledge
v. The problem statement must give the purpose of the research

\section*{Stating the purpose/Broad objective}
$\checkmark$ It conveys the focus of the study in one or two sentences

$\checkmark$ Neutral verbs or phrases are applicable also here

\section*{Examples}

Purpose
$\checkmark$ The purpose of this study is to investigate the breastfeeding practices among professionals in Mombasa district

\section*{Specific objectives}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
$\checkmark$ To identify the social economic status of professionals, women in Mombasa
$\checkmark$ To investigate the factors that influence baby weaning by professional women in Mombasa
$\checkmark$ To explore the attitudes of professional women in Mombasa towards breastfeeding

\subsection*{3.6 Formulating hypotheses}
$\checkmark$ This is the researchers prediction concerning the outcome of the study
$\checkmark$ It states possible differences, relationships or caused between two variables or concepts
$\checkmark$ These derived or based on:
$>$ Existing theories
> Personal experiences
> Previous research
$\checkmark$ A study can have one or more hypotheses. These hypotheses are crucial because that is the study put to empirically test.

\subsection*{3.6.1 Purposes of Hypothesis}
1. Hypothesis provides direction. They bridge the gap between the problem and the evidence needed for its solution
2. Hypothesis ensure collection of the evidence necessary to answer the question posed in the statement
3. Hypothesis enable the investigator to assess the information he/she has collected in terms of relevance and organization
4. Hypothesis permit the researcher to understand the problem with greater clarity and use the data collected to find solutions to problems
5. Hypothesis from the frame work for the ultimate conclusions as solutions. Researchers usually base their conclusions on the results of the tests of their hypothesis

\section*{Characteristics of a good hypothesis}
a) They must state clearly and briefly the expected relationship of variables
b) They must be based on a sound rationale derived from theory, previous research or professional experience
c) They should be consistent with common sense or generally accepted truths
d) They must be testable i.e. data can be collected to support or fail to support hypothesis
e) They must be testable within a reasonable time
f) They must be related to empirical phenomena-words to "ought", "should", "bad" should be avoided
g) Variable stated in the hypothesis must be consistent with the purpose statement, objectives and the operationalisation of variables in the method section
h) They should be concise and simple

\section*{Examples}
i. High alcohol content in the blood influences reaction time among drivers in Kenya
ii. There is a relationship between level of education and income among civil servants in Kenya
iii. The amount of rainfall and the type of fertilizer used influences the yield of wheat per area in the Riftvalley province in Kenya

\subsection*{3.6.2 Types of Hypotheses}

\subsection*{3.6.2.1 Null hypothesis}
$\checkmark$ Also called statistical hypotheses
$\checkmark$ These always states that no relationship of differences exists. Any relationship between two variables or differences between groups is merely due to chance or errors
e.g. High alcohol content in the blood affects reaction time among truck drivers in Kenya
$\checkmark$ There is a relationship between bhang trafficking and intelligence among traffickers

\subsection*{3.6.2.2 Alternative directional hypotheses}
$\checkmark$ This specifies the relationship or differences between variables. The relationship may be stated as either being higher than or lower than e.t.c. e.g. Male circumcision reduces the prospection of contracting HIV infection among males in Nyanza province.

\section*{LITERATURE REVIEW}

This involves the systematic identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research problem being investigated

\section*{It should be extensive and thorough:}

\section*{PURPOSE OF LITERATURE REVIEW}
i. The main purpose is to determine what has been done on the problem being studied
ii. This avoids unnecessary and unintentional duplications
iii. Demonstrates one's familiating with existing body of knowledge gives the reader confidence
iv. Identify consistently unproductive or unreliable approaches
v. Reveals information gaps and unanswered questions
vi. Reveals strategies procedures and measuring instruments useful in the investigations of the research problem. This helps one to avoid mistakes that have been made by other researchers and also helps one to benefit from other researchers experience.
vii. Literature review will suggest other procedures, approaches, and other recommendations which one can try
viii. Makes the researcher familiar with previous studies thus facilitates interpretation of the study results. Results can be discussed in terms of whether they support or contrast previous findings. If contradicting literature review may provide rationale for the discrepancy.
ix. Literature review helps the researcher to narrow or limit the research problem and to define it better. The literature will give the researcher the knowledge needed to convert a tentative research problem into a detailed and concise plan of work
$x$. It helps determine new approaches and stimulates new ideas. The researcher may also be alerted to research possibilities which have been overlooked into the past.

\section*{FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN DOING LITERATURE}
i. Assess the strengths and weakness of past management
ii. Report any inconsistent findings
iii. Identify gaps in the knowledge
iv. Determine the contribution of proposed study
v. Consider the possibility of unintentional duplication

\section*{SCOPE OF LITERATURE REVIEW}

\section*{Questions arising from the scope include:}
$\checkmark$ How wide or narrow should it be?
$\checkmark$ What is the relevance to my topic?
These are applicable questions and they get answered with experience. There is no formula for arriving at a decision. However these hints are useful towards determining scope
i. In widely researched area, cover a narrow topic in depth e.g. HIV
ii. In a little or new researched areas, where little depth available, the researcher would require to review any relevant material in order to develop a logical framework for the study and appropriate hypotheses for the study
iii. Avoid the temptation to include all available materials. Excessive material does not mean great research information
iv. At the point of saturation reencountering already reviewed literature, abandon literature review.

\section*{TIPS ON GOOD LITERATURE REVIEW}
a) Avoid hurried review, you may overlook important studies
b) Avoid relying too much on secondary sources
c) Concentrate on the methodology and measurements used and not only findings
d) Copy references correctly and constantly acknowledge sources

\section*{STEPS OF LITERATURE REVIEW}
1. Be familiar with the library-before beginning the literature review
2. Make a list of key words or phrases to guide your search e.g. female condoms, abortions, community health, episiotomy
3. Go to the source of the literature
4. Summarize the references on cards for easy organization of the literature
5. Analyze, organize and report the collected data in orderly manner. This is usually the hardest part
6. Make an outline of the main topics or themes in order of presentation. Decide on the number of headlines and sub headlines required depending on how detailed the review is
7. Analyze each reference in terms of the outline made and establish where it will be most relevant
8. Studies contrary to the received wisdom should not be ignored, such studies should be analyzed and possible explanation for the differences given
9. Literature should be organized in such a way that more general issues covered first before the researcher narrows down to that which is more specific to the research problem
10. Some researchers prefer to have a brief summary of the literature and its implications. However this is optional.

\section*{SOURCES OF LITERATURE}

Primary sources: These are accounts of those who actually observed or witnessed the occurrence of the phenomena

It also includes accounts of primary researchers (original documents)
These should be used as much as possible because secondary sources may be attended by writers

Secondary sources: These include publication of authors who were not direct observers or participants of the events described. Examples of sources of literature/information;

Scholarly journals: Are crucial research documents. Are found in the libraries. They can also be found in the internet

These and dissertations: These are research projects written by masters and PHD students. They are valuable sources of information.

Government documents: These include policy papers and research reports owned government e.g.Kenya demographic and Health survey, vision 2030

Papers presented at conferences: Papers during conferences and symposium good and are primary sources e.g. literature

Books: These are available in most libraries seek assistance of librarian to assist in library searching

Abstracts: Abstracts give a list of journal articles with summaries e.g. nutritional abstracts

Computer search: Can use key words in search for relevant literature

This is used where all information materials are computerized
Internet One can browse the web and get literature from the latest articles, conference papers and policy documents from various organizations

Others Includes periodicals, grey literature (unpublished literature) Africa etc

\section*{Referencing within text}

\section*{African psychological Association (APAD) system}

Method 1:
Authors last name(s) and the year of document publication comes after or before paraphrased statements
a) e.g. Before (one author)
- John(2009) asserted that female condoms are only used by $2 \%$ of female students in the faculty of health sciences.
Before (2 Authors)
John and Alice (2009) Asserted that female condoms are only used by $2 \%$ of female students in the facility of health sciences in subsequent citation, John , et al (2009) Asserted that....
b) After (one Author)
- It has been documented that only $2 \%$ of female students in the faculty of health sciences use female condoms( John,2009)
After (two authors)
3 It has been documented that only 2\% of female students in the F.H.S use female condoms(John and Alice (2009) )
4 After (three authors)
5 It has been documented that...(John, Alice and Kennedy, 2009) or John, et al, 2009

Method 2: Numerical Referencing
6 Here numbers are used instead of authors name year of publication e.g. It has been documented that only $2 \%$ of female students in the faculty of Health sciences use female condoms $(1,2012)$ or the number can be put after the statement but no brackets

\section*{Foot notes}

7 These are references which appear at the bottom of a journal paper or a book rather than at the end of the text.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

8 These serve two purposes
i. To provide additional information with no disruption
ii. To indicate the source of an idea. Are helpful to a reader who wish to refer to the sources of facts or opinions presented hence accurate and complete information is essential
9 Foot notes can be indicated through;
a) Numbering footnotes consecutively throughout the chapter and then put the references on each page
b) Footnotes can be numbered and then put at the end of the chapter.

\section*{QUOTATIONS}

Quotations may be used for several reasons;
i. For accuracy
ii. For presentation of statements that are unusually clear and well put
iii. To add strength to ones study especially when the quotation marks before and after the quote, then italiaze. E.g there is significant relationship between the alcohol intake and academic performance. The higher the alcohol intake, the lower the performance in academics. ( Njenga, 2005)
iv. Direct quotation must be exactly the way it is (No corrections)

10 When using incomplete statements, use quotations marks before and after then quote, then italiaze, use 3 dots/periods to represent the missing text either before or after. E.g.
"...The higher the alcohol intake, the lower the performance in academics,"(Njenga,2005,P.5)

\section*{METHODOLOGY}
> Has to go about the particular design to use
> This describes the procedures that have been followed in conducting the study
> It deals with
i) Identifying research design
ii) Sampling procedures
iii) Measurement methods

\section*{RESEARCH DESIGN}

Includes; common ones
a) Experimental- Classical or true quasi
b) Survey-A comparative study or correlation study
c) Descriptive research design
d) Case study design

\section*{SAMPLE AND SAMPLING METHODS}
> Is a subset or a small group that represents the total population of a study subscale, selected group, part at a whole
> Population-Entire group of persons/ a set of objectives and events the research has to study

\subsection*{5.2.1 Sampling frame}
> Is a comprehensive list of the sample element in the target population e.g. a list of all nurses in a district hospital

\subsection*{5.2.2 Sampling bias}
> Occurs when the researcher has not carefully selected, the sample that's expected to represent the target population

\subsection*{5.2.3 Sampling error}
> Is the difference between the sample characteristics and population characteristics (population invalidity)

\subsection*{5.2.4 Sample size}
> If time allows, a researcher should take a large sample which is better for generalization
> It depends on factors such as;
- Number of variables, type of research, design, method of data analysis, the size at the accessible population
> It has been suggested that for coming up a sample size on estimation can be used.
E.g. for correlation studies 30 or more are required for descriptive signs and symptoms of accessible are enough for experimental at least 30 cases are required per group
NB: However there's a statistical formula for calculating a sample size

\section*{SAMPLING TECHNIQUES}

There are two basic sampling
a) Probability/random sampling
b) Non-probability sampling

\section*{Probability or Random Sampling}
> The goal of probability sampling is to select a responsible number of subject, objects or cases that present to get population
> In random sampling, each unit of the sample here have equal chance of being selected. This allows generation of results in a higher population

\subsection*{5.3.1.1 Simple random sampling}
> It involves giving a number to every subject or a member of the accessible population placing the number in a container then picking any number at random
> Alternatively one can use a table of random number or can be generated by computers

\subsection*{5.3.1.2 Systematic random sampling}
$>$ In every $\mathrm{k}^{\text {th }}$ case is selected in a population frame for inclusion in the sample
> The list of all members in the sampling frame, must be randomized to get a true random sample
> Once the sampling frame has been randomized, the researcher then decides the sampling interval
> Interval is the distance between the cases that are selected for the sample. i.e. divide the total population over sample size e.g. population of $400 \mathrm{~K}^{\text {th }}=400 / 100=4$ subject/case is used. Sample size at 60
$\Rightarrow$ Every $4^{\text {th }}$ case is picked, this process continues and sampling case is completed

\subsection*{5.3.1.3 Stratified random sampling}
> This ensures representation from various subgroup in the population
> The population is subdivided into subgroups or statistics and the sample selected from each subgroup

\section*{Steps}
a) Identify the population
b) Define the criteria for stratification e.g. sex, age, colour, gender, income level, cadres of nurses
c) Stratify the population into two or more groups using a given criteria have a list of population in each strata
d) Determine the required sample size and appropriate representation (can be proportionate or equal)
e) Select the respondent using simple random an appropriate number of subjects for each stratum

\subsection*{5.3.1.4 Cluster sampling}
> Used where sampling frame is not possible e.g. Where population is too large or if its scattered

\section*{Steps}
a) Identify the population e.g. Malaria patients in Kenya
b) Define the clusters forming the population e.g. Malaria patients in district hospitals. Other clusters include ; schools, estate, ministries, department
c) Determine the required sample size e.g. Loss of malaria patients
d) List all the clusters in a random order e.g. Mombasa, Msambweni e.t.c
e) Using the table of random number select the required number of clusters according to size of cluster required e.g. Select 2-3 district hospital with loss of patients
f) All members in the selected cluster are included in the unit observed.

\subsection*{5.3.2 Non probability sampling}
> Used when a researcher is not interested in selecting a sample that is representative of a population
> Is common in quantitative research because the focus is on depth information and not making references or generalizations

\subsection*{5.3.2.1 Purposive sampling}
> In this technique the researcher uses/selects cases that have the required information with one's object to the study
> The cases are handpicked simply because they have the required information
N/B
The researcher specifies the criteria e.g. certain age, range, region, education level, specified group etc

\section*{Disadvantages include:}
$\checkmark$ Sampling bias
$\checkmark$ Non-representative hence no generalization
$\checkmark$ After the criteria has been set, random sampling is then applied

\subsection*{5.3.2.2 Snow balling sampling}
> In this method, initially the researcher identifies few subjects with desired characteristics using purposive method
> This few respondent direct the researcher to other subject with similar characteristics
> This continues until the researcher gets the number of cases/subjects he requires e.g. Research dealing with drug addicts and sex workers, social deviates
> This method is useful where the population that possesses the required characteristics is small or hard to find

\subsection*{5.3.2.3 Quota sampling}
$>$ Is similar to stratified random sampling and the objective is to include various groups or quota of the population in the study based on some criteria
> Researcher purposely chooses the subject to fit the quota

\section*{Steps}
a) Identify the population of interest
b) Determine size of sample
c) Stratify population into quota, depending on criteria
d) Cases are purposely selected to fill the quotas

\subsection*{5.3.2.4 Convenient/ Accidental sampling}
> Involves selecting cases or units of observation as they become available to the researcher, also called "volunteer sampling" e.g. if one wants to assess the BP on female on depo provera, once above 40 years, one will check the BP of any client on the age bracket of $>40$ years who are attending FP clinic despite the parity, not everyone is given a chance

\subsection*{5.8 CONDUCTING A PRETEST/PILOT STUDY}
$>$ Before you carry out the full scale data collection process, it is important to conduct a trial to see whether the instruments planned for collecting data are actually appropriate for the study and whether are collecting the information you need.
$>$ To achieve this, you have to carry out a pilot study/pretest
$>$ Pretest or pilot study is defined as;
- A small version of a proposed study conducted to refine the methodology or
- Is the process of carrying out preliminary study going through the entire research procedure with a small sample. Or
- Pretest refers to a small scale trial of a particular research component
$>$ In a pilot study, respondents chosen have characteristics to those to be used during the actual research
$>$ The settings should be almost similar

\subsection*{5.8.1 PURPOSES OF A PRE-TEST/PILOT STUDY}

A pilot study is done to;
i. To ensure that items in the data collection instruments are stated clearly and have the same meaning to all research respondents(Refine where necessary)
ii. To determine whether the proposed study is feasible
iii. To identify any problems with the research design
iv. To assess the time taken to administer the research instruments
v. To determine whether the sample is representative of the population
vi. To determine the effectiveness of the sampling technique used
vii. To give the researcher the real experience in the field(with the respondents, environment, methodology and instruments)
viii. Determine the human and financial resources requirement for the study
ix. Determine the effectiveness of the training given to research assistants where necessary
x. Evaluate the procedure for data process and analysis

\subsection*{5.8.2 APPROPRIATE TIME TO CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY}
> It should be conducted before the actual full-scale study.
$>$ The advantages of conducting the pre-test before finalizing the proposal is that one can draft the work plan and budget based on realistic estimates
$>$ Also one can revise the data collection tools he/she submits the proposal for approval
$>$ Can be done before or after training research assistants or immediately after
$>$ If it is not possible to do it in the above circumstances, e.g. the proposal being drafted far from the field or no similar research settings available close to the drafting site, the pretest can be done after finishing the proposal. However it should be done long before the actual field work to allow for a thorough revision of data collection tools.

\subsection*{5.8.3 USING FINDINGS OF THE PRE-TEST/PILOT STUDY}
$>$ Identify any sensitive or annoying items in the instrument and rectify them
$>$ Any question that interviewers had to repeat and explain several times to respondents need to be rectified
$>$ Analyze the results of this pre-test and develop dummy tables

\section*{UNIT THREE: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS}

\subsection*{5.4 MEASUREMENT LEVELS AND TOOLS USED IN DATA COLLECTION}

\subsection*{5.4.1 Measurement level scales}
$>$ It's the process of assigning number to variables
$>$ Measurement as used in research implies quantification of information ie assigning some type of number to the data
$>$ These applies in quantitative research
$>$ Mathematical calculations that can be made with data obtained depend on the level/scale of measurement
$>$ There are 4 levels/scales of measurement
a) Nominal scale
b) Ordinal scale
c) Interval scale
d) Ratio scale

\subsection*{5.4.1.1 Nominal scale}
> Considered as the lowest level of measurement/scale of all variables
$>$ This level/scale merely groups subjects/cases from the sample into categories with a common set of characteristics
$>$ Variables that can only be measured at nominal level include:
- Sex e.g. male and female
- Marital status e.g. single, married, separated, divorced
- Religion e.g. Christian, Islam, Hinduism, ATR e.g. variable marital status may be included in a research. The researcher then can operationalise this variable as married, single, divorced, separated
The researcher would then number the subjects that fall in (3) separated (4) these numbers are for identification e.g. married (40) single (10) divorced(5) separated(1) in a frequency.
$>$ Numbers are often assigned to various categories for the purpose of identification. We could have assigned 1-married, 2- single, 3-divorced, 4- separated
$>$ These numbers do not represent quantities or order, addition, subtraction, division, multiplication of this numbers would yield meaningless values.
$>$ Variables that can take two categories are referred to as "Dichotomous" e.g. sex can take either male and female

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\subsection*{5.4.1.2 Ordinal scale}
$>$ The scale groups subjects into categories and also ranks them into same order either ascending, descending (highest to lowest) or (lowest to highest)
$>$ Numerical represent relative position or order among the values of the variables
E.g. community health cadres (KECN, KRN, KRCHN, BSN, MSN, PHD)

Social economic class (low, mild, upper class)
Severity of anaemia (mild, moderate, severe)

\subsection*{5.4.1.3 Interval scale}
$>$ In this class, numbers assigned in each measure are ranked in order and interval between numbers are equal
$>$ Numerical used represent quantities in mathematical operations (+ve, -ve) on numerical would yield meaningful values but this mathematical operations are limited to addition and subtraction (multiplication and divisions are not applicable)
$>$ In this scale, there's no true 0 point i.e. It can take-ve values e.g. interval scale measures include;

Temp. in test score or in foren height e.g. $99^{\circ} \mathrm{c}-98^{\circ} \mathrm{c}-98.2^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ order and interval of $0.4^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$.

\subsection*{5.4.1.4 Ratio scale}
$>$ Is the highest level of measurement, it's the most precise method of measuring a variable
$>$ It has all characteristics of other scales (nominal, internal, ordinal)
$>$ It has a true 0 point and all mathematical operations can be applied to yield meaningful values
> Most physical objects can be measured at the ratio scale e.g. Weight, height, age, area, BP , distance e.t.c. e.g. a field 1000 m long is as twice as long as one which is 50 m long. Therefore 0 m long means no length as weight

\section*{$\underline{N B}$}
$>$ When considering interval and ratio scale, there are 2 types of variables
i. Discrete variable: these can take only exact numbers (whole numbers)
ii. Continuous variable: these measures can theoretically occur at any point in a continuous e.g. Height $5.2 \mathrm{~m}, 5.65 \mathrm{~m}$, age 24.3 years 34.8 months

\subsection*{5.5 INSTRUMENTS IN RESEARCH}
> An ideal instrument is one which results in measurements that are relevant, accurate, objective, sensitive and efficient
$>$ An instrument is a device used to measure the concept of interest in a research project

Instruments can be;
i. Observation scales, forms or checklist
ii. Questionnaires
iii. Interview schedules
iv. Standardized tests

\subsection*{5.5.1 OUESTIONNAIRES}
$\Rightarrow$ It's the commonly used tool
$>$ Each item in the questionnaire is used to address a specific objective research question or hypothesis of the study
$>$ The researcher must know how each item in the questionnaire is to be analyzed
$>$ A questionnaire must be well thought or it will;
Cause a confusion to the respondent on the information required
Discourage the respondents to an extent of discarding it
It may leave important information

\subsection*{5.5.1.1 CATEGORIES OF QUESTIONS USED IN A QUESTIONNAIRE}
a) Structural or close ended
* These are accompanied with possible alternatives from where respondents selects the answer that will best describe the situation
* Always has the other(specify) option to cater for any category that might have been left out eg. What do you crave for in pregnancy apart from food?
-clay -charcoal -others(specify)

\section*{Disadvantages of structured questions}
1. They are more difficult to construct because categories must be well thought out
2. Responses are limited and the respondent is compelled to answer according to research choices

\section*{Advantages of structured questions}
1. Are easy to analyze
2. Easy to administer because each items followed by alternative answers
3. Are economical in time and costs
b) Unstructured /open question
* They give the respondent freedom of response
* They have no present alternatives
E.g. how do you handle cases
malpractice? ........................................................
i. They yield in depth responses
ii. They are simpler to formulate because the researcher does not need to labour to come up with appropriate categories
iii. Responses give insight to the feelings, attitudes, interest, decisions, hidden motivations and background
iv. They stimulate persons to think about his feelings or motives and to express what he considers to be most important

\section*{Disadvantages}
i. Answers given might be irrelevant to the research objectives
ii. They are hard to categorize and analyze
iii. They are time consuming for respondents and may put them off.

\section*{c) Contingency questions}
* Are applicable to certain respondents only and not all
* These are follow up questions and are required to get further information from relevant subgroup also called 'filter' questions
* They are used to probe for more information and save the respondent from answering questions which are irrelevant to them

\section*{+ Examples}
1. Have you ever been pricked by a needle?

Yes.
No.
$\qquad$
$\qquad$
If yes how many times
Once $\qquad$
2-4 times. $\qquad$
Over 4 times
2.Have you ever used any contraceptives

Yes.
No.
$\qquad$

The questions can be structured or unstructured
c) Matrix questions
* These are questions that share same set of response categories
* Are common whenever scales are used

Examples how are you satisfied with you job?
a) Financial 12345
b) Quality of life 12345
c) Level of assets 12345
d) Ability to save 12345

Key
1- Extremely dissatisfied
2- Dissatisfied
3- Neutral
4- Satisfied
5- Extremely satisfied

\section*{Advantages of matrix questions}
a) They are easy to complete and unlikely to put off respondents
b) Space is used efficiently
c) It is easy to compare responses given to different items. The researcher can easily detect a trend just by glancing at the responses
d) They are easy to analyze

\section*{Disadvantages of matrix questions}
a) Because they are easy to construct and analyze they can be misused
b) Some respondents may form a pattern of agreeing or disagreeing with all items

\subsection*{5.5.1.2 RULES FOR CONSTRUCTING A OUESTIONNAIRE AND ITS ITEMS}
1. Start by listing the specific objectives that you want the questionnaire to accomplish
2. Determine how each item is to be analyzed
3. Ensure clarity avoid terms like 'most' or several
4. If a concept has several meanings, then the intended meaning must be defined
5. Short questions are preferred to long ones
6. Items should be stated positively as much as possible. Negative words are easily overlooked by respondents
7. Questions with two separate items should be avoided
8. Leading or biased questions should be avoided
9. Very personal and sensitive questions should be avoided
10. Use simple words that are easy to understand
11. Avoid psychologically threatening questions eg. Are you worried of the consequences of divorce?
12. Avoid questions that assume facts without evidence
13. Make complete meaningful statements

\subsection*{5.5.1.3 PRETESTING A OUESTIONNAIRE}

6 This is trying out the questionnaire in the field

7 It should be tried to sample which is similar to the actual selected sample. Subject in the actual sample should not be used in the pretest
8 The pretest sample should be $1 \%-10 \%$ of the sample size

\section*{Reasons for pretest}
i. Vague questions will be revealed as the respondents will interpret them differently
ii. Other deficiencies will be revealed e.g. unclear instructions, limited space, wrong numbering
iii. Comments and suggestions from the respondents during pretest will improve the questionnaire if incorporated
iv. Because few questions are analyzed, the method of analysis appropriateness is tested

\subsection*{5.5.1.4 WAYS OF ADMINISTERING A OUESTIONNAIRE}
a) Self administered questionnaire
* Respondents fill questionnaires themselves which can be sent to them by mail or by hand delivery

\section*{b) Researcher administered by questionnaire}
* The researcher interviews the respondents using a questionnaire
* This is applicable when the respondents may not have the ability to interpret the questions because of their educational levels
* Questions are read out to the respondents and their options/choices are written down
c) Using internet
* Sampling and collection of data is done through the internet and responses are given via e-mail or website.

\subsection*{5.5.2 INTERVIEW SCHEDULE}
* This is a set of questions that the interview asks when interviewing
* It is used to orally obtain data from the respondent
* Cooperation is key to good results. Good rapport is a must
* Questions in the interview schedule can be structured or unstructured

\section*{Advantages of Interview}
i. In depth data is obtained which cannot be obtained with questionnaires
ii. It is precise in attaining specific objectives
iii. There is no confusion as the interviewer can clarify the questions
iv. It is more flexible than questionnaires
v. Can capture very sensitive and personal information by honest and personal interaction between the researcher and respondents
vi. You can get more information by probing
vii. Can also expose negative responses through interaction and genuine conversation
viii. There is high response rate because it is not easy to refuse to answer questions or completely ignore the researcher.

\section*{Disadvantages}
i. Interview are expensive as time, travelling to meet respondents is costly.
ii. It calls for high level communication and interpersonal skills. Which some researcher may lack
iii. There could be interviews bias hence need training to avoid bias
iv. The interview may be subjective in that the subjects may be too eager to please the researcher. Again the researcher may ask questions to support his perceived notions
v. Because it is time consuming, the researcher may be forced to use a small sample
vi. Respondents may have bias/prejudice. E.g. affluent researcher going to a poor community may influence the respondent's reaction

\subsection*{5.5.2.1 DATA COLLECTION DURING INTERVIEW}

Data can be collected by;
i. Note taking- where the researcher takes notes as the subjects answer questions asked. Should be done carefully not to upset the respondent. Responses should be recorded the way they are expressed
ii. Tape recording- responses are recorded in a video or a tape recorder. One should be careful when recording.

\subsection*{5.5.3 STANDADIZED TESTS}
* A standardized test is one that has consistency and uniform procedures for administering scoring and interpreting the behavior of the subjects. E.g. 1Q intelligence tests
* Graduate record examination (GRE) usually by students wishing to pursue further studies abroad

\subsection*{5.5.4 OBSERVATION FORMS SCHEDULES OR CHECKLISTS}
* These are used to record what the researcher observes during data collection
* The behaviours to be observed must be defined. The observer checks off each observed behavior as they occur
* Sometimes rating scales are used, responses are recorded and evaluated
* Can be used by;
- Non participant observer or
- Participant observer

\subsection*{7.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION}

\subsection*{7.1 QUALITATIVE DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS}
* Data presentation and analysis of qualitative research is quite different from data collected when using quantitative methods
* This is because qualitative research uses words while quantitative uses numbers
* The following steps could be used when presenting and analyzing qualitative data:-

\subsection*{1.1.1 Organizing the data}
* The data collected is usually large, therefore the researcher will need to put all this information in a simple format. This is called "clearing" the data

\subsection*{1.1.2 Creating categories; themes and patterns}
* The disorganized and fragmented data needs to be put into categories, themes and patterns. One can use research questions or discussion topics

\subsection*{1.1.3 Analyzing and interpreting the data}
* Once themes, categories and patterns have been identified, the researcher then evaluates the data to determine its usefulness and accuracy. Computer programmes can be used to generate themes and categories

\subsection*{1.1.4 Writing the report}
* Unlike in quantitative research where the report writing is done after analyzing the data, in quantitative research techniques, the report writing and the analysis go hand in hand

\subsection*{1.2 QUANTITATIVE DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS}

\subsection*{7.2.1 Descriptive statistics}
* This is the process of organizing, summarizing and visualizing quantitative data
* The purpose of descriptive statistics is to help the researcher to visualize and identify the patterns that may emerge from the data collected. This in turn assists the researcher in making meaningful conclusions from the results of the study.
* Type of statistics or indices used depend on type of variable and scale of measurement (Nominal, ordinal, interval, or rational)

\section*{Main types of descriptive statistics}

\subsection*{1.2.1.1 Measures of central tendency}
* Measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) are statistics that describe the average, typical or most common value for a group of data
* A measure of central tendency summarizes a frequency distribution by the use of a single number
* There are 3 main types of commonly used measures of central tendency

\section*{a. The mode}
* Def: This is the most commonly occurring value or category among a sample of subjects
* This is the only measure of central tendency appropriate for norminal data. Mode may also be reported for ordinal, interval or ratio
* A set of data with one value that occurs most frequently is unimodal. Two is biomodal and if more than two values occurring more frequently it is multimodal. It is possible to have no mode. 358991011 9=mode

\section*{b. The median}
* This is the score that divides ranked scores into two equal parts, such that half of the scores are larger than the median and the other half are smaller
* Median is appropriate for ordinal, interval and ratio data influenced by extreme values. Media is frequently used in reporting average income because extreme values do not affect the median.

\section*{c. Mean}
* This means the average of a set of scores or measurements
* It is most frequently used measure of central tendency,
* Is arrived at by adding all values and dividing by the total number of values
* The mean is appropriate for interval and ratio data
* It is the most stable measure of central tendency for these levels of data if the distribution is normal
* If the distribution is not normal and extreme values are present, the mean will not represent an accurate picture of the distribution.

\subsection*{7.2.2.2 Measures of variability (measures dispersion)}
* Measures of variability described how spreads out values are a distribution of values. Variability is the distribution of scores around a particular central score or value(usually the mean)
* Although measures of central tendency are important, sometimes it may be interesting to know how spreads out the values are in the distribution.

\section*{For example}

The following are pulse rates of subjects 2 groups(A and B) Group A-80,79,78,78,75 mean 390/5=78
Group B- $100,90,80,70,50$ mean $390 / 5=78$
For this example, the pulse rates for both is 78 . However the pulse of group A seems homogeneous, or alike, while group B are heterogeneous, or dissimilar. This information is very important because the arithmetic mean is not appropriate to use in describing group B or to use in comparing the two groups of pulse rates
The most common measures of variability are range, standard deviation, variance, percentile and 2-5 scores

\section*{Types of measures of variability}

\section*{i. Range}
> This is the difference between the highest and the lowest value in the group of values or scores in a distribution
> This is determined by subtracting the lowest value from the highest score. E.g scores $78,79,80,81,82,85$. The range is $85-78$
> A small range signifies that scores are not spread out and vice versa
> Range is used to gain a quick picture of the dispersion of data. Range has limited usefulness because one extreme score can change the range drastically

\section*{ii. Standard deviation and the variance}
> Standard deviation is defined as the extent to which scores 1 a distribution deviate from their mean average
> The standard deviation therefore involves subtracting the mean from each score to obtain the deviation

\subsection*{7.2.2.3 Frequency distribution}
> This is one of the simplest ways to present data
> Frequencies are obtained by simply counting the occurrences of values or scores represented in the data
> Frequency distribution are appropriate for reporting all level of data(nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
> In a frequency distribution, all values or scores are listed and the number of times each appears is recorded
> Values may be listed from the highest to the lowest or vice versa
> Use slash method(////) and if range is small, say less than 20, each score may be listed individually
> Groups of scores must be exhaustive (include all possible values) and mutually exclusive(no overlapping of categories) e.g.
pulse rate tally frequency
60-65 III 3
66-70 IIII 5
71-75 |/I/ // 7/15
> Frequency distributions may be described according to their shape
> They can be symmetrical or non-symmetrical
> Symmetrical distributions are those in which both values of the distribution are the same
> Non-symmetrical distribution also called skewed are those in which distribution has an off-centre peak
> Skewness- is a measure of horizontal departure from normal distribution. it can be positive skew or negative skew
$\checkmark$ Positive skew-is where the tail of the measures of a particular variable are low with very few high measures
$\checkmark$ Negative skew- is where the tail of the distribution points to the left i.e. the majority of the scores/measures of $s$ variable are very high and very few low measures
- A variable that tends to be positively skewed is personal income while few earn large income. An example of a negatively skewed distribution would be age of people who have chronic illnesses. (a few young and middle aged men and women have chronic illnesses, but many elderly people have chronic conditions.
> A part from skewness, another deviation from the standard normal curve is kurtosis-is the vertical departure from the normal
> This is the peakedness or the flatness of a curve
> A curve that is peaked is called leptokurtic
> A relatively flat curve is said to be platykurtic. The kurtosis of the standard curve lies between the two extreme and is called mesokurtic.

\subsection*{7.2.2.4 Characteristics of a Normal curve}
1. It is well shaped with symmetrical distribution and the maximum height being the mean
2. The mean, median, and mode are the same
3. Most values cluster around the mean
4. T
5. The tails of the curve never touch the base because the distribution is theoretical, rather than empirical
N/B : normal distribution is frequently found in many happenings in nature. Height and weight are normally distributed in the population

\subsection*{7.2.3 GRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION}
> A graph enables the reader to see the trend of the distribution easily than is possible by simply looking at numbers in a frequency distribution
> A graph should be labeled on both the vertical and horizontal axes. It should also have a title
> Graphs commonly used to present data in research reports include: histograms, frequency polygons, and bar charts.

\subsection*{7.2.3.1 Histograms}
* Histograms consists of a series of adjacent bars whose x-axis represent the number of subjects obtaining a particular score, number of respondents belonging to a particular category. X-axis usually has the scores
* Exact limits are commonly used to construct a histogram hence the bars are continuous with no space in between

Example below is a distribution scores from a test..

Score limits
91-100
81-90
71-80
61-70
51-60
exact limits
frequency (f)
90.5-100.5

70.5-80.5 6
60.5-70.5
50.5-60.5 10 14
$$\mathrm{N}=34$$

Figure 1. Histogram derived from the score above

\subsection*{7.2.3.1 Frequency polygons}
* A polygon is a many sided figure. To plot a frequency polygon, one must establish the midpoint of the class interval
* The midpoint is established by summing up the lower and upper class limits of each interval then divide by 2 . The midpoint are then plotted against the frequencies and the points are joined using straight lines
* A frequency polygon is a closed figure and so the ends meet the horizontal line one limit after the highest and score and one unit from the lowest score

\section*{Example}

Table 2: Distribution of scores from
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Scores & Midpoints & Frequency \\
\hline $10-20$ & 15 & 3 \\
\hline $20-30$ & 25 & 2 \\
\hline $30-40$ & 35 & 3 \\
\hline $40-50$ & 45 & 5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Figure 2: Frequency polygon constructed from data in table 2

\subsection*{7.2.3.2 Bar charts}
* Bar charts are preferred when data is discrete or categorized or when the scale is nominal.
* This is because the categories in a nominal scale do not imply any order
* Bar chart is very similar to the histogram except that spaces are left between the bars to signify a lack of continuity or flow between the categories

\section*{Example}

Table 3: Department enrolment
\begin{tabular}{lcc} 
Subject category & frequency(f) & \%frequency \\
Biology & 5 & 10 \\
Maths & 20 & 40 \\
Geography & 20 & 40 \\
History & 5 & 10 \\
& & $\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{5 0}$
\end{tabular}

Fig.3: Bar chart based on data presented in table 9

\subsection*{7.2.3.4 Choosing a graph}
* For discrete variables a bar chart is better
* Frequency polygons have an advantage that several polygons can be superimposed with less crossing of lines
* This allows for comparisons among various distributions
* Histograms are easier to understand especially when only one distribution is being represented
* However, histograms give the impression that subjects fitting within each interval are evenly distributed over the interval which is not always the case

\subsection*{7.2.3.5 Percentages}
* A percentage is defined as the proportion of a subgroup to the total group or sample and range from 0\% to 100\%
* The size of the total group on which percentages is useful or valid should be big. A minimum number should be at least 20

\section*{UNIT FOUR: ETHICAL ISSUES IN RESEARCH}
$\checkmark$ Issues of ethical behavior are central to health professions
$\checkmark$ In conducting clinical trials and research projects, ethical issues should be taken into consideration
$\checkmark$ It is unethical for an investigator not to give patients the best possible treatment
$\checkmark$ Other way, it is unethical not to discover whether a new treatment is an improvement, since this would deny future patients the possibility of a cure.
$\checkmark$ It is also unethical to perform bad trials that give misleading results and there by encourage others not to use a treatment that is beneficial or to use a treatment that is not beneficial, or may indeed have harmful effects
$\checkmark$ Two important areas of ethical consideration are
rights of human subjects and
$>$ freedom from harm
$\checkmark$ Three factors are important regarding the rights of the participants
$>$ Confidentiality
$>$ Anonymity
> Voluntary participation
$\checkmark$ It can be ensured through an informed consent which clearly explains the study objectives and states participation right to accept or refuse to participate

\subsection*{2.6.1 Research participants at Risk}
$\checkmark$ Research participants at risk are individuals who may be harmed physically emotionally, spiritually, socially or legally through participation in a research study
$\checkmark$ A basic responsibility of the researcher and those assisting in carrying out the project, is to protect all research participants from harm and
while they are participating in an investigation or as a result of the study.

\subsection*{2.6.2 Informed consent}
$\checkmark$ Informed consent is the process of providing an individual with sufficient understandable information regarding his or her participation in a research project
$\checkmark$ It includes providing potential participants with information about their rights and responsibilities within the project and documenting the nature of the agreement
$\checkmark$ All consent forms need to assure potential participants of their right to withdraw from a research study at any time. Informed consent is the researchers conscious and deliberate attempt to clearly and fully provide the potential participant with information about the study
$\checkmark$ It is a fundamental responsibility of the investigator in human research to ensure research participants understand the nature of the project and the implications of participation and the individual is able to decide freely whether to participate in a project, without fear of reprisal. When the researcher fails to adequately inform potential research participants about full nature of the research, thereby preventing them from making an informed decision on their participation is called deception

\subsection*{2.6.3 Confidentiality and Anonymity}
$\checkmark$ The researcher's responsibility to protect all data gathered within the scope of the project from being divulged to others-confidentiality
$\checkmark$ Anonymity Refers to the act of keeping individuals nameless in relation to their participation in a research project

\subsection*{2.6.4 Regulatory Bodies}
$\checkmark$ The researcher may need to take permission from regulatory bodies for conducting research investigations, mainly when subjects are human beings
$\checkmark$ These are regulatory bodies in most of the countries which grant permission after considering ethical issues of study
$\checkmark$ National council for science and technology deals with approval and authorization of research being done in Kenya.

\subsection*{2.6.5 Misuse of privileges}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
$\checkmark$ Researchers have power over their subjects to their training, legal authority to undertake research, and their perceived ability to provide help. Subjects therefore participate in research based on this trust.
$\checkmark$ It is therefore unethical for researchers to abuse this trust by using their powers negatively e.g
$>$ Using obtained data to stigmatize or indict the same subjects
$>$ Doing research in pretext of providing help

\subsection*{2.6.6 Use of vulnerable and /special groups}
$\checkmark$ Consent should be obtained in case of disadvantaged from their guardians
$\checkmark$ These groups include:
> Mentally challenged sick people, children
$>$ Prisoners, street children e.t.c.

\subsection*{2.6.7 Financial issues and sponsored research}
$\checkmark$ A sponsor may demand compromise on quality to save on costs and time
$\checkmark$ Some sponsors may demand the findings to be reported in a distorted manner for their own selfish reasons
$\checkmark$ Some researchers may divert research funds for their own use
$\checkmark$ All these are unacceptable. A researcher should maintain his/her integrity

\subsection*{2.6.8 Dissemination of Findings}
$\checkmark$ It is unethical to conceal research findings for some reasons. Even if results are contrary or against the sponsor's wishes or expectations, they should be disseminated and not concealed.

\subsection*{2.6.9 Intellectual property Rights}
$\checkmark$ Joint researchers should not be published as personal by one individual.

\subsection*{2.6.10 Plagiarism and Fraud}

\section*{Plagiarism;}
$\checkmark$ Is a situation where a researcher refers to another persons work as his/her without acknowledging the author this is punishable by law

\section*{Fraud:}
$\checkmark$ Is where a researcher takes data that has not actually been collected and also false presentation of research methodology and results.
$\checkmark$ This is also punishable in law

UNIT FIVE: RESEARCH FINDINGS, DISSEMINATION AND REPORT WRITING

\subsection*{8.0 COMMUNICATING THE RESEARCH FINDINGS}
* The significance of conducting research is to communicate and share the research findings.
* There are several ways of communicating research findings.
* These are:-
i. A written report for academic purposes e.g. thesis or desertion which are requirements for obtaining a certain academic level
ii. A written report prepared for some managers and policy implementers-present a clear and detailed report with no academic jargons
iii. A written report sent as an article for publication in referred/non-referred journals
iv. Presentation of the research findings in workshops, seminars and conferences

\subsection*{8.1 PRESENTING RESEARCH RESULTS AT PROFESSIONAL CONFERENCES}
* Because publication in journals which is referred takes long (up to 3 years), presentation of research findings is more rapid in distribution of study results
* Presentation should be in community health conferences as well as interdisciplinary conferences
* Research results can be presented at professional conferences in two ways
a) Oral presentation
b) Poster presentation- has become more popular
* Potential participants are contacted through "call for abstracts"
* The call for abstracts is a request for a summary for a study that the researcher wishes to present at a conference
* These requests are published in professional journals and distributed to educational institutions, health care agencies and potential participants from professional organizations notices of research
* Conferences are generally distributed 6-12 months before the event.
* Each conference or seminar provide guidelines for presenters and for submission of abstracts
* Abstract length varies from 50-1000 words, but many have 200-300 word limitations
* It contains the purpose, research question(s), hypothesis, design, methodology, major findings and conclusions
* Generally, those selected to participate receive no pay and are required to cover their own travel expenses
* In some cases conference registration fee is waived or reduced for participants

\subsection*{8.2 PRESENTING A RESEARCH PAPER}
* An oral presentation of a research report is usually referred to as paper presentation. Paper because it has been written on paper and is read by the investigator.
* If principal investigator is unable to attend the conference, a coinvestigator or another person familiar with the study presents the paper.
* Presenting research results at a conference has advantages
i. The researcher presents findings that are current/recent unlike publication that lags behind for up to 3 years
ii. The researcher has an opportunity to interact with those people who are interested in the study and will be able to locate other researchers who are studying the same or similar phenomena
* The presenter is usually given 10-15 minutes. Sometimes additional time is allocated for questions or during break, other questions are dealt with.
* Format for oral presentation is the same as that of the journal but condensation of material is done to fit the time given.

\subsection*{12.0 WRITING RESEARCH REPORTS}

* The list should clearly give the number and title of the figure and its number

\subsection*{12.7 List of abbreviations and acronyms}
* These abbreviations are used especially where a ward or a group of words is used repeatedly
* The abbreviations and acronyms should be listed and explained in full
* They should be used only when necessary
* Refer on guidelines on use of abbreviations

\subsection*{12.8 Executive summary(Advisable to include)}
* Is short version or a summary of the research report provides a picture of the entire document
* A good executive summary begins with a clear and brief statement of the problem
* Details from the body of the report are then presented in brief and the summary ends with conclusions and recommendations
* Use of bulletins and bolded subheading helps to make summary reader-friendly
* Avoid technical terms in the executive summary

\subsection*{12.9 Introduction}
* This has several components that include:
- The background of the study
- The problem statement
- Objectives
- Hypotheses
- Research questions
- Limitations of the study

\subsection*{12.10 Literature Review}
* This provides the needed support to the researcher rationale for undertaking research in a certain area
* The critique of findings from other studies done in related areas
* Literature review assists the researcher in making a strong care for the study's objectives, research questions or hypotheses
* Literature review should be relevant to the topic

\subsection*{12.11 Methodology}
* It gives regarding the procedures used in conducting the study.
* Issues discussed under methodology include the population, sample, sampling techniques, the research design, instruments or tools used in data collection, measurement of variables and techniques to be used in such tests
* Give enough details regarding the procedures used in conducting the study should be precise enough to enable other researchers to replicate your study

\subsection*{12.12 Results and Discussion}
* Main purpose of the results and discussion is to present the results of the data analysis in a systematic way

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
* The data analysis is done figures and tables are usually used
* Computers and statistical packages has made data analysis easier and faster
* In this section, it is advisable to start with a short introduction that describes the general procedure followed in analyzing the data
* State the objectives or hypothesis of the study
* Key pointers on writing the results and discussion are
$\checkmark$ Present descriptive results of analysis first. They include frequencies, percentages, means, modes, median, and standard deviation e.t.c.
$\checkmark$ Then present the results of hypotheses tests if any. These tests inform whether results can be generalized to the target population
$\checkmark$ It may not be possible to present every result of the analysis. Select the most important findings for reporting. Be guided by objectives and hypotheses
$\checkmark$ Not every result or table generated is presented in the report objectives and hypotheses of the study should guide you to select the most important ones
$\checkmark$ Graphs, charts and other usual presentations of the data should be included in the results and discussion section of the report if they add value to the content
$\checkmark$ It is very important for the researcher to point out whether findings are supported by other studies discussed in the literature review section. If findings contradict other studies, point out giving possible reasons for such outcome
* The discussion section therefore conveys the meaning of the findings to the reader and provides an important linkage to other sections or components of the report such as objectives, hypotheses, research questions or theoretical/framework and existing literature

\subsection*{12.13 Summary, conclusions and recommendations}
* Summary reminds and informs the reader about the purpose of study, process used to collect and analyze data and the major findings of the study
* A summary must reflect as accurately as possible the body of ones report.
* Conclusion answers the questions that sparked the collection and analysis of data
* In including the report, it is necessary to discuss the practical application and implications of the findings....
* Implications are usually targeted to stakeholders e.g. health policy makers
* The summary and conclusions should lead logically to your recommendations must be consistent with the purpose of the study, its objectives, the evidence presented by the data and interpretations given
* Recommendations should be practical and achievable
* Common recommendations that researchers often make include;
$\checkmark \quad$ Areas of further research, with the question in that study that remain unanswered, hence ought to be explored further
$\checkmark \quad$ Methodology issues, that could be addressed and refined to improve future research in that area of the study
$\checkmark \quad$ Actions that should be taken to address the problem based on the research findings e.g. interventions/projects

\subsection*{12.14 References}
* The researcher should give credit to authors of any work or materials quoted from or rejected to by listing them
* Generally, a reference gives the name of the author, year of publication of the document, the title of the book or journal paper and the publisher

\subsection*{12.15 Acknowledgement}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
* Research process takes a lot of time, money and energy. A researcher may seek help from professional colleagues, respondents, research assistants etc.
* One can also seek materials from institutions or organizations
* The researcher should acknowledge individuals and organizations that provide assistance
* But because they can be many, the researcher should maintain only a few by names to keep the acknowledgement section as short as possible.

\subsection*{12.16 Appendices}
* The appendix section of the report contains information that the researcher does not seem necessary to include in the body of the report
* The appendix contents include:-
$\checkmark$ Instruments of data collection
